[0.00 → 6.82] How you all doing everybody? Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show. We've got a fantastic
[6.82 → 10.58] show lined up for you guys today. See, I told you guys I was going to do it. Yep.
[10.90 → 16.04] Lots of great topics. More trouble for Intel Arc as board partners reportedly
[16.04 → 21.68] bail on the project. That's a little awkward. In other news,
[21.68 → 32.60] Amazon apparently wants to buy iRobot for $1.7 billion. Not the movie. We're talking about
[32.60 → 37.00] robot vacuum cleaners. They needed some inspiration. They wanted to buy the movie.
[37.08 → 41.16] I actually have a lot to say about Amazon buying iRobot. What else we got?
[41.90 → 46.94] We have NCX Tales from Behind the Counter, which I'm going to throw one in for,
[46.94 → 50.82] which is not from when I worked at NCX, but I'm going to throw a behind-the-counter
[50.82 → 58.86] tale into the pile. Oh, okay. I'm going to put this in. Luke's cryptic story that Linus doesn't know.
[58.94 → 65.84] I think. I might have told you at some point. We've had a lot of conversations. Also, other stuff.
[67.38 → 74.76] Europe is mad at me. Yeah. We'll talk about why. Yeah. What's up, Europe? How are you doing?
[74.76 → 80.92] It's going to be a good show.
[80.92 → 101.62] The video is brought to you. The show is brought to you by Short form. I think that was Squarespace.
[101.88 → 107.96] It went by pretty quick. And MSI. All right. Why don't we jump right into our first topic for the
[107.96 → 115.16] day? More trouble for Intel Arc. It feels like just a few short weeks ago that we had representatives
[115.16 → 119.68] from Intel here on the show telling us that things are going swimmingly for Arc, and we should be
[119.68 → 126.32] expecting a launch imminently. Wait, that is exactly what happened. Yeah. That exact thing I just said.
[126.58 → 129.66] That was literally a few short weeks ago. That wasn't a fever dream, right? Nope.
[129.66 → 136.28] Like that was a thing. Yeah. Okay, cool. Well, according to Igor's lab, as if all the other
[136.28 → 141.96] rumours of Intel's GPU misadventures haven't been bad enough for Team Blue, it now seems,
[142.30 → 150.70] according to rumours allegedly, that third parties are abandoning Arc. Igor says there are lots of
[150.70 → 158.52] unsold but already produced graphics cards sitting in inventory, likely thanks to the fall of
[158.52 → 164.22] cryptocurrency values and the scramble to keep production high to meet that prior demand.
[165.34 → 173.82] Whew! That is a bad time. Yeah. Anthony writes, which as Linus should know, is a pretty bad time when
[173.82 → 180.40] it comes to tying up your capital. As a result, Intel has been focusing first on OEM partners, but they face
[180.40 → 185.58] a chicken and egg scenario. In order for system integrators and OEM customers to place orders,
[185.58 → 192.52] there must first be a demand for the products to begin with. But since Arc is an unknown quantity,
[192.62 → 199.12] I mean, all we've seen is the small demos that Intel has done. Since it's unproven, there is apparently
[199.12 → 205.26] little to no interest from prominent European distributors and dealers. And this was the case
[205.26 → 212.44] long before A380 benchmarks reared their ugly head. There's another angle.
[212.44 → 218.32] There was still a weird way to launch it, considering it's basically always been Halo product and then
[218.32 → 220.78] dropping from there. And they did like the opposite.
[221.34 → 226.18] AMD pulled it the other way once when they launched, I think it was Polaris, I want to say.
[226.18 → 233.08] Okay. Mind you, I don't think they had a high-end product for that generation at all. So maybe they
[233.08 → 237.92] were just pitching it as, no, no, they launched, because they did 474. No, they launched the whole
[237.92 → 242.38] stack. They just didn't have a high-end product. I remember now. Nope, nope, never mind. Yep, you're
[242.38 → 247.42] right. Yeah, it's weird. So I think that set people off on a weird foot as well. You generally try to put
[247.42 → 252.78] your best foot forward when it comes to launching a generation of products. Now, there's another angle
[252.78 → 260.34] here. Intel allegedly didn't want to give price guarantees, and the conditions around RMA return
[260.34 → 264.66] were worse than their competitors, which is a tough pill to swallow for system integrators
[264.66 → 270.98] whose margins, at least on desktop computers, are often low. You know what I want to know? I want to
[270.98 → 277.96] know where these RMA conditions for returns are coming from, because back at NCI, we couldn't
[277.96 → 285.50] return jackass. When we bought something, it was ours. How did we get hosed so hard? Is it
[285.50 → 291.08] because we were Canadian? That sucks. That's a pretty good joke, though. Okay, to be clear,
[291.16 → 295.98] we did occasionally get stock rotation and price protection, but once you committed to having
[295.98 → 302.46] something, you pretty much had it. If I was Intel, though, I would recognize that I'm going
[302.46 → 308.28] to have to offer price protection of some sort for these Arc GPUs, because if I was a reseller,
[308.38 → 312.98] I mean, I remember going through this back when we did the original WAN hoodie, and our strategy
[312.98 → 319.58] for international sales was working through resellers. And we basically had to bend over
[319.58 → 324.26] in order to get the thing in stock in the store, because they were sitting there going, well, if we
[324.26 → 328.68] don't sell it, then we want this to be entirely your problem. We want you to cover shipping back to you,
[328.68 → 336.30] take back the entire thing for the entire value. And because we were just small and had absolutely
[336.30 → 340.28] no leverage whatsoever, we pretty much had to take whatever offer was given to us. So
[340.28 → 347.74] hilariously, we had, I think, three partners, I want to say. It was either two or three. I can't
[347.74 → 352.68] remember. I think we had three partners, though, and the only one that didn't manage to sell through
[352.68 → 357.68] and that we did end up taking inventory back from was NCI. Yeah, I know, right?
[360.06 → 363.74] They weren't even the ones that gave me a really hard time about terms. I just told them, like,
[363.78 → 367.60] just look, look, just don't worry, we'll get it taken care of. And then they just like didn't sell
[367.60 → 372.50] it. They, I mean, that's NCI, right? And just, yeah, if your product sells itself, then great,
[372.58 → 376.42] you'll be fine. And if it doesn't, if they have to actually do any work, then it could be a
[376.42 → 378.64] challenge. Their site was so bad, man.
[378.64 → 384.50] It was atrocious. Yeah. Anyway, without interest from commercial customers, then board partners
[384.50 → 389.42] are kind of left out in the cold. I mean, man, if you guys have been following along with the
[389.42 → 394.42] screwdriver and the backpack saga, I mean, these are relatively uncomplicated products compared to,
[394.82 → 400.60] well, first, you've got this, this, this highly complex integrated circuit, right? You've got,
[400.76 → 407.56] you've got this ASIC, right? Then you've got the highly complex board designs, the development that
[407.56 → 412.26] goes on around those, the mass production that has to happen in order to reach the kind of scale
[412.26 → 417.48] that it even makes any sense economically to produce these things. Then there's the distribution.
[417.66 → 422.76] You've got to kind of, you've got to kind of bet, move all your pieces into play globally. You've
[422.76 → 426.80] got to bet on where people are going to buy these things and which ones they're going to buy and what
[426.80 → 431.62] volumes. Like it's so, it's so complicated. And all of this has to take place in the
[431.62 → 438.14] in the years and then months and then weeks leading up to actually pressing go, this is available.
[438.58 → 442.92] And it's all got to be basically perfect, or you end up looking like an amateur, right? Because you're
[442.92 → 448.68] going up against AMD and NVIDIA who've been doing this for decades. So without interest from commercial
[448.68 → 454.38] customers, board partners are left out in the cold and one has allegedly halted production altogether.
[454.38 → 462.28] And this is due to quality concerns. Whether these rumours are true or not, they are emblematic of the
[462.28 → 469.60] challenges faced by anyone attempting to enter the GPU market in this day and age. Without a clear value
[469.60 → 474.74] proposition or brand recognition, SI's are going to have a tough time accepting it. Without SI's accepting
[474.74 → 479.48] it, board partners are less likely to hop on board and without performance leadership or aggressive
[479.48 → 485.22] back-end agreements on pricing, especially price protection. Um, not to mention RMA support,
[485.52 → 492.26] neither situation is likely to change. So the cycle continues until either Intel blinks or the
[492.26 → 498.06] proverbial plug gets pulled. Now we do have some discussion questions here, and I don't like this
[498.06 → 505.64] first one. Is ARC going to be another Barrable? I don't, I don't think that's a realistic outcome at this
[505.64 → 512.50] point. Like I, I think, I do think Intel is a smart enough company to not go completely sunk cost
[512.50 → 518.38] fallacy. Well, we've already put billions in what's another few billion, but it is very clear from a
[518.38 → 527.96] strategic standpoint that having a GPU play is what the A players do today. You must have, in addition to
[527.96 → 536.00] your x86 compute product, you must have a GPU compute product. And it's also clear from AMD and NVIDIA
[536.00 → 543.52] strategy that in order to hit the kind of volumes that you need, you want a consumer product. You
[543.52 → 549.70] don't just want it to be a data centre compute product, which is ultimately where Barrable ended
[549.70 → 558.18] up if I recall correctly. Yeah. So I don't see it happening. I think Intel has to go down this path, even if
[558.18 → 565.38] it's like beating their heads, gang, wall in order to get there, even if it takes another three years.
[566.86 → 572.34] I think it's, I think it sucks. I don't remember the exact problem. There was, there was some type of problem,
[572.34 → 577.12] which is causing a lot of these performance issues. We talked about it last week. I don't remember exactly what it was,
[577.12 → 581.72] but I think that's like really unfortunate, especially considering that you would kind of
[581.72 → 585.06] hope that with the pedigree that they brought on board, that they would, they would have been able
[585.06 → 589.82] to avoid something like that, but it is extremely technical concepts, and it's not like they can
[589.82 → 595.44] exactly just copy and paste what these guys have done in the past. Yeah. I don't think if Raja Kauri like
[595.44 → 603.34] just recreated. Yeah, that would be a big problem. So you can't exactly do that. So you're going to run
[603.34 → 608.14] into some issues. It's unfortunate, but I do agree with, with Linus. I think they're going to try to
[608.14 → 613.46] make it work. Um, I hope, I hope they're going to try to make it work. I hope you're right. Yeah.
[613.86 → 620.78] I don't know. We'll see. Um, there's another discussion question here, courtesy of Anthony.
[620.90 → 626.86] Gamers probably share the concerns around pricing, RMA and driver support that system integrators do.
[627.08 → 631.96] How will this impact the role of early adopters? I think early adopters are absolutely critical to
[631.96 → 635.84] arc. And, you know, from talking to shroud and tap about it, they seem to understand that they're
[635.84 → 641.66] going to have to be priced very aggressively to drive some of that early adoption. But if they
[641.66 → 647.14] don't have the buy-in from upper management, if they don't have, you know, tens, hundreds of millions,
[647.96 → 655.86] a billion bucks to just kind of get some art GP freaking use out there into users hands.
[656.04 → 661.06] Do they even really want to, if it has a lot of issues with this generation? I think they produce
[661.06 → 667.88] them allegedly. Yeah. Supposedly they just have wafers upon wafers of our GPUs.
[667.88 → 670.06] Then they're going to have to make them incredibly cheap if there are problems.
[670.06 → 674.62] Yeah. You don't just grind them up and make new GPUs. Although.
[676.72 → 679.80] The biggest recycling effort ever. Yeah, exactly.
[679.96 → 682.98] Don't bury it in the desert like, uh, the ET video game. Yeah, exactly.
[682.98 → 691.22] Grind them up and make new ones. Um, yeah, I, we'll see. I, there was a comment earlier,
[691.22 → 695.98] but like no brand recognition. I don't think that's fair at all. Um, because it's going to
[695.98 → 699.64] have Intel on it and people that are building computers know who Intel is.
[699.64 → 707.58] And Intel's onboard graphics, to their credit, have gotten a lot better in the last five years.
[707.58 → 713.14] I mean, I continually, they've gotten continuously better ever since they introduced them back.
[713.84 → 715.84] Uh, well, I shouldn't say introduced them, but.
[716.18 → 722.28] Okay. Sorry. Jaden just said something in full plane chat. If they allow GPU, they'll move them.
[722.62 → 724.34] Yep. There's, there's absolutely.
[724.60 → 725.20] Like a hundred percent.
[725.32 → 730.78] Strategic levers they can pull. And EPOS Vox did a video recently talking about their AV1 encoder.
[731.02 → 734.70] I haven't watched the video yet. I do need to watch it, but I did at least make it to the headline.
[734.70 → 742.48] Apparently it's outstanding. Like it is, it is a better video encoder. So as long as OBS gets
[742.48 → 748.68] support for Intel's AV1 encoder, I could see a bunch of streamers just throwing it in, in addition
[748.68 → 751.62] to their NVIDIA GPU, just so that they have AV1 encoding.
[751.84 → 755.50] That would actually be pretty cool. Cause then you can lift a lot of the it hasn't really been
[755.50 → 762.74] worth it to have like a dedicated and vent card, but I mean, it could be if it's like actually really
[762.74 → 766.66] killer. Yeah. If it's legitimately better. I mean, remember too, we're talking about people
[766.66 → 771.40] that will build an entire separate machine so that they can use CPU encoding for the best
[771.40 → 777.56] possible quality. If AV1 meant you just don't have to do that. Although there are other reasons to
[777.56 → 781.28] use a separate machine. Like if your game crashes, it means your stream doesn't crash, et cetera,
[781.34 → 787.50] et cetera. But if money is no object, or if maybe it's the money is a partial object at that tier,
[787.50 → 793.82] if just adding one of these arc cards for, you know, 130, 140 bucks, getting that AV1 encoding
[793.82 → 798.70] means that your stream will just immediately look sharper, look better. I could absolutely see
[798.70 → 804.18] people doing that. Yeah. If they do, if that's genuinely perfect, and they have GPU support,
[804.28 → 808.60] they'll move them a hundred percent. They'll move them. I, there's a comment from, from Anthony saying,
[808.60 → 814.26] uh, regarding brand recognition, it's more about the Intel HD graphics being poor performers and people
[814.26 → 819.64] generally seeing Intel graphics as low and bare bones. That's fair. But I do also think that Intel
[819.64 → 826.82] is like a household name that people trust. Um, and like, maybe if you're, if you're very technical
[826.82 → 831.00] and you've like messed around with the Intel HD graphics, a bunch of stuff like that, um, then
[831.00 → 835.40] you have that opinion. But if you're just someone who like, you'd like building your own computers,
[835.40 → 841.18] you build one every like three, four years, and you've had Intel chips since you were fairly young.
[841.18 → 846.52] Like, I think it's going to hit for those people. Um, and then on the other end, like we've just
[846.52 → 851.72] been saying now, there might be specific scenarios where with the highly technical people, it just,
[851.84 → 857.66] it slays. And like, I don't know, I, we tried to tell them here, I'm going to try to tell them
[857.66 → 863.18] again, you'll solve, I, in my opinion, they'll solve your problems. If you enable GPU, one of the
[863.18 → 868.50] issues with that it is going to be hard to take it back with battle mage or whatever the ones are
[868.50 → 878.34] really hard. Oh, yeah. So, you know, I think you shouldn't, to be fair. I think you should just
[878.34 → 883.58] send it out there and just leave it out there and just, um, you know, drop it on the table.
[883.80 → 889.02] Be like, Hey, we're actually doing it. We might have cards that have issues, but we have this
[889.02 → 893.76] enabled. People are going to buy it. And if the competition doesn't answer to this, we'll just
[893.76 → 899.86] take our piece of the pie and run with it. But I don't know. All right. Let's jump into a couple
[899.86 → 906.42] of merch messages very, very early on because naturally the big news for us this week was we
[906.42 → 916.30] finally, finally launched the LTT backpack. Thank you. Massive shout out to everyone who ordered one.
[916.44 → 922.18] It's hilarious. Everyone who watched the video internally is like, Hey, when are the, uh,
[922.18 → 927.54] when are the staff ones going out? And I was like, Oh, not soon. Okay. They're going to pay
[927.54 → 931.30] customers first guys. There was people from float plane that asked if we're getting like
[931.30 → 935.52] backpacks and screwdrivers. And I was like, I seriously doubt it. Because I did the math and it
[935.52 → 943.32] was like, and then you sent that message, and I was like, Oh, okay. Yeah. I guess so. We're going to,
[943.40 → 946.66] we're going to do it, but it's going to, it's going to take some time. It's going to take some time.
[946.74 → 950.96] We got a stock needs to stabilize stuff like that. Anyway, we can do a couple of merch messages. Now,
[950.96 → 954.92] if you guys want to send in a merch message, anytime we're alive, when you're checking out
[954.92 → 959.82] on LTT store.com, you can check that you want to send a merch message, enter your merch message.
[959.88 → 965.98] It'll either pop up down here. It's our replacement for like super chats or, or bits on Twitch or
[965.98 → 970.84] anything like that. Because this way, instead of just throwing money into a void, you can throw it
[970.84 → 977.34] into a void and the void will spit out a high quality t-shirt or backpack or, or hoodie or whatever
[977.34 → 982.78] else it is that you happen to need. And it'll arrive at your door eventually, depending on,
[982.90 → 985.12] depending on where you are. All right, hit me bell.
[985.90 → 990.86] From Jack, been following the backpack for a while and loved the unboxing on short circuit.
[990.98 → 991.50] Hey, thanks.
[991.62 → 995.38] With the thought of other LTT products working with the backpack, do you expect to release products
[995.38 → 1000.64] that directly work with a backpack, such as hooks or lockers or carabiners, or we had people ask
[1000.64 → 1008.64] rain covers? Okay. So I've, uh, I've seen quite a few requests for a rain cover. If we can find
[1008.64 → 1014.26] something that folds up compactly enough that it could fit in the hidden passport pocket, I would
[1014.26 → 1018.06] love to have a rain cover that kind of sits in there, and then you can pull it out in an emergency.
[1018.28 → 1022.06] So you, so you swap the luggage strap for that is basically what you're saying?
[1022.72 → 1025.80] Yeah, exactly. There wouldn't be a place for your luggage strap at that point, but like
[1025.80 → 1032.72] just store it somewhere. It can't hold everything. Yeah. Um, I'd absolutely love to do a rain cover.
[1033.00 → 1039.20] We are already working on some attachments for the front, but the front, I think I just saw a
[1039.20 → 1043.96] secret thing. Yeah. We are already working on some attachments for the front for things like, uh,
[1044.32 → 1050.96] oh man, Matthew has this adorable little, uh, like wireless headphones' holder that will clip on right
[1050.96 → 1054.16] here. So it'll just sit right here. So you can just tuck your wireless headphones in. It's big enough
[1054.16 → 1060.60] for AirPods pros in a case or like a large bulky one, like the Sennheiser's. And this will probably
[1060.60 → 1065.58] be one of those things where like it fits best on this backpack. Oh, yeah. But it'll work on anything
[1065.58 → 1073.10] that has like a we definitely want to keep our accessories, um, generic in terms of their
[1073.10 → 1079.10] compatibility with other bags. If we can, the last thing you want to do is make something that then
[1079.10 → 1084.54] is married to, I mean, okay. Even if I think these things are going to last you 10 years,
[1084.54 → 1090.84] they're not invincible. So if you'd be able to carry on, you know, some of the accessories to a
[1090.84 → 1096.08] future bag, then great. Like that's even if it's a future bag that we potentially make,
[1096.18 → 1099.62] yeah. Whether it's us or whether it's someone else, like if you find a use for it, that isn't
[1099.62 → 1108.30] even a bag. So that's something we're working on. Uh, another cool one is, uh, this, we recognize
[1108.30 → 1116.46] that not everyone is necessarily going to prefer just that, that, that compartment of holding,
[1116.46 → 1123.54] um, as I, as I like to call it, the, the just uninterrupted, you know, place to stuff everything.
[1123.78 → 1128.32] So this is an accessory that we are currently working on. That's going to be called the tech
[1128.32 → 1134.02] pouch. It's built to the same standard of quality as the backpack, which means, you know, we've got
[1134.02 → 1140.46] entirely unnecessary, like reinforced stitching on the handle on the end. It uses waterproof zippers,
[1140.78 → 1149.96] even though like, come on, get real. This has to be rainproof. Um, but it does anyway. And then
[1149.96 → 1156.98] this is really cool. So it opens up into like an accordion style, uh, thing that is just chock-full
[1156.98 → 1160.22] of Dan, are you trying to do something here? Should I be switching to that camera? Is that,
[1160.56 → 1165.00] should I be switching to the loop cam? Yeah, here you go. So it's got like, you know, a little spot
[1165.00 → 1169.30] for pens. You know, we only have one spot for a pen, like a native spot for a pen in the
[1169.38 → 1174.78] in the backpack as it is. Uh, this is an this is an earlier version. We actually already have a newer
[1174.78 → 1180.94] version than this one that has changed this to either two medium-sized ones or one big and one small.
[1180.94 → 1187.08] I can't remember, but I, I just found this, uh, three by small configuration was not that useful.
[1187.26 → 1190.68] I need to take my, uh, you know what? No, it's fine. I'll just leave that in there for now.
[1190.80 → 1195.32] That is an old school flash drive. Yeah, I know. Right. Uh, there's, these are supposed to be,
[1195.32 → 1200.40] um, uh, knitted. So when they're knitted, these are going to be stretchy and then this is supposed
[1200.40 → 1205.86] to be elastic at the top. So there's like a stretchy thing here. And then you can, uh, also
[1205.86 → 1210.58] undo the zipper here. There's like a zipper thing. Basically you can just kind of like
[1210.58 → 1217.44] cram it with whatever you want. Uh, there's another thing of like, uh, so this would also be,
[1217.52 → 1221.44] I forget one side's going to be stretchy and one side's not because when you fill up the stretchy
[1221.44 → 1226.48] side, we want it to bulge out. And when you fill out the not stretchy side, we want it to bulge in
[1226.48 → 1232.74] so that you can still fit, uh, the spacing of this, uh, elastic here has been changed so that you can
[1232.74 → 1236.66] kind of put tools in it, or you could put like thumb drives in it. You can kind of put whatever
[1236.66 → 1240.64] you want in it. And then it'll also be tighter because right now it's a little loose. So once
[1240.64 → 1245.06] it wears out a bit, it's going to have a hard time holding things in place. But this is basically
[1245.06 → 1251.04] exactly the width of the bottom of the, the, the chamber of holding pouch of holding or whatever.
[1251.50 → 1255.38] And it'll be, it'll just kind of sit there. And then the idea is that because it's made of that
[1255.38 → 1261.64] same sturdy reprieve fabric, you just kind of roll up, put it on your desk,
[1261.64 → 1266.70] and it just stands on its own, and you can get whatever you need, put all your stuff back away,
[1267.20 → 1273.44] whether it's like tools or, you know, USB drives or, or if you testers or whatever it is that you're,
[1273.44 → 1278.62] that you're using, and then you tuck it away. So that's, that's something, that's something.
[1279.02 → 1283.72] Cool. Um, you could also use it for toiletries and stuff like that. Yeah. People have, have clued
[1283.72 → 1289.60] in that. Yeah. It could also be great for travel. So we're working on that. When, when is no idea.
[1289.60 → 1293.40] Okay. Yep. Can't promise anything. I shouldn't even be showing it to you.
[1294.48 → 1300.24] I, I was wondering when you put it over there, I was like, uh, I've never seen this before or heard
[1300.24 → 1308.50] of it. Yeah. It'll absolutely work standalone, but it's kind of made to, to sit in. Well, that's,
[1308.62 → 1313.36] yeah, that's just, that's a good idea to do everything that way. Right. But you could use
[1313.36 → 1316.88] it without it. You don't even have to use that with a bag. Technically, like you said,
[1316.88 → 1322.10] it could just be like a travel thing. Yeah, exactly. Whatever. Have it in the car.
[1322.10 → 1327.50] Question is from Brian. Could the lab possibly do USB hub reviews? Everyone I've purchased has been
[1327.50 → 1334.38] terrible. I think that's a fantastic idea. I don't even know where we'd begin. Furthermore, I mean,
[1334.44 → 1342.18] obviously you'd want to know how, how hot it gets when you're pulling the maximum amount of power that
[1342.18 → 1348.96] it can support. You'd want to know what its internal inefficiencies are. So if you could test
[1348.96 → 1353.84] how much power you could draw with a device that's actually plugged in on the other side of it,
[1354.78 → 1360.72] uh, you'd want to, you'd want to create some kind of like a torture test, right? Where you have,
[1360.84 → 1367.82] you know, data streaming over, like, let's say it was a USB-C hub, right? That has HDMI and, uh,
[1367.82 → 1373.06] also, you know, USB type A's or something. So if you have some kind of data storm going on over
[1373.06 → 1378.40] the USB ports, does the HDMI cut out? You know, I'd want to know things like that. Yeah.
[1378.52 → 1381.22] That is a good question because that's one of those types of things where like,
[1381.42 → 1386.10] if you go on like Amazon or whatever, and you want to buy one, there's just like a billion of them.
[1386.24 → 1390.98] And I just, how are you supposed to know that the brand recognition isn't going to be there.
[1391.30 → 1396.66] It's from like 30,000 brands you've never heard of. Um, yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
[1396.66 → 1399.78] That would be one of the things that I would, I would like there to be some,
[1399.86 → 1404.38] some kind of like answers for. Yeah. If we could find a way I'd, I'd, I'd love to.
[1404.86 → 1410.46] Because it's, man, I get so frustrated. I get so frustrated. I, we went through this with dash
[1410.46 → 1415.18] cams recently. We actually have a video coming where we bought every a hundred dollar and under
[1415.18 → 1421.56] high, like the top, uh, a hundred dollar and under dash cams on Amazon. Because I just,
[1421.56 → 1426.62] I went on the site. I'm like, I don't understand that most of these reviews are obviously
[1426.62 → 1433.34] fake. Um, but they, they all are rated pretty well. And even some of the genuine real users
[1433.34 → 1440.92] seem to say like, it's perfect. So why would, why do $300 dash cams exist if there are $70 dash
[1440.92 → 1447.06] cams? Like it was just, it was overwhelming. Even as a, as a tech-savvy person, it was absolutely
[1447.06 → 1452.52] overwhelming. So I kind of went, well, conveniently I'm in a position where I can commission my own
[1452.52 → 1460.92] independent test. I need a fricking dash cam. Uh, you buy all the dash cams and then let's share
[1460.92 → 1464.84] our findings with the people. So that video is coming pretty soon, but that's actually cool.
[1464.98 → 1469.64] I will, I will genuinely very likely buy one based off that video. That's the type of things that I
[1469.64 → 1476.06] like where like, to be completely honest, uh, they're almost more interesting to me than computer
[1476.06 → 1480.58] stuff reviews. Cause at this point I can often like sums out what I need to know about computer
[1480.58 → 1484.32] hardware. But when it goes into something like dash cams, like USB hubs, stuff like that,
[1484.34 → 1488.36] and we're just like, I don't know. Even something like a thumb drive. Yeah. Okay. I still need a
[1488.36 → 1492.04] thumb drive for whatever reason. I got to carry around a lot of ISOs. Who knows?
[1492.04 → 1497.68] They're useful. Whatever. Uh, how do you know if it's good? Which one? Which one's good? Yeah.
[1498.34 → 1503.30] Cables. Cables are going to be huge. That's, that's going to be the main like tertiary product
[1503.30 → 1508.26] thing. That's, I'm, I'm very excited about, about the cables. Oh, the ones that we're planning
[1508.26 → 1512.64] to make or the testing, the testing mostly to be completely honest. Yep. But then I'm hoping
[1512.64 → 1516.10] that the ones that we make are like some of the best ones that come through testing. Right. So
[1516.10 → 1521.28] I should hope so. If they're not, then we suck, and we need to start over. Yeah. See, this is,
[1521.52 → 1526.66] this is hilarious. Uh, Scale over in Twitch chat says Garmin makes decent dash cams. No,
[1526.74 → 1531.94] they don't. I see. I would have thought that too. Garmin's like a brand name, right? Like they're,
[1532.00 → 1535.08] they're a trusted name. They made like GPSs or whatever. That is a direction that I would
[1535.08 → 1540.80] likely go in. Exactly. And instead, no, it turned out it just costs another 10, $20 and
[1540.80 → 1547.14] was not better at all. Alrighty then. Great. Now I know, but I didn't. And it's so hard to
[1547.14 → 1554.76] tell because your intuition might tell you this, but then when you go empirically test it and
[1554.76 → 1559.24] you go, Oh yeah, I can't see jack at night. Oh, great. Well, it's good to, it's perfect
[1559.24 → 1564.04] to know. Yeah. No, for sure. Oh, well really? Everyone's using, everyone's using one of the
[1564.04 → 1570.56] same two Chinese chipsets. Oh, all right then. That's interesting. That's very interesting.
[1570.74 → 1573.18] That's not something that you're going to be able to easily figure out in any other way.
[1573.66 → 1578.88] No, no, not at all. You're going to, you're going to tear down some, uh, some fanboy fences
[1578.88 → 1583.04] with that one. I think there's already people charming and like, ah, the anchor, the Garmin,
[1583.14 → 1587.06] whatever. And it's like, Hmm, we'll see. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see. Cobra.
[1587.06 → 1593.04] Yeah. Related to that. Uh, I asked if there are any plans for the labs to release a spreadsheet
[1593.04 → 1596.94] list or ranking chart for the products you test, whether it's paid or free.
[1600.02 → 1607.70] Uh, yeah, I don't know. We still, I still have to sit down with a lot of people from labs that,
[1607.88 → 1614.70] that have experience at, um, related, um, uh, websites, uh, and, and figure out exactly what
[1614.70 → 1620.00] we're going to do because we've been waiting to get development on staff, but, um, there was
[1620.00 → 1626.98] paperwork signed. Really? Okay. Um, done deal. Love to hear it. So very soon it'll technically be
[1626.98 → 1631.52] before that person actually starts, but I want to get these meetings started anyway, and he's
[1631.52 → 1636.34] volunteered. So we're going to have a call just to go over some of the road mapping stuff before he
[1636.34 → 1641.74] actually starts so that we can start doing design so that we can start hitting it hard right when he's
[1641.74 → 1646.54] actually full, full-time. Can I tell you something wild? Sorry. Hold, hold that thought. I want to
[1646.54 → 1654.26] hear the rest of that, that what you're about to say thing. You manage a larger team now than I did
[1654.26 → 1663.86] when we moved into this building. Nice. And there's a lot more coming. By the way, if you just heard
[1663.86 → 1669.70] that backpacks, yeah, fair. Uh, if you just heard that back, that, uh, that contract thing, you're like,
[1669.70 → 1673.76] what? I didn't get it. I'm still, I'm still working on it. Furthermore, I need a few of you guys, not just one.
[1675.26 → 1675.58] So.
[1678.58 → 1684.58] Yeah. In summary. Yes. Our intention in the longer, I mean, screw it. Should I just,
[1684.66 → 1691.58] should I just bring up the doc? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1691.58 → 1698.50] no. I'm serious. Do not. There are things on there. We're not showing. No.
[1700.58 → 1706.38] I'm getting it. No, I'm serious. I'm getting a maybe vibe. I will switch off. Furthermore, I will switch
[1706.38 → 1711.38] the camera off his screen. I'm getting a maybe vibe. Furthermore, I'm getting a maybe vibe. No. What do you,
[1711.46 → 1718.54] what do you think? Okay. Can I at least, can I at least talk about MVP? Yes. Okay. I'll tell you
[1718.54 → 1723.06] what why don't you talk about MVP okay, okay I thought you were going to say why don't I just show
[1723.06 → 1731.24] that part of this yeah why don't I just show that no the MVP the chat screaming do it oh my goodness
[1731.24 → 1734.38] is someone calling me to prevent this line is speaking
[1734.38 → 1745.46] I don't know what this is nope definitely spam that's a hilarious spam call
[1745.46 → 1754.38] it started with to we're all out of vaccines and then I hung up because it was obviously very stupid
[1754.38 → 1766.36] um I was going to say MVP is is is minimal minimally viable product uh sure yeah um it's its not
[1766.36 → 1772.68] technically 100 locked down the general features are which is what's on that sheet but exactly what
[1772.68 → 1777.38] the site will actually look like it's not 100 locked down okay we still have to nail that in
[1777.38 → 1781.80] but it's so you want me to read it or do I need to share this with you or like share it with me okay
[1781.80 → 1789.32] I'm not gonna share with you, it's its mostly i I actually might have to see it yeah you can there
[1789.32 → 1795.34] you go yeah it's essentially like a the MVP to be completely honest is essentially like a really
[1795.34 → 1802.54] fancy blog um because that's I mean that's what it is right you're you're reading, so there will be
[1802.54 → 1807.76] there will be reviews we're going to try to make sure that the search is very strong um the
[1807.76 → 1812.40] the fuzziness of the search is very good um so you can find things that you're looking for that's
[1812.40 → 1818.10] there's all going to be categorized to some degree we want to be able to uh generate and display graphs
[1818.10 → 1823.96] and tables obviously which already sort of works it just needs to work on the website as well we
[1823.96 → 1829.50] can't be painstakingly you know graphing things and making tables by hand like we do on the video
[1829.50 → 1834.96] production side of things and yeah they might not be as pretty, but they need to be fast I'm going to
[1834.96 → 1840.74] be taking in goals and desires from a lot of different people on the technical side of labs so we
[1840.74 → 1845.62] can figure out what they want on the website I can tell you one of the really wild things they want
[1845.62 → 1852.98] um i I had a chat with Gary recently or someone did somehow this floated back to me and
[1852.98 → 1863.56] apparently the target maximum throughput for headphone testing is 50 a month oh yeah so hopefully you guys
[1863.56 → 1870.00] are ready to store a lot of data well that's yeah that's in graphic yeah yeah I just mean like that's
[1870.00 → 1874.24] a freaking lot of headphones yeahs that's fine are there even that many headphones like I think you're
[1874.24 → 1877.62] going to run out of headphones yeah I think we're going to run out of headphones before we run out of
[1877.62 → 1884.52] testing throughput yeah um what was I going to say yeah but so one of my two okay two core concepts that
[1884.52 → 1890.72] I'm going to try to champion one of them is that it needs to not be like overwhelming and intimidating
[1890.72 → 1895.02] when you land on the website yeah um and when you're looking through the website to be honest
[1895.02 → 1902.44] there should be deep hardcore information, but it should feel accessible um it should, you shouldn't hit
[1902.44 → 1906.96] land on the website be like oh my goodness this looks like an UI from the 90s we're going to trick
[1906.96 → 1912.14] you into thinking you can handle this data pretty much yeah but like actually though we want to make
[1912.14 → 1917.02] it is a comfortable experience to dive really deeply into something um to encourage people to actually
[1917.02 → 1922.62] take that extra step so that's one of my things the other one is I want the cms to be really strong
[1922.62 → 1929.80] um the cms is actually extremely important because I don't want someone to have to spend their whole
[1929.80 → 1936.88] freaking day building uh these articles because they because I don't know if we're writing individual
[1936.88 → 1943.92] articles for each one of those 50 headphones that we're testing a month um what's all this no, no
[1943.92 → 1949.42] you're good you're good um, so the cms has to be pretty strong if we're is we're building a little
[1949.42 → 1955.36] thing like a graph or whatever it should be very easy to add that not labour intensive as few clicks as
[1955.36 → 1959.94] possible that type of stuff, so there's going to be a lot of work in that regard we want to have
[1959.94 → 1965.68] product browsing by category by tags by search we want to have pictures and videos embedded we
[1965.68 → 1971.58] obviously want to have affiliate links working because they have to pay for this um it's so expensive
[1971.58 → 1978.60] yeah uh we shot a video this week oh man I'm excited for you guys to see this thing have you seen
[1978.60 → 1985.72] the PSU tester we bought I have heard that it was purchased I have not seen if it's here oh boy it
[1985.72 → 1991.92] arrived on I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday, and we did our unboxing video which is an uncrating
[1991.92 → 2000.06] because it's taller than you are it's an entire 40 u cabinet
[2000.06 → 2014.00] uh-huh full of ac load generation DC load generation oscilloscopes um uh loads themselves so
[2014.00 → 2020.26] you need like the need the power supply, and then you also need the loads uh logging uh like
[2020.26 → 2028.10] monitoring and logging uh hardware it's its it's packed it is stuffed to the gills it's apparently
[2028.10 → 2036.82] a better one than c sonic has yeah, and they're an actual power supply manufacturers yeah like a lot
[2036.82 → 2042.34] of your favourite power supplies are probably once you go down to it c sonic pure asks bigger than the
[2042.34 → 2050.22] one gamer's nexus got yeah definitely it's big we go big, or we go home it's good we had the land when
[2050.22 → 2054.46] we did because you guys are going to fill that space up pretty quick considering the
[2054.46 → 2060.74] anechoic chamber was just like leaning against the wall the whole time I had to point that out to a
[2060.74 → 2064.64] couple people because I guess when it's deconstructed people don't necessarily recognize what it is
[2064.64 → 2070.40] um but yeah that was uh that was pretty that was pretty crazy here I can, I'll show you uh I'll show you
[2070.40 → 2075.14] the company that we got it from there has been a lot of mentions getting electro boom to come
[2075.14 → 2080.86] check out the uh space once it's set up yeah I mean sure I'm down for whatever so yeah it's basically
[2080.86 → 2088.74] like one of these so they're highly configurable kyle actually uh went through a whole did a whole
[2088.74 → 2094.20] bunch of research working with uh c sonic and I believe you know I'm not sure who else he talked
[2094.20 → 2099.46] to so I'm not going to name anyone else but working with c sonic as well as engineers from chroma
[2099.46 → 2107.08] to ensure that we have exactly what we need for the ultimate configuration for testing pc
[2107.08 → 2111.48] power supplies because they make gear for testing all kinds of stuff batteries any kind of power
[2111.48 → 2120.20] system and the only piece that we don't have yet the only piece that was not included in our 133 000 us
[2120.20 → 2129.30] dollars was an oscilloscope so once we get the scope in the front of it, it's that price tag goes
[2129.30 → 2137.44] goes up a little bit of goes up a little bit oh boy uh no we're not going to be blowing any breakers
[2137.44 → 2143.56] the plug on it's like this big it's got its own special plug there's a lot of power in that building
[2143.56 → 2148.36] yeah oh there are tons of power in that building I mean we ran like a 200 plus person land in there
[2148.36 → 2151.54] no problem whatever you know no problem yeah
[2151.54 → 2159.92] well that's crazy yeah I can't wait man we're going to be able to churn through like the capability
[2159.92 → 2168.60] the capabilities of this thing are so cool the ac power source for example you can get it to run
[2168.60 → 2177.08] automated scenarios for things like okay uh what's it like if you're on you know a really crappy
[2177.08 → 2181.16] up setup and someone like flicks on a blender somewhere else in the house
[2181.16 → 2187.86] so you can find out you know hey if i live some if i you know in a developing country
[2187.86 → 2194.00] and my power is really inconsistent there are brownouts frequent brownouts yeah so you can create
[2194.00 → 2199.70] all these test scenarios where it'll, it'll simulate a brown out here and then another brown out there
[2199.70 → 2205.42] and then uh you know uh, uh a really um I'm trying to remember what the problem is certain
[2205.42 → 2211.14] types of motors though when they spin up they can cause problems for other devices that are on the
[2211.16 → 2219.74] same circuit so you can have those spin up um the DC oh man this is super cool so the have a
[2219.74 → 2228.96] have like a DC uh power source and the reason for that is that it allows us to fake our power supply
[2228.96 → 2235.76] accidentally over supplying like overvoting so we can take whatever our power supply is outputting
[2235.76 → 2241.90] and we can actually add a little bit to make sure that overvoltage protection works for example so
[2241.90 → 2246.06] we're going to be able to test uh safety mechanisms and power supplies if there's anything that's not
[2246.06 → 2252.22] safe we can hook it up run through our automated test suite, and it'll tell us that we're going to
[2252.22 → 2258.14] build a chamber for it that will be both uh acoustically isolated and thermally isolated so we'll be able
[2258.14 → 2264.96] to tell you okay under different load scenarios how loud is it going to get uh how hot is it going to
[2264.96 → 2272.00] how efficient is it going to be if it's in a particularly hot environment as the world heats up
[2272.00 → 2279.44] I guess that could become more and more of a concern for people and uh this one's really cool we have
[2279.44 → 2287.88] I think it was I it's either six or seven of the 400 watt loads and the reason that we got so many
[2287.88 → 2294.60] was actually not because we needed that much sustained load but because of the like transient
[2294.60 → 2302.30] performance so by having that many in parallel we are able to simulate the effect of like a RTX 3090
[2302.30 → 2309.94] having a momentary power draw spike yeah now NVIDIA might have kind of screwed us here
[2309.94 → 2315.82] with some even higher power draw GPUs coming oh yeah uh but I mean we won't know that for sure until
[2315.82 → 2320.98] it actually happens so we might actually have to get more of those modules to there was a comment
[2320.98 → 2328.00] for that there's a comment in flow plane chat about hoping that we don't um like squeeze Steve out
[2328.00 → 2333.42] that's squeeze Steve out not going to happen well you need multiple independent sources I was just
[2333.42 → 2340.52] going to say so if is anything uh it should bolster because then people are going to be looking for
[2340.52 → 2346.26] that type of content exactly we're bringing it back yeah bringing it back, and we have dead literally
[2346.26 → 2351.24] always said um that you should look at multiple reviews for products that you're buying so like no
[2351.24 → 2358.66] that's that's not happening not a thing I mean another thing too is that yeah this is pointed out
[2358.66 → 2365.82] by afford over on in the float plane chat is we don't intend to just focus on pc components that too
[2365.82 → 2373.26] I mean one of our first hires has a ton of experience in mobile phone testing uh so that's I mean that's
[2373.26 → 2378.52] not something Steve touches as far as I can tell at all in fact doesn't he still use like a dumb phone
[2378.52 → 2386.00] or something i i I know he last time I talked to him, he used like ancient phone I just don't
[2386.00 → 2390.96] think he cares about it at all so we are absolutely going to be looking at different
[2390.96 → 2397.86] verticals, and we also think that even for the things we both cover there is and yeah a lot of
[2397.86 → 2407.10] situations validity to more than one testing methodology too so you know maybe, maybe one of us uh you know
[2407.10 → 2412.78] tests coolers with an artificial load maybe one of us is all about you know embedding a thermal diode
[2412.78 → 2419.00] in the IHS maybe you know whatever right like and to be clear that's a bad example because
[2419.00 → 2424.46] obviously we would both care about it from both perspectives but I just mean that there is not
[2424.46 → 2432.06] always the one and only single way to test something I mean okay games are a perfect example
[2432.06 → 2438.78] maybe you know we really feel like yeah our audience has moved past 1080p so we're really
[2438.78 → 2444.62] focused on how good cards are for 1440p and up you know that that could be something that could
[2444.62 → 2450.20] realistically happen in the next two to five years or if we start automating the if we start automating
[2450.20 → 2457.20] custom benches instead of uh or custom runs instead of just running the canned benchmarks or something
[2457.20 → 2463.84] like that I don't know more sources is good you should read slash watch both yes
[2463.84 → 2473.22] and we've literally always said that so yeah one note for people who are thinking about the backpack we
[2473.22 → 2480.00] do have a promo on right now for the wan hoodie and backpack so if you get a wan hoodie and a backpack
[2480.00 → 2488.28] at the same time you save 20 and that's only valid until tomorrow evening so no pressure but uh you
[2488.28 → 2488.64] should do it
[2489.28 → 2497.66] question here from Nathan for Luke and Linus what is your favourite piece of freeware or open source
[2497.66 → 2505.20] utility software like nine night or something else favourite piece of freeware I mean we're streaming
[2505.20 → 2510.96] on obs right now I think it sort of has to be obs well I wouldn't say favourite I don't have an
[2510.96 → 2517.50] emotional attachment to obs there's a lot of stuff that's not that perfect imagines it didn't exist
[2517.50 → 2527.08] yes uh I mean i was using I have you know I was using x split before and like it had some
[2527.08 → 2532.26] problems but i actually kind of want to try it again to be perfectly honest with you see where it's
[2532.26 → 2536.64] yeah see where it's at they've sponsored the show a couple of times and it kind of made me think oh
[2536.64 → 2540.94] yeah x split I mean I have a lifetime license for it, I might as well maybe I'll do like a game stream
[2540.94 → 2546.44] at home or something like that fires up x split see how it does play some obsidian when it
[2546.44 → 2551.02] worked well for me, it worked great or divinity sorry yeah like there were things that x split did
[2551.02 → 2558.14] way better for me the game detection was so sick back then yes yeah and obs is still sucks we also had a
[2558.14 → 2563.12] lot of problems we did that was a long time and the wan pc had a lot of gremlins I don't know how
[2563.12 → 2570.82] much of that was x split that's fair enough honestly so man favourite free utilities I mean
[2570.82 → 2577.12] you can't, you can't mention you know your paint. Nets of the world paint on net notepad plus
[2577.12 → 2584.14] plus yeah night winter stat um back putty someone said putty yeah putty seven zips oh there's so
[2584.14 → 2588.56] many good ones VLC you already said notepad plus right yeah okay heck yeah love notepad plus
[2588.56 → 2593.50] plus uh i actually I used to do that thing I think I told you about it way back in the day
[2593.50 → 2598.84] where you can overwrite all the like uh you can essentially like reg edit windows so anytime you
[2598.84 → 2603.16] even try to open notepad it just opens notepad plus that's hilarious I don't remember exactly
[2603.16 → 2607.54] how it works so I might have said something wrong there, but it was actually really nice because
[2607.54 → 2613.54] you should just never use notepad you should use notepad plus I thought about uh resurrecting LSD
[2613.54 → 2619.06] remember oh yeah Luke software discoveries yeah yeah yeah um chocolatey is apparently a
[2619.06 → 2622.76] nine-night alternative that's like way more powerful way more customizable so I thought
[2622.76 → 2629.90] maybe we'd like check that out and then I found something really cool oh no did I misplace the name
[2629.90 → 2633.98] of it chocolatey okay I can't find the name of it right now I have it written down somewhere
[2633.98 → 2641.78] but this is so this blew my mind there's this utility that lets you turn your USB drive bootable
[2641.78 → 2648.68] which I know won't impress you yet but turn your USB drive bootable so that it just loads
[2648.68 → 2655.76] like a list of all the ISOs that you've drag and drop onto that USB that's cool so it's like the
[2655.76 → 2661.10] ultimate utility USB actually I really like just throw your you just literally drag and drop your
[2661.10 → 2666.78] me test ISO your windows install ISO, and then you just plug this thing in, and it just goes which one
[2666.78 → 2673.56] would you like this one that reminds me a lot of like so cool the no it's not Rufus vector that's
[2673.56 → 2680.72] the one geek squad used to have this tool um that was actually perfect um and I don't I don't
[2680.72 → 2685.64] remember the name of it, but this was back in the day when every computer had a CD drive so they were on
[2685.64 → 2694.44] CDs and you could like to burn the like geek squad tool onto these CDs yeah and uh um people used to
[2694.44 → 2699.58] effectively like sell them outside of geek squad because they were so good they were actually
[2699.58 → 2705.74] valuable and like local repair shops would buy the updated versions of these like geek squad CDs
[2705.74 → 2711.06] that were bootable, and they had uh like me tests and like all these other types of things on them
[2711.06 → 2717.24] right just all arranged really nicely yes yeah yeah yeah god it was nice like in one place but
[2717.24 → 2722.94] yeah vector is what it's called super, super cool little tool yeah that's sweet
[2722.94 → 2732.90] all right what else we got from I think we brought down vector's website oh man MRI yeah geek squad MRI
[2732.90 → 2739.54] that way back in the day way way way long ago that used to be really genuinely good I have no idea if
[2739.54 → 2747.90] it even exists any more uh, but it was awesome back in the day yeah from Aiden any updates on the big
[2747.90 → 2751.26] tall or women's sizes Byron's boots yeah
[2751.26 → 2755.66] uh no
[2755.66 → 2767.68] we're we got a lot we got a lot of stuff going on yeah a lot of stuff going on there's always like man
[2767.68 → 2771.50] it's its kind of amazing how many projects they have rolling right now for how few people
[2771.50 → 2778.74] work at creator warehouse relatively speaking a lot of stuff going on yeah yeah
[2778.74 → 2785.74] apparently geek swatch still uses MRI, and it's still pretty cool all right that's actually good
[2785.74 → 2789.86] to hear because I know they've like outsourced a lot of their repair and stuff like you just
[2789.86 → 2793.58] plug the computers into a network connection and then people fix them remotely and stuff which
[2793.58 → 2800.02] kind of made me really sad um but the fact that MRI is still cool is pretty sweet also Byron's
[2800.02 → 2804.00] boot CD and all that type of stuff there are lots of cool things yeah I don't know I'd be super down
[2804.00 → 2811.68] from Dominic hey Linus I noticed wrist rest for keyboards are super boring have you ever
[2811.68 → 2816.46] thought of creating your own wrist rest in the typical LTT quality and style we all know and love
[2816.46 → 2822.68] why you have to read it like that so far over the top dude
[2822.68 → 2829.78] in all seriousness yeah we've thought about it but the way that I see it the custom keyboard
[2829.78 → 2836.64] market is so saturated there are so many players there 's's so many boutique wrist rests and
[2836.64 → 2844.44] keyboards and cables and all that stuff that i just I feel like we'd just kind of be adding to the noise
[2844.44 → 2849.18] at a certain point and the reason that it's occurred to me to make that product is because
[2849.18 → 2858.44] my wife is an avid wrist rest user she uses a steel series 7g which has that super long wrist rest on it
[2858.44 → 2864.82] and she just basically won't touch any other keyboard because it really is way better and so if we were
[2864.82 → 2871.38] going to do one it would probably be in that long gently inclined style, and she also uses a wrist rest
[2871.38 → 2877.96] for her mouse but I think the mouse one would be more likely just because there are so many options
[2877.96 → 2885.78] for keyboard rest rests due to the explosion in enthusiasm for mechanical keyboards and super
[2885.78 → 2891.70] cool keyboards a mouse rest I could actually see us exploring because the razor one that she's
[2891.70 → 2897.10] been using all these years it's its kind of disgusting I was going to say is it like yeah it's its
[2897.10 → 2903.34] pretty gross at this point there 's's you maybe just haven't looked in the right spots or
[2903.34 → 2911.54] maybe deep enough or whatever, but there are a lot of options for wrist rest um i I have this wooden
[2911.54 → 2917.12] one right now that's pretty sweet that I got from my mom for Christmas um and I like it, but it wasn't
[2917.12 → 2925.40] like sealed super well yeah I know i I know it's wearing out yeah so it's just like dang because it's it
[2925.40 → 2931.70] aesthetically is really nice in my opinion and then now it's actually yeah um, and then it's its
[2931.70 → 2935.70] I find it quite comfortable I actually like that it's just solid wood I know not everyone would like
[2935.70 → 2942.46] that but i I do um but yeah it's its like I'm like wearing through it pretty rapidly um so that's
[2942.46 → 2950.54] the only disappointing part now that's an interesting idea if we were to do a wooden one instead of using a
[2950.54 → 2953.80] stain like they did I think I know the one you're talking about its kind of reddish right is that the
[2953.80 → 2959.58] yeah yeah yeah instead of using a stain if we used something like a Danish oil then we could just
[2959.58 → 2965.40] like man I bet we could just do like a little like a little bottle of it included yeah a little
[2965.40 → 2971.46] maintenance kit that actually be sweet so that because it will wear away a little bit but when it
[2971.46 → 2976.18] does with something like a Danish oil you just decode it, and it will actually match the surroundings
[2976.18 → 2981.44] even like it'll still look like new that would be awesome that'd be pretty sweet okay maybe we'll do it
[2981.44 → 2987.22] I'd be interested in that I would genuinely like yeah i if there was that option, and it was advertised
[2987.22 → 2994.46] as like look it looks like this it will change over time because it's wood and your hands are on it all
[2994.46 → 2999.46] the time yeah you can maintain it here's how, and we're going to include some that would have that
[2999.46 → 3005.08] would have sold me at the time pretty much for sure huh yeah okay all right I'll think
[3005.08 → 3011.36] about it think about it yeah uh I did get a message from one of our labs folks I don't know is uh
[3011.36 → 3020.60] is he off probation yet this particular one uh I think as of like a day or two after the land yeah
[3020.60 → 3027.56] okay all right so well do you know that for sure not technically 100 okay then I'm not I'm not going
[3027.56 → 3033.34] to say it just in case but uh one of our software developers for the lab says read the USB hub testing
[3033.34 → 3039.90] question that came up yes we can and Gary and I have already had a chat around testing USB power
[3039.90 → 3046.62] banks etc as well good that's something that I really want to know because you buy these things
[3046.62 → 3052.92] they say however many William hours they are, but we all know that even on something like an iPhone
[3052.92 → 3061.02] right and apple for all their faults does have pretty strict quality control even on something like
[3061.02 → 3065.84] an iPhone I think is it plus or minus five percent it's quite a bit for the battery capacity yeah
[3065.84 → 3071.16] like what I'm sorry what do you mean plus or minus five percent so on something that you know might
[3071.16 → 3076.92] handle a screen on time of you know eight nine hours you mean my friend might get an extra hour
[3076.92 → 3082.56] if I get the worst one, and they get the best one that's ridiculous i also I have some battery banks
[3082.56 → 3090.46] that are still working from like 2013 that I have thrashed, and they're still like they have a decent
[3090.46 → 3094.96] amount of charge like I'm very impressed with some of them and then I have a small army of other
[3094.96 → 3099.76] battery banks that are essentially like decommissioned because they've just completely died yeah this
[3099.76 → 3105.20] is another perfect example of one of those techie product categories that even as someone knowledgeable
[3105.20 → 3114.42] you can go in and go well I know the reviews are horse I know that the specs are horse so I'm basically
[3114.42 → 3121.62] just like taking a complete shot in the dark hoping that I hit something decent yeah and there are brands
[3121.62 → 3128.50] that have built a reputation over the years brands like an anchor for example I expect to be better most of my
[3128.50 → 3136.24] anchor ones are pretty solid, but you know good brands can release a bad product, or they can be sorry
[3136.24 → 3143.90] or they can turn bad right you can have a good a brand that starts out good and then leverages
[3143.90 → 3149.54] that trust that they've built with their audience to start cranking out crap we've seen certainly seen
[3149.54 → 3155.22] that time and time again oh yeah definitely yeah I'm I'm super into that that sounds great
[3155.22 → 3162.48] and then dad dude over on float plane chat says hey and remember to that the William hour rating
[3162.48 → 3169.36] even on an honest company spec is based on the battery capacity not what it will output at the ports
[3169.36 → 3175.52] yes that is true uh it also doesn't account for oh I guess this is kind of the same thing so any
[3175.52 → 3182.20] inefficiencies that exist within the design of the bank any loss well there you go also some batteries
[3182.20 → 3189.06] will actually discharge at a less efficient in a less efficient manner if they are discharging
[3189.06 → 3193.70] quickly compared to others so depending on the chemistry depending on the quality of that
[3193.70 → 3200.54] particular battery if you use slow trickle charging versus fast charging one or another could perform
[3200.54 → 3210.38] dramatically different yeah there's so much boy is there ever a lot to it uh eternal salt says like
[3210.38 → 3214.68] Pyrex when that Chinese mega company bought them out I actually didn't know that Pyrex got bought and
[3214.68 → 3218.88] I didn't I don't know if the quality has gotten worse i I heard that they got bought out I have no
[3218.88 → 3224.52] idea about the quality interesting I mean the old school stuff lasts forever yeah literally forever
[3224.52 → 3229.94] yeah I don't know there's some people saying beeswax seals would really well against like
[3229.94 → 3235.60] hand oils and stuff oh interesting well that's cool I'm sure I'm sure the greater warehouse
[3235.60 → 3240.54] engineer team would figure out what the best option would be too bad there are not going to be
[3240.54 → 3246.90] any bees yeah, yeah so that's sad yeah
[3246.90 → 3255.50] yeah uh from Benjamin next question uh hello from Germany do you think the escalation with china
[3255.50 → 3260.06] and Taiwan could crash the entire tech industry yes sure could
[3260.06 → 3272.66] like immediately overnight sure could because basically TSMC is by far the largest player for chip fabrication
[3272.66 → 3281.46] particularly advanced chips uh Samsung is a distant second if I recall correctly or is intel still ahead of them
[3281.46 → 3288.06] but that then intel until they really ramp up their third party fabrication strategy is not really doing that
[3288.06 → 3293.18] as far as I know they're mostly jabbing their own products as it stands right now and
[3293.18 → 3298.30] TSMC um it's right in the name is in Taiwan
[3298.30 → 3306.80] so looking at the chip race that's going on right now you look at the chips act in the U.S.
[3306.80 → 3314.36] you look at the way uh china has been uh fighting to get their hands on high-end lithography equipment
[3314.36 → 3321.06] uh I forget what that like Chinese state owned basically uh chip Faber is i I forget the name
[3321.06 → 3327.00] but I think they're doing up to 14 nanometers right now, and they're trying to get their hands on more advanced stuff
[3327.00 → 3334.74] look at the way this technology arms race is ramping up right now because it's so obvious that next generation weaponry
[3334.74 → 3348.18] unless it is AI powered is going to be utterly useless um and the incentive that china has to just claim Taiwan
[3348.18 → 3358.00] um is higher than ever you know up until now it seems like it's been mostly an emotional incentive to claim
[3358.00 → 3367.54] the island nation, but that was big industry yeah but now with what a technological hub Taiwan is
[3367.54 → 3371.46] i i I can only see it going up
[3371.46 → 3378.90] SMIC that's the one thank you uh thank you float plane chat they fired missiles over Taiwan
[3378.90 → 3384.58] like a couple of days ago yeah well there was the whole thing with uh Nancy Pelosi visiting Taiwan which
[3384.58 → 3391.80] i have to say um not a huge fan Nancy Pelosi but ballsy move yeah I mean respect for that
[3391.80 → 3403.92] yep um you know maybe a bit of a bit of a weird move given the know um profiting that her husband
[3403.92 → 3412.32] technically I guess um has done uh with like uh through chip stocks and not definitely not
[3412.32 → 3416.96] insider trading um you'd think they wouldn't want to disrupt the tech industry but then
[3416.96 → 3419.94] you know who knows maybe they're shorting it now I don't I don't know
[3419.94 → 3428.48] inferno says nobody likes Nancy Pelosi to be frank I mean yeah yeah that's that's that's fair
[3428.48 → 3439.92] moving on we've got another question from Liam wondering what your take is on the Hasbro selfie
[3439.92 → 3444.68] series where you use an app to take pictures of your face then Hasbro sends out and has your face
[3444.68 → 3455.32] made into a custom action figurehead uh well Hasbro selfie series is that pulse what does oh hold
[3455.32 → 3461.76] on I thought i yeah here we go I thought I searched for this what happened create your own custom action
[3461.76 → 3468.12] figure choose your location uh not Canada okay then sure I'm German today
[3468.12 → 3474.80] make room on your, and it's English of course for yourself sure I'll take your cookies that's actually
[3474.80 → 3485.86] a perfect tagline new rangers look at this uh okay Boba Fett in disguise sorry what is this how's
[3485.86 → 3490.38] my face on I think you need to do the U.S. because the page change we did Germany might not be available
[3490.38 → 3495.70] yeah mine's work I clicked on us and mine's well I don't know these are that is definitely not the
[3495.70 → 3500.88] green and black ranger from the show that I watched so well this has got to be it right there's been a
[3500.88 → 3506.60] new show what's the lightning yeah but no these look like the retro uniforms though this is definitely
[3506.60 → 3511.48] the retro megaport should we show Luke's screen yeah I think you're totally off yeah I think you're
[3511.48 → 3517.62] totally off, so this is the Hasbro selfie series not what you were just looking at this is the tagline
[3517.62 → 3521.70] that I liked a lot of make room on your shelf for yourself I think that's hilarious okay that's
[3521.70 → 3526.96] pretty good uh pretty classic yep they have this thing which is I guess trying to represent
[3526.96 → 3532.52] you getting scanned yeah and then just a stay in you know stay in the know thing nothing really going
[3532.52 → 3539.58] on this one of a kind experience will be launching in fall 2022 exclusively on the Hasbro pulse mobile
[3539.58 → 3545.62] app for fans aged 16 and older in the U.S. only so that's yeah that's why it didn't show all right
[3545.62 → 3550.58] why did they even give me the option to go to Germany then who knows uh sing up below for the
[3550.58 → 3556.72] exclusive selfie series mailing list would you do it um do you get an action figure of yourself
[3556.72 → 3565.54] I mean I could see myself just being like well uh then again I don't I don't know hard to say I don't
[3565.54 → 3572.78] actually buy that much well yeah kind of stuff yeah I could definitely see a lot of people doing it
[3572.78 → 3580.26] though oh yeah like this is next level like genius tier product management I think if
[3580.26 → 3587.00] Hasbro really wants to pop off with this they should let people merchandise them oh like
[3587.00 → 3591.22] offer like a bulk right you know what I think the way they're going to be manufacturing these though
[3591.22 → 3596.60] they're going to be inherently like low volume i I don't think it'll barely even be much of a savings
[3596.60 → 3603.48] yeah I don't know i just think there's there are creators out there that would want to sell
[3603.48 → 3609.48] like an action figure of themselves hasn't Hasbro already done partnerships like that though I think
[3609.48 → 3616.72] so I don't know but if they is maybe is they use this to like to widen that okay flow plane chat reminds
[3616.72 → 3621.36] me that I already have multiple 3d printed action figures of myself yes but I don't think this is true
[3621.36 → 3627.06] but i for yourself I didn't buy them for me yeah so that doesn't count oh as a gift though I could
[3627.06 → 3632.72] see myself buying someone an action figure of themselves yeah for sure okay I thought you're
[3632.72 → 3637.24] going to say as a gift you could see yourself buying them an action figure of you and giving it to them
[3637.24 → 3641.74] and I was going to be like whoa I could see him doing that I could definitely see him doing that
[3641.74 → 3655.36] come on it's like dang dude okay that's brutal no what do I think of it I think they're
[3655.36 → 3660.62] geniuses I think as long as they can make the economics work they're going to sell so freaking
[3660.62 → 3665.84] many of these yeah why not i I assume they'll start with just faces and then from there you'll actually
[3665.84 → 3671.08] be able to like you know design what you're what you're want to be wearing and all that kind of stuff
[3671.08 → 3677.84] guarantee you're going to see some wedding cakes oh yeah with action figures oh yeah on top
[3677.84 → 3683.38] um especially with the way that like marvel's been popping off and stuff the whole like superhero
[3683.38 → 3688.98] action figure thing is like totally yep 100 and the number of people that do like a Star Wars themed
[3688.98 → 3696.14] wedding or one that I saw recently because i was checking out covers of the um romantic flight
[3696.14 → 3702.66] uh song from the soundtrack of how to train your dragon there are some amazing covers of it
[3702.66 → 3709.78] um anyway i I saw someone walked someone had it as they had a live orchestra at their wedding playing
[3709.78 → 3715.80] how to train your dragon music while they walked up to the altar yeah no kidding right uh but anyway
[3715.80 → 3722.84] you know with that in mind how realistic would it be to have Astrid and hiccup with the
[3722.84 → 3728.14] the heads of the bride and groom on top of the cake obviously by the time you hire an orchestra
[3728.14 → 3735.58] you know what's a custom figurine from Hasbro 99 99 easy forever right yeah exactly, exactly I could
[3735.58 → 3743.56] totally see people manufacturing like landfill like that it's good I read a fascinating
[3743.56 → 3747.26] article recently actually I don't think I talked about this on land show I think I was talking to you
[3747.26 → 3752.72] about it at some point though about how one of the big industries that is just popping off
[3752.72 → 3762.96] right now is junk removal because millennials have like no space and baby boomers had nothing but space
[3762.96 → 3771.48] and a compulsive desire to acquire shit and so as they are downsizing or passing away
[3771.48 → 3780.20] there's just this there's this mountain this veritable mountain of garbage that the next generation
[3780.20 → 3787.48] either doesn't want or has absolutely nowhere to put and this generation of people that are like
[3787.48 → 3795.12] yeah we accumulated this bone china that I'm sitting here like I was in I was in thrift store the other
[3795.12 → 3800.86] day picking up like cheap Archie comics for my kids and I was like I was looking at all the like
[3800.86 → 3805.86] the fine china gold leaf stuff I'm like who the fuck would want any of this
[3805.86 → 3814.76] are you like are you for real this is worth nothing now right and this is like a prized possession for
[3814.76 → 3820.86] silent generation or for your baby boomers out there oh we won't eat on this because it's like
[3820.86 → 3826.06] the nice it sits in the cupboard and never gets taken out until no one wants it now give me some
[3826.06 → 3830.92] mel mac is it called uh is that what that like super cheap
[3830.92 → 3840.04] yeah Mel mac yeah melamine from American cyanamide here let's let's check you and I have talked about
[3840.04 → 3844.74] fast fashion before yeah here we go my girlfriend told me about this website give me some Mel mac this
[3844.74 → 3851.92] is my childhood right here boys yeah definitely okay uh my girlfriend told me about this website I'm
[3851.92 → 3859.02] probably going to pronounce it incorrectly but sheen shine sheen bell recognizes it yeah I think it's
[3859.02 → 3867.48] sheen there's like eight dollar shirts pants for six bucks oh yeah so like there's no way these
[3867.48 → 3876.24] things last beyond like a season 100 and like I don't know yeah it is super cheap it is super cheap
[3876.24 → 3881.68] it definitely has that going for it, and they like look relatively trendy and stuff yeah fast fashion but
[3881.68 → 3889.62] like environmental disaster oh yeah actually there's this whole thing um how like the
[3889.62 → 3894.32] donated clothes they have too much of it yeah they're just like there's just like mountains
[3894.32 → 3903.48] of donated clothes I don't have anyone to give it to you like okay brutal man there's got to be stuff
[3903.48 → 3908.94] that you can just like make out of it like just shred it and like make stuff you know like it can't be
[3908.94 → 3914.14] that hard can it I think you'd have a lot of inconsistency in like fabric quality and stuff
[3914.14 → 3918.50] like that yeah and getting back down to like string is going to be basically impossible no you wouldn't
[3918.50 → 3923.78] you know no it wouldn't be to get back down to string you would just like i oh okay like for
[3923.78 → 3929.38] example that insulation that we have that's made out of uh recycled blue jeans where they just shred
[3929.38 → 3934.12] jeans and then just like turn it into like blue jean cake that you stuff in your walls like it
[3934.12 → 3942.82] I mean that's pretty much what it is um yeah I don't know i think in like shirts and stuff
[3942.82 → 3946.70] it's going to be more inconsistent though yeah no I don't think you wouldn't be able to make shirts
[3946.70 → 3952.20] oh, oh you mean just like the materials in them, I mean I don't know here's a question if it cost half
[3952.20 → 3959.12] as much and there was a chance that from one bat to the next the performance was going to be plus or
[3959.12 → 3963.78] minus you know never mind five percent like we were talking about for batteries I'm talking 25
[3963.78 → 3970.58] would you just would, you buy would you buy fabric insulation that's just like
[3970.58 → 3975.42] ah screw it some shirts yeah it's like I don't know it's made of shirts there are some skirts in there
[3975.42 → 3984.56] a few buttons oh man maybe you have to find something to do with it um yeah used clothing ends up in
[3984.56 → 3993.88] in landfills yeah, yeah pretty much that's bad question here from Luke hi Linus I do cell phone
[3993.88 → 4001.32] repair that's not really a question Luke yeah yeah yeah got him what's going on Luke classic Luke
[4001.32 → 4006.08] but I was also curious if when labs are up and running fully there'll be any testing of durability
[4006.08 → 4012.16] of mobile devices or tad teardowns like fixity do I don't think that we are going to get into
[4012.16 → 4018.36] either of those um durability testing is not useful on a sample size of one and quite frankly
[4018.36 → 4024.50] it's not even useful on a sample size of 10 we showed back when we toured one plus's manufacturing
[4024.50 → 4031.78] facility that what it takes is specialized equipment whether it's for drops or whether it's for tumbles
[4031.78 → 4039.74] that is run on many devices and they have the luxury of many disposable devices to chuck into
[4039.74 → 4045.92] these things that are not finished quality right that might have engineering sample grade SOCS in
[4045.92 → 4051.00] them for example like they literally couldn't sell them is ready to test exactly or they could make
[4051.00 → 4057.68] dummy ones that have exactly the same body, and they can investigate it for screen cracking without
[4057.68 → 4061.54] actually wasting hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of internal hardware on them
[4061.54 → 4067.76] uh we just don't we don't have that kind of luxury and that's the kind of thing that you know
[4067.76 → 4075.20] what hey three to five years from now if the community said we want this we might even create
[4075.20 → 4079.94] a system actually this is a perfect idea we should write this down, but we could create a system
[4079.94 → 4089.96] where our community could fund could specifically fund specific tests they could say hey uh we want to see
[4089.96 → 4096.88] we want to see 10 iPhones in a tumble dryer um, and then we would have basically built a mechanism
[4096.88 → 4101.56] where they could, we could say like look we're not gonna we're no we're not paying out of pocket for that
[4101.56 → 4107.32] there is no way there's your not getting your return make up that ten thousand dollars worth
[4107.32 → 4114.76] of iPhones on this video or this article or just this data sheet right it's not happening but if you guys
[4114.76 → 4120.68] really want to see it than sure yeah we're into it uh we could even see manufacturers potentially
[4120.68 → 4127.38] funding something like that like if you're an um oh no I don't know that'd be tough that'd be tough
[4127.38 → 4133.20] like if I'm an otter box and I just said hey I want independent third-party testing of how well the iPhone
[4133.20 → 4138.62] holds up to this thing there's no way that they're gonna just write the check and walk away
[4138.62 → 4143.98] uh and not expect us to also test otter boxes for example so that's
[4145.06 → 4152.38] yeah that's tough is that an acceptable thing as long as they don't interfere with our data and
[4152.38 → 4156.78] they understand as long as part of our agreement we basically say yeah you got to understand that
[4156.78 → 4161.72] once you write the check we're publishing the data regardless of the outcome I don't think it's bad
[4161.72 → 4166.76] to test otter boxes I could see us doing it for LTT but I don't think that's something that the lab
[4166.76 → 4171.94] would just do and publish the data so that's something where LTT could use the lab yeah i
[4171.94 → 4175.80] that's where I would kind of draw the line there that seems fair yeah
[4175.80 → 4183.62] question here from William hi Linus and one of your oh sorry no I'll get to that one sec as for i
[4183.62 → 4187.60] fix it I think they do a great job I don't think we'd be contributing anything to that particular
[4187.60 → 4194.02] space at this time low priority we love I fix it uh from William hi Linus in one of your at-home
[4194.02 → 4199.50] videos I saw a Yuma plush in your kids playroom is Yuma your favourite PAW Patrol pup or do you
[4199.50 → 4206.24] prefer a different one I can't say that I have a favourite pup but I can definitely recite the
[4206.24 → 4212.34] intro theme song from my kids watch thankfully they're over PAW Patrol at this point they're um
[4212.34 → 4217.26] man what do they don't really watch much TV lately actually now that I think about it, they'll watch
[4217.26 → 4222.22] wild Kratz if they're is they're just like down to never even heard of that never heard of PAW Patrol
[4222.22 → 4229.46] but not Kratz brothers yeah like Abuja foo oh okay I know Abuja foo sure okay I don't know what the
[4229.46 → 4235.22] heck Abuja foo is but oh wow Abuja foo is legit dude okay you don't know the good stuff well
[4235.22 → 4242.94] uh this question's from Ryan, but we've had a couple of people ask if we had any information about
[4242.94 → 4247.00] what the backpack's warranty will be now that we've started getting ready to ship out it's a
[4247.00 → 4254.18] wonderful question right now we are we're holding firm with we are not formalizing anything but we
[4254.18 → 4261.46] will stand behind our products um I think that we have a pretty good tracker I think we have a pretty
[4261.46 → 4270.14] good track record for just kind of dealing with it the last thing that I would want to do is create
[4270.14 → 4278.10] some kind of like legal liability um for you know like I don't I don't know what the future holds
[4278.10 → 4287.20] right like I could die tomorrow and let's say let's say my you know my my my muse my flame
[4287.20 → 4296.52] uh Yvonne is like I can't do this like I can't walk in every day, and you know see Linus all over
[4296.52 → 4301.80] the place, and she's just like yeah I can't right that that that's that's possible and I respect that
[4301.80 → 4308.74] um so the last thing I want to do is create some kind of legal obligation because of some kinds of
[4308.74 → 4316.02] t some kind of t's and c's that we have created around our uh our warranty policy for example and
[4316.02 → 4321.32] like yeah I guess that does put you guys in a bit of an uncomfortable position, but it's not our
[4321.32 → 4328.22] intention to go away it's not our intention to do anything about our current policy of just
[4328.22 → 4336.90] dealing with it but um it's not our primary business making backpacks and so the last thing I would want
[4336.90 → 4345.12] to do is hang this albatross around my family's neck um when they're already had other stuff to deal with
[4345.12 → 4349.00] so that's where that's where we're at on that
[4349.00 → 4357.36] question here from Chester any suggestions for Ethernet cable routing along the inside of brick
[4357.36 → 4365.30] walls I mean other than just running it along the mortar and then using like those um using just
[4365.30 → 4370.08] like plastic drywall anchors you kind of drill them out you put in the anchors you screw it in so
[4370.08 → 4373.60] they expand so they grab on I mean I don't know what else to tell you
[4373.60 → 4379.26] if the brick wall is painted you can paint the cable to match um it's just always going to look
[4379.26 → 4384.46] pretty bad yep painting it to match never fully solves that problem
[4384.46 → 4389.94] you briefly mentioned it in the pre-show so we got a few people asking if there are any new houses
[4389.94 → 4398.14] updates actually we shot two today we're going to say you were I heard you're at home yeah i I did
[4398.14 → 4405.46] away with my 48-inch monitor 48 inches it's pretty big it's it maybe is too big
[4405.46 → 4414.34] so uh I tried a couple different options the alienware 34 inch ultra-wide with the cutie OLED
[4414.34 → 4424.66] screen looks so good but then LG also has the c2 42 inch which also looks almost as good oh and is
[4424.66 → 4432.28] bigger yeah but not as big as 48 inches so that one's going to be pretty good i also uh in that video
[4432.28 → 4438.96] we update you know how I changed my microphone yeah so I do that in that video got it um what else
[4438.96 → 4444.94] what else did we do oh, and then we also shot one that's about sort of fun novel interesting
[4444.94 → 4450.88] charging solutions it doesn't sound very interesting but I will tell you that within
[4450.88 → 4457.84] the first 10 seconds of the video you're going to be hooked okay because I managed to rip uh a car
[4457.84 → 4464.50] charger out of the ceiling of my house and I can't promise that there won't be other shenanigans we're
[4464.50 → 4469.18] actually not done shooting that one yet so I don't know what else will happen okay we should um we
[4469.18 → 4475.54] should probably hit the sponsors oh do we have sponsors are there sponsors for the show no maybe not

[4651.98 → 4658.68] below satire in float plane chat if you sent in three support tickets and didn't get a reply
[4658.68 → 4666.30] uh the problem i I don't I can't possibly understand how that happened, but they reply to every
[4666.30 → 4674.32] ticket that they receive so what you might have to do is um you can try tweeting uh at nick and then
[4674.32 → 4679.20] maybe just say like hey here's my order number or my ticket number ideally, and then they can go track
[4679.20 → 4684.56] it down nothing is perfect but if you're is you're not getting a reply from support eventually sometimes
[4684.56 → 4689.50] we do get behind then something is wrong that's not how that works
[4689.50 → 4698.42] all right what else we got to talk about today should we talk about the uh tales behind the
[4698.42 → 4702.24] counter do we save that for another time uh we can save that for another time I want to talk about
[4702.24 → 4708.52] Amazon buying i robot okay yeah you have strong opinions about this uh my reaction to it was just
[4708.52 → 4713.94] like okay they just moved closer to being an entire country but yeah what's what's uh what's up with
[4713.94 → 4722.44] Amazon has signed an agreement to purchase i robot maker of the Roomba for 1.7 billion dollars
[4722.44 → 4727.38] almost as much as twitter loses every year in specific money talk it is an all cash transaction
[4727.38 → 4733.98] wow for 61 dollars a share no that's a big deal that's a big deal no I know that's why yeah earlier
[4733.98 → 4741.58] this year i robot launched its latest i robot OS an AI platform for its vacuums and mops i robot OS was
[4741.58 → 4747.30] designed to separate Roomba from the rest of the vacuums out there Amazon has not detailed plans for
[4747.30 → 4753.94] what it intends to do with i robot um and the big an actually launched their own smart home robot last
[4753.94 → 4759.98] year called Castro for a thousand dollars uh it could map out floor plans listen for commands and
[4759.98 → 4768.50] recognize faces it could not clean so here is kind of on the surface you can kind of go okay
[4768.50 → 4777.66] Amazon is buying competent cleaning technology so that's one thing but hear me out what I think
[4777.66 → 4782.98] is Amazon just wants yet another camera in your house oh they're also mapping your house yet another
[4782.98 → 4790.90] sensor array that patrols your house and monitors what the heck it is that you're doing and where
[4790.90 → 4796.36] you're going recognize your face and vacuum definitely needs to do that what you like to spend your time on
[4796.36 → 4806.52] yeah this is brutal to don't buy it please I mean you can buy it no but like just know what you're
[4806.52 → 4812.38] getting yourself into that's all I ask that's all I ask I asked that you don't buy it between ring
[4812.38 → 4824.62] Roomba Castro and echo Amazon will now be able to basically not basically literally follow you around
[4824.62 → 4833.48] and know exactly who you're talking to about what and what you're doing anytime you are at home
[4833.48 → 4837.38] isn't that wild super cool
[4837.38 → 4846.30] very, very cool uh yeah that was it that was it I just wanted to kind of laugh
[4846.30 → 4853.56] at how Amazon is basically the buy and large from wall-e yeah at this point stop bending over and
[4853.56 → 4858.82] giving Amazon so much money please thank you people complain about like all these working conditions
[4858.82 → 4863.78] and stuff, and they're like uh still can't drive to the store still going to buy everything off Amazon
[4863.78 → 4870.78] yeah and then I'll go protest Amazon at the same time yeah as supporting them financially as hard as i
[4870.78 → 4878.14] possibly can at all points in time I have a prime membership come on guys i know, but it's so
[4878.14 → 4880.64] convenient for business oh my goodness
[4880.64 → 4887.88] I've talked about this too much on Wayne show people don't like my spicy Amazon takes its fine
[4887.88 → 4892.30] I get it guys just keep supporting them eventually they'll own your house and your car and you but
[4892.30 → 4897.32] that's okay that's fine no, no tesla will own your car buy the vacuum so that they can track your face
[4897.32 → 4900.70] because that's definitely required that makes a lot of sense cool
[4900.70 → 4912.62] anyway uh Europeans mad oh we got to tackle it at some point yeah okay a lot of folks in Europe
[4912.62 → 4921.54] are mad about the LTT backpack price Amazon has free shipping why doesn't LTT store okay well hold on
[4921.54 → 4926.96] hold on don't be condescending a lot of people don't necessarily okay I know I was just
[4926.96 → 4933.12] trying to tie in the Amazon thank you for one thing when we assess tax in the checkout that's
[4933.12 → 4938.22] the one time that tax should be assessed that's not Canadian tax, and then you pay your own country's
[4938.22 → 4944.06] tax after if you're getting assessed tax again when the package arrives you need to take that up with
[4944.06 → 4949.42] the last mile courier because they are doing it wrong you already paid the tax to be clear I don't
[4949.42 → 4955.12] think the way that we communicate it is the same way that it is normally communicated I'm not
[4955.12 → 4959.46] necessarily saying that we're communicating it poorly or that we're not communicating it but I think it is
[4959.46 → 4965.92] abnormal so when I think when people see it they're assuming that it is different okay for another
[4965.92 → 4972.46] thing so thing number two the expensive shipping we have I believe it is capped at either 50 or 60
[4972.46 → 4980.56] dollars on average looking at our order history and the quotes that we got across many couriers we
[4980.56 → 4990.88] really did work hard at this um already our average costs and our average um amount that we're charging
[4990.88 → 4997.92] um are subsidized or sorry already the costs are higher than what we're actually charging we are we
[4997.92 → 5004.72] are subsidizing backpack shipping to I believe everywhere but Canada and the U.S. who are helping us
[5004.72 → 5012.10] subsidize the other regions but nominally so yeah I think we're eating somewhere in the neighbourhood of
[5012.10 → 5020.02] 10 to 20 dollars on pretty much everything outside of North America per shipment there just is not
[5020.02 → 5026.96] more that I can do at that point someone in the phone chat said my shipping was 89 dollars, so there is
[5026.96 → 5032.22] no cap you probably had other things in your order more stuff so that was a judgment call that we made on
[5032.22 → 5038.70] backpack knowing that it wasn't going to be in stock for I believe wave one ships out September 20th by
[5038.70 → 5045.60] September 20th so we made a judgment call because either we were going to have to hold people's entire
[5045.60 → 5051.56] order until their backpack was ready and if we did that we would be able to charge one shipping fee
[5051.56 → 5058.64] or we were going to ship out everything else on your order and then the backpack separately which meant
[5058.64 → 5064.20] that well because we were paying for the shipping twice we have to charge the shipping twice and there
[5064.20 → 5070.00] wasn't a way with our limited internal systems right now to have that be a toggle option that people
[5070.00 → 5077.44] could choose so we made the call because we know no matter how many times we say it no matter how clearly
[5077.44 → 5084.58] we say it there are always a very significant number of people who get confused and frustrated when they order
[5084.58 → 5090.00] something even though they know one of the items is going to be delayed whether it's a custom printed
[5090.00 → 5094.84] shirt or something like that there is always people who get confused and angry and message customer
[5094.84 → 5100.26] service and create a ton of work because they haven't received the other items from their order yet
[5100.26 → 5105.98] and so we made the call to ship out everything we have and follow up with the backpacks later so for the
[5105.98 → 5109.32] backpack itself there was a completely separate shipping fee assessed
[5109.32 → 5120.04] if there is a legitimate problem, and you legitimately did encounter something else then please do message support
[5120.04 → 5131.00] oh yeah there was also the sticker controversy if you ordered a backpack and just free
[5131.00 → 5136.20] stickers you got charged shipping for the stickers we are dealing with that yeah it's being its being
[5136.20 → 5141.44] refunded it's its been fixed so it shouldn't happen anymore, and it's being refunded so we're taking
[5141.44 → 5146.66] care of it across the board um what I don't fully remember and I think some other people might be
[5146.66 → 5151.60] might be interested what are the complications about setting up distribution from Europe do you have to like
[5151.60 → 5159.50] tax be a company there yeah, yeah so that's that's that's a lot that's like it's not trivial yeah um and
[5159.50 → 5167.14] so aside from just the cost of running a physical location there uh the logistical nightmare
[5167.14 → 5175.86] of splitting our inventory there is also the um the taxation and reporting uh obligations that come
[5175.86 → 5182.44] with being now an EU company we're all of a sudden a multinational do you think it's a coincidence that
[5182.44 → 5189.40] OnePlus started out as having one location web only from which they shipped all phones that
[5189.40 → 5195.90] charged three hundred dollars for a phone to becoming a multinational that has support and service
[5195.90 → 5202.00] centres in multiple countries um that charges six seven eight hundred dollars for a phone it's not it's
[5202.00 → 5208.64] not there's no free lunch you have to pay for it somewhere yeah uh Aiden yeah go for it
[5208.64 → 5220.02] but then I'd rather wait I don't want to pay 2x shipping I literally don't know what that means
[5220.02 → 5226.24] no they would prefer to have a single shipment oh yeah I get it um
[5226.24 → 5234.30] unfortunately we didn't have a way to do it either way so we're we're working on I mean we're constantly
[5234.30 → 5242.06] doing development on our Shopify store it just takes time it just takes time and we
[5242.06 → 5248.82] fortunately thanks to the amazing support that we've gotten from you guys on backpack uh we have
[5248.82 → 5253.48] some money that we are spending we are actively spending on hiring developers I mean how many are
[5253.48 → 5261.84] you hiring right now okay thank you for that um no more for the store but um a huge amount of the
[5261.84 → 5266.82] effort that's gone into store development for a while the person who does that is in flow plane
[5266.82 → 5273.50] chat right now I think I saw him in here recently um a lot of that effort has gone to a big redesign
[5273.50 → 5279.24] uh that we wanted to happen because we wanted to freshen up the site but also because we need to move
[5279.24 → 5285.46] on to a new theme um just because of like I mean we don't like own the platform and things are changing
[5285.46 → 5292.10] and we're moving to the dawn theme um and that's perfect for like a wide range of reasons once
[5292.10 → 5296.76] we are on the dawn theme then we'll start being able to get back to features and stuff specifically
[5296.76 → 5305.14] for the store, but there's been a very big effort to get us um to the new version yeah aria lux in
[5305.14 → 5310.00] twitch chat asks have you ever looked into variable pricing based on location it might ease shipping costs
[5310.00 → 5318.50] if it appears not too exorbitant the problem with that is that it will for the people who live in
[5318.50 → 5325.62] areas that are very well serviced by couriers or by their local postal service um it will be a
[5325.62 → 5332.86] savings yep you're right unfortunately what it will do is it will basically put ordering from LTT store
[5332.86 → 5338.96] completely out of reach for people in rural areas it generates it's its just like the situation we're
[5338.96 → 5344.08] running into now where the people who are fine with the shipping costs will be fine, and they'll be
[5344.08 → 5350.14] quiet and the people who are upset because they are at the high end of the shipping costs will be
[5350.14 → 5357.12] absolutely outraged, and we'll bring that outrage online and into our customer support inbox and
[5357.12 → 5363.34] so what are we what are we supposed to like there there 's's a there's a trade-off no matter which
[5363.34 → 5368.68] way we do it yeah in a perfect world I would say yeah sure that makes total sense that
[5368.68 → 5374.04] people should just pay exactly the amount that the shipping cost uh maybe with a slight surcharge
[5374.04 → 5377.36] so that we have a slush fund for running shipping promos or whatever else yeah I'd say something
[5377.36 → 5386.40] like that makes a ton of sense but unfortunately in the real world we can't charge you know 19 for
[5386.40 → 5396.16] shipping to Vancouver and 362 for shipping to Iqaluit sorry we can't, we can't give the middle finger
[5396.16 → 5403.62] to that customer in a remote region that hard even though that's how much it costs I don't know that
[5403.62 → 5409.94] that exact amount is right, but it is not inconceivable within Canada alone for shipping charges on a product
[5409.94 → 5417.22] like the backpack to exceed 100 Canadian dollars easily so yeah if you're somewhere where typically
[5417.22 → 5423.10] you're accustomed to it being cheaper you're probably subsidizing someone else well we've said that
[5423.10 → 5430.36] forever to be fair that is not a's not new information shipping is really expensive I'm a
[5430.36 → 5434.26] flanker says one additional warehouse would cover all of Europe and slash shipping times I know but
[5434.26 → 5442.18] you're not listening what it wouldn't do is decrease our overall overhead our costs would go up our prices
[5442.18 → 5450.84] would just go up once we have a physical location in a region it gets really complicated like we will need
[5450.84 → 5457.52] a team of people to manage it right now the entire creator warehouse teams like 10 people
[5457.52 → 5466.22] so what we're going to go hire another team well you're going to pay for it right so I don't know it's tough
[5466.22 → 5472.88] it's tough i there's no perfect answer we would love to do it what I had wanted to do way back
[5472.88 → 5479.44] in the day was um especially back when Hong Kong was so heavily subsidizing international shipping
[5479.44 → 5485.50] like you, you could get a package shipped from Hong Kong for like a dollar you could buy stuff yeah you
[5485.50 → 5490.60] could buy stuff on like AliExpress or whatever for like three dollars with free shipping, and you're
[5490.60 → 5495.76] sitting here going how does this make any sense whatsoever well it's all state subsidies right
[5495.76 → 5500.86] um so what I had wanted to do was find a region like that where there's heavy state subsidies
[5500.86 → 5505.86] in international shipping and just take advantage of that but to my knowledge nobody is really doing
[5505.86 → 5516.26] that to the same degree any more yeah and shipping in Canada in general is quite brutal yeah yeah Canada
[5516.26 → 5523.42] uh yeah even just shipping something like you actually mentioned just a minute ago shipping
[5523.42 → 5529.52] something inside Canada not even leaving the borders can be like astronomically shipping something from my
[5529.52 → 5533.80] house to your house would cost me like 20 bucks exactly I was just going to say even if you're not going
[5533.80 → 5539.56] to a quality or whatever like if is you're going if you're going basically down the street it can still
[5539.56 → 5540.70] be really expensive
[5540.70 → 5555.00] and I mean the reality of it is that the backpack launch was a smash success so you know did we get
[5555.00 → 5564.16] it perfect maybe not, but we did get it pretty good and if is huge shipping costs are a concern for you but you
[5564.16 → 5567.90] you know you want to support the channel or whatever else we do have things that don't weigh as much
[5567.90 → 5574.14] screwdriver is coming really soon it's a lower cost item, and it's a much smaller item um if you're is you're
[5574.14 → 5580.06] frustrated with how much backpack cost to ship um what something that I would recommend that you do if you want
[5580.06 → 5584.72] to understand it a little better at least is look into the concept of dimensional weight the backpack
[5584.72 → 5592.18] itself is not that heavy but in shipping because their costs are less to do with the actual weight
[5592.18 → 5597.08] unless its air freight in which case weight matters a lot uh but less to do with the actual weight but
[5597.08 → 5603.58] more to do with the dimensions of it backpack is huge, and it takes up a lot of space on a pallet and
[5603.58 → 5612.22] every time a pallet gets moved there's a cost so the farther it goes, the more it costs and the more
[5612.22 → 5618.14] of the pallet takes up the more of the overall cost of moving those goods around has to be borne by that
[5618.14 → 5624.42] one package and this is some assumptions but well I am assuming I'm assuming their correct
[5624.42 → 5629.28] I don't know maybe you can correct me because I know in the boxes for the backpacks
[5629.28 → 5634.52] themselves are filled with airbags they are um it's to help them keep their shape because the
[5634.52 → 5640.74] reprieve fabric is really like strong right, and we want it to be in good quality and in with the
[5640.74 → 5646.78] proper shape and holding its form so if it gets crushed like really badly like sits crushed crumpled
[5646.78 → 5651.80] you uh you know it gets delayed in shipping, and it sits in a warehouse for six weeks under a giant
[5651.80 → 5658.30] pile of other stuff uh it could have a hard time bouncing back it is meant to it is meant to retain
[5658.30 → 5664.08] yeah because there's a lot of other like purses or backpacks or small bags or whatever that will
[5664.08 → 5670.58] come flat yeah, but they're like tent material yes it's its very different so it's not made for
[5670.58 → 5673.18] that yeah yep that's correct
[5673.18 → 5682.74] have you this is another thing I think you're just reading comments so I'm just going to keep riffing sure
[5682.74 → 5689.24] yeah this is another thing that i uh had thought of recently is we talk about this with
[5689.24 → 5696.22] graphics cards so you release the halo product first have you considered releasing a like Ltd backpack
[5696.22 → 5704.12] light um i I hadn't I I mean the backpack was built to be the one that I want yeah which that's what i
[5704.12 → 5710.62] want I carry a lot of stuff around and i I like that whether I well whether I like it or not that's
[5710.62 → 5719.12] my life but I have seen so many requests for it that I feel like we'd be morons to not at least
[5719.12 → 5724.38] explore it I can't guarantee anything right now it's absolutely not something that we have in
[5724.38 → 5730.32] development at the moment, but we had had people ask about it internally, and we have had so many
[5730.32 → 5736.02] people ask about it from our audience that we'd be yeah there's just there's just no way we won't
[5736.02 → 5743.46] at least explore it cool interesting yeah all right want to give us another one bell sure do how
[5743.46 → 5753.78] about a softball yes let me pick a different one then just kidding this question is from a whale from
[5753.78 → 5758.96] the land event oh hi the event was super fun and I hope we get to focus more on lands at Ltd in the
[5758.96 → 5765.08] future that's not a question luckily they followed up with a question I wanted to ask one thing about
[5765.08 → 5769.54] headphone testing at the lab oh sure do you have any plans to do frequency response at different
[5769.54 → 5774.58] volumes versus an equal loudness curve it's something I've always wondered about frequency response graphs
[5774.58 → 5784.20] interesting um I don't know that is a tremendous wonderful question I don't know that I'll be able to
[5784.20 → 5791.34] get you an answer back in a convenient way but what I can do is I can definitely forward that
[5791.34 → 5797.24] actually I'm going to have bell forward that to uh the head of the lab and that's something that they
[5797.24 → 5804.26] can at least explore for the creation of our test suites uh thank you for asking and I'm glad you had
[5804.26 → 5811.28] fun at the land i I also had fun the land was awesome yeah i I had an I had a blast i we should probably
[5811.28 → 5817.56] wow we should probably talk highlights hey yeah I'd be down um beating everyone
[5817.56 → 5824.46] at left for dead I mean okay that was kind of mean though was it like bell we told them it was
[5824.46 → 5831.22] going to happen yeah we warned them they all knew they signed up for that yeah we basically assembled a
[5831.22 → 5838.86] team uh like a crack team of left for dead players and I got up on the microphone and said
[5838.86 → 5847.14] assemble a squad if anyone can beat us I will give every member of your team a backpack an early
[5847.14 → 5854.26] screwdriver hand built by kyle head of engineering at creator warehouse and 250 us dollars in store
[5854.26 → 5861.48] credit at LTT store, so naturally teams were assembled the teams yeah people signed up for the tournament
[5861.48 → 5871.90] and one by one we absolutely crashed them into the ground it wasn't even fair we had chase who is just
[5871.90 → 5880.92] like a mad lad in general and who is perfect at left for dead we had bell who streamed probably
[5880.92 → 5888.34] hundreds of hours of left for dead back in the day we've got me I've got 250 300 hours of left for
[5888.34 → 5894.12] dead one and left for dead two under my belt it's been a while but like there's a big difference
[5894.12 → 5901.64] between having 250 hours of left for dead playing on like public servers and me the vast majority of
[5901.64 → 5908.40] my hours were with a crew that did nothing but get home from work and play left for dead with some
[5908.40 → 5913.82] really like legit gamers sharpen that sword a lot more than just like randomly playing against pubs
[5913.82 → 5918.48] absolutely yeah and so the vast majority of my hours are playing with that crew I have
[5918.48 → 5924.92] significantly fewer hours than everyone else that was on that team um by like probably hundreds but
[5924.92 → 5932.04] uh I've only really played with all of them yeah so, and you follow orders good yeah and your fps skills
[5932.04 → 5937.82] are yeah that's that's right every once in a while I was you I usually did okay every once in a
[5937.82 → 5943.66] while if I got like the right zombie characters I'd like top damage or whatever i really my favourite one's the
[5943.66 → 5953.24] spitter oh spitter so much so much fun yeah yeah um and like it's not like Linus is quiet
[5953.24 → 5958.76] so anytime that I'm like not necessarily sure what I should be doing I just like hey where am I going
[5958.76 → 5963.34] or like whatever and I'll, I'll get information quickly but yeah it was good we ended up playing
[5963.34 → 5972.34] against um like essentially my family and friends in the final so that was weird because like their team
[5972.34 → 5977.84] name is generally the team name that I'm under, and we like had to beat them up which was kind of funny
[5977.84 → 5983.56] had to crush them it was there were a few funny moments where like I would just like take
[5983.56 → 5988.20] someone out or just like there was a boomer time when I got all four of them and I was just like
[5988.20 → 5994.68] brutal there was one time I was a smoker I was on top of the building you guys hit them all at the same
[5994.68 → 6002.28] time yeah and i 100 to KO'd someone with the smoker nice and I was like yeah let's go um Linus against
[6002.28 → 6009.44] again my crew did a charger run down a set of stairs and hit literally every single one of them which was
[6009.44 → 6016.62] awesome yeah it was pretty good it was pretty fun it was good heart I mean as much as I love just
[6016.62 → 6023.34] crapping all over noobs though I'd say the most fun that I had at the land was halo CE blood bulk
[6023.34 → 6031.42] you can't you you can't plan we can show the clip I was looking for it just now okay you I haven't
[6031.42 → 6037.82] found it yet, but you cannot plan this out okay you can't have ranked players go into a tournament
[6037.82 → 6046.24] and set up teams this even and we basically just Luke and I started up a lobby each of us went to one of
[6046.24 → 6052.82] the teams, and then we just broadcast the password on discord and people flooded in randomly populated to
[6052.82 → 6059.22] the teams we broke it into separate discord chats and I kid you not I have never seen a competition
[6059.22 → 6069.06] so even in my life we played 8v8 on blood bulk capture the flag three full rounds with neither team
[6069.06 → 6075.94] scoring a single flag capture, and it got close to the end of the fourth one as well and then finally
[6075.94 → 6080.84] finally, and it was like it was not because people didn't know what they were doing or weren't following
[6080.84 → 6087.00] instructions or weren't good fps players if anything it was just that each team had the
[6087.00 → 6095.62] perfect mix of elite tier players and lower end scrappers and there was just this it was like
[6095.62 → 6102.28] playing warcraft one right where the orcs and the humans are exactly equivalent like you would
[6102.28 → 6107.56] have a swordsman and uh and uh what are they called grunts they're they're just like swordsman
[6107.56 → 6113.62] equivalent is, and they would just go uh uh uh uh uh and then the last two swords would hit each
[6113.62 → 6116.96] other at the same time, and they'd both die right like that that would actually happen oh
[6116.96 → 6123.90] in warcraft 2 as well uh so it would that was just how every conflict would go down both teams would
[6123.90 → 6132.50] annihilate each other and respawn over and over and over again until finally the stalemate was
[6132.50 → 6140.82] broken by just a fluke lucky situation sick to watch it back if is anyone's in the whale land discord
[6140.82 → 6146.56] because it's still up uh if you can find the video and post it in general because I can't really find
[6146.56 → 6151.42] it right now uh I just don't remember what channel it's in but if you can post it, it'd be really cool
[6151.42 → 6158.84] to show because it's actually crazy like it's its pretty sweet oh man I was raging out so hard
[6158.84 → 6168.06] Luke uh Luke mentioned that I'm not a quiet gamer which is fair I like it, I'm not complaining its
[6168.06 → 6177.54] just it's a fact so when my driver the driver of my warthog who I asked to take asked very politely
[6177.54 → 6183.90] and calmly asked Luke was actually sitting next to me so he could hear me just like
[6183.90 → 6190.04] to my mic the whole time I would try not to i would try to mute my mic when I heard you actually
[6190.04 → 6195.10] saying commands and if I heard like okay we're going in whatever amount of time I would not
[6195.10 → 6200.60] relay that information I'll try not to act on it, but sometimes it was so loud that it would go through
[6200.60 → 6205.48] other people's mics in the convention and I would hear you saying it through my headphones from someone
[6205.48 → 6212.90] else and I was just like okay so I tend to be a bit of a loud boy gamer we got it
[6212.90 → 6218.90] uh okay uh do you want to send it to you on post it in the chat or oh yeah sure yeah yeah if you
[6218.90 → 6227.70] send it to me here I can just play it um okay so someone's hiding behind the base okay and they
[6227.70 → 6234.92] went they stole one of the warthogs from that base happened to pull up right as some lone wolf rogue
[6234.92 → 6238.76] came out the back of the base with the flag grabbed them like it couldn't have been timed more
[6238.76 → 6242.42] perfectly if we were professional players uh where will I find I'm just trying to figure out where
[6242.42 → 6248.18] to send it to you oh then the dog yeah the dog is good just right at the top is perfect um so they're
[6248.18 → 6252.06] coming back and I'm like guys you got to talk you got to communicate they're like we
[6252.06 → 6256.14] got the flight okay where are you going what can we do what can we do to support you they're
[6256.14 → 6260.12] like okay we're coming back like which side where are you coming back like oh so I'm talking to my
[6260.12 → 6268.28] driver I'm like go go go you have to go up here my driver bless his heart bless his heart soul mind
[6268.28 → 6278.08] and body okay drives headlong into the warthog that is coming back after literally an hour of stalemate
[6278.08 → 6286.72] an hour no one can score okay drives headlong into the warthog that is carrying their flag back
[6286.72 → 6292.92] this is a 8v8 we are right next to the portal that comes out of their base i just
[6292.92 → 6302.50] should be under the uh right above intel slowing down right above that topic okay yeah I'm I'm like
[6302.50 → 6310.14] I'm getting anxiety just thinking back to it okay here it is fortunately uh fortunately the copper i
[6310.14 → 6318.12] believe yeah yeah the copper managed to manage to uh screen record and upload the whole thing
[6318.12 → 6324.42] so this particular player on our team was kind of playing hide up near the base kind of take
[6324.42 → 6329.34] pot shots or whatever one of the things we were trying to do was accumulate all the warthogs yeah
[6329.34 → 6335.82] so that we could do like a four warthog push look at this didn't know they were coming because people
[6335.82 → 6340.00] don't communicate I had no idea in CE you could get in the gunner seat with a flag that also
[6340.00 → 6343.58] confused the crap out of me a lot of people were shooting at the passenger seat so we're actually
[6343.58 → 6351.30] missing them nice, so this is my hog that drives headlong into them, I didn't see it our hog crashed
[6351.30 → 6357.28] so I didn't actually see that they landed on all four wheels nobody talks so I didn't know what the
[6357.28 → 6361.76] heck was going on we have someone in their base grabbing their flag who goes out the back which you
[6361.76 → 6367.48] would think would be smart, but that's actually where they pulled up their flag they like barely make
[6367.48 → 6374.88] it through, but they cap it crazy ending scored oh man one nothing after four full rounds is
[6374.88 → 6380.48] absolutely wild I mean that's the kind of thing I love at lens is the second that happened the and
[6380.48 → 6388.30] you could just hear oh yeah just all over the room like you can't oh there's playing online yeah it's
[6388.30 → 6394.22] fine I guess right you don't get the same uh, but it's not the same response and stuff like there's
[6394.22 → 6400.94] nothing better than duelling someone finishing them off with a headshot and being like ah like
[6400.94 → 6409.20] the first round Linus and I were like fighting overkills uh and then event one I thought it was me
[6409.20 → 6414.68] it was oh no I won the second yeah not even close the first one you were even close I stopped going
[6414.68 → 6419.80] for kills because I started realizing no one is ever going to win the game and I followed suit because
[6419.80 → 6426.84] their team got way more organized yeah because it was like the respawn timer what I think the
[6426.84 → 6432.48] the shortest respawn timer is like five seconds, and then you have eight people and the flag return is
[6432.48 → 6439.02] instant if you touch it, it's just gone so actually getting one of the flags out is really hard um but
[6439.02 → 6444.72] that's just I mean one of the teams pulled it off just saying I mean one of the teams had a
[6444.72 → 6453.12] commander who was able to i did make some SUS calls here and then your four warthog push thing was
[6453.12 → 6460.10] never gonna work by the way um it's fair we had like beautiful strategies for that um yeah
[6460.10 → 6466.24] sneaky boy warthog though we also did sneaky boy with like the spring bounce if that's one thing that i
[6466.24 → 6472.08] think my people not people might not know is there was like grenades and stuff under that hog if it stayed
[6472.08 → 6478.28] on the ground it was dead the fact that it got ran into and did a perfect flip in the air and landed
[6478.28 → 6486.20] with like still having momentum like what was amazing um it's actually such a cool clip I seriously doubt
[6486.20 → 6490.68] there are clips that have like the exact same series of events oh, and it's an ancient game that people
[6490.68 → 6496.00] played a ton so that's super cool yeah it was awesome man yeah that was really sick
[6496.00 → 6505.48] love land gaming although I think my favourite moment was when I hoodwinked literally everyone
[6505.48 → 6512.48] at the entire event including me and I was sitting right next to it in the minor VGA competition
[6512.48 → 6520.90] okay minor VGA pretty tough game pretty unforgiving game all right we gave people what was it 10 or 15
[6520.90 → 6526.32] minutes yeah it wasn't that much to accumulate as much money in their bank account as possible
[6526.32 → 6532.44] and at the end of it I was like yeah there's no way that anyone's going to beat me at minor VGA
[6532.44 → 6540.46] and we actually had someone who did shockingly well like they had what like 5 000 a lot like a lot like
[6540.46 → 6545.36] far and away more than anyone else did they win a gaming pc I think so I think so yeah they won
[6545.36 → 6553.54] absolutely wild prize but anyway sick gaming pc too before I admitted that they won it
[6553.54 → 6564.28] i um I went back to my machine I was like I'm going to win this one and I managed 15 000 15 000
[6564.28 → 6570.94] that's nearly end game for minor VGA I had like all the items I had the four leaf clover I had the
[6570.94 → 6576.62] wedding ring I had the condom okay I had everything that is an item that is an item in the game
[6576.62 → 6581.74] okay gotta get the condom okay play it save you know what I'm saying yeah uh so I had the condom
[6581.74 → 6588.76] and uh you know everyone Luke included I was like Luke did I cheat he looks over at my computer he's like
[6588.76 → 6595.12] well not only that i I was playing next to him part way through I'm like man this is really hard
[6595.12 → 6598.78] because I've never really played before because I knew it was coming but I didn't like practice or
[6598.78 → 6603.72] anything um and I was like losing money and I thought I was doing the right strategy but i
[6603.72 → 6610.64] wasn't Linus told me how to play after that uh but I glance over, and he has this amount of money
[6610.64 → 6616.38] and he's like basically given up and I was like what you have whatever the thing that convinced me
[6616.38 → 6623.10] about it was that you didn't seem to care which was really I was very smart because you just kind of
[6623.10 → 6629.68] shrugged it off, and you're like yeah no one's going to beat me and I was like okay all right sounds
[6629.68 → 6633.70] good so I was convinced because I was sitting right next to him never saw him open the VM because I was
[6633.70 → 6640.38] focused on trying to learn the game but so I had a game that I had already played for like two hours
[6640.38 → 6646.16] because I was ripping footage for the upcoming channel super fun where Colton and Dennis uh attempt to hide in
[6646.16 → 6653.42] my house again um and the way that the downloader works from the ubiquity UI is that you it breaks up
[6653.42 → 6662.40] the files, and you can only confirm the save location of the file once each one is done, and so I was just
[6662.40 → 6667.06] stuck sitting at my computer confirming downloads because it's like 200 files or something stupid
[6667.06 → 6670.82] like that for all the different cameras and all the time span that we had to record them for
[6670.82 → 6677.64] so I was like ah screw it I'll, I'll play minor VGA in the other tab so then what I did was I left my
[6677.64 → 6684.48] computer in a state where I would land on minor VGA in kind of believable scenario so I went down
[6684.48 → 6691.36] sat at my computer like started one fresh, and then it was like team viewer hide interface
[6691.36 → 6694.02] okay yeah yeah I'm doing good
[6694.02 → 6701.76] and I even had Luke check my computer when I was like yeah I did way better he's like no it's legit
[6701.76 → 6707.04] it's legit I'm like are you sure he's like yeah it's legit I didn't notice there was the
[6707.04 → 6711.86] little like because it was a full screen and stuff there's just the little tiny drop down thing at the
[6711.86 → 6716.98] top and uh I think there was like a mic in the way or something someone on the other side of the table
[6716.98 → 6721.54] was like no it's there and I had to lean around to be able to see if it was awesome yeah
[6721.54 → 6729.22] oh boy I had so much fun with that the winner of space cadet table played on a steam deck
[6729.22 → 6736.16] yeah that's actually pretty cool that was hilarious there was the counterstrike tournament which i
[6736.16 → 6741.44] enjoyed because usually at most lands that I've been to that there is a counterstrike tournament
[6741.44 → 6751.12] some like local team will show up, and it's just like not even remotely close but all the like
[6751.12 → 6756.60] quarter semi and actual final every single one of them was down to the wire that's which was really
[6756.60 → 6761.94] cool and like that's super cool that was actually sweet it like actually felt like a real
[6761.94 → 6766.60] tournament despite being kind of the opposite because it was mostly just a bunch of random but
[6766.60 → 6771.90] it wasn't like just a complete slaughter by like one pro team or something like that's so important
[6771.90 → 6780.18] for fun I would rather have lost that halo match than won it easily yeah like just a close game is
[6780.18 → 6787.20] so much better than a blowout no matter which side you're on yeah the multi like flash game style
[6787.20 → 6793.38] tournament thing was really cool I'm very happy that it culminated with Nichols because Nichols is such a
[6793.38 → 6800.12] cool like 1v1 like oh yeah stressor type of game oh yeah so having it end with Nichols was awesome
[6800.12 → 6807.76] the fact that I got robot unicorn attack in there was cool um yeah yeah yeah we had some good space
[6807.76 → 6812.42] cadet table players there I thought I was pretty good I played a lot when I was a kid but I was not
[6812.42 → 6816.64] even close in fairness to me though you saw how leggy it was running on my machine mine was I don't
[6816.64 → 6821.12] know what was up it was pretty brutal I could barely even shoot a new ball like it was totally
[6821.12 → 6822.62] totally glitched out
[6822.62 → 6827.32] but yeah yeah land was perfect
[6827.32 → 6834.82] all right why don't we uh jump into another topic uh what else did we say we would talk about
[6834.82 → 6839.56] when did we start the show I don't know oh how long have we been streaming that's what I was wondering
[6839.56 → 6844.00] it's eight it's about two and a half hours' oh we should probably call it at some point jeez we
[6844.00 → 6849.70] have we've hardly even touched the merch messages um there's just been a lot I don't know if the rest of
[6849.70 → 6854.40] the topics are like all that well I definitely want to talk about how there are now two google meets
[6854.40 → 6860.82] okay yeah I heard about this and my eyes rolled into the back of my head and I moved on because i
[6860.82 → 6866.60] didn't even want to know what was happening so yeah what is it um google now has two
[6866.60 → 6873.18] two google meets it's not enough for them to have competing video chat products internally
[6873.18 → 6881.56] now they actually have the same name even though they're different programs in fairness
[6881.56 → 6888.18] Microsoft I think was the first to this innovation with their multiple versions of Skype and now
[6888.18 → 6893.08] multiple versions of teams wasn't okay hold on wasn't it skype for business
[6893.08 → 6898.30] uh yeah but still that's clear enough no just log in with a business
[6898.30 → 6906.24] login freaking account and have business features you idiots no I know you don't have Skype for
[6906.24 → 6912.60] business and skype I think there are different ways that it's like actually built well then pick the
[6912.60 → 6918.18] one that's good and use that one yeah it's probably more expensive I mean it's like wow back when they
[6918.18 → 6923.90] used to have two separate freaking kernels for their operating system the good one for business and the
[6923.90 → 6930.14] crap one for home so to get rid of the crap one that one's less defensive obviously
[6930.14 → 6938.68] obviously who's in charge skype for business was link yeah and i in my opinion that was a better name
[6938.68 → 6945.40] to be honest sorry I get kind of angry about this kind of crap so tell me about the two meets all right
[6945.40 → 6950.68] um google meet was originally launched as a zoom like video communication successor to hangouts which
[6950.68 → 6956.82] hilariously still exists the fact that all the video like video to video communication companies
[6956.82 → 6965.68] allowed zoom to like to become what it is pathetic I'm sorry yeah, but it is from January to April 2020
[6965.68 → 6971.78] meets user count grew by a factor of 30 with roughly a hundred million users per day Google Duo was
[6971.78 → 6977.78] launched earlier as a one-to-one and group call app meant for a firm for smaller scale use think FaceTime
[6977.78 → 6987.90] skype or discord if it's scalable then use it if it's not scalable then put it on the shelf goodbye
[6987.90 → 6996.24] why do you need a good scalable one and a crap not scalable sorry, sorry okay as the pandemic went on
[6996.24 → 7003.20] the need for both styles of communication grew and so did the apps as a result duo as the smaller service
[7003.20 → 7009.04] has been rebranded meat and will receive the features from both apps and meat is still meat
[7009.04 → 7017.94] so we have two meats um so what's not even like a business they're both business or consumer so meat
[7017.94 → 7026.88] is compatible with both duo and meat, but meat is compatible only with meat eventually the old meat app
[7026.88 → 7032.20] will be phased out in favour of the duo app with meat functionality which is now being called meat
[7032.20 → 7038.20] this is horrible how did this stuff happen
[7038.20 → 7049.94] users of duo don't have to do anything the app was updated automatically with meat support last month
[7049.94 → 7056.54] it has icon changed earlier this week and I'm assuming its name want to see something that makes me really
[7056.54 → 7064.62] angry as someone who used hangouts as our internal business chat as part of g suite for so long than
[7064.62 → 7071.66] switched off of it first to slack which we had issues with was it slack i I wasn't a part of that I think
[7071.66 → 7076.62] it was slack first to slack then to teams both of which we've had numerous issues with hangouts
[7076.62 → 7082.40] for all its warts and all its simplicity did mostly just work um and was convenient because it was
[7082.40 → 7089.28] always open in your Gmail tab always okay so every time I see this I get irrationally angry because
[7089.28 → 7095.52] they told me hangouts is going away so we like rush migrated off of it now when you go to share something
[7095.52 → 7105.68] in android, and you click Gmail it freaking prompts you Gmail or chat no, no no Gmail you told me chat which
[7105.68 → 7109.68] is what hangouts is now and the one that's built into you, you know you told me it was going away
[7110.88 → 7118.48] I believed you that's what I get for believing anything you say when I click Gmail I mean an email
[7119.12 → 7124.96] that's what I mean don't make me press more don't make me press more buttons and the hilarious thing
[7124.96 → 7130.48] is that oh okay it doesn't it doesn't right now so I'm not sure why but there used to be
[7130.48 → 7136.08] a chat oh this is chat this is different chat no, no that's because that's there's a standalone chat
[7136.08 → 7144.48] app aside from chat built into the Gmail app how are they so bad at this, so bell said that the
[7144.48 → 7149.20] meat app on his phone is now named meat and then original in brackets
[7151.28 → 7154.96] yeah just updated one day on my iPhone I was like what is this long name that is
[7154.96 → 7167.36] meat original funny yeah mine is that too what the heck wow crazy all right let's talk merch messages
[7167.36 → 7173.60] i have to I got a lab to pay for read me merch messages wow from Calvin hi I've been following
[7173.60 → 7180.64] your coverage on the use of HDR video very closely any updates on LC HDR in the future we did one we did
[7180.64 → 7189.36] one recently the uh the video on glossy monitors on the eve excuse me doe spectrum uh is in HDR so if
[7189.36 → 7194.40] you watch it on a HDR compatible display with HDR enabled you will experience it in HDR and for
[7194.40 → 7200.88] videos about displays in particular if it is a huge difference maker it really helps you to better see
[7201.52 → 7207.84] through the screen the differences between two different experiences it's more true to life
[7210.64 → 7217.12] from Milton oh hold on i I saw a little bit more to that merch message and yes we've learned a lot
[7217.60 → 7224.00] um we are working closely with adobe and with YouTube there seems to I don't know if I can take credit for
[7224.00 → 7232.08] it but there seems to be a fire lit in the online video streaming industry um to better support HDR and
[7232.08 → 7240.88] I'm really excited for it, we we are moving slowly but surely toward HDR particularly on LTT
[7240.88 → 7244.32] there have been two to three videos someone in flow plane chat said there have been two to three HDR
[7244.32 → 7251.76] videos on flow plane there has been um but I will admit they're quite the pain to get going
[7252.32 → 7259.60] um, and we do need to update our stiffs so that it can be done better fortunately the king has returned
[7259.60 → 7266.88] yeah well that we're not yeah yeah that's all I'm saying yeah float plane people will know sure has
[7268.24 → 7271.84] I had a wonderful day me too
[7274.08 → 7278.32] actually my day was pretty chaotic, but that was a good that was a high point a good moment yeah
[7280.32 → 7285.36] uh from Milton hi Luke and Linus long time fan I wanted to ask what you think of smartwatches are they
[7285.36 → 7290.24] a fad that have run their course where they become a ubiquitous gadget on everyone's wrist
[7290.24 → 7298.08] or remain a niche product like I feel they are now I really want them to be good but I give up so I'm
[7298.08 → 7304.40] just using uh the tithings you know one that is a clock and lasts for a month and I guess there's like
[7304.40 → 7311.20] some heart recording stuff but I don't really care about any of that I have always done really, really bad
[7311.20 → 7318.80] with any accessories that you wear uh if they're glasses I will lose them or drop them or step on
[7318.80 → 7327.44] them um is that why you don't wear glasses yeah oh that's sort of sad yeah I'm not even kidding i
[7327.44 → 7333.52] have a pair of glasses don't you have a close uh a close associate who literally works in the glasses
[7333.52 → 7338.80] industry and that's why I have two I have sunglasses and I have those mm-hmm the sunglasses you don't wear
[7338.80 → 7344.72] them never leave my car ideally because if they do, they will be gone because you know how
[7344.72 → 7348.72] I like if I leave your house what percentage chance would you say that I have to come back to get my
[7348.72 → 7356.48] keys oh yeah yeah yeah just there's no number it's just yeah yeah yeah so like i that type of stuff if
[7356.48 → 7363.12] it's a ring if it's a watch if it's glasses if it's a necklace it's gone and I just like know that about
[7363.12 → 7369.28] myself so I don't wear any of it um and that's it so like i I think they're cool they're just it's not
[7369.28 → 7373.92] for me, I would go with something like that where it's relatively simple and toned down because i
[7373.92 → 7377.68] honestly wouldn't want to like daily charge a watch that would just be very annoying to me
[7378.96 → 7383.76] yeah it's all about battery life I wear the fossil hybrid hr for the same reason I get steps and basic
[7383.76 → 7388.88] stuff for two weeks and that's better than charging an Apple Watch every day yeah that's pretty good yeah
[7388.88 → 7395.92] uh from Sal question for Luke you mentioned did freelance it work before fully committing to Ltd
[7395.92 → 7397.60] what did you do to find work to make it possible
[7401.12 → 7401.36] um
[7405.12 → 7409.92] this isn't entirely above board but I haven't worked there in forever so whatever uh back when I used to
[7409.92 → 7414.88] work for geek squad there were customers that would come in that would want things that are services
[7414.88 → 7420.40] that geek squad could not provide um so in those cases I would potentially step in
[7421.12 → 7427.68] that is how I got one of my clients um that's pretty one of my main ones it was stuff that they
[7427.68 → 7432.56] literally didn't do yeah you're just like not really supposed to do that no for sure yeah for sure yep
[7434.40 → 7439.76] I was very young with that and extremely poor so that's i did what I did I mean at least you
[7439.76 → 7448.56] didn't steal toilet paper for like a long time um but yeah like I there was one guy who
[7448.56 → 7453.28] needed server work done like on location like this is not something that geeks wad would ever do
[7453.28 → 7458.08] they'd never touch that no like i I only did stuff where it would never be something that they would
[7458.08 → 7464.24] do um and then that got me some other jobs because he was a business person who talked to other
[7464.24 → 7468.00] business people that had the same problem and then blah blah blah blah blah and it just kind of
[7468.00 → 7476.00] grew from there grew from there um, um getting late some yeah something that you can do though
[7476.00 → 7481.36] is just like go talk to businesses fine I've talked a few times about how like notaries and law offices and
[7481.92 → 7488.88] and uh medical practices and stuff like that they need very good uh data storage and security yep it
[7488.88 → 7494.64] needs to be extremely reliable etc be good so that you're not screwing them over because there is liability
[7494.64 → 7500.64] um but yeah then just go walk into places and be like what is your solution like do you need a
[7500.64 → 7506.56] better one etc this is great, and then he graduated to grossly misrepresenting his qualifications on his
[7506.56 → 7510.88] LTT application love it all right what's next
[7513.36 → 7519.68] uh next one we have here it's from uh radioactive twinkle hello as pc enthusiasts and gamers do either
[7519.68 → 7525.28] you do routine wrist exercises to keep your wrist limber and to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel
[7526.48 → 7536.88] um I play badminton which involves a lot of uh squeezing and like these motions
[7536.88 → 7545.44] squeezing motions so i probably unintentionally do a ton of wrist exercise but no I don't go out of my way to
[7545.44 → 7550.56] to do it uh when I was rehabbing a problem that I was having with my arm I spent a lot of time with
[7550.56 → 7557.36] the Powerball um like a gyro ball and that worked really great for me but other than that no i
[7557.36 → 7563.44] can't say that I do uh nope never been even remotely a problem with me though um
[7563.44 → 7572.88] if I use a mouse that does is not compatible with my grip um I'll get like ice like shooting
[7572.88 → 7579.84] feelings through my wrist um, but it hasn't been a problem with the corsair m40 or 45 or whatever that
[7579.84 → 7583.76] one that I used for so long was, and it hasn't been a problem with the g pro wireless so I'm pretty happy
[7583.76 → 7589.36] with where I'm at for that right now yeah I don't know I've never had anything like that my wrists are
[7589.36 → 7597.76] kind of huge I don't know if that like helps at all but yeah question here from Alex a few years ago
[7597.76 → 7602.72] I managed to make my hard drive burst into flames despite having built multi multiple computers at
[7602.72 → 7607.44] that point I'd never heard or assumed that PSU SATA cables were not cross compatible do you have any
[7607.44 → 7616.48] other explosive stories I'd say my best story just like lighting something on fire was probably
[7616.48 → 7625.04] oh I mean I had one recently actually okay I got a couple never mind i I tried to install a PCI card
[7625.76 → 7631.68] oh man no i oh man I don't remember any more exactly what I tried to do I wrote this out on the forum
[7631.68 → 7636.48] like back in the early probably nine years ago on the forum so I might tell the story wrong but
[7636.48 → 7647.92] in a nutshell I tried to install a PCI card into an uh oh no I remember okay I there was a PCI card
[7647.92 → 7654.88] that had some kind of four pin header on it, and probably it was for something to like some kind
[7654.88 → 7662.64] of breakout cable or something like that I mistook it for a four pin floppy female connector for like
[7662.64 → 7670.16] auxiliary power for the card so I plugged it in powered on the system and promptly released the
[7670.16 → 7675.68] magic smoke that was inside that card that made it work um I had a buddy who sorry I thought you're
[7675.68 → 7681.84] done no, no go ahead I had a buddy who was uh fairly aggressively overclocking a computer and shot some
[7681.84 → 7685.92] blue flames out of the back of the power supply I like it but I have never
[7685.92 → 7694.72] I think been in that scenario I managed to scorch the back of a motherboard just uh just a couple
[7694.72 → 7704.40] weeks ago nice yeah i uh was helping the neighbour build their pc and uh young neighbour and um
[7704.40 → 7710.16] one of my son's friends and I wasn't paying close enough attention this is at least partially on me
[7710.16 → 7717.12] and he was trying to put it into the back of the Io shield spot and dragging it around on the
[7717.12 → 7725.20] standoffs knocked a couple caps off the back so I made a clumsy attempt at putting them back on
[7725.20 → 7730.24] knowing that it was probably dead anyway and whether it was the scratches to the traces around
[7730.24 → 7737.04] it or whether it was something else you know when you hear that sound yeah it's bad
[7737.04 → 7744.08] yeah so that was pretty recent yeah i I haven't killed anything with like fire you know
[7744.08 → 7748.64] but I've I've bricked some stuff but I guess it doesn't fit in this story hit me
[7750.64 → 7755.84] from me sale excited to get my backpack hope have you guys thought about making wallets
[7758.00 → 7762.16] I'm a simple man I like to put my stuff in my wallet
[7762.16 → 7769.92] I feel like I just don't really I don't demand much of a wallet I use this I use this homemade
[7769.92 → 7777.52] one from Yvonne and i I'm sure there are wallet connoisseurs out there who would ask for
[7777.52 → 7785.52] so much more performance from their wallet than I do but for me, it's just like speeds and feeds yeah can I
[7785.52 → 7793.92] can I reach the card can i flash my identification I've had all right then wallet
[7793.92 → 7802.16] ever since we went to Germany for um the cherry tour oh wow that's a long time i I bought a wallet
[7802.16 → 7807.20] while I was there because mine like literally fell apart I'm exactly the same one I've only ever owned
[7807.20 → 7813.76] three wallets in my entire life I have probably similar to me used all of them until they disintegrated
[7814.56 → 7820.96] and then I have gotten a new one that is as simple and usually a gift actually i yeah I think two of
[7820.96 → 7826.48] them were gifts so I've gotten whatever simple basic black men's leather wallet has been handed to me
[7826.48 → 7836.16] nice yeah that's how I roll from sergeant Kilgore great name uh do you guys think modular phones will
[7836.16 → 7842.48] ever make a comeback also do you have any opinions on tubers man I had a tuber conversation with the
[7842.48 → 7847.52] whales at the whale land when I was doing the studio tour where I was basically saying you know I'm I'm
[7847.52 → 7854.00] getting too old for this I'm getting too old to be the frontman of this band and um they kind
[7854.00 → 7861.92] of laughed right and I was like no like for real I'm going to be 40 like in a few years I'm I'm going to be
[7861.92 → 7869.76] not young and cool at all I mean I was never cool but I won't be young either and you know I think the
[7869.76 → 7875.12] next generation of tech enthusiasts are going to want a face that looks more like theirs to tell them
[7875.12 → 7881.04] about their you know their tech purchases or whatever else like we have to i I have to realize
[7881.04 → 7888.08] that there's a shelf life how many YouTubers can you name who are over 50 yeah not many they
[7888.08 → 7893.04] definitely exist but not many part of that's because the platforms age itself sure right
[7893.04 → 7899.44] but then that's where I was going next how many prominent TikTokers are over 40 yeah right
[7899.44 → 7904.32] so there's going to be new platforms there's going to be new ways that the younger generation prefers
[7904.32 → 7910.64] to communicate and I am not necessarily going to understand it I'm not necessarily going to be there so
[7910.64 → 7919.20] uh one of the one of the solutions to aging out of your media platform is going digital right
[7919.20 → 7924.00] and I think a perfect example of this is Ryan's toy reviews Ryan's toy reviews started as a cute
[7924.00 → 7930.32] little kid unboxing toys right but obviously uh his parents who seem to manage that particular media
[7930.32 → 7936.24] empire recognized very early on that their son wasn't going to be five forever right, and so they built
[7936.24 → 7944.16] up a team of animators and writers, and they built out content around Ryan's persona around Ryan as a
[7944.16 → 7949.68] character right um and part of that is just making sure that he wasn't being exploited right that he wasn't
[7949.68 → 7956.16] working 60 hours a week making YouTube videos uh but part of it is the longevity and so
[7957.68 → 7963.84] um red and link it's yeah it's a viable strategy, and you know I could just pursue cosmetic surgery
[7963.84 → 7967.12] right you know try and look young for as long as possible try and stay limber
[7969.12 → 7972.80] but that's going to run out at some point I've got a lot of people relying on me so it's definitely
[7972.80 → 7977.20] something that I've considered like would you watch an animated review of something I don't see why not
[7977.20 → 7983.28] i I think and I've kind of always thought this that and i know i know but I think you put too
[7983.28 → 7991.60] much stock into it, I think uh if it was a piece of technology that was like totally out of your
[7991.60 → 7997.76] realm sure but I don't think you lose legitimacy with like phones VR tech and computers just because
[7997.76 → 8003.60] you get old sure that is something from our generation yes, but there will be things that
[8003.60 → 8008.08] are not from our generation like I don't have a ton of interest in things like smart speakers because
[8008.08 → 8014.32] I just grew up without them and I don't care about them, and so i I think that whether it's whether
[8014.32 → 8021.60] it's just the face like I okay so I won't look like someone who knows about whatever that new thing
[8021.60 → 8029.04] is and people do they do generalize they do stereotype right so i just I think it's something
[8029.04 → 8033.84] to be aware of we've had people in chat bring up adam savage is a great example of
[8033.84 → 8042.24] someone who has transcended you know generational gaps right I think Adam savage is cool pretty much
[8042.24 → 8047.04] across the board but maybe that's the millennial in me talking maybe Adam savage isn't cool to young
[8047.04 → 8053.04] people i I wouldn't know because I think he's cool so yeah I don't know Bixby says I see old
[8053.04 → 8057.20] man tech wizard is more legitimate sure but how many of them do you actually watch every day
[8058.08 → 8062.48] I just don't think there are that many sure there are I mean you could watch uh you could watch get
[8062.48 → 8068.48] connected uh does he even still make videos you could watch Rodney Reynolds
[8068.48 → 8073.20] I feel like I can hear hi I'm Rodney Reynolds in my brain
[8076.32 → 8079.28] does Leo Lahore still make content I believe so
[8082.80 → 8091.76] get connected I can't find out here uh Leo Lahore podcasts like yeah I think so eight days ago well
[8091.76 → 8097.44] you guys gotta make more content there you go yeah see look Pixel Buds pro you can hear about pixel
[8097.44 → 8102.72] buds pro from uh from mike right like it's its one of those things I think this is someone else
[8102.72 → 8112.32] now what oh hold on we got a mr that's a that's a face that we recognize yeah okay so they've hired a
[8112.32 → 8118.96] host yeah i he's definitely still has some of it I know that okay I looked at it not that long ago
[8118.96 → 8125.76] so you know i it's its tough it's something that I think about a fair bit um float plane says I should
[8125.76 → 8134.72] get the Tom Cruise package yeah i i I was watching top gun with uh with Yvonne um I remember it being
[8134.72 → 8139.92] a lot cooler when I was a kid it's the original yeah it's like pretty hard to watch actually anyway
[8140.80 → 8146.96] and I was looking at the other people in that movie whether it's Val Kilmer or whether it's um
[8148.64 → 8154.88] is it hold on a second no no robin Wright played the princess in the princess pride which I had no idea
[8154.88 → 8158.88] because when I was a kid I didn't care about like who the cast was or whatever I was so I was I saw
[8158.88 → 8168.24] that in like my Plex no way that was robin Wright anyway um uh really yeah she plays jenny and Forrest
[8168.24 → 8177.20] jump she plays the wife in house of cards okay, okay well anyway uh Meg Ryan's in top gun and so
[8177.20 → 8187.36] you look at like you look at everyone else in top gun literally okay 35 years later right
[8188.72 → 8196.08] none of them have aged anywhere close to as well as Tom Cruise so yeah whoever's doing his work man
[8196.80 → 8203.76] gotta get me some of that for realties it's menu dude for realties he's making it happen keeping him
[8203.76 → 8211.44] young all right what else we got uh from mark with the steady progression of human enhancement tech
[8211.44 → 8215.68] what would be your line for what is too much to replace would you get a RFID implant or digital
[8215.68 → 8222.32] eyeball or something else oh I'm down as long as it's like probably pretty safe and or I have like
[8222.32 → 8228.88] nothing to lose like if i lost my hearing I'd be first in line for a cochlear implant like let's go
[8228.88 → 8239.28] if you guys start getting into biohacking I'm in dude yeah I'm in next question here for Luke from
[8239.28 → 8244.96] Alex how do you and your engineers approach planning and roadmapping and how do you guys organize do you
[8244.96 → 8252.96] leverage scrum so the whole thing of like agile and scrum is almost i I've been paying attention to
[8252.96 → 8257.44] a lot of spaces a lot of people are kind of moving away from it it was very much the rage when we
[8257.44 → 8266.16] first started, and we've kind of landed on a bit of a weird mix which seems to be true for a lot of
[8266.16 → 8271.04] teams um I don't know for everybody and I'm sure people can be like well my team does what I know
[8271.04 → 8278.08] I'm not talking for everybody um, but our mix is that we do uh twice a week meeting so we have a meeting at
[8278.08 → 8282.96] the end of the week, and we have a meeting near the end of the week uh Monday and Thursday generally
[8282.96 → 8288.88] those meetings are supposed to be fast um they're not supposed to take a lot of time we've had
[8288.88 → 8294.32] those meetings that last less than five minutes um in total not per person they're they're supposed
[8294.32 → 8299.60] to be quick they're not supposed to take a lot of your day um and that's like the stand-up from
[8299.60 → 8306.80] the scrum mentality stuff that we do uh, but then we dive into kanban with uh like issue tracking and
[8306.80 → 8312.32] and task tracking boards um that people manage themselves and Ada Ada Ada uh planning and
[8312.32 → 8320.64] road mapping um planning as much as I can try uh often just has bombs dropped on it all the time
[8320.64 → 8325.36] and if people are in this space I think they probably have experienced the same thing whether
[8325.36 → 8329.84] that's Linus just randomly coming in and be like hey guys we're doing all these things now good luck i
[8329.84 → 8335.20] need it in a month um or if I don't usually give you a month uh yeah usually it's less than that um
[8336.16 → 8341.84] or if it's me doing effectively the same thing to be completely honest um because I'll, I'll be like
[8341.84 → 8346.72] oh wait this like creator wants this thing uh so you're halfway through that that's cool what if
[8346.72 → 8352.32] you worked on this thing now uh especially with a small team sometimes there can be staffing challenges
[8352.32 → 8357.68] and it's beyond our control like yeah they were going to do that, but they didn't so here we go
[8357.68 → 8362.80] you know, and it's not anyone's fault it just does still need to be the show must go on at the end of
[8362.80 → 8368.88] the day development is uh inconsistent progress that that is going to be a thing that you experience
[8368.88 → 8374.40] is inconsistent progress you'll have someone who will make absolute leaps and bounds in like two days
[8374.96 → 8380.40] and then they get stuck on something that like actually wasn't that difficult for like two weeks
[8380.40 → 8386.80] because they just happened to not approach it in the exact right way or see it from the exact right
[8386.80 → 8392.00] angle, and they spend a bunch of time trying like more difficult solutions than what it actually
[8392.00 → 8395.60] needed, and then they figure out that it's something simple whatever and that's going to happen and
[8395.60 → 8403.04] that's fine that just happens in this space a lot um this is hilarious sorry I'm just going to jump in
[8403.04 → 8407.52] this is from twitch chat Dido says it's easy to say we need to plan better and end up in an infinite
[8407.52 → 8411.68] loop of meetings discussing how to plan and never end up doing it yeah and a lot of times you just need to
[8411.68 → 8417.52] act so in in regard to architecting too like I don't know we do our best uh we try to figure
[8417.52 → 8422.00] out all the different components that are going to end up going into something but a lot of times
[8422.00 → 8428.64] Linus or me or someone else on the team it doesn't matter is going to change what we need to do because
[8428.64 → 8433.36] we'll learn something, or we'll experience something right we'll go oh this tool that's currently in
[8433.36 → 8438.64] development actually needs to work this way, or we'll get user feedback or that so like sometimes things are
[8438.64 → 8444.00] going to change so we architect the best that we can to try to set ourselves up for the best possible
[8444.00 → 8452.80] result but i never I think it's a fool's path to go into it assuming that uh it's not going to change
[8452.80 → 8457.60] sometimes potentially drastically hopefully that answered your question this is I could talk about
[8457.60 → 8465.04] this for a long time so that's that's the compressed version but yeah nice the last question we have here
[8465.04 → 8470.64] is from anon as a frequent phone switchers for smartphone reviews how do you manage to transition
[8470.64 → 8475.68] of data apps messages and contacts between your temporary daily drivers I haven't found a reliable
[8475.68 → 8484.72] oh it sucks that was one of the main reasons that i dailyed the note 9 for so long was that I just got
[8485.44 → 8491.28] tired of switching my daily driver actual daily driver phone all the time so what I would do is I would
[8491.28 → 8496.56] mostly sloppy transition over to whatever I was reviewing and I would just have my note 9 in my
[8496.56 → 8502.16] pocket for certain things like I just didn't want to move my off onto the one that I was reviewing or
[8502.16 → 8508.32] I didn't want to move my uh we chat was one that was really annoying like I lost my entire we chat history
[8508.32 → 8514.32] a couple of times because the process for backing it up and restoring it is like kind of arcane um
[8514.32 → 8520.56] um so yeah I'm sorry I don't really have like a perfect solution for you, it sucks, and it will always
[8520.56 → 8530.56] suck as far as I can tell it is what it is, and it is over thank you for tuning into the wan show yeah
[8530.56 → 8533.36] we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[8533.36 → 8541.60] bye
[8543.12 → 8543.68] sorry I didn't
[8547.92 → 8551.04] I didn't even I wasn't even like thinking it was probably done the show I took the time
[8551.04 → 8553.60] oh yeah yeah
