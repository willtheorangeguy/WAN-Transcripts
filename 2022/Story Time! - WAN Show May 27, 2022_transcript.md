[0.00 --> 6.36]  welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[6.36 --> 15.64]  some big topics amd is launching their ryzen 7000 cpus this fall and you know what okay luke i'm
[15.64 --> 21.12]  gonna give you the good topics for a change because you complained and it was very complaining
[21.12 --> 26.66]  so i don't want to i don't want i don't want you to feel complaining bring it up one time in 10
[26.66 --> 34.28]  years and it's very complaining anyways i fix it start selling steam deck parts calls out consoles
[34.28 --> 41.78]  get wrecked consoles um and twitter find 150 million dollars for misusing 2fa data 150 million
[41.78 --> 49.26]  also i will be explaining my incendiary tweet yesterday i had a very negative experience with
[49.26 --> 56.24]  one jazz co maker of smart home accessories so i'll be talking i mean really i guess i'll be catching
[56.24 --> 62.88]  you up luke on what exactly happened there and why i'm a lot more angry than just if i bought a
[62.88 --> 68.72]  product and it didn't work as i expected that's right wow it's gonna be a heck of a show today guys
[68.72 --> 73.60]  i'm gonna try really hard not to have any of it be a hot take though okay it's all gonna be very
[73.60 --> 79.62]  reasonable and grounded so you have don't you have literally a topic that is a hot take uh yes i guess
[79.62 --> 84.90]  it comes down to what a hot take is but yeah yeah maybe a legitimate complaint isn't a hot take
[84.90 --> 88.26]  exactly good yeah and you know what else isn't the intro boom
[88.26 --> 117.10]  show is brought to you today by vulture axiom and secret labs all right why don't we jump right
[117.10 --> 122.06]  into our headline topic today i don't remember what it is what did we put in the title title
[123.74 --> 134.30]  uh you're ten thousand dollars ah yes okay luke here's the problem yes when i set out to smartify
[134.30 --> 140.86]  my house honestly i don't even know why i did it it was it was partly morbid curiosity because i think
[140.86 --> 146.22]  you and i have talked about this fairly extensively in the past i'm not that huge into the home automation
[146.22 --> 154.38]  thing i never have been i am a a young able-bodied young man and i i don't mind getting up and pressing
[154.38 --> 159.58]  a light switch and that's always really the way that i felt about it but yeah i figured okay we're
[159.58 --> 164.78]  moving into this new place we're ripping off a ton of the drywall anyway i don't know if i've told this
[164.78 --> 170.78]  story publicly but we found this um shoot you would your dad would know for sure but there's a there's a
[170.78 --> 177.34]  kind of there's a kind of in wall uh plumbing piping that's really terrible but that was used extensively
[177.34 --> 183.58]  in the 90s oh yeah he's he's for sure told me but i'm not gonna remember the name basically you find it
[183.58 --> 188.94]  in your house you rip it out you replace it there's no other way to go about it because it's not a matter
[188.94 --> 194.46]  of if it will fail it's a matter of when it will fail so we ended up peeling back a lot more of the
[194.46 --> 199.42]  drywall and a lot more of the ceilings than we had originally intended because polly b polly b thank you
[199.42 --> 204.70]  twitch chat oh there we go because we had to pull all of that stuff out of the house and there's
[204.70 --> 213.42]  bathrooms everywhere so once that was done i kind of went well shoot this was originally built back in
[213.42 --> 221.74]  the mid 90s it is now the early 2020s by the time i'm done with it it will be i don't know the 2040s the
[221.74 --> 229.02]  2050s the 2060s god willing when it comes to resell this place if it is not wired up for
[229.02 --> 234.06]  smart home a smart home is just going to be a home by that point if things keep going according
[234.06 --> 239.18]  to the trajectory they're on right now so this is the opportunity to put this stuff in and do it in
[239.18 --> 244.70]  a way that is clean and professional instead of just you know little little nail on cable management
[244.70 --> 252.62]  things all all over the house so fine let's go ahead let's freaking let's wire it up then and part of
[252.62 --> 259.42]  that was figuring out light switches now there's a wide variety of different smart light switches
[259.42 --> 267.42]  and they all come with some kind of of terrible deal-breaking problem pretty much whether it's
[267.42 --> 274.14]  the outrageous cost or the super closed ecosystem in some cases i mean insteon that's the one that
[274.14 --> 280.22]  shut down outright right that gives you an example of how bad it can be if there's a hyper-closed
[280.22 --> 287.42]  ecosystem associated with this particular light switch uh lutron i tried so hard i tried so hard
[287.42 --> 292.94]  to like their switches i bought a caseta i don't even know how to pronounce it but i bought one of
[292.94 --> 296.78]  their switches a while back i installed their stupid little hub that you need with it
[298.86 --> 307.18]  and the second i walked into the room and wanted to use it manually i was like nope pulled it out no
[307.18 --> 314.54]  tactile feedback on it whatsoever and the switches themselves are like like like pennies bad not tens
[314.54 --> 321.26]  of pennies bad pennies bad like it felt like it felt like pushing down on like rotting food or something
[321.26 --> 329.42]  like it had it had no it had no like click whatsoever uh yeah we've got we've got the chat talking about
[329.42 --> 334.70]  this like yeah i i get it i get it from uh from a smart control standpoint they might be all right anyway
[334.70 --> 341.26]  i came across this one from ge or so i thought i i will get more into that later i came across this
[341.26 --> 347.26]  one from ge that i really liked okay it has you know if you're reaching around a corner given you
[347.26 --> 352.86]  know given the room they'll reach around it's easy to tell which part of the button is up which part is
[352.86 --> 358.54]  down it works like a dimmer switch i would how i would expect it to work you press and hold for dim up
[358.54 --> 364.78]  press and hold to go down you know i'm a i'm a 90s boy had my cd walkman all right you press and hold
[364.78 --> 371.10]  track skip to fast forward instead all right so it was intuitive to control for me and what i really
[371.10 --> 378.14]  liked about it was that every single switch for a nominal increase in cost has a motion sensor in it
[378.78 --> 384.78]  what's cool about that is that while motion sensing is not a perfect way to handle presence detection
[384.78 --> 391.26]  it certainly is an additional data point and if you've got these motion sensors all over all over
[391.26 --> 397.90]  your house well all of a sudden you've got a really cool bit of data to throw at what we're probably
[397.90 --> 402.86]  gonna we're probably gonna add to it with cameras but you've got a really cool data point to add to
[402.86 --> 408.94]  presence detection which can save you a freaking ton of money especially in the summer months when you
[408.94 --> 414.86]  don't need to be running air conditioning in rooms where there are not people that's the main concern
[414.86 --> 419.98]  is how can we make this place more efficient because if i blow five or ten i think it's somewhere
[419.98 --> 424.86]  between five and ten thousand dollars i spent on these freaking light switches but if i blow that money
[424.86 --> 433.26]  today over 10 years they could pay for themselves with a good implementation okay right okay so that's why
[433.26 --> 439.50]  i kind of went you know what sure let's do that and while we're at it heck let's do the blinds too
[439.50 --> 445.50]  because you throw in some temperature sensing and all of a sudden you can kind of go or you throw in weather data
[445.50 --> 451.66]  you can be like hey when it's too sunny close them or when it's in when it's the morning open them up
[451.66 --> 456.06]  so that you have a more natural waking experience or you know whatever like i want to try that stuff
[456.06 --> 461.98]  because part of being a tech personality is that i'm supposed to i'm supposed to try stuff and i'm
[461.98 --> 468.22]  supposed to have some kind of you know experience with it so this was my one shot my one opportunity
[469.66 --> 476.30]  now as it turns out these ge switches that i not only bought but also paid to have installed
[476.30 --> 481.42]  throughout the entire house which as you can imagine is not particularly cheap well they didn't work
[481.42 --> 488.78]  um there's a whole bunch we got them adopted they're z-wave devices we got them adopted in
[488.78 --> 493.10]  home assistant we could see all the different parameters lots of cool things you can adjust
[493.10 --> 499.34]  you can tell it hey you know have a longer delay to start sensing again uh once you're turned off so
[499.34 --> 503.18]  that like you can walk away from it without it just like turning on immediately oh yeah the default
[503.18 --> 509.90]  behavior does that so you've been to my house right how annoying is the default behavior it's it's it's a
[509.90 --> 517.02]  little annoying yeah i also like i'm not used to my house has like almost no smart stuff it's not a
[517.02 --> 521.90]  house it's a small apartment so i don't really need anything like there's no there's if i'm like oh
[521.90 --> 526.70]  i'm going to bed and i have to go turn off all the lights it's like darn that'll take me 15 seconds
[526.70 --> 532.78]  um so it doesn't really matter um but being in a room and having it just turn off on you like that
[532.78 --> 538.06]  happened to us the last time i was there actually we were standing around in the room like horsing
[538.06 --> 543.18]  around we were moving around a fair amount and the light still turned off um that's a little
[543.18 --> 550.78]  annoying yeah and the the really stupid thing about it is that the second you turn it off like it once
[550.78 --> 557.18]  it reaches off the motion sensor is active again so as you press you can press it walk away from it and
[557.82 --> 565.34]  it'll turn back on come on stop i actually wish for it to be dark now no problem though because these are
[565.34 --> 571.42]  all parameters that you can adjust you can change the ramp on and ramp off speed um so we were playing
[571.42 --> 576.78]  around with it and one of the one of the maybe not first things but one of the the first few things
[576.78 --> 582.62]  that jake and i wanted to adjust was turning off the motion sensor in places where it doesn't make
[582.62 --> 588.70]  sense because there could be areas where we want to use the motion sensor for presence detection but we
[588.70 --> 595.02]  don't necessarily want it to control the lights for example in a bathroom i might want the motion sensor
[595.02 --> 603.10]  to control the lights whereas in something like a oh i don't know a bedroom okay i don't want motion to
[603.10 --> 608.14]  turn on the lights i'm freaking sleeping unless i unless i set it on some kind of a schedule like
[608.14 --> 613.98]  i could create uh is this a sex thing that you what are you gesturing about
[613.98 --> 619.42]  i mean you're talking about motion turning on lights in a bedroom you you have to have set that
[619.42 --> 625.58]  up there's no way you didn't set that up i i i i actually was thinking about it completely from
[625.58 --> 633.02]  in practical terms okay practical yeah sure okay um i mean look speak for yourself but people like me
[633.02 --> 639.74]  we don't need the lights on okay in the bedroom you can find your way around my face might be all right
[639.74 --> 647.02]  but there's things you don't want to look at okay oh no oh no oh no okay so we tried to turn the motion
[647.02 --> 656.70]  sensor off it completely didn't work and i'm sorry i'm sorry home assistant team okay my immediate
[656.70 --> 664.38]  reaction was man bloody open source software bad product uh home assistant come on guys you got to get
[664.38 --> 669.58]  your act together i didn't say it but i did think it i thought it for a couple of seconds
[669.74 --> 675.66]  and so we we kind of we first tried to troubleshoot through home assistant okay do we need to apply
[675.66 --> 679.74]  the setting in a different way do we need to try it again does the switch then we thought does the
[679.74 --> 684.30]  switch need a little while for it to apply but then we went we had a different model of switch that's
[684.30 --> 690.06]  not a dimmer it's the same it looks identical it has the motion sensor but it's not a dimmer and that
[690.06 --> 694.06]  one worked fine we were able to disable the motion sensor we went oh hold on a second what's going on
[694.06 --> 700.38]  here so we checked the home assistant dashboard and the switches are running very different firmwares
[700.38 --> 705.34]  after some quick googling we realized the switches i just bought are running firmware from as far as we
[705.34 --> 714.38]  can tell four or five years ago and i'm sitting here going who ships a product like that i literally went
[714.38 --> 723.58]  to oneplus's factory like like oppo's factory and they showed me how it works when you apply software
[723.58 --> 729.50]  or firmware to your product on the way off the assembly line and there should be no reason why
[729.50 --> 736.14]  they can't just load a newer better image so that it ships with updated firmware so supposedly the newer
[736.14 --> 746.22]  firmware firmware have fixed this is not selling problem right so okay luke tell me you realize the
[746.22 --> 757.26]  firmware is out of date on your product what should you do update okay how i'm assuming because it's a
[757.26 --> 764.78]  smart home device you could you could ota over the air okay so because i'm using home assistant um which is
[764.78 --> 769.10]  like uh i don't do i don't do home automation stuff no that's fine no no no no no i'm just this is my
[769.10 --> 774.46]  this is my assumption it's all good that that could be that could be a valid way because i'm using uh
[774.46 --> 781.42]  because i'm using home assistant uh you can push an update through home assistant but it's it's not it's
[781.42 --> 788.94]  not just one ecosystem right like it's this it's an amazing amazing platform that ties in through like
[788.94 --> 797.66]  third party plugins and all kinds of cool stuff ties in like most smart ecosystems into one one cool uh
[797.66 --> 804.86]  one cool platform one one integrated platform um but what it what it needs me to do is it needs me to
[804.86 --> 810.14]  point it to a firmware file okay so i can click the device i can go into advanced update firmware and
[810.14 --> 818.94]  then it prompts me for a file so what's my next step then um you you get the file and you give it
[818.94 --> 825.66]  the file okay well i mean where should i get the file is this so this is firmware from jasko right
[825.66 --> 832.78]  i'm just kidding from jasko yeah well i would think so but oh did they not they don't download i went
[832.78 --> 839.82]  to jasko's website and the support section of their website okay let's just why don't we visit
[839.82 --> 847.26]  jasko together let's do it right now all together i'm trying to find it uh all right so let's uh let's
[847.26 --> 855.50]  go on a little what no not right now okay by jasko.com wait what why is there what what is by jasko.com
[855.50 --> 861.50]  why do you have by jasko.com as your ad and then jasko.com oh because jasko applied sciences is a
[861.50 --> 868.30]  completely different yeah it's it's by jasko okay by jasko.com okay so maybe i might click support
[869.02 --> 878.14]  does that seem like a pretty cool place to go faq resource library refund return policy contact us
[878.14 --> 884.30]  order support promotion details well resource library maybe right i mean come on let luke let's
[884.30 --> 890.78]  let's go through it together let's go through it together i i yeah i'm trying to uh the the interesting
[890.78 --> 896.22]  thing to me is google is auto-filling a lot of this so people are looking for this stuff right
[896.22 --> 901.58]  and are clearly unable to find it uh but yeah okay i'll go along specifically with you so so what i
[901.58 --> 908.54]  clicked on here was resource library yep okay um and then i scrolled down and found nothing interesting
[908.54 --> 919.50]  at all energy tips all right well what's our next what's our next uh what's our next path here what
[919.50 --> 925.74]  do we do at this point the next thing that i did was i i left the by jasko website and i just went to
[925.74 --> 930.70]  google and i because i was like whatever i don't know maybe it's weird navigation on their website maybe
[930.70 --> 936.94]  i don't know how to find it who knows so i just googled by jasko firmware download or firmware update i did
[936.94 --> 941.82]  both both of them auto-filled it knew both of them were things that people are going to look for
[941.82 --> 947.58]  yeah um and neither of them got me anywhere uh the the first page that came up was the support page
[947.58 --> 953.82]  because that's probably where most humans are going when they're looking for this thing um but
[953.82 --> 963.50]  there's clearly nothing there um they have an faq yep but it's like i don't know maybe i don't
[963.50 --> 970.06]  understand this so much but i expected there to be oh this is just an wait hold on so what exact
[970.06 --> 979.66]  product do you have uh it's a it's a ge and brighton dimming motion sensor switch so they don't have a
[979.66 --> 988.14]  section called like switches they have wi-fi z-wave yeah you could open up the z-wave faq sure sure i'm
[988.14 --> 996.22]  gonna open up the z-wave faq why not now let's control after firmware nope no nope nothing about
[996.22 --> 1003.74]  that nothing about that okay so then i mean so now i would get angry on twitter i don't know i went one
[1003.74 --> 1008.70]  step further i mean come on you can't go straight to being angry yeah no i i would i would email them
[1008.70 --> 1014.86]  or something i would have contact support well you know what good guy jasko um their their their number
[1014.86 --> 1020.86]  both their local and toll free are listed on their contact us page they have product support you can
[1020.86 --> 1028.38]  actually contact their product support both via phone and via live chat so we tried both of them okay
[1028.38 --> 1035.66]  and you know it seems like a pretty straightforward thing hi i have an outdated firmware i would like to
[1035.66 --> 1044.30]  get the updated firmware what pray tell mr lafreniere do you think was the response um what i hope was
[1044.30 --> 1048.54]  the response and what based on the information that i have i think was the response are very
[1048.54 --> 1056.62]  drastically different things um i'm expecting that the response was like there is no updated firmware or
[1057.50 --> 1062.86]  no response that's what i expect the response was really okay you're actually wrong on both counts
[1063.66 --> 1071.02]  nice there is updated firmware there is there is updated firmware from as recently as i believe earlier
[1071.02 --> 1078.78]  this month this product is absolutely still receiving updated firmware that as far as we can tell from
[1078.78 --> 1084.62]  the information we found online seems to resolve the exact issues that we're having with the product
[1086.30 --> 1091.74]  this sounds great sign me up oh yeah and we got responses both by phone i waited about 12 minutes on
[1091.74 --> 1100.62]  hold and via live chat so we got responses and there is new firmware so why am i mad is there no way to like
[1100.62 --> 1105.42]  upload it to the device oh no there's a way to upload it to the device it's through the home assistant
[1105.42 --> 1112.22]  interface very simple yeah you can up home assistant will allow you to update your z-wave device all you
[1112.22 --> 1118.70]  got to do is plunk the firmware file into the into the browse file explorer thing and it'll it'll upload it
[1118.70 --> 1125.42]  for you will it will it update the device oh yeah does it just store it okay so the new so the new
[1125.42 --> 1132.86]  firmware is on the device no no no no i well i i i don't have it oh they just told you that they
[1132.86 --> 1136.30]  have new firmware they didn't give it to you they no well why would they do that
[1139.10 --> 1139.50]  why
[1143.50 --> 1146.54]  what did they say did they say they just like wouldn't do it or like what
[1147.98 --> 1150.70]  how did this communication happen i don't understand
[1150.70 --> 1158.06]  what did this is so they immediately so they very not immediately but they very very quickly
[1158.06 --> 1163.18]  responded and told you that they do indeed have exactly what you need and it is digital and they
[1163.18 --> 1169.50]  can give it to you no problem but they won't but that's what they said why did what did they say why
[1169.50 --> 1173.98]  that firmware is proprietary we do not provide that firmware to end users
[1173.98 --> 1180.30]  oh my god
[1182.78 --> 1197.34]  oh so i want okay okay i want to have i i want to have a little a little fun here okay wow i'm so bothered
[1197.34 --> 1207.10]  right now it's not even me i'm so annoyed that's wow oh man okay i would like our audience members
[1207.10 --> 1213.26]  who are artistically inclined okay sorry sorry i should be muting i would like you guys to draw
[1213.26 --> 1218.62]  i i'm actually going to request fan art for i think the first time ever i would like you to draw for
[1218.62 --> 1226.54]  me the executive who made this decision that firmware cannot be provided to end users due to
[1226.54 --> 1232.70]  because it's proprietary i feel like i don't want to offend golfers but i feel like you should have
[1232.70 --> 1239.82]  them golfing while he says it i just i just want to see i just want to see i i want to see what what
[1239.82 --> 1246.78]  this story inspires you guys to come up with and so naturally i mean i have to confess i kind of lost it
[1246.78 --> 1253.58]  i i because i like i just yes i i don't i i have the same reactions as you except that i i'm out like
[1253.58 --> 1262.78]  10 grand plus installation piece so i'm my my anger is extremely extremely high right now and to be
[1262.78 --> 1269.74]  clear my anger is not just because i wasted money i've i've lost money i've lost lots more money than
[1269.74 --> 1276.70]  this running a business you make mistakes you lose money you screw things up right um you hire colton
[1276.70 --> 1281.58]  you have you have products that don't work the way that you expected them to i mean we lost a ton
[1281.58 --> 1286.86]  of money on those ursa 12k cameras you don't hear me putting black magic on blast because of it because
[1286.86 --> 1291.42]  at the end of the day we didn't do our due diligence validating it and that's you know that's that's our
[1291.42 --> 1296.86]  bad it just didn't end up being as good as we had hoped this is not that this is not a product
[1297.42 --> 1305.10]  not meeting my expectations so i'm in and yeah this is just a blatantly anti-consumer action
[1305.90 --> 1313.10]  having it be your policy your official actual policy to refuse to provide firmware updates okay so do you
[1313.10 --> 1323.10]  know how you're supposed to get them wow do you like mail it in or some through uh like a compatible
[1323.10 --> 1328.06]  i believe you actually can mail them in actually i don't want to rip them all out of my wall mail them
[1328.06 --> 1333.18]  in and then put them all back in my wall though that is not happening um especially when the real
[1333.18 --> 1338.46]  solution is so easy to provide me the firmware update so the way it actually works is that you are
[1338.46 --> 1346.86]  expected to go get a smart hub that is able to i don't know that jazzco maybe provides the firmware
[1346.86 --> 1355.02]  update too and then updates the switches for you but here's the thing since we shot the video we've
[1355.02 --> 1361.98]  actually done a little bit more work already on this step one is that there was literally nowhere
[1361.98 --> 1367.74]  within driving distance for me that i could go get a smart home hub and bring it back in order to try
[1367.74 --> 1375.26]  this so they're just they're not terribly accessible so really what this means is that probably from
[1375.26 --> 1381.82]  some integrator there's going to be some kind of hub that maybe and jasco would not guarantee this
[1381.82 --> 1389.58]  maybe would have newer firmwares that might help me but they i i i but they wouldn't guarantee it
[1389.58 --> 1394.70]  because they already shipped you a device that had firmware those four years of date so they don't know
[1394.70 --> 1400.06]  they wouldn't guarantee what version what version maybe maybe the hub's eight years out of date because
[1400.06 --> 1406.54]  here's the model here's the model the way what they basically embraced is the u.s telecommunications
[1406.54 --> 1414.14]  carrier model whereas the manufacturer of the device you write good software with new features i mean
[1414.14 --> 1418.14]  maybe it's not good i don't know i mean we've seen the level of incompetence here but you write software
[1418.14 --> 1424.30]  okay you write software that presumably is helpful otherwise you might you probably wouldn't bother writing it
[1424.30 --> 1435.10]  okay and then instead of sending it to the end user's device you willfully insert smart home controller
[1435.10 --> 1443.18]  hub manufacturers as the gatekeepers who get to decide whether you will or won't get updated firmware
[1443.18 --> 1453.74]  that has functionality fixes and new features and and making it even worse you willfully obstinately
[1454.38 --> 1460.46]  refuse to allow end users who by the way can buy your products i bought them off amazon like i didn't
[1460.46 --> 1466.22]  i didn't get it they didn't come from an integrator so these this is a product i can buy and that i can
[1466.22 --> 1472.62]  adopt in my z-wave with my aeotech z-wave stick and my home assistant controller which is running on a
[1472.62 --> 1479.82]  raspberry pi right now so i absolutely can get it and use it but i cannot update it i can't use it
[1479.82 --> 1487.10]  properly because you will not provide me the firmware update that i need in order for it to actually work
[1490.22 --> 1496.54]  how is this how does this make any sense i just i would bring up right now like if you're if you're a
[1496.54 --> 1502.78]  developer that works for jasco and you spend your time making these these pieces of firmware that as
[1502.78 --> 1509.18]  as far as i can tell by this story literally no one ever gets to use um i would just make sure that you
[1509.18 --> 1516.46]  know that it is a vibrant uh tech space out there right now and there are many other jobs you could have
[1516.46 --> 1525.98]  and if you all quit at once um you could all have new jobs very quickly um that i don't know i don't
[1525.98 --> 1531.10]  know how much shazco pays but it's very likely you could even be paid more you could live pretty much
[1531.10 --> 1535.42]  wherever you want there's tons of different companies that are offering work from home right now
[1535.42 --> 1542.30]  um yeah i would i would take this opportunity for a potential career change uh so that more people can
[1542.30 --> 1550.30]  use what you work on and it might be more impactful i'm just i'm so i'm so i'm so frustrated right now
[1550.30 --> 1555.18]  and it's just it's one of those things where like you said you see you see the auto completions in
[1555.18 --> 1562.54]  google search because it's just flipping obvious that if there's new firmware for a device that you
[1562.54 --> 1568.22]  should be able to download it this is how like basically everything has worked forever yeah yeah unless
[1568.22 --> 1574.70]  you're unless you're unless you're just i don't know unless you're jesco unless yeah yeah i would i
[1574.70 --> 1582.86]  would say if i had to guess i would say that some non-tech savvy executive level individual who doesn't
[1582.86 --> 1592.22]  really understand that giving the like giving the firmware files to a customer uh does not give them the
[1592.22 --> 1598.06]  source code of the firmware like maybe they just don't maybe they don't understand the difference between
[1598.22 --> 1602.70]  the firmware and the this is this that that statement right there is actually why i brought up that
[1602.70 --> 1608.78]  like seek a new career thing because clearly the people leading your company have like no idea what's
[1608.78 --> 1617.02]  going on with you um and probably have taken none of your feedback because i can't imagine i can't
[1617.02 --> 1623.90]  imagine a developer not bringing up like hey we should just let them have the firmware updates like we can
[1623.90 --> 1627.90]  even control the pipeline somehow if you want to do it that way whatever but like we should let our
[1627.90 --> 1632.22]  customers update their own freaking firmware i can't imagine one of the developers hasn't brought that up
[1632.78 --> 1638.14]  what i can absolutely imagine is whoever came up with this policy just doesn't care at all about what the
[1638.14 --> 1645.90]  developers say that's the only thing i can think of either no no engineer in their right mind if i was in fact if i was an
[1645.90 --> 1651.42]  engineer what i would probably suggest is that we not only have the latest firmware or two
[1652.14 --> 1657.02]  but we have a form where you can request even older ones i wouldn't necessarily say yeah you should have
[1657.02 --> 1662.46]  an archive of every possible firmware for it that could be potentially irresponsible but actually you
[1662.46 --> 1668.22]  know what with the way that they roll out updates hmm that's interesting maybe the maybe you would want
[1668.22 --> 1672.38]  to have that because that's probably the reason that they ship it with such out-of-date firmware
[1672.38 --> 1679.18]  because there are probably smart home hub manufacturers that are running like ancient firmwares as their as
[1679.18 --> 1685.02]  their official platform and they need to have an earlier one to update from in order to go to that one so
[1685.02 --> 1692.86]  so so i probably would say like hey um we should have the last couple and then as a as a nuclear option
[1692.86 --> 1698.86]  we should have this like og ancient one so that we can point people to it as customer support
[1699.34 --> 1704.62]  and say hey why don't you try flashing that one and then you can re-adopt it into your thing
[1705.42 --> 1713.90]  yeah and it'll it'll make its way up to the one that that's needed um so i i'm at the point now
[1714.46 --> 1722.30]  where it's time to decide what to do there is not an alternative that has a good feeling switch with a
[1722.30 --> 1729.58]  motion sensor in it so if the goal and like i said you've been you've been over like the motion motion
[1729.58 --> 1733.82]  sensing like lights turning on as you walk down the hallway walk into the bathroom go to the garage
[1733.82 --> 1740.38]  i mean it's kind of cool right it's it's generally quite good yeah the only thing and this is always
[1740.38 --> 1745.98]  my problem with them the only thing is when when if you're just chilling in a room and they turn off
[1745.98 --> 1753.10]  that's that's the only thing but yeah other than that it's fine and i will admit i pressed the buttons
[1753.10 --> 1758.46]  sometimes and they felt all right yeah yeah the quality of the switch itself the actual hardware
[1758.46 --> 1768.14]  seems fine i just need the firmware and you know i feel like i oh man i feel like a lot of the time
[1768.14 --> 1773.66]  i kind of go off the rails and i get really angry about stuff and people don't understand it like it
[1773.66 --> 1780.38]  might seem like you know in a world where so much is going wrong really you you can't get the latest
[1780.38 --> 1787.18]  bells and whistles on your smart light switch wow so out of touch linus but it's not about that it's not
[1787.18 --> 1793.82]  about the the magnitude of the grievance it's about the unnecessariness of the grievance it's about the
[1793.82 --> 1802.86]  shocking stupidity that led to my time and probably countless other people's time being wasted for no
[1802.86 --> 1810.06]  that's what i was going to say is reason in a lot of situations we we bring this up all the time
[1810.06 --> 1815.74]  right like if it takes if it takes an influencer using their platform in order to get something done
[1816.30 --> 1822.78]  then it's it's not necessarily a win that that thing gets done it's only a win if the entire process
[1822.78 --> 1827.90]  changes and that's honestly that's i've already told them that's the only outcome that i'll accept
[1827.90 --> 1834.22]  if they say look we'll send you an nda and we'll send you the firmware file i'm going to send them
[1834.22 --> 1840.54]  one of these because that's not a real solution the real solution is that they have a download portal
[1840.54 --> 1847.66]  on their website for the firmware for their products that's the only solution yes some way for them to
[1847.66 --> 1852.86]  have a have a pipeline for for updating their devices i mean i've seen well they have a pipeline it's
[1852.86 --> 1858.14]  just a stupid one with stupid third-party gatekeepers but i want nothing yeah i don't i don't mean i don't
[1858.14 --> 1863.90]  mean with some weird hub i mean like through software or something like that but yes um so what i was
[1863.90 --> 1869.18]  going to say is sometimes when you are in this situation you have to become disproportionately loud
[1869.18 --> 1873.98]  if that makes sense um i'm talking to the audience right now not you because i think you get it
[1873.98 --> 1878.78]  but when you run into something like this and you're like oh i'm potentially the first person
[1878.78 --> 1885.58]  with a large platform or whatever else that has ran into this problem um and it's pro looking at how
[1885.58 --> 1890.78]  this goes through communicating with the company it's not like they're like oh yeah here you can have
[1890.78 --> 1895.02]  it we don't have like a public download form but you can just have it because that would be fine
[1895.02 --> 1903.18]  whatever it's not great but who cares um you you have to be very loud so that actual change happens
[1903.18 --> 1908.62]  and they don't just fix it for you yes because the actual goal that you want is you want actual
[1908.62 --> 1916.06]  change to happen that's exactly it and so if honestly we didn't manage to finish the video the
[1916.06 --> 1925.58]  video was supposed to be kind of a puff piece like it was supposed to be just hey linus and jaker are
[1926.54 --> 1933.10]  horsing around for a few hours like setting up some cool automations and home assistant integration
[1933.10 --> 1939.98]  and showing you guys the potential of this like really cool technology that yes costs a lot more
[1939.98 --> 1946.46]  than a regular dumb switch but if you were upgrading anyway and you have a raspberry pi kicking around
[1947.02 --> 1953.18]  maybe doesn't cost as much more than you thought and for a couple of key rooms could actually be really
[1953.18 --> 1959.58]  cool like the idea was to just show this technology being used in a way that's really practical and makes
[1959.58 --> 1969.34]  a ton of sense and then it turned it turned into this just angry bashing our heads against a brick wall
[1969.34 --> 1977.26]  why is this happening and i i just i'm sorry i i don't remember how i started the sentence anymore but
[1977.26 --> 1986.62]  it was just it was so infuriating jasko managed to through their own utter incompetence and or ignorance
[1986.62 --> 1991.66]  turn what should have just been basically a free promo for their product i wasn't even reviewing
[1991.66 --> 1998.54]  it i was just integrating it into my home and showing cool things it can do right they they turned
[1998.54 --> 2005.34]  that into now this is gonna has to be a multi-part video because i didn't manage to successfully
[2005.34 --> 2011.82]  integrate the freaking product and now i have to find another solution so they basically just turned an easy
[2011.82 --> 2026.22]  w into a giant l so what do i do now yeah i don't know um there's there's still opportunity i don't
[2026.22 --> 2031.82]  know what you do to be honest there's there's still opportunity for jasko to fix their situation though
[2031.82 --> 2036.70]  well yeah they can um because it's it's probably it's probably ignorance like you said ignorance or
[2036.70 --> 2040.86]  incompetence is probably ignorance they're probably not listening to their dev team this is a big
[2040.86 --> 2045.66]  opportunity for hopefully their dev team to go like hey this thing that we've probably already
[2045.66 --> 2050.30]  talked to you about needs to happen and they could react and add a download section or just start
[2050.30 --> 2055.10]  allowing people to to get the files through support tickets or whatever else what are the odds if
[2055.10 --> 2063.58]  they're so will very ignorant that they've maintained this policy up until now come on and and there's
[2063.58 --> 2070.30]  i mean i doubt it i i mean i even asked i asked explicitly so you make the switch yes we do
[2071.02 --> 2078.94]  so you write the firmware yes we do but you will not send it to me no we will not in such simple
[2078.94 --> 2082.86]  terms because i even thought as i was on the phone with them i was like okay well maybe this is one of
[2082.86 --> 2088.30]  those things where because it's it's like branded ge but jasko actually makes it maybe there's some kind
[2088.30 --> 2095.10]  of weirdness where it's like it's someone else's ip and they they can't send it up but but the point is just
[2095.10 --> 2102.22]  however far this has to make it up the chain whoever's making this decision is so far out of
[2102.22 --> 2108.78]  date that it has to be willful like you can't possibly you can't possibly be working in the
[2108.78 --> 2116.86]  technology industry and and and manage to not understand why sending a firmware out to your end
[2116.86 --> 2124.78]  user is a good idea unless you just sit at your desk la la la la la la la la la la every time an
[2124.78 --> 2133.66]  engineer comes in and tries to talk to you i don't know how else to put it yeah i mean it's a it's a
[2133.66 --> 2138.70]  horrible experience and we've seen a lot of home automation brands go down i think you mentioned that
[2138.70 --> 2146.94]  earlier in the show um it makes sense it's even at this point i would say it's a relatively young space
[2147.74 --> 2153.42]  for sure you're absolutely right so yeah i mean there's an absolute opportunity for jazco to just
[2154.14 --> 2160.38]  fail as a company if they don't become more uh uh i wouldn't even say that's user-centric
[2161.34 --> 2166.14]  i i i was gonna say if if they don't become more user-centric but i don't think that's even fair it's
[2166.14 --> 2171.90]  it's like if they become less uh oppressive to their users because forcing people to have
[2172.78 --> 2178.70]  stuff that's like a brand new product that's four years four years out of date is like not okay like
[2178.70 --> 2184.22]  and i don't know how else to say that um so they just need to figure it out and make sure that that's
[2184.22 --> 2194.30]  not like allowed to be a thing that's it so what i could do luke is i could go out and i could buy
[2194.30 --> 2199.50]  a compatible hub i could adopt all the switches with that hub well maybe because you don't know
[2199.50 --> 2205.66]  if that hub is going to have the latest firmware or not that's true okay but i could try that you
[2205.66 --> 2212.30]  could try it okay i could painstakingly adopt over a hundred switches to my new hub beautiful
[2212.30 --> 2219.74]  update the firmware it is possible that i could have that z-wave hub act as like a daughter z-wave
[2219.74 --> 2225.02]  controller device for home assistant we don't know that for sure we haven't explored that
[2225.02 --> 2231.34]  if that's not possible then what i could do is i could um whatever the opposite of adopt is i could
[2231.34 --> 2236.94]  disconnect the switches painstakingly from that hub and then i could go around and adopt them all
[2236.94 --> 2244.54]  with their new flashed firmware back into home assistant i could do that but unless we can use
[2244.54 --> 2249.74]  that new hub as a daughter hub then anytime i needed to update the firmware again in the future
[2249.74 --> 2255.18]  which has i think it appears to be being actively developed still uh i would probably have to jump
[2255.18 --> 2261.10]  through those same hoops again meaning that that is not an acceptable solution so here's what i'm
[2261.10 --> 2267.90]  leaning to here's what i'm leaning toward i wish to have motion sensing in my house particularly for
[2267.90 --> 2273.98]  hallways stairwells bathrooms utility spaces it's it's been really nice actually it's really cool
[2274.54 --> 2281.58]  the only way to do that is to get a separate device i'll have to get a separate motion sensor
[2281.58 --> 2287.42]  and i'll have to get that embedded into the wall i have talked to my general contractor it looks like
[2287.42 --> 2292.62]  they can do it uh they can they can just cut a hole next to the switches and then just kind of work
[2292.62 --> 2298.46]  around the back to tap into the electrical wiring in the box uh hook up a five volt power supply there's
[2298.46 --> 2303.10]  one from aeotech it's like a seven in one or something like that moisture humidity well those are the
[2303.10 --> 2308.70]  same thing whatever the point is it does temperature uh uv like a whole bunch of stuff put that next to
[2308.70 --> 2313.58]  all the light switches serving essentially the same function but at that point i wouldn't have to have
[2313.58 --> 2318.94]  these jasko switches anymore and the jasko switches even just using them as dumb switches is an
[2318.94 --> 2323.74]  inconvenience there is a way without doing it through software which doesn't work remember because
[2323.74 --> 2328.22]  the old buggy firmware it doesn't work there is a way to turn off the motion sensor and just have
[2328.22 --> 2333.02]  them work as a dumb switch but you have to pull off the plate and like there's a third button that
[2333.02 --> 2340.70]  you have to like press and hold and they're not they're not that good they're not better than just
[2340.70 --> 2346.38]  like a normal dumb switch in my opinion they're not i would i would prefer a normal dumb switch if it
[2346.38 --> 2354.70]  was a dumb switch um yeah like it feels good but like we're being realistic with how good it can be
[2354.70 --> 2362.62]  while still packing all this other stuff in it yes so what i think will happen is i am going to try to
[2362.62 --> 2369.74]  find a sponsor maybe someone with you know an attitude chip on their shoulder someone a little snarky
[2369.74 --> 2376.06]  and i'm gonna try and find a sponsor who's like yeah we want to be part of this and i think that through a
[2376.06 --> 2379.50]  combination you're making you're making home automation switches now through a combination
[2380.86 --> 2387.18]  through a combination of sponsor dollars and just plain eating it i think what we'll do is we'll just
[2387.18 --> 2393.98]  rip every jasko switch out of the wall replace them with someone who has we'll you know we'll work
[2393.98 --> 2398.78]  through the community i know jake's already doing some research replace them with someone who has a way
[2398.78 --> 2408.54]  more consumer friendly approach to firmware and and just uh just have it be do a second follow-up video
[2408.54 --> 2416.38]  that's just a big f you now jasko jasko can stop this but the only way to stop this is not to appease me
[2416.38 --> 2423.66]  it's not about me at this point the only way to stop this is to fix your policies is to educate
[2423.66 --> 2431.02]  yourselves internally about what firmware updates are what the potential implications of sending out
[2431.02 --> 2438.14]  firmware updates are and learning that there's only one possible outcome to this lesson that you're
[2438.14 --> 2443.10]  learning and that is that you need to support your products through firmware updates that are readily
[2443.10 --> 2449.10]  available to your paying customers uh fair and yes innaveli that's the word i was looking for
[2449.10 --> 2453.64]  uh they've been quite involved in the home assistant community and would very likely be on board yes innaveli
[2453.66 --> 2459.42]  innaveli has actually reached out to us already in fact they were the number two choice and the only
[2459.42 --> 2464.78]  reason we went with the ge jasko ones was for the motion sensor because i didn't want to put those
[2464.78 --> 2469.74]  additional freaking holes in my wall for separate motion sensors which now ultimately it looks like
[2469.74 --> 2476.30]  i'm going to have to do anyway innaveli actually reached out to us and said hey we know you're looking
[2476.30 --> 2481.10]  for smart switches we'd be potentially willing to work with you on firmware updates and like build new
[2481.10 --> 2487.10]  features for you if you if you require them so basically i made a mistake jake pushed hard for
[2487.10 --> 2491.82]  the innaveli switch that's the other end of the spectrum that's fantastic and i really wanted the
[2491.82 --> 2496.06]  motion sensor but like there's also stuff on the jasko switches that i don't even know if the new
[2496.06 --> 2501.74]  firmware is going to fix because i can't get it and i can't try it um like for example we want to
[2501.74 --> 2507.26]  operate it without a fade on and fade off it there is a parameter that we did get working for adjusting
[2507.26 --> 2513.66]  the speed of the fade on and fade off but in some rooms like for example in my son's room he wants
[2513.66 --> 2518.78]  to use a smart uh bulb he wants to use like one of those yee lights so that he can have like rgb
[2518.78 --> 2523.34]  lights in his room and i was like oh yeah that's that's cool but smart bulbs don't always play well
[2523.34 --> 2530.14]  with smart switches and one of the reasons is that smart switches tend to um do have like fade on fade off
[2530.14 --> 2536.22]  or dimming functionalities that are not that don't work well with a smart bulb now that doesn't mean i
[2536.22 --> 2539.90]  want to put a dumb switch in there because if i wanted to do something like turn off all the lights
[2539.90 --> 2543.90]  in the house i'd like to have the switch be controlled without having the yee light app on
[2543.90 --> 2549.66]  my phone tied into homelessness i'd like to have a minimal minimal number of of apps and tie-ins
[2549.66 --> 2555.42]  required to have basic functionality so what i wanted was the ability to set the switch to have an
[2555.42 --> 2561.50]  instant on instant off mode that you can that you can activate i don't know if the jasko one has that
[2561.50 --> 2566.46]  but in a valley if they don't well i'd be able to say hey hey here's what i want here's why i want
[2566.46 --> 2570.54]  it here's why i'd be beneficial to your entire community not just to me and they expressed
[2570.54 --> 2578.14]  interest in working with us on that so i think i think that's the update guys you're still going to
[2578.14 --> 2586.38]  want to watch the video just because it is such an emotional roller coaster like i can't express we
[2586.38 --> 2591.10]  were really pressed for time that day we were trying to get the smart lighting video done and
[2591.10 --> 2598.14]  the hvac update one done and then um this just completely threw a wrench in what was supposed to
[2598.14 --> 2605.74]  be a simple shoot where we adopted some switches showed some cool automations and called it a freaking
[2605.74 --> 2613.98]  day and just this is one of those situations where having labs like running and having the labs website
[2613.98 --> 2621.34]  would be pretty cool because i'm sitting here thinking like i i want to make sure because this
[2621.34 --> 2627.66]  this is a terrible thing for someone to run into um especially if they don't have a platform right um
[2627.66 --> 2633.66]  yeah for sure and i i don't want people to run into it but if you just if you title the youtube video
[2633.66 --> 2641.26]  like you will have firmware problems if you buy jasko switches uh that's just like not really going to go
[2641.26 --> 2647.02]  very well so because just because it's just very boring of a of a title so i want to make sure that
[2647.02 --> 2652.14]  it would get traction with people that might be like should i buy this switch and i would hope that
[2652.14 --> 2657.50]  this this content would come up but having the labs website you could absolutely do something like that
[2658.14 --> 2665.98]  um i'm excited man i'm excited yeah yeah uh why don't we do a couple of merch messages we've actually
[2665.98 --> 2673.10]  got some deals on ltt store for this week uh we are launching a new oh oh dang it oh i don't have
[2673.10 --> 2678.38]  it on me we're launching a new headphone t-shirt uh okay what is the oh crap what is the best way for
[2678.38 --> 2684.38]  me to do this oh okay the first thing i'm going to do is share you uh in a valley's firmware download
[2684.38 --> 2692.38]  page which includes beta firmwares and change logs and all the things that you should have on a firmware
[2692.38 --> 2698.38]  download page so that's pretty cool and then the next thing we're going to do is head over to ltdstore.com
[2698.94 --> 2704.14]  where we have the new headphone shirt that's right ladies and gentlemen a new design from the one
[2704.14 --> 2713.18]  and only laloid pan looking pretty sharp kind of audio inspired in other news we've got a couple of
[2713.18 --> 2719.74]  promos this week we need to generate i mean look i'm all about being honest with you guys okay
[2720.46 --> 2726.06]  we need to generate some cash flow to pay for our final our final payments for screwdrivers and
[2726.06 --> 2732.46]  backpacks i have stubbornly refused to take pre-orders on them so i can't take your money in that way so
[2732.46 --> 2740.22]  we're running some promos we're doing a free shipping promo but because of some limitations in shopify's
[2740.22 --> 2751.74]  systems um the free shipping promo is honor system in a sense if you kind of get what i mean discount code
[2751.74 --> 2759.34]  honor the american way or honor with a u the british canadian way will get you free shipping on orders
[2759.34 --> 2768.78]  of 89.99 or more it is intended for use with the team red and couch ripper pillows please don't use
[2768.78 --> 2780.22]  it for anything else that's right free shipping on your entire order okay if you buy all products here
[2780.22 --> 2788.54]  we go the couch ripper or team red pillows in i believe it's the largest sizes so team red 50 by 50
[2788.54 --> 2796.70]  centimeter this guy right here or the couch ripper which is this guy right here in the i believe it's uh
[2796.70 --> 2803.90]  yeah 65 by 50 size so the the big guy right here so both of them are are over that threshold and you
[2803.90 --> 2811.82]  will have free shipping for your entire order on ltdstore.com don't use it for anything else the
[2811.82 --> 2817.50]  code probably ends at midnight pacific tonight unless nick thinks that um it's gotten out of control
[2817.50 --> 2821.90]  and shuts it off early okay bye that is the end of my that is the end of my notes about it
[2824.06 --> 2830.30]  and with that we have some merch messages oh yeah sure that makes sense from tim linus did your trip to
[2830.30 --> 2835.42]  the intel dev center give you any ideas for testing methods or method methodologies for the lab oh my
[2835.42 --> 2841.50]  god i mean there's so much stuff there that's just beyond what we could afford to buy even if we wanted
[2841.50 --> 2846.38]  to i mean it's not like we're gonna man did you did you watch even linus's blank check isn't that blank
[2846.38 --> 2855.42]  my dude yeah man my my blank check it just it's not long enough you know it's a blank short check short
[2855.42 --> 2864.30]  check okay yeah and cash is a little tight right now uh over the next sort of 12 to 24 months my
[2864.30 --> 2870.54]  belief is that um through screwdriver backpack some of the other launches we have coming ltdstore is
[2870.54 --> 2877.02]  really intended to fund a lot of the of the lab equipment we're going to need and then my goal
[2877.02 --> 2881.82]  just to give you guys some idea of how i expect the business model to work is i don't i don't really
[2881.82 --> 2889.02]  expect to make back the equipment if that makes sense what i need lab to be is self-sufficient on
[2889.02 --> 2896.62]  like a month to month basis so through the site um through any like channels any additional youtube
[2896.62 --> 2901.02]  channels that we spin up around lab content or anything like that i need it to be break even to
[2901.02 --> 2909.42]  cover its own payroll and its own monthly mortgage or rent right but the equipment the goal is that we
[2909.42 --> 2916.30]  make enough on ltdstore that we can that we can afford those big outlays right and get labs to the
[2916.30 --> 2921.58]  point where it's set up enough that it can that it can coast that's the goal um
[2924.86 --> 2929.26]  ltdstore.com you know it's been great it's been one of the biggest success stories for us ever
[2929.26 --> 2932.78]  but we're not going to be able to afford a lot of luke did you watch those videos
[2932.78 --> 2942.86]  uh i i watched some of them a lotto me is a russian car so there's a cooler lotto okay so
[2942.86 --> 2950.94]  i i believe it's the lotto is the one that allows intel to fire a laser at a silicon die and actually
[2950.94 --> 2960.22]  change the properties so that they can test what redesigning the um what redesigning the chip and
[2960.22 --> 2966.86]  re-manufacturing it would would do it's utterly incredible i didn't even think technology like
[2966.86 --> 2972.62]  that existed but it does and intel has it in their in their testing facility like i'll never have
[2972.62 --> 2979.02]  anything like that um i mean even the way that they have uh heated and chilled water plumbed throughout
[2979.02 --> 2984.62]  the building and then running to all the test benches so you just turn on a tap and then have you
[2984.62 --> 2988.70]  have a controller there that gives you the exact temperature of water you want to test like that's
[2988.70 --> 2993.58]  it's not the kind of thing that is likely for us to be able to do but we are sweet though it's pretty
[2993.58 --> 2999.58]  sweet but i saw that part there was some inspiration like i thought it was really cool the way they had
[2999.58 --> 3004.46]  their test benches in drawers like i could see us maybe implementing something like that it'd be the
[3004.46 --> 3013.90]  ikea version of it but but a lot of a lot of their uh a lot of their test benches looked like uh and so i i
[3013.90 --> 3018.46]  i'm pretty sure i watched the whole thing i'm just not remembering names and stuff um a lot of their
[3018.46 --> 3025.34]  test benches looked like just like open bench table style configurations and and a lot of their
[3025.34 --> 3031.82]  their like racks and stuff just looked like extrusion i think we could get that type of stuff but some of
[3031.82 --> 3035.82]  the some of the machines and things that they had like you were saying that like oh we can just set
[3035.82 --> 3040.86]  the temperature of the water to be whatever we want and stuff like that um without having the the loops
[3040.86 --> 3046.86]  getting all screwed up and yada yada like that's that's some pretty advanced stuff um but yeah i
[3046.86 --> 3051.18]  think the the benches and having them slide out and stuff there's there's easy ways to do that
[3052.30 --> 3053.26]  we could do that for sure
[3053.26 --> 3064.94]  from eric uef cybran aeon or seraphim i started out in uef and so i just never really learned the other races
[3064.94 --> 3071.58]  good good question from that i do the same thing yeah right because i taught him how to play
[3073.74 --> 3078.22]  from anon i want to get your opinion on password managers love the idea behind them but it's hard to
[3078.22 --> 3085.02]  trust one company with all my passwords yeah i don't know luke you want to speak to that don't trust them
[3087.02 --> 3088.78]  good call try to
[3091.34 --> 3097.34]  it it almost feels like a necessity in the modern age because you're if you if you do like anything
[3097.34 --> 3103.74]  you're gonna have way too many passwords um single sign on is becoming more popular um that is an
[3103.74 --> 3109.66]  interesting thing but that also has a very similar problem um where one thing is going to control
[3109.66 --> 3115.74]  access to many other things um i think there's going to be some major disruption to passwords and
[3115.74 --> 3120.22]  logins in the next like five to ten years i think there's going to be some extremely major disruption to
[3120.22 --> 3126.86]  that whole field um but there is a range of security options that you can choose there are some like
[3126.86 --> 3133.58]  self-hosted password managers that you can have um so that's that's a much higher level of security
[3133.58 --> 3138.22]  that you can have if that's something that you're looking for there is also some expertise some
[3138.22 --> 3144.22]  maintenance um and some management that come along with doing that so you have to be willing to actually
[3144.22 --> 3148.78]  do that it's like it's one of those things where i feel like there's there's a group of people that
[3148.78 --> 3155.10]  will jump straight to well you should self-host it without really considering that for a lot of people
[3155.10 --> 3163.34]  even the act of setting up a password manager is a lot to expect yeah yeah for sure yeah um so that's
[3163.34 --> 3170.22]  not it's not an option for everyone and then if you if you do decide to use one um just make sure
[3170.22 --> 3177.58]  like if you if you follow some like news news setup of some type add to your feed the the keyword of
[3177.58 --> 3184.46]  the name of that company um so you can keep on top of it and and hope that it's like open source so
[3184.46 --> 3191.74]  that the security of it is constantly being evaluated um and to be clear make sure that 2fa
[3191.74 --> 3198.62]  is on everything is not a magic silver bullet no no no it just means that it's constantly being
[3198.62 --> 3203.98]  evaluated by a multitude of sources unless it's a very small open source project and nobody happens
[3203.98 --> 3210.22]  to be looking at it absolutely true it could be completely abandoned where and it could be a a
[3210.22 --> 3217.02]  situation where a zero day lasts forever because no one ever actually notices that it's there um so
[3217.02 --> 3223.02]  yeah it's uh i don't know the whole world of of that type of stuff is a little sketch right now unless
[3223.02 --> 3230.06]  you want to self-host but that's also uh complicated and and if you self-host a password manager and you're
[3230.06 --> 3237.50]  not managing the backups for it properly you're gonna have a bad day you're gonna have a really really bad day
[3237.50 --> 3245.18]  um but yeah also so i have heard this before i never realized that it was a thing but some people
[3245.18 --> 3248.94]  think like oh i have a password manager and all my passwords have like 100 characters in them i don't
[3248.94 --> 3255.34]  need 2fa that's just stupid and like i don't have anything else to say about that that's just unintelligent i
[3255.34 --> 3264.62]  i just okay it is a thing that has been said no um you don't even know them but okay i just i don't
[3264.62 --> 3274.22]  know yeah um you need 2fa 2fa is like hugely powerful right now yeah 3fa if you can um and ideally
[3274.22 --> 3281.10]  you want to pick good factors sms is not a very good factor for you sms is a trash factor yeah there's
[3281.10 --> 3288.86]  almost nothing left on sms for me and that is on purpose because phone numbers are so trivial to
[3288.86 --> 3295.82]  find they and and taking them over and hijacking them is so trivially easy through social engineering
[3295.82 --> 3302.46]  and no amount of better encryption is going to save you from social engineering there's nothing that you
[3302.46 --> 3306.30]  can do because the social engineering to get your phone number has nothing to do with you
[3307.18 --> 3313.66]  it has to do with the the phone company um i had something to say and i don't remember darn it
[3313.66 --> 3314.78]  it was probably really good though
[3318.46 --> 3327.10]  oh yeah uh if if you have a company uh or an organization that only does sms 2fa um reach out to
[3327.90 --> 3333.26]  reach out to them in some way uh if if you have to use them reach out to them in some way like
[3333.26 --> 3340.30]  the canadian government um and ask them to support things other than just sms oh that's insane did i
[3340.30 --> 3350.54]  ever tell you about my stupid conversation with equifax support no oh my god oh man so um
[3351.18 --> 3356.46]  equif okay i don't okay it might not have been equifax it might have been the other one but for some
[3356.46 --> 3363.90]  reason i had to have credit monitoring through one of those services yeah i literally got a
[3363.90 --> 3369.66]  newsletter from them talking about the importance of 2fa for protecting your own security and this is
[3370.22 --> 3375.02]  literally like it was equifax or the other one what's what's the other what's the other stupid one
[3375.58 --> 3380.70]  it was it was the main one there's two there's two big ones there's equifax and then there's the other
[3380.70 --> 3387.10]  big one and i literally got a newsletter from them talking about the importance of two fact
[3387.10 --> 3391.26]  transunion that's the other one so i don't remember which one of them it was but i'm on the phone with
[3391.26 --> 3398.06]  them going hey you guys like have all my financial like credit information in here and you don't even
[3398.06 --> 3405.02]  support two factor you literally sent me a newsletter saying how important it is and you literally don't
[3405.02 --> 3411.50]  even support it unbelievable what can be done they're like basically entry tier customers for
[3412.62 --> 3423.26]  like yeah so guys if you work for if you yeah yeah anyway if you work for a company that doesn't do 2fa
[3423.26 --> 3430.38]  properly please please advocate advocate because it's so so so important and if it's any kind of
[3430.38 --> 3437.26]  important financial or otherwise personal uh potentially compromising information you absolutely
[3437.26 --> 3443.34]  have to have it be required it and even then you still have to be careful because you could be
[3443.34 --> 3446.78]  holistically compromised and they could still get into your systems or whatever else you still have
[3446.78 --> 3453.66]  to be careful nothing is a a fully encompassing solution but 2fa is super big deal oh no the horror
[3453.66 --> 3459.26]  stories are showing up in the chat sopy mac and cheese says t-mobile apparently recently killed off email
[3459.26 --> 3468.22]  2fa forcing you to use sms like why why i mean i okay i can tell you why because sending emails
[3468.22 --> 3474.78]  costs t-mobile money whereas to whereas uh texts probably don't that's probably why run their own
[3474.78 --> 3480.46]  thing i was gonna say usually text is more expensive than email but yeah they run their own thing that's
[3480.46 --> 3487.98]  funny uh glad to hear it infinity puddle okay their school district is turning off sms and moving to
[3487.98 --> 3494.86]  uh required 2fa love to see it awesome good very cool good happy to hear it all right money hit us
[3494.86 --> 3500.78]  with a couple more and then we'll move on to another good job too to those it teams because i know um and
[3500.78 --> 3507.02]  they probably don't hear it very often because government and and uh essentially government it
[3507.02 --> 3512.86]  teams often have to move very slowly there's a lot of steps and hoops and stuff that they have to jump
[3512.86 --> 3517.74]  through so a lot of push stuff like that through to educate yes so if you're able to push something
[3517.74 --> 3521.98]  like that through that's a big win good job yeah props you're doing you're doing the lord's work
[3521.98 --> 3526.30]  because no one else is going to thank you for it you're going to get a ton of angry emails what do you
[3526.30 --> 3531.74]  mean i have to do this to do my password is one to update my account and i can always remember it and
[3531.74 --> 3540.62]  i just type it in so fast so keep doing what you're doing it's really important all right oh okay we got
[3540.62 --> 3547.26]  someone asking why is sms2fa so bad because sms2fa if someone hijacks your sim like if they call your
[3547.26 --> 3553.98]  carrier and pretend to be you and get a new sim issued in your name it will have your number so if
[3553.98 --> 3560.14]  they have compromised your passwords in some other way they can quickly go log into things two-factor
[3560.14 --> 3565.50]  authenticate change out all the phone numbers associated with your two-factor and lock you out
[3565.50 --> 3570.62]  of your accounts and it is a real nightmare if you don't happen to be like a public figure like i am
[3570.62 --> 3577.50]  getting my accounts back is relatively straightforward i call my youtube rep and i'm like yo i need my
[3577.50 --> 3584.70]  account back now it's frozen it's done it's out i'm authenticated they know who i am but i went through
[3584.70 --> 3589.82]  this back before that was not the case i lost my youtube account and getting it back took a month
[3589.82 --> 3597.34]  it's it's a really awful stressful experience and for a lot of people like and there's so much
[3597.34 --> 3602.06]  uncertainty will i ever get it back what else have they compromised while they've had access to my
[3602.06 --> 3606.62]  email what what credentials are they changing email is basically the key to your life right
[3608.54 --> 3612.86]  it's rough sorry luke i didn't mean to cut you off there's a bit of a leg on he's not actually here i
[3612.86 --> 3618.78]  don't know if you know it's it's it's always it's way harder to do wanshow remotely it's just it is i
[3618.78 --> 3625.58]  i remember after the like the the first era of isolation wanshow when we first did wanshow back
[3625.58 --> 3631.42]  in office again it was like whoa this is so much easier um but even the small amount of delay you
[3631.42 --> 3634.38]  don't notice it very much when you're like gaming and stuff but when you're trying to host a show
[3634.38 --> 3639.74]  it's it's pretty noticeable um what was i gonna say though i don't really remember but yeah anyways
[3639.74 --> 3646.62]  it's it's just it happens more often than you'd think social engineering is a very um in some ways
[3646.62 --> 3653.18]  it's like super difficult to be like extremely good at it but then also anyone can try it and
[3653.18 --> 3660.30]  if you fail it's like whatever because you just hang up yeah by the way can i just say i can totally
[3660.30 --> 3666.62]  see the same thing that i went through when i had covid and i hosted the show your brain's just a little
[3666.62 --> 3672.86]  stupid today yeah umming way more than usual and you're just like dude i've built it all week
[3674.06 --> 3680.06]  yeah that's the like one thing that i've experienced i yeah i've been i've been talking to my like
[3680.06 --> 3684.70]  family and stuff about it um and there's a there's a couple specific things because my stuff and that's
[3684.70 --> 3690.06]  all whatever but um this more than any other sickness that i've had i just yeah i just feel a
[3690.06 --> 3698.06]  little wagged you're like you're kind of an idiot today it's great and i mean that in a good way i
[3698.06 --> 3707.34]  mean normally you're sharp and so when you're not i notice that's great yeah slow mode slow mode loop
[3707.34 --> 3711.98]  chat uh why don't we do our sponsors real quick here actually before we do before we do some more
[3711.98 --> 3716.14]  merch messages oh i just ripped that tab out of my browser perfect that's what i needed to do
[3716.14 --> 3718.94]  the show is brought to you today by
[3721.90 --> 3729.90]  bell you got me yep are you gonna put one up oh we're both waiting for each other vulture vulture

[3945.26 --> 3955.10]  next mr lafreniere um let's see what we got here how many we did a few merch messages yeah um we can wow
[3955.10 --> 3961.90]  that's a really long topic god you're so gassed on game pass xbox put them on blast can the
[3961.90 --> 3967.02]  subscription model really last this is a super long topic what i saw was that kotaku mentioned
[3967.02 --> 3973.10]  on i think it was twitter that they were like burnt out on game pass or something interesting
[3973.10 --> 3978.94]  and then and then xbox just like flamed them saying something along the lines of like tell me you only
[3978.94 --> 3984.78]  ever play triple-a games without telling me you only ever play triple-a games um and i think that's the
[3984.78 --> 3989.90]  whole story and then the notes are like an entire page long um but it says can the subscription model
[3989.90 --> 3994.94]  really last i i think yes honestly everyone that i've talked to about the xbox game pass for a long
[3994.94 --> 4000.94]  time has been very happy with it and i think we're in one of those situations where everyone's going to
[4000.94 --> 4006.70]  be really happy with it because companies can be very aggressive on pricing and availability yeah and
[4006.70 --> 4012.06]  then once everyone switches over to not buying games and just being on subscription models then we're
[4012.06 --> 4016.62]  going to have too many subscription models and they're going to cost too much um the same thing
[4016.62 --> 4020.22]  that's happening with video streaming services right now i think we're gonna go through this
[4020.22 --> 4025.50]  it's basically freaking cable it's cable now yeah and there's all these people putting their their
[4025.50 --> 4031.58]  pirate hats back on um and and i think we're gonna we're gonna go down the same path but right now
[4031.58 --> 4036.78]  in this exact moment things like i would i would probably say especially game pass in my opinion i think
[4036.78 --> 4043.26]  game pass is probably the best one um but it's an extremely strong value yeah game pass is insane
[4043.26 --> 4047.90]  like the the value proposition on is nuts and then they're bringing in netflix was nuts when it was
[4047.90 --> 4055.82]  seven dollars too and how long exactly a fair amount of time but yeah it's completely gone uh and i i
[4055.82 --> 4061.10]  strongly believe we're going to be going down the same path um but yeah kotaku's point was just like
[4061.10 --> 4069.02]  stupid and honestly xbox was probably right um they probably just play like new triple a titles and
[4069.02 --> 4073.34]  there aren't a ton hitting right now because it's not the time of the year that they usually hit really
[4073.34 --> 4079.50]  hard um if i can give a shout out for something actually super cool that i'm personally very interested in
[4079.50 --> 4087.26]  that i think is launching today um is a mod for elden ring co-op um which makes me like
[4087.26 --> 4091.98]  way more interested in playing it oh i'm gonna play i haven't tried it yet you down yeah i mean
[4091.98 --> 4095.98]  either so sure yeah all right i mean right now i'm probably just gonna die constantly because
[4096.94 --> 4105.74]  brain like brain leg but you know uh but the uh it's output leg the screen updates and looks like
[4105.74 --> 4115.42]  like hold on a second i died um but yeah it looks amazing you can you can look it up it's made by a
[4115.98 --> 4121.66]  well-known modder it adds a lot of the things to to multiplayer elden ring that a lot of players would
[4121.66 --> 4126.86]  want i understand that a lot of like hardcore hardcore souls players can be like that's not the
[4126.86 --> 4133.02]  way the game's meant to be played i don't care i like co-op games um you can you can both mount at the
[4133.02 --> 4137.10]  same time if one of you like dies during a boss fight it switches to a spectator mode so you can
[4137.10 --> 4142.78]  watch your buddy play oh that's cool it scales you can play with you can play with up to four people
[4142.78 --> 4147.02]  at a time and it scales the difficulty of the game based on the amount of people that are in the lobby
[4147.66 --> 4153.66]  it sounds like an amazing mod like it's extremely well done it's like literally everything i would
[4153.66 --> 4159.02]  have wanted from elden ring multiplayer is theoretically going to be in the game it's going to be launching on
[4159.02 --> 4167.02]  nexus mods um i don't um that sounds like like first party tier feature set like whatever i mean i
[4167.02 --> 4171.82]  guess we'll have to try it and see if it's any good but like yeah like it's supposed to release today so
[4171.82 --> 4178.22]  i mean i haven't played it yet but it's supposed to be yeah absolutely like fantastic wow um hey there's
[4178.22 --> 4184.30]  a good comment in twitch chat for a change doomwalker42 says imagine gatekeeping how an rpg should be played
[4184.30 --> 4194.46]  that's ironic yeah yeah yeah yeah what you said yeah no i will role play however i wish that's the
[4194.46 --> 4202.94]  whole point um it looks like it's yeah so i'm pretty sure it launched today it already has 21 000 downloads
[4203.42 --> 4211.10]  um like it it yeah people are people are on this it's called seamless co-op for uh for elden ring so
[4211.10 --> 4215.58]  yeah maybe check it out i'm definitely going to check it out um but but yeah i know there's there's
[4215.58 --> 4220.78]  not a ton going on right now for for new large triple a titles which is probably why you're bored of
[4220.78 --> 4225.82]  game pass if all you play is new larger but here's an alternate perspective it never happens
[4226.38 --> 4231.74]  mike rose of indie developer no more robots claimed that game pass is guaranteeing success for dozens
[4231.74 --> 4236.70]  of devs every single month by paying them their their entire dev costs and then some on day one
[4236.70 --> 4242.46]  he went on to explain that normally you launch a game it costs x to make and you hope that your
[4242.46 --> 4247.18]  game plus marketing was good enough to make x back so you can start making a profit if you're on game
[4247.18 --> 4251.34]  pass at launch it's likely you've just instantly made x on launch day that's that's incredible i mean
[4251.34 --> 4257.10]  that's what that's what we wanted for this model was to have more predictability to your income as a
[4257.10 --> 4264.70]  game developer because we've seen that that feast and famine just chew up and spit out studio after studio
[4264.70 --> 4270.62]  after studio and some of them folded some of them got acquired but the story is ultimately the same
[4270.62 --> 4277.34]  that as they scaled up the ambition of their projects they reached a point where they just
[4277.98 --> 4287.82]  yeah where the risk was just too high and they couldn't keep going so yeah yeah game pass very cool
[4288.70 --> 4293.90]  i don't have like a huge amount else to say about this topic i just i saw that tweet too and i kind of
[4293.90 --> 4298.46]  laughed at it as well because it's like there's just so many games on game pass that there's just
[4298.46 --> 4304.22]  like no way that unless unless you have that like fatigue that people get with things like steam or if
[4304.22 --> 4308.70]  they own like 500 games they're like i have nothing to play there's like at least 50 games that you know
[4308.70 --> 4312.30]  they'd be excited to play but they don't want to scroll through the entire list and like look into each
[4312.30 --> 4317.02]  one and actually remember why they were why they bought whatever they bought and why they wanted to
[4317.02 --> 4322.94]  play it or maybe they got it in a pack of like 10 things from humble bundle 10 years ago and they don't
[4322.94 --> 4329.66]  know that it's actually good or whatever else um but there are so many things in xbox game pass then
[4329.66 --> 4336.38]  that unless literally all you do 16 hours a day is try to play through every single game in your
[4336.38 --> 4340.78]  game pass library and even then i don't know i feel like you wouldn't have made it all the way through
[4340.78 --> 4344.86]  yeah like there's an insane amount of content if you're not finding anything to play in game pass you
[4344.86 --> 4349.82]  might not be opening you might not be broadening your horizons enough try something new you might like
[4349.82 --> 4354.30]  it you might hate it but hey you didn't pay anything for it it's game pass that's that's
[4354.30 --> 4359.02]  the beauty of it try something else if you need it clear like i'm i'm saying i you know i'm supporting
[4359.02 --> 4366.38]  game pass i like i love the idea i actually don't have a subscription to game pass um actually what's
[4366.38 --> 4367.50]  i don't have a subscription
[4369.82 --> 4376.14]  me neither yeah but it's really great i mean i like to i like to buy games on sale and then play
[4376.14 --> 4381.26]  them at my leisure i like to own my library of content but i consider that a luxury that is it's
[4381.26 --> 4388.38]  an utterly unnecessary luxury i i have friends that have game pass and i have recommended game pass
[4389.26 --> 4395.58]  to some of those friends and i have recommended game pass publicly before um the reason why i don't
[4395.58 --> 4400.86]  have it is because i i will recommend it because it's just a very good deal and if you're trying to be
[4400.86 --> 4407.10]  economic about things and all that type of stuff which a lot of people should then it probably makes
[4407.10 --> 4415.18]  a lot of sense to to go with it um the reason why i don't is because i'm trying to lean more on
[4416.30 --> 4422.30]  my my stuff which is where i buy like as many physical copies of of games basically as as possible
[4422.30 --> 4428.94]  as long as it's not like nerd you know you know when they switched pc games to like you go buy it in
[4428.94 --> 4433.82]  the store and you get a box and inside there's a sticker that's the code yep that's stupid i don't
[4433.82 --> 4438.78]  care about that i'm not buying those um but like for switch i buy as many physical games as possible
[4438.78 --> 4445.58]  for pc i buy as many like buy it one time own it forever games as possible um but that's that's a
[4445.58 --> 4451.18]  personal thing so that's up to other people decide how they want to deal with that we should
[4451.18 --> 4455.50]  probably jump into a couple more topics because i realized i have a badminton night thing uh that i
[4455.50 --> 4459.82]  forgot about yvonne showed up kind of hovering around the wancho set and i think that's what
[4459.82 --> 4462.62]  she's trying to remind me of uh vaughn is that is that the thing
[4465.58 --> 4468.22]  she's going to get my children wait does that mean i don't have a car
[4470.22 --> 4480.70]  uh you got me uh oh that could be a problem uh okay uh amd ryzen 7000 launching this fall it could be
[4480.70 --> 4487.10]  really fast up to 5.5 gigahertz with architectural improvements they're expecting a 15 single thread
[4487.10 --> 4492.94]  increase in cinebench uh given the clock speed the ipc gains look pretty small but it'll be built on
[4492.94 --> 4499.82]  five nanometer tsmc more level 2 cache with some ai shiz that has no actual details all desktop
[4499.82 --> 4505.34]  processors will come with an igpu alex clark puts i personally love this because it makes troubleshooting
[4505.34 --> 4511.90]  so much easier it is actually a really valid point that's i i the only reason i think i i that one's
[4511.90 --> 4518.94]  not a big deal for me what i love about it is just that amd's onboard gpus are freaking awesome so having
[4518.94 --> 4525.10]  a value option is something i wish we'd had two years ago but hey i'll take it now uh ddr5 no support
[4525.10 --> 4533.82]  for ddr4 it looks like um pcie 5 with four more lanes than what we have on intel's latest platform
[4533.82 --> 4540.38]  support for up to 170 watt processors and in their keynote amd showed a 16 core processor completing
[4540.38 --> 4546.70]  a blender render in 31 less time this is sort of a strange way to put it because it means that the cpu
[4546.70 --> 4553.34]  is 45 faster notes alex it's entirely possible that amd is being very conservative with their claims
[4555.50 --> 4561.98]  uh all right let's go ahead and talk about i fix it starting to fix it yeah this is super cool
[4561.98 --> 4568.54]  here they created uh i'm just going to share my screen real quick here because who did this for
[4568.54 --> 4576.06]  me anthony young what a guy anthony created a nice little list of solid lines you can buy and how much
[4576.06 --> 4583.90]  they cost now this looks like the pro move all right you buy the cheap one upgrade the storage diy
[4583.90 --> 4590.14]  grab the 512 gig screen with the anti-glare etched glass and boom there you go maybe flip your standard
[4590.14 --> 4595.34]  screen on ebay for someone who broke theirs that's looking like a pretty good value huh changing up
[4595.34 --> 4600.38]  the screen is a bit of a is a bit of an ordeal though but it can be done yeah it should be noted
[4600.38 --> 4605.90]  if you were hoping to get a steam deck sooner by buying all the parts and putting it together yourself
[4606.94 --> 4612.54]  i would say that the cost probably doesn't make a ton of sense it's 400 that's for the 512 gig display
[4612.54 --> 4618.54]  but that doesn't include everything like not the ssd or a bunch of the buttons and the heatsink
[4618.54 --> 4625.66]  and stuff so there's parts that um are not currently being sold just yet i fix it says that new parts
[4625.66 --> 4630.70]  will come back will come online in the next few weeks responding to out-of-stock parts by citing
[4630.70 --> 4634.94]  very high demand for their initial shipment of components it could be a good or a bad thing
[4634.94 --> 4640.14]  depending on your point of view right anthony that's a very good point i fix its main issue with
[4640.14 --> 4643.58]  the steam deck is the inaccessibility of the battery that's something we talked about when we did a
[4643.58 --> 4648.78]  tear down of it it's glued in place and buried under flex cables another complaint was that the
[4648.78 --> 4653.02]  thumbsticks capacitive touch wires and the unit's usb-c board are soldered in place rather than
[4653.02 --> 4659.66]  modular those are relatively small though notes i fix it compared to other consoles and the deck is
[4659.66 --> 4665.10]  leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to transparency and repairable design choices so
[4665.10 --> 4671.58]  i mean it's sort of old news at this point but good guy valve thank you very much for that are there
[4671.58 --> 4679.42]  any other headline topics we promised to talk about and haven't yet um i don't think so oh twitter
[4679.42 --> 4686.54]  find 150 million for misusing 2fa data uh twitter misused 2fa data of its users misrepresented its
[4686.54 --> 4692.62]  security and privacy practices profited off of users data misused phone numbers and other personal
[4692.62 --> 4697.98]  info to target advertisers and twitter used users 2fa phone numbers and email addresses to allow
[4697.98 --> 4704.46]  advertisers to deliver specific advertising to them they violated an ftc order from 2011 that prohibits
[4704.46 --> 4710.30]  social media companies from deceptively using personal information twitter allowed users to use
[4710.30 --> 4715.50]  other multi-factor authentication methods such as mobile authentication apps or security keys that do
[4715.50 --> 4723.18]  not require users to provide their telephone numbers they must notify users that it misused phone
[4723.18 --> 4728.62]  numbers and email as part of the suit i guess they must notify users that it misused phone numbers and
[4728.62 --> 4734.38]  email addresses collected for account security to also target ads to them and provide information about
[4734.38 --> 4740.22]  twitter's privacy and security controls here and they must implement sorry okay go ahead no go for it it's
[4740.22 --> 4748.38]  fine here's what needs to happen okay there needs to be a centralized fund that these companies pay these
[4748.38 --> 4752.62]  fines into and the money needs to go to the end users if you're going to use my data i want to get
[4752.62 --> 4759.82]  freaking paid for it like what what benefit is it to me that they then get a slap on the wrist that
[4759.82 --> 4767.10]  gets paid to like the same entity that wastes all my money so it can waste their money too like i i i
[4767.10 --> 4773.82]  don't i don't understand i'm the one who was harmed right am i not so why are they paying a fine to the
[4773.82 --> 4779.42]  government so what i'd like to see the government do is instead of just taking this money padding their
[4779.42 --> 4787.34]  pockets is i would like them to create a system by which these fines and i want i think it's like
[4788.06 --> 4793.02]  every time i think it's like whatever organization in the states i think it's the irs goes after tax
[4793.02 --> 4802.86]  stuff sorry i'm not 100 on top of american things um yeah where they like fund themselves by catching
[4802.86 --> 4808.06]  people that are doing tax fraud things right i suspect this is a similar situation i'm assuming the
[4808.06 --> 4815.66]  fine goes to the organization that that caught them doing this well i don't know all right whatever
[4816.30 --> 4820.62]  basically i'm telling you guys how i think it should work i think the users whose rights
[4820.62 --> 4826.14]  were violated should get paid i think it should be way worse people are saying it's called a class action
[4826.14 --> 4831.98]  yes you could do that but it's it's a ton of work to organize it should just happen automatically like
[4831.98 --> 4836.94]  laws should matter and companies should be fined and people should just automatically receive the
[4836.94 --> 4841.98]  money like what year is it if all our personal information is going to be out there anyway it
[4841.98 --> 4845.74]  might as well be used for our benefit for a change give me my money
[4849.50 --> 4856.30]  that's my hot take for the day that's very wishful thinking linus says twitch chat yes it is i know i just
[4856.30 --> 4861.98]  think like at 150 million dollars for all the users that twitter has you're gonna get like five cents um
[4864.14 --> 4869.34]  but maybe maybe both maybe the maybe the fine has to entirely cover the government's costs
[4869.34 --> 4876.78]  and also you have to like pay whatever amount that you uh gained from users to the users that'd be cool
[4879.66 --> 4884.30]  um i don't know i think that's it for headline topics so child dude no says in the past few videos
[4884.30 --> 4888.30]  featuring the corsair 4000 you keep unscrewing the entire front part yet you can just rip off the
[4888.30 --> 4893.74]  front panel and you can just pull off the mesh it's been making me mad as someone who owns the 4000d
[4893.74 --> 4901.34]  okay i'll have to have a look at that um i've got a i've got a fan art to show firmware by jazco
[4901.34 --> 4906.86]  i don't think it's the greatest fan art but it's a an attempt was made so that's nice thank you for that
[4908.86 --> 4914.14]  i don't i don't mean to be overly critical it's uh it's it's good it's good it's good that you tried
[4914.14 --> 4919.74]  that was good uh we've got a few curated merch messages here uh just a reminder guys whether
[4919.74 --> 4924.22]  you're want to send a merch message or not we have free shipping on orders over 89.99
[4925.34 --> 4932.86]  we intended it to be for cpu ripper uh or excuse me what do we call it cpu rip like
[4932.86 --> 4938.46]  no tripper thank you we intend for it to be for the large size couch ripper or the large size team red
[4938.46 --> 4944.86]  pillow but there's no actual way for us to limit it because of shopify's stupid limitations so it's
[4944.86 --> 4950.46]  just on any order over 89.99 uh it should run until midnight tonight or luke might pull the plug if it
[4950.46 --> 4955.18]  gets too bad but just telling you guys uh let's go through a few and then i'm going to have to i'm
[4955.18 --> 4961.98]  gonna have to run i have like seven minutes from ryan i've sort of become the unofficial tech advisor for
[4961.98 --> 4966.46]  my workplace i love helping but it can be tedious at times any advice on how to politely educate on
[4966.46 --> 4971.90]  smaller issues without seeming like i'm trying to avoid helping documents knowledge bases yeah
[4972.70 --> 4979.10]  link them to link them to a video make it make it you know just say hey i'd love to help you with that
[4979.10 --> 4985.90]  but that's a little more involved than like basically you have to help them understand that they have to
[4985.90 --> 4992.54]  be willing to help themselves and if they're not willing to put the basic work into reading an faq or
[4993.10 --> 4997.10]  watching a video that helps give them a primer so that you're at least speaking the same language
[4997.10 --> 5003.82]  when you're trying to help them then you just got to say like hey you know i really need you to
[5004.62 --> 5009.82]  you know you you there's got to be like a push and a pull here you know like i i can't just be
[5009.82 --> 5015.50]  pushing all the information to you you you got to be you got to be willing to to educate yourself you
[5015.50 --> 5020.70]  know one of the things that was a big change for me is i used to try to respond to every email to our
[5020.70 --> 5025.58]  public email asking for tech support uh this was back like you know eight and a half years ago right
[5026.54 --> 5030.06]  when it wasn't such an incredible volume and i reached the point where i just couldn't do it
[5030.06 --> 5035.18]  every evening from the moment i got off work which was late to the moment i slept which was even later
[5035.18 --> 5039.74]  i would just sit and reply to tweets and i would reply to emails just like helping people with tech
[5039.74 --> 5045.58]  problems i'm like look at a certain point i made myself a a template email and it basically was just
[5045.58 --> 5050.38]  like look i can't do this anymore i'm sorry um you need to go post on the forum or something like
[5050.38 --> 5054.86]  that you got a crowd source you got a crowd source this information it's just not it's not tenable for
[5054.86 --> 5060.54]  me anymore and i would suggest something along those lines like point them to a good resource point them
[5060.54 --> 5066.86]  to r slash build a pc point them to linus tech tips.com and if they and if they exhaust those resources you've
[5066.86 --> 5074.86]  provided and they do not find a solution then okay you know fine fair enough maybe you can make some time to
[5074.86 --> 5080.38]  help them out but they got to do they got to put the work in first you know what i mean okay i'm
[5080.38 --> 5087.42]  ordering my uber now so bell do you mind locking up tonight of course okay thank you so much uh and
[5087.42 --> 5093.66]  then i'm just gonna sprint out of here when when the when the car comes uh what's next oh sorry luke
[5094.46 --> 5099.66]  i can i can finish up merch messages with bell okay cool well uh as soon as it comes i'll i'll go
[5099.66 --> 5106.14]  says it's gonna be about eight minutes um from odin's raven desk pads are awesome but my beautiful
[5106.14 --> 5114.94]  wife wants one in white nick and i talked about this today today my concern and this is me being a
[5114.94 --> 5120.94]  total dinosaur executive is that if we make a white product y'all are going to get coffee stains on them
[5120.94 --> 5127.18]  you're going to post pictures of your amazing setup with my white mouse pad in it and it's going to look
[5127.18 --> 5135.58]  ugly and it's going to be bad bad promotion for our in my opinion quality beautiful product and i had
[5135.58 --> 5141.98]  this argument with nick and sarah back when we did the gpu wasteland one and they got me to agree to do
[5141.98 --> 5149.50]  a light colored mouse pad as a limited edition before we even received the finished units i had gotten
[5149.50 --> 5155.90]  sarah and nick to do a complete 180 on it because sarah had spilled coffee on hers twice and it looked like
[5155.90 --> 5162.38]  ass so that's where i'm at on it nick brought it up to me again today and i said yeah i'll consider it
[5163.02 --> 5169.90]  but i just i i just don't think people should buy it that's the ultimate problem is i don't want to
[5169.90 --> 5175.58]  make products that you're gonna i know you're gonna eat your cheetos you're gonna drink your mountain
[5175.58 --> 5182.70]  dew okay i know it because i'm you i'm there all right you're gonna ruin it and it's and then you're
[5182.70 --> 5189.82]  gonna want a new one and it's just more microplastics and more garbage in an already full of plastic and
[5189.82 --> 5195.34]  garbage world i would rather that we make something that you're going to use for 10 years than something
[5195.34 --> 5202.38]  that you're going to use for 10 months that's my stance on it and that's why we haven't done it
[5202.38 --> 5207.98]  it's not going to be like a lot of them says twitch chat there's also a lot of people saying just
[5207.98 --> 5215.98]  pre-coffee stain the mat but like rings of coffee mug on the mat could work uh i know it's going to be a
[5215.98 --> 5220.46]  lot of them but we should go through any that are specifically addressed at at linus because he's going
[5220.46 --> 5229.10]  to head up oh my god it's not going to get here for 15 minutes i'm going to be so late okay i'll be
[5229.10 --> 5234.78]  fine everything will be fine from jackson yes jackson hi whatever happened to the gold xbox
[5234.78 --> 5241.74]  controller and the diamond play button pc our potential buyer for the gold xbox controller uh
[5242.70 --> 5246.70]  well got sort of screwed over by covid they wanted to come pick it up in person i can understand that
[5246.70 --> 5253.18]  i'd probably want to do the same thing so we haven't sold it yet which means it's still somewhere um
[5253.18 --> 5260.06]  um to be clear when i say somewhere i know where it is but not telling you exactly where it is because
[5260.06 --> 5267.02]  it's like kind of valuable and stuff so it's still somewhere um and if someone wants to buy it i'm open
[5267.02 --> 5271.74]  to it you know you can you can get in touch it's not going to be cheap i consider it worth more than
[5271.74 --> 5278.30]  just the gold and i want to finally make some money on that project so there you go i'm being up front with
[5278.30 --> 5284.38]  y'all as for the diamond play button pc it's still 100 works it's actually in my office on my test bench
[5284.38 --> 5289.50]  right now it's amazing it's so quiet and because of thunderbolt you can even put like a rip in gpu
[5289.50 --> 5295.74]  and it's freaking awesome from many people any updates on the screwdriver or backpack still aiming
[5295.74 --> 5301.66]  for the summer or any changes in that backpack has gone to fabric cutting which means that it is
[5301.66 --> 5306.94]  one step away from mass production all the testing with uh i think we use chima it's the company
[5306.94 --> 5312.78]  that we use for our testing all testing passed with flying colors with respect to durability and
[5312.78 --> 5319.50]  uh water resistance so it it meets our goals internally actually for durability it blew our
[5319.50 --> 5325.26]  goals out of the water it's a freaking durable bag and so that is going into mass production should be
[5325.26 --> 5329.66]  this summer but you never know the worldwide shipping is a a mess that could be locked up i don't
[5329.66 --> 5335.98]  know you got what what's the new what's the new disease uh monkey monkey monkey we got monkey pox
[5335.98 --> 5343.50]  right like i i don't know man so it'll be when it is and as for screwdriver we should have the final
[5343.50 --> 5350.54]  fix to the ratchet next week we're pretty darn sure it involved a new mold so we weren't able we weren't
[5350.54 --> 5356.06]  able to fix it by changing the zinc housing we had to fix it by changing the mold for this little rocker
[5356.06 --> 5362.78]  inside it and with that new mold we should be able to enter mass production for those as well we've got a
[5362.78 --> 5368.54]  lot of parts already shot so people might not realize this but it actually qualifies to be
[5368.54 --> 5375.82]  labeled made in canada all the plastics are were designed and shot here in vancouver the actual um
[5376.78 --> 5383.26]  engineering was done here in vancouver richmond and langley i think like all by companies within this
[5383.26 --> 5387.58]  region uh the patents are owned by mega pro who's a local company they're in port kells they're our
[5387.58 --> 5393.10]  neighbors uh the only thing that's being done overseas is the zinc housing for the ratchet and
[5393.10 --> 5398.94]  then i believe we're doing the shafts themselves uh are the bits done overseas okay i can't remember
[5398.94 --> 5403.10]  i think the bits might be in taiwan and then i think the shaft and the the zinc housing for the ratchet
[5403.10 --> 5408.70]  are done in in china but um but yeah it actually because of the the way the costing works out oh and
[5408.70 --> 5413.26]  the final assembly is all done here it actually qualifies as a made in canada driver which is pretty cool
[5413.26 --> 5419.90]  what was i gonna say where was i going right so a lot of it's actually done like a lot of handles
[5419.90 --> 5424.78]  are shot already and sitting waiting for assembly so as soon as the time comes we're gonna be ready
[5424.78 --> 5429.66]  to rock boys but it's gonna take some time i think the capacity of the of the ratchet factory is like
[5430.86 --> 5436.70]  30 000 units a month or something like that so we're gonna once once we have that locked in we're
[5436.70 --> 5444.30]  gonna go we're gonna be ready all right from christopher christopher sorry how do you feel
[5444.30 --> 5451.18]  about the firewall firewall of firewall boxes i just got the firewall of gold amazed at how apple like
[5451.18 --> 5456.54]  they've made the firewall router without wi-fi it's the first user-friendly networking monitoring
[5456.54 --> 5460.86]  equipment i have never heard of it i'm sorry luke have you ever heard of firewalla
[5460.86 --> 5471.98]  you're muted dog mute king strikes again dude i did so good until the end ah uh no i haven't that
[5471.98 --> 5479.90]  was a it's quite a quite a mouthful though yeah it's a cool name all right um from john what's a good
[5479.90 --> 5486.62]  four to eight bay nas brand hmm you want the nas build that we did recently in a john's bow case with
[5486.62 --> 5492.78]  your own computer in it because it'll be way better just run uh run uh true nas and it'll be
[5492.78 --> 5503.34]  awesome that's what you want yes ask a di ask a diy person get a diy solution from carter having
[5503.34 --> 5507.26]  recently wrote a research paper on passing right to repair legislation i was wondering if you think
[5507.26 --> 5512.22]  there's any situation where right to repair should not include third part third parties due to quality
[5512.22 --> 5530.30]  oh i see um or if first parties are responsible for a quality issue so no the first party just
[5530.30 --> 5535.90]  simply shouldn't be liable for anything that goes wrong with your self-repair i mean i think that much
[5535.90 --> 5541.74]  has been clear for many many years i mean that's that's the reason why ford is not responsible if
[5541.74 --> 5547.42]  your local mechanic shop puts bad brakes on your car they're responsible yeah like this is already the
[5547.42 --> 5554.14]  the craziest thing about the whole right to repair argument is that we already had it it's already
[5554.14 --> 5560.94]  completely solved decades ago we just need to look to the automotive industry where yes they are required
[5560.94 --> 5567.58]  to produce service manuals and they are required to support devices with replacement parts for some
[5567.58 --> 5573.02]  certain amount of time or facilitate the existence of these replacement parts like this is already a
[5573.02 --> 5579.18]  solved problem so everybody shut up and do the solution we already have
[5582.06 --> 5589.58]  sorry okay not no no no i'm calm i'm calm i'm not panicked at all about being late for this thing that
[5589.58 --> 5597.90]  i'm a guest at well to make you feel better we have another question from guther what's a product
[5597.90 --> 5605.90]  you wish you had reviewed when it was relevant oh wow vita maybe that would have been pretty cool
[5605.90 --> 5609.10]  that's such a cool product and i just like i never shared any thoughts on it
[5612.62 --> 5617.74]  yeah i don't know i've just i've had kind of retro consoles on the mind so i uh
[5617.74 --> 5623.42]  i don't know what about you luke what's something that would have been pretty cool i don't know i'm
[5623.42 --> 5633.50]  thinking wrt 54 gl the legendary oh yeah honestly that would have been sick yeah what a legendary
[5633.50 --> 5642.30]  product remember when links was cool yeah press normal folk what is that uh it's a router it was like
[5642.30 --> 5648.22]  the go to router where the l at the end meant that it was linux compatible and you could run
[5648.22 --> 5652.78]  third-party firmwares which at the time was like a big deal and not that common that enabled all kinds
[5652.78 --> 5659.18]  of cool functionality like you could build a mesh network way back in like freaking the mid 2000s with
[5659.18 --> 5664.78]  these things way before like you know the kits you can buy today with like your home mesh setup or
[5664.78 --> 5672.06]  whatever like way back then like ncix's freaking wi-fi ran on wrt 54 gls that were like zip tied into
[5672.06 --> 5679.34]  the rafters in the warehouse like that stuff was so op so sweet there's this sweet spot with technology
[5679.34 --> 5687.18]  um where like honestly for me i don't want it to be too good because there's there's this sweet spot when
[5687.18 --> 5693.74]  it's still kind of jank but you have an enthusiast core behind it that's really motivated and they
[5693.74 --> 5699.90]  make some some stuff for it that's like really cool and it still exposes a lot of its a lot of the ways
[5699.90 --> 5703.82]  that it works and you can tinker with it you can do things and it's awesome but it's it's performance
[5703.82 --> 5707.26]  enough that like when you get it in place and it's done it's actually like a really good experience
[5707.82 --> 5713.26]  that's the sweet spot dude when stuff is in that situation it's great and you know that it's over when
[5713.26 --> 5717.42]  it's not really that fun to play with anymore because you can just set it and forget it and
[5717.42 --> 5722.62]  it's going to be fine anyways and that happens with like almost everything eventually it gets too good
[5722.62 --> 5728.46]  and then it's just like ah but that's the fun of being on the cutting edge right it hurts a little but
[5728.46 --> 5736.14]  it's fun yeah yeah exactly like that that was an extremely fun era of like home networking oh for sure
[5737.34 --> 5737.58]  yeah
[5737.58 --> 5744.86]  relating to our game pass conversation reed asked where do you see gaming pricing going in the future
[5744.86 --> 5749.58]  when cloud streaming becomes a norm do you think we'll just pay for a subscription will you buy games
[5749.58 --> 5755.10]  or rent games i don't see the model changing much for the foreseeable future game pricing has been so
[5755.10 --> 5761.98]  stable for so long that i think it's pretty clear that if there was any way for the industry to push
[5761.98 --> 5768.38]  pricing up they probably would have done it there's there's whole like deeply analytical articles and
[5768.38 --> 5776.06]  videos about why games still cost 60 bucks um so i think you should maybe just explore that rabbit hole
[5776.06 --> 5781.02]  but i think that cloud streaming is ultimately not going to change that model because for the people
[5781.02 --> 5788.22]  that want to own a copy of the game as much as you can own a digital license in you know the the game
[5788.94 --> 5794.22]  uh app store of your choice or whatever um i i don't see why they would discount it any more than
[5794.22 --> 5797.58]  they already do and i don't see how they would get away with increasing the price if they haven't
[5797.58 --> 5805.66]  already so that's kind of my take on that from joshua love the content what's your take on the new
[5805.66 --> 5811.82]  major browser exploits going around first chrome now firefox i've been really busy um every day at work
[5811.82 --> 5816.54]  i do script reviews and meetings and shoot videos and then i go home and i work on setting up my house
[5816.54 --> 5820.94]  so i actually didn't hear about it sorry
[5823.50 --> 5829.42]  yeah i've been like sick and haven't really heard about this but yeah yep fair enough okay
[5832.46 --> 5837.10]  from michael i just got a new job as a civil engineer in a large company how do i convince
[5837.10 --> 5842.22]  them that if you pay me over six figures providing monitors larger than 24 inches is probably worth the
[5842.22 --> 5851.26]  investment there is nobody at our company still stuck on 24 inch monitors that's stupid the amount
[5851.26 --> 5859.10]  that it costs for a 27 or better yet an ultra wide particularly if you are working them spreadsheets
[5859.82 --> 5866.78]  is it it's like it the calculation for when the productivity is worth it is on the order of like
[5866.78 --> 5873.10]  weeks not months like the break-even point like that's you can send them this michael
[5873.98 --> 5879.10]  it is so much faster and so much more efficient to get your work done when you have that extra
[5879.10 --> 5885.18]  stream screen real estate and for how little like a 27 or 32 inch monitor costs these days
[5885.98 --> 5892.94]  especially if you're a large company doing civil engineering um it's trivial it's trivial and and a
[5892.94 --> 5898.38]  second monitor uh yeah you said monitors so i'm assuming that he has two but i'm just making sure
[5898.38 --> 5904.14]  there is there is productivity increases beyond two monitors they get pretty small but they are
[5904.14 --> 5908.62]  there depends but if you have getting to that second order if you have like internal chat or tickets or
[5908.62 --> 5913.26]  something like that that kind of always need to be out it is i need a third monitor that's just the way
[5913.26 --> 5919.34]  it is you you got your two for what i'm doing what i'm referencing and what i kind of need to be aware of
[5919.34 --> 5925.10]  yeah it depends and there's industries where you need like six to nine at like a minimum that's so
[5925.10 --> 5930.70]  it depends what you're working on but like for any random person almost no matter what you're doing
[5930.70 --> 5933.90]  getting a second monitor is an immediate massive improvement to productivity
[5937.18 --> 5943.10]  okay i must go you gotta go i think that's the end of the merch messages anyway though
[5943.10 --> 5949.82]  oh nice awesome okay well hey that was a fun show thanks guys for tuning in we'll see you again next
[5949.82 --> 5953.42]  week same bad time same bad channel bye
[5960.54 --> 5962.62]  did you mock me sir yes i do
[5965.98 --> 5972.46]  uh okay uh bell i need to run to the sidewalk uh okay are you gonna all right here i'll turn off
[5972.46 --> 5985.50]  here
