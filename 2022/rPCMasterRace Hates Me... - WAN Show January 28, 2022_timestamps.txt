I don't want to sound like a dick, but I honestly don't want to watch 45 minutes of birdsite flamewars over who gets to see or not see what on their computers.  thanks NoKi1119 for the timestamps, you're the hero of the show.

Linus cleared it up though, so I'm actually fine with it: *privateering.*
I have content/ad blocking myself, but I have deserving channels whitelisted; Being aware of its effects and with everything considered, I am able to choose this decision I have.
Thank you for clearing it up at least!

Silly times-stamps:
0:46:15 "[…] set them all to be the same password […]" Luke facial reaction.
1:13:27 "That's my favorite big red dragon right there!"   [context 1:12:55]
1:28:36 "They wanna be the best" "That no one ever was", English Pokemon OP song reference.  [1:27:44]
1:37:35 "[…] or do you have a wondering eye", then Distracted Boyfriend meme reference.
1:40:18 "Where do you live? ♪ Where do you come from, where do you go? ♪", Cotton Eye Joe song reference.
2:19:57 "That's a cool story, bro," sincerely.
2:39:17 "Only you can end the WAN Show" "No u"  (am aware this one's also listed in the main timestamps too, and das good)
