[0.00 --> 7.92]  What is up ladies and gentlemen how are you all doing it's Friday and it's time for the WAN show
[7.92 --> 14.16]  at least a hour and 20 minutes ago it was yeah but that's okay because I was at Hoffman's doing
[14.16 --> 21.18]  one of our best Intel extreme tech upgrades yet that's right same $5,000 budget as everyone else
[21.18 --> 28.56]  but Hoffman wasn't content to upgrade his PC Hoffman wasn't content to get a new TV
[28.56 --> 37.50]  Hoffman wasn't content to build a sick NAS and have like a sick studio monitor audio setup
[37.50 --> 46.56]  Hoffman did all of those things oh I haven't done the math but I don't think it quite adds up and I
[46.56 --> 54.66]  think he might have stolen more gear from the office more brazenly than anyone yet to this point yeah I
[54.66 --> 60.36]  can never have an upgrade oh because I'm gonna find everything I don't I don't think you own
[60.36 --> 65.64]  anything that didn't come from the office yeah probably not we've got a great show for you guys
[65.64 --> 73.50]  today valve has partnered with I fix it to offer replacement parts for the steam deck and get this
[73.50 --> 79.56]  they did us one better and they're working on replacement parts for the valve index as well
[79.56 --> 88.88]  freaking a ladies and gentlemen in other news Nintendo hey the polar opposite Nintendo shuts
[88.88 --> 95.74]  down the Wii U and 3DS eShops cutting off the only legal option to purchase that library of games
[95.74 --> 100.44]  thanks Nintendo I sure won't have to resort to any kind of
[100.44 --> 108.66]  piracy or privateering or yeah you like the like that ship right there it's got a little jolly Roger on
[108.66 --> 113.10]  the top and everything we're gonna have some details about this a little bit later what else we got today
[113.10 --> 119.16]  uh in in continuing bad news Microsoft will soon require a Microsoft account and internet connection
[119.16 --> 128.48]  to set up Windows 11 Pro uh that's that's good that's that's good right also Dr. Ian Cutras Dr. Cutras leaves an
[128.48 --> 130.62]  ant-tech Dr. Mega Transfers per second
[130.62 --> 141.54]  which I don't know it might might be good for Ian depends on where he's going maybe maybe he's going to work at Burger King
[141.54 --> 149.12]  yeah do they have Burger King in the UK I have no idea hey respect to Burger King employees by the way I do love me a Whopper do you
[149.12 --> 157.48]  yeah it's it's I haven't had one in a while it's sort of a bad burger but I can't remember the last time yeah it's not that great it might have been literally when I was in high school
[157.48 --> 163.06]  uh we did it
[163.06 --> 167.54]  oh man
[167.54 --> 185.44]  the show is brought to you by Corsair how appropriate Squarespace and
[185.44 --> 188.26]  Zoho CRM
[188.26 --> 193.02]  I was saying before the show started in in the in the name of like what these shirts are talking about it representing
[193.02 --> 200.12]  yes you should have had like one or like three or something one or just have the Corsair logo instead of the pirate ship
[200.12 --> 205.32]  I don't think Corsair wants to get drawn into our nonsense
[205.32 --> 210.22]  probably not um love our friends at Corsair and you know who we really love these days
[210.22 --> 218.88]  Valve has been just on freaking fire lately so this story comes from Valve's own blog
[218.88 --> 226.16]  uh Steam Deck replacement parts look at this we've got a freaking amazing x-ray image
[226.16 --> 232.24]  I know isn't that stuff so cool if you watch the video as well they they go 360 they go all the way around
[232.24 --> 236.52]  um the x-ray image and it looks absolutely fantastic absolutely love it
[236.52 --> 239.56]  iFixit posted their tear down of the Steam Deck so
[239.56 --> 242.92]  uh Valve linked to that as well obviously
[242.92 --> 246.94]  no one's gonna do a better tear down of the Steam Deck than iFixit
[246.94 --> 250.68]  that's great freaking love it but that's not the big news
[250.68 --> 253.12]  Valve posts things in their blog all the time
[253.12 --> 255.24]  presumably actually i don't really follow the iFixit
[255.24 --> 258.08]  I found it kind of cool actually that they posted this in their blog
[258.08 --> 260.42]  with a 7 out of 10
[260.42 --> 262.54]  yep
[262.54 --> 264.70]  spoiler alert the score that they got was 7 out of 10
[264.70 --> 265.00]  yep
[265.00 --> 269.52]  which is solid especially for like a a all encapsulated device
[269.52 --> 270.02]  yep
[270.02 --> 271.38]  but it's not like perfect
[271.38 --> 271.66]  nope
[271.66 --> 274.96]  and Valve still posted this whole thing and was like yeah we're proud of this
[274.96 --> 278.32]  they're taking a pretty overall transparent approach to things
[278.32 --> 278.58]  yeah
[278.58 --> 282.94]  uh but the big news of course is that Valve has committed
[282.94 --> 289.04]  to iFixit as one of the partners that they are going to be working through
[289.04 --> 292.76]  for Steam Deck replacement parts and not just Steam Deck replacement parts
[292.76 --> 296.82]  but also and this is something that I specifically brought up with Valve
[296.82 --> 300.68]  because I was extremely frustrated about something that happened with my personal index
[300.68 --> 305.10]  uh also Valve Index VR headset replacement parts
[305.10 --> 306.94]  so here's the details
[306.94 --> 309.30]  uh Valve is still hammering out the details
[309.30 --> 310.26]  hey
[310.26 --> 315.70]  um the main complaints that iFixit had were the difficulty in removing the battery
[315.70 --> 317.76]  and not having a modular charge port
[317.76 --> 318.10]  yeah
[318.10 --> 319.46]  most of the other parts are modular
[319.46 --> 321.62]  entry is relatively simple uh simple
[321.62 --> 322.58]  there's a lot to like
[322.58 --> 327.10]  and they are really that's it
[327.10 --> 328.44]  we don't have a ton of details
[328.44 --> 330.66]  but what we can talk about at the very least
[330.66 --> 336.50]  is what this is like compared to the process that you would have to go through for something else
[336.50 --> 338.72]  i mean if you buy a handheld from Nintendo
[338.72 --> 341.94]  you buy a controller from someone like a Sony or a Microsoft
[341.94 --> 345.46]  if you're within warranty and you have some kind of problem
[345.46 --> 348.60]  whether it's a failing battery on a PlayStation controller
[348.60 --> 350.60]  less of a concern with Microsoft's controllers
[350.60 --> 353.84]  i know that's a super polarizing issue
[353.84 --> 356.80]  Microsoft's use of AA batteries in their Xbox controllers
[356.80 --> 358.08]  for me it's such a no-brainer
[358.08 --> 362.46]  because you could you you can use your own rechargeable batteries
[362.46 --> 363.24]  it doesn't have to
[363.24 --> 364.32]  you don't have to buy throwaways
[364.32 --> 365.96]  you don't have to buy disposable batteries
[365.96 --> 366.96]  there's very good rechargeable batteries
[366.96 --> 370.12]  please stop buying disposable batteries
[370.12 --> 372.62]  anyway that's a whole whole separate conversation
[372.62 --> 374.64]  so whatever it is that you buy
[374.64 --> 376.26]  within your warranty period
[376.26 --> 378.78]  if something goes wrong in most cases
[378.78 --> 381.10]  so so even though they will cover you
[381.10 --> 382.82]  they will they will get you a new one
[382.82 --> 385.18]  in most cases as far as i can tell
[385.18 --> 388.06]  there is little or no effort made
[388.06 --> 394.10]  to reclaim the the the the still working components
[394.10 --> 396.20]  yeah i mean i could be mistaken
[396.20 --> 399.78]  does Microsoft sell refurbished controllers for example
[399.78 --> 403.78]  uh or are these done through third parties
[403.78 --> 407.76]  xbox refurbished controller
[407.76 --> 408.22]  here we go
[408.22 --> 408.72]  best buy
[408.72 --> 409.90]  best buy has xbox
[409.90 --> 410.36]  i was gonna say
[410.36 --> 412.26]  i feel like i've seen that before
[412.26 --> 413.92]  but this is geek squad certified
[413.92 --> 416.04]  so what does that even mean
[416.04 --> 417.38]  that sounds like a return
[417.38 --> 419.14]  yeah
[419.14 --> 422.36]  walmart also has refurbished controllers
[422.36 --> 424.54]  but from where
[424.54 --> 426.70]  where do these refurbished controllers come from
[426.70 --> 427.86]  it says the
[427.86 --> 431.84]  it says the brand is microsoft
[431.84 --> 434.86]  okay that doesn't necessarily help us that much
[434.86 --> 435.58]  yeah not 100%
[435.58 --> 437.52]  destroyer samuel says i think they do
[437.52 --> 438.24]  so that's great
[438.24 --> 440.14]  as long as it's within warranty
[440.14 --> 441.06]  you're covered
[441.06 --> 441.90]  fantastic
[441.90 --> 443.36]  but
[443.36 --> 445.60]  what if there was a way
[445.60 --> 447.66]  for even if you were outside of warranty
[447.66 --> 449.80]  to replace that controller
[449.80 --> 451.58]  or the component of that controller
[451.58 --> 453.10]  that was failed
[453.10 --> 455.74]  without actually discarding the whole thing
[455.74 --> 457.52]  or or sending it away to be refurbished
[457.52 --> 459.24]  what if it was something that could be serviced on your own
[459.24 --> 461.46]  you haven't taken apart a steam deck yet
[461.46 --> 462.02]  no
[462.02 --> 463.82]  but i have watched the whole iFixit video
[463.82 --> 465.26]  i can tell you
[465.26 --> 466.48]  having having done it
[466.48 --> 468.64]  it's as easy as they make it look
[468.64 --> 470.66]  if not actually more so
[470.66 --> 471.38]  and there is
[471.38 --> 471.80]  there is
[471.80 --> 472.88]  they do point out like
[472.88 --> 474.34]  like replacing that battery
[474.34 --> 476.52]  would make me
[476.52 --> 477.74]  cringe
[478.26 --> 479.28]  and not from like
[479.28 --> 481.66]  the modern interpretation of cringe
[481.66 --> 482.48]  but it would make me cringe
[482.48 --> 484.30]  because i'd be very concerned about like
[484.30 --> 485.84]  breaking the screen and stuff
[485.84 --> 486.74]  because the amount of pressure
[486.74 --> 487.12]  they have
[487.12 --> 487.66]  yeah the battery
[487.66 --> 489.66]  the battery replacement is not good
[489.66 --> 489.94]  the battery replacement is rough
[489.94 --> 490.92]  they need to improve that
[490.92 --> 491.18]  but
[491.18 --> 493.06]  we said we don't have a lot of details
[493.06 --> 494.12]  that's probably because
[494.12 --> 494.72]  to be honest
[494.72 --> 495.88]  you should go watch the iFixit video
[495.88 --> 496.52]  it's fantastic
[496.52 --> 498.00]  but
[498.00 --> 499.56]  the fact that you can
[499.56 --> 501.38]  individually replace the thumbsticks
[501.38 --> 502.36]  the fact that you can
[502.36 --> 503.20]  individually replace
[503.20 --> 504.22]  so many different things
[504.22 --> 504.88]  it's
[504.88 --> 506.00]  it's really nice
[506.00 --> 506.48]  like the
[506.48 --> 507.18]  the
[507.18 --> 509.20]  i understand why they lost points
[509.20 --> 510.84]  and what they lost points for
[510.84 --> 511.64]  makes sense
[511.64 --> 512.70]  but
[512.70 --> 514.48]  the things that they gained points on
[514.48 --> 515.44]  were really strong
[515.44 --> 515.86]  yeah
[515.86 --> 516.72]  like it wasn't like
[516.72 --> 517.16]  oh okay
[517.16 --> 517.66]  they sort of
[517.66 --> 518.66]  they got that checkbox
[518.66 --> 519.46]  so they get that point
[519.46 --> 521.06]  like it was very very good
[521.06 --> 522.42]  in each one of those categories
[522.42 --> 524.46]  and i think they should get credit for that
[524.46 --> 524.84]  okay
[524.84 --> 525.26]  hey
[525.26 --> 526.42]  thanks very much
[526.42 --> 527.34]  floatplane chat
[527.34 --> 528.00]  um
[528.00 --> 530.42]  microsoft uses refurb controllers
[530.42 --> 531.70]  for warranty replacements
[531.70 --> 533.50]  and it was pointed out
[533.50 --> 534.98]  that microsoft's controller warranty
[534.98 --> 536.66]  is actually only 90 days
[536.66 --> 537.18]  making it
[537.18 --> 538.42]  basically worthless
[538.42 --> 540.78]  how is that even legal
[540.78 --> 542.06]  that's pretty brutal
[542.06 --> 543.58]  a 90 day warranty
[543.58 --> 545.68]  on like a 70 dollar product
[545.68 --> 548.02]  sorry i'm speaking in canadian rubles here
[548.02 --> 549.34]  i think they were closer to 50
[549.34 --> 550.26]  or something like that
[550.26 --> 551.48]  that's brutal
[551.48 --> 552.34]  that is really brutal
[552.34 --> 554.30]  i don't i don't like it
[554.30 --> 555.54]  surprised it's not a one year minimum
[555.54 --> 556.14]  so
[556.14 --> 558.88]  i want to tell my story about what happened with the index
[558.88 --> 561.92]  because it was actually a pretty similar situation
[561.92 --> 564.46]  to what someone might find themselves in with the steam deck
[564.46 --> 566.58]  i have no idea what happened
[566.58 --> 568.52]  and this is sort of unique to vr
[568.52 --> 571.38]  because i was in vr
[571.38 --> 572.82]  and everything was fine
[572.82 --> 574.82]  and i came out of vr
[574.82 --> 577.38]  and one of my thumbstick tops was missing
[577.38 --> 578.90]  okay
[578.90 --> 581.40]  did it fall off on its own
[581.40 --> 582.74]  maybe
[582.74 --> 585.60]  did i knock it off while
[585.60 --> 588.38]  flailing around playing beat favor
[588.38 --> 588.70]  yeah
[588.70 --> 590.28]  probably not
[590.28 --> 591.50]  but maybe
[591.50 --> 592.16]  but maybe
[592.16 --> 597.30]  but what was frustrating for me about it
[597.30 --> 598.08]  was that
[598.08 --> 600.34]  a i was out of warranty
[600.34 --> 601.94]  which i was fine with
[601.94 --> 602.92]  this is like
[602.92 --> 606.68]  i i feel like this narrative is gonna get turned around on me somehow
[606.68 --> 607.40]  like i've just
[607.40 --> 607.90]  that happens
[607.90 --> 609.98]  yeah i've had a i've had a fantastic
[609.98 --> 612.22]  yeah i've had a fantastic streak lately
[612.22 --> 614.06]  of saying things
[614.06 --> 615.94]  and then replying to posts
[615.94 --> 617.78]  where people are absolutely outraged
[617.78 --> 620.34]  that i would say a thing i completely didn't say
[620.34 --> 622.96]  yeah which is awesome always the most fun
[622.96 --> 623.36]  primo
[623.36 --> 625.84]  um because it's kind of like what happened with the imac
[625.84 --> 628.46]  i was outraged that apple wouldn't fix it
[628.46 --> 631.64]  not because i wasn't willing to pay for it
[631.64 --> 633.46]  i was outraged because it's your product
[633.46 --> 636.06]  and you're not providing me replacement parts
[636.06 --> 637.86]  so you better be able to fix it
[637.86 --> 639.88]  that just seems very straightforward
[639.88 --> 641.94]  and you guys were happy to pay like
[641.94 --> 643.38]  apple fees
[643.38 --> 643.76]  yeah
[643.76 --> 644.22]  to fix it
[644.22 --> 644.84]  yeah yeah yeah yeah
[644.84 --> 646.52]  like it was expected to be expensive
[646.52 --> 647.06]  they said
[647.06 --> 648.08]  they just wanted to fix it
[648.08 --> 648.78]  they said no
[648.78 --> 650.86]  we will not fix it
[650.86 --> 652.16]  them saying no is the problem
[652.16 --> 652.52]  buh-bye
[652.52 --> 653.64]  not there being a price
[653.64 --> 655.90]  yeah it's it was the imac pro
[655.90 --> 658.74]  and there was literally nothing professional
[658.74 --> 661.90]  about the experience of getting that product serviced
[661.90 --> 663.90]  so um so anyway
[663.90 --> 665.32]  my warranty was up
[665.32 --> 666.82]  so i was a little choked about that
[666.82 --> 668.28]  i contacted valve support
[668.28 --> 671.68]  and honestly my whole experience with the index has been terrible
[671.68 --> 673.64]  a it wasn't available in my country
[673.64 --> 677.54]  so i had to find someone in the u.s to buy it and ship it to me
[677.54 --> 679.14]  which then caused problems
[679.14 --> 682.36]  when i had not one but two components fail
[682.36 --> 682.88]  three
[682.88 --> 685.10]  have i gone through this two or three times
[685.10 --> 686.14]  i can't i can't remember
[686.14 --> 686.92]  the point is
[686.92 --> 688.84]  i've had to go through valve support
[688.84 --> 692.96]  every single time i contact valve support about this stupid thing
[692.96 --> 693.84]  they're like
[693.84 --> 697.20]  we are very confused as to why you have this thing
[697.20 --> 699.44]  uh it doesn't appear to be under the right account
[699.44 --> 699.90]  i'm like
[699.90 --> 701.42]  okay
[701.42 --> 704.16]  you're in the support ticket system right
[704.16 --> 707.26]  so why don't you just spend four seconds
[707.26 --> 710.08]  looking at if i've ever contacted support about this
[710.08 --> 711.28]  i have
[711.28 --> 712.08]  if you
[712.08 --> 714.80]  rather than me typing up this long explanation
[714.80 --> 716.90]  that's going through this whole song and dance again
[716.90 --> 718.76]  because the first time i contacted them
[718.76 --> 720.72]  it was like two day response times every time
[720.72 --> 724.26]  like it was really slow and we had to go back and forth like four times i was like
[724.26 --> 725.02]  guys
[725.02 --> 725.88]  oh it's base stations
[725.88 --> 727.74]  i had base stations fail a couple times
[727.74 --> 728.54]  okay guys
[728.54 --> 731.28]  i would like to use my vr headset
[731.28 --> 736.12]  i i don't even like i don't even i don't even mind that they're you know
[736.12 --> 737.80]  we got to work through this stuff
[737.80 --> 738.52]  but
[738.52 --> 741.08]  this thing at the time
[741.08 --> 742.96]  this thing hasn't even been out for a year
[742.96 --> 744.82]  so does it have a one year warranty
[744.82 --> 745.72]  okay
[745.72 --> 747.10]  then what's the question
[747.10 --> 749.64]  that's something that has always triggered me
[749.64 --> 751.14]  when you contact a company
[751.14 --> 753.08]  about a warranty replacement
[753.08 --> 753.96]  and they go
[753.96 --> 755.22]  oh well
[755.22 --> 757.18]  here's a bunch of paperwork
[757.18 --> 759.88]  to demonstrate that it's within its warranty period
[759.88 --> 760.54]  and you go
[760.54 --> 763.64]  this product launched 46 days ago
[763.64 --> 766.26]  unless i have a time machine
[766.26 --> 768.18]  or my name is marquez brownlee
[768.18 --> 770.06]  i haven't had it for a year
[770.06 --> 771.46]  okay
[771.46 --> 773.40]  why would it
[773.40 --> 774.12]  is that a reference
[774.12 --> 775.02]  it's it's a thing
[775.02 --> 775.52]  it's a thing
[775.52 --> 777.58]  he opens so many of his videos with
[777.58 --> 779.90]  so i've been using this for whatever
[779.90 --> 781.44]  and it's like kind of a meme in the community
[781.44 --> 782.20]  yeah yeah okay
[782.20 --> 783.62]  the point is
[783.62 --> 785.24]  my experience with valve support
[785.24 --> 787.02]  has been overall positive
[787.02 --> 788.18]  but imperfect
[788.18 --> 790.70]  so i contacted them about this controller
[790.70 --> 791.68]  i'm like proactively
[791.68 --> 792.32]  i'm like hey
[792.32 --> 794.64]  can we just not do that whole thing this time
[794.64 --> 796.88]  i don't even want a warranty replacement
[796.88 --> 798.78]  i think i'm outside of warranty
[798.78 --> 799.66]  it doesn't matter
[799.66 --> 801.94]  the thing is not overall broken
[801.94 --> 805.08]  my thumbstick just got disappeared
[805.08 --> 807.12]  i would just like a new one of those
[807.12 --> 809.08]  and they were just like
[809.08 --> 810.22]  mmm
[810.22 --> 811.44]  no
[811.44 --> 813.02]  as a show of good faith
[813.02 --> 815.00]  we will cover it for you under warranty
[815.00 --> 816.24]  but
[816.24 --> 817.72]  um
[817.72 --> 819.88]  this is your last one
[819.88 --> 820.42]  by the way
[820.42 --> 821.74]  i think i think they mentioned that
[821.74 --> 822.66]  don't quote me on that one
[822.66 --> 824.68]  uh but i could tell there was some
[824.68 --> 826.16]  there was some hesitation about
[826.16 --> 827.28]  covering it under warranty
[827.28 --> 828.22]  which is fine
[828.22 --> 829.00]  because it was out of warranty
[829.00 --> 830.22]  i didn't expect them to do it at all
[830.22 --> 832.08]  i expected to repair it myself
[832.08 --> 833.14]  and then
[833.14 --> 834.04]  they were like
[834.04 --> 835.46]  and we don't do that
[835.46 --> 836.72]  we have no way of doing that
[836.72 --> 838.60]  and i was really disappointed at the time
[838.60 --> 839.40]  because
[839.40 --> 841.06]  it was less about
[841.06 --> 842.62]  that i wanted the replacement
[842.62 --> 843.66]  i could just buy a new one
[843.66 --> 843.88]  they gave you a whole controller
[843.88 --> 844.34]  didn't they
[844.34 --> 844.56]  yeah
[844.56 --> 845.62]  so they swapped
[845.62 --> 847.60]  a whole new controller out for it
[847.60 --> 849.46]  and that wasn't the solution i wanted
[849.46 --> 850.98]  i actually was like
[850.98 --> 852.00]  kind of looking forward to
[852.00 --> 852.76]  ripping it apart
[852.76 --> 854.02]  and and replacing it
[854.02 --> 854.68]  and quite frankly
[854.68 --> 855.92]  i expect that to be
[855.92 --> 857.30]  much more difficult
[857.30 --> 858.58]  than something like the steam deck
[858.58 --> 859.08]  because
[859.08 --> 861.12]  of all of the sensors
[861.12 --> 861.86]  oh yeah
[861.86 --> 862.54]  just
[862.54 --> 863.44]  like
[863.44 --> 864.38]  covering
[864.38 --> 866.70]  the outside of the index controllers
[866.70 --> 867.84]  like it was going to be
[867.84 --> 868.34]  what are they called
[868.34 --> 869.50]  knuckles controllers i think
[869.50 --> 870.02]  is like the
[870.02 --> 871.26]  the cool name for them
[871.26 --> 873.74]  i i expected it to be an absolute nightmare
[873.74 --> 874.64]  but i i don't know
[874.64 --> 875.82]  i kind of wanted to tackle it anyway
[875.82 --> 876.64]  i thought it might be fun
[876.64 --> 878.72]  and they just had absolutely
[878.72 --> 881.22]  no way to deal with that whatsoever
[881.22 --> 881.84]  uh
[881.84 --> 883.40]  oh no jayden
[883.40 --> 884.68]  one of our floatplane dads
[884.68 --> 885.00]  was like
[885.00 --> 886.82]  i am presently in customer support
[886.82 --> 887.62]  hell for my index
[887.62 --> 888.70]  that came with a broken speaker
[888.70 --> 890.50]  i'm so sorry to hear
[890.50 --> 891.10]  that your
[891.10 --> 892.56]  that your vr headset
[892.56 --> 893.72]  that you will not be able
[893.72 --> 895.18]  to beat me at beat saber with
[895.18 --> 896.54]  is not working properly
[896.54 --> 898.22]  that's a real shame jayden
[898.22 --> 900.22]  is this challenge version 2
[900.22 --> 901.08]  no no no no
[901.08 --> 902.02]  there's no challenge
[902.02 --> 903.46]  i jayden came in
[903.46 --> 905.14]  schooled me on my own headset
[905.14 --> 906.30]  and that's honestly
[906.30 --> 907.56]  a big part of what got me
[907.56 --> 908.72]  like heavy into beat saber
[908.72 --> 911.38]  because you don't set the high score
[911.38 --> 913.48]  on somebody else's gaming device
[913.48 --> 914.54]  well
[914.54 --> 915.54]  okay it's rude
[915.54 --> 916.06]  you would
[916.06 --> 916.94]  i totally would
[916.94 --> 917.26]  yeah
[917.26 --> 918.74]  but it's rude
[918.74 --> 920.60]  it's just
[920.60 --> 921.60]  i'm just saying
[921.60 --> 923.44]  it's a rude thing to do
[923.44 --> 923.90]  all right
[923.90 --> 925.52]  um
[925.52 --> 927.06]  hey jayden look
[927.06 --> 928.00]  at least yours
[928.00 --> 929.26]  isn't a us unit
[929.26 --> 930.72]  and you have to explain
[930.72 --> 931.18]  why
[931.18 --> 932.10]  your name
[932.10 --> 933.10]  in your profile
[933.10 --> 934.28]  says linus sebastian
[934.28 --> 935.48]  but the name on the invoice
[935.48 --> 936.62]  says john martin
[936.62 --> 937.74]  so john
[937.74 --> 939.18]  john arranged it for me
[939.18 --> 943.20]  i was like i could tell you were gonna say the person's name and i was like hold on
[943.20 --> 944.04]  i was like okay
[944.04 --> 951.64]  yeah no it's all it's all it's all good what i was like look john you know we facilitated your relocation
[951.64 --> 958.78]  can you do me a solid and use your special murica powers to obtain an index and ship it to me
[958.78 --> 961.16]  he's like don't worry i got you bro
[961.16 --> 963.08]  thank you very much
[963.08 --> 966.76]  um what am i even supposed to be talking about right now right
[966.76 --> 993.76]  we're talking about this is great so they've gone from me being extremely disappointed because i wanted to be able to repair my own my own valve crap to working with partners to provide these parts and working with partners is actually such a good way to do this because something that i think a lot of people don't necessarily realize if they haven't worked in distribution or warehousing or retail is how complicated it can be when you've got something that doesn't fit into your regular workflow
[993.76 --> 996.76]  at ncix
[996.76 --> 998.76]  i wanted to bring in water cooling
[998.76 --> 1009.76]  and at that time the only shops that carried water cooling stuff were really boutique i'm talking like adp mods i'm talking frozen cpu
[1009.76 --> 1039.74]  like those those old school water cooling first everything else later kinds of shops petra's tech shop okay like those kinds of shops and for them the concept of having an entire spool of tubing and just measuring it according to whatever it said on the invoice and then packing it into the box was no problem but here's what you guys probably don't realize if you've never
[1039.74 --> 1054.74]  worked like in a warehouse before is that you can't count on every single person in the warehouse to have the same level of like game sense and capability
[1054.74 --> 1083.74]  if ncix okay if ncix had had a by the foot method of buying tubing because that's what i wanted to do because i was like well obviously they should just pick how much tubing they want and then they should get exactly that amount and my boss basically sits me down he goes look if it's on the invoice tubing per foot times six half the time
[1083.74 --> 1092.74]  half the time they're gonna end up with six one foot chunks of freaking tubing and the other half the time they're gonna end up with six whole spools
[1092.74 --> 1099.74]  and we're gonna end up with like a six hundred dollar shipping bill and i'm like
[1099.74 --> 1101.74]  right
[1101.74 --> 1112.74]  so that's actually that's actually one of my like proudest innovations in like it's it's one of those hilarious things that nobody would ever know if i didn't bring it up
[1112.74 --> 1130.74]  but i am the driving force behind why water cooling tubing comes pre-packaged in ten foot length the ten foot box the ten foot box that's me i because because our warehouse could not be trusted to measure length of tubing and put it in a box and because to my knowledge we were the first component first water cooling second retailer to actually sort of try to ship any kind of volume of this stuff and i'm not going to
[1130.74 --> 1142.86]  put it in a box so that was my operation till i was moved on so i cried and i peter missed the efеты Conservative
[1142.86 --> 1152.90]  we would've been really convinced boves swiftecky that was a usual number of commodities but it's a huge deal on the webvasat house
[1152.90 --> 1159.30]  like like kitchen cling wrap like thuran wrap yeah exactly right because they didn't have a system
[1159.30 --> 1165.46]  for it they were like this is the stupidest thing ever it comes in bulk from taigon or like uh clear
[1165.46 --> 1172.26]  flex or whatever why would anyone why would anyone want to have like two feet of extra tubing left
[1172.26 --> 1178.34]  over after they finish their build this is so dumb and i was like look if you guys can't figure this
[1178.34 --> 1183.70]  out either i'm gonna have to stand in the back of the warehouse and cut this these things and wrap
[1183.70 --> 1188.26]  them up and i can't i have other things to do or your warehouse is going to have to do it because
[1188.26 --> 1193.62]  i trust you to be half burn halfway near competent and then my warehouse can just have one thing
[1193.62 --> 1201.62]  with one label to put in the box and ship so that that is my my innovation because i i remember
[1201.62 --> 1207.46]  the transition of like stupid problems need stupid solutions needing to buy from frozen cpu yeah and
[1207.46 --> 1212.26]  then being able to get it from ncx but it was like this ran wrapped and then being able to get it
[1212.26 --> 1216.18]  from ncx and it was in those like black boxes i don't even remember who uh that would have been
[1216.18 --> 1221.62]  primo chill i think was the first one to have like boxes really nice with like often like a little thing
[1221.62 --> 1229.70]  of colorant or whatever yeah it was like a pre-prep thing that they put in yeah yeah oh no wait there
[1229.70 --> 1234.98]  was someone that we did dies with i can't remember it might have been primo chill i actually i i don't
[1234.98 --> 1240.26]  quote the second you said primo chill i remember their name on the box i think that was right yeah
[1240.26 --> 1244.10]  it might have been it they might have had both options it might have been primo chill but yeah
[1244.10 --> 1250.02]  that's that's the whole story and the rest is basically history um it's pretty funny actually
[1250.02 --> 1253.94]  that's the whole start of it and it's that and that's interesting insight because before the show
[1253.94 --> 1258.26]  yeah um we we stopped talking about it because we were like save it for the show but i was wondering
[1258.26 --> 1262.34]  i was thinking i was like they're they're clearly shipping hardware like it's not a company that has not
[1262.34 --> 1266.98]  shipped hardware before why don't they do the sub components there's probably a reason but i don't
[1266.98 --> 1273.30]  know and that's it and that makes sense that's exactly it when your eye fix it there is a certain
[1273.30 --> 1280.42]  level of aptitude that you're going to be expected to have and you will be you will be expected to
[1280.42 --> 1285.62]  recognize oh no this is completely the wrong joystick assembly how did this end up in the wrong bin let
[1285.62 --> 1291.46]  me put that away this is the right like you will be expected to have that degree of knowledge valve
[1292.10 --> 1299.46]  can't necessarily expect this is a gigantic box that says index on it blonk exactly this is a decently
[1299.46 --> 1305.70]  charged box that says one barcode on it one line item on the invoice it has to be that simple when
[1305.70 --> 1312.02]  you're operating at scale so that's why you need to build partnerships with smaller more boutique
[1312.02 --> 1317.38]  distributors when you want to do something like this so i understand why it didn't happen overnight
[1317.38 --> 1324.98]  and massive respect to valve for figuring it out getting it done i'm so excited and i have another
[1324.98 --> 1330.58]  thing to tell you guys i'm really excited about here yeah and that is that the privateer shirt is
[1331.14 --> 1337.94]  live there's a lot of really cool stuff to go over with this particular shirt first and foremost is that
[1337.94 --> 1347.46]  this is the first design in our new colored our own branded t-shirts that's right ladies and gentlemen
[1347.46 --> 1354.18]  we are no longer simply printing on american apparel shirts these have been probably about two years in
[1354.18 --> 1360.58]  the making so that's not about right nick basically two years in the freaking making uh we went through
[1360.58 --> 1368.34]  oh my god over 10 well probably over 20 different suppliers all told trying to trying to get this
[1368.34 --> 1377.78]  nailed down at least round yeah at least that it was not freaking simple to get a basic high quality
[1377.78 --> 1386.02]  t-shirt like why is it this hard well because you're the customer okay i'm a difficult customer i will grant
[1386.02 --> 1392.74]  you that but i they are good i wasn't willing to settle for almost as good as what we had we were
[1392.74 --> 1399.06]  only going to be able to start doing our own blanks if they were as good or better and the skin feel is
[1399.06 --> 1404.10]  absolutely freaking fantastic i think the fit is great the fabric hang just the like the way it hangs
[1404.10 --> 1411.30]  i think is absolutely awesome and this is our first design on it sarah did this actually if you're
[1411.30 --> 1416.90]  subscribing on floatplane there's a vod of it sarah did a four hour stream did you know do you know
[1416.90 --> 1423.14]  about this yeah yeah so sarah did a design stream where she really went into her creative process how
[1423.14 --> 1429.70]  she how she goes start to finish how it goes when she creates a design so she worked on this whole thing
[1429.70 --> 1434.98]  with her we had her her drawing tablet like captured it was she using an ipad i think for this one yeah
[1434.98 --> 1443.78]  uh so that was really cool and then finally we've got colors we've launched the first colored shirt
[1443.78 --> 1452.50]  on the store in since constellations three years because the problem is that aside okay honestly i
[1452.50 --> 1457.86]  never would have needed to switch away from american apparel if they had managed to keep their
[1457.86 --> 1462.98]  distribution in order but we couldn't get consistent there is another issue i do know about that one
[1462.98 --> 1468.18]  i was just gonna jump in yeah you're not on mic if you don't come a little closer though we placed an
[1468.18 --> 1477.06]  order for black shirts yeah in august and i'm still waiting on like 2 000 of them to show up now
[1478.18 --> 1485.86]  yeah like it's it's bad yeah and that's black shirts that's black shirts so we've had to stalk like
[1485.86 --> 1491.78]  i remember nick and i having a conversation where he goes this is a lot of money um
[1493.14 --> 1499.14]  and i know it's really stupid for us to essentially be a t-shirt warehouse but we have to order in this
[1499.14 --> 1506.98]  volume because the supply is so inconsistent that if we don't we will be a t-shirt store with no t-shirts
[1506.98 --> 1511.78]  which is essentially what american apparel is at this point the the nice thing is with these t-shirts
[1511.78 --> 1516.18]  it's only going to take like three months to get a restock even though we're literally shipping them
[1516.18 --> 1525.54]  from like china so yeah and and because we're dying our own raw fabric we can get them in any color we
[1525.54 --> 1531.86]  want we they don't have to all be black like oh man it didn't even matter how far ahead we ordered
[1531.86 --> 1537.94]  any color other than black it was just it was a joke like it was an absolute freaking joke so we're
[1537.94 --> 1543.38]  launching our first colored shirts and we're going big or going home here ladies and gentlemen because
[1543.38 --> 1547.70]  we've got there's a question in the full plane chat six different colors uh that i kind of want nick
[1547.70 --> 1552.50]  here for yes in case he has any insight um it says so the shirts aren't american apparel anymore i love
[1552.50 --> 1557.70]  how your american apparel shirts fit personally disconnected from the store i don't talk about any
[1557.70 --> 1562.74]  of this stuff ever i can't really tell the difference in terms of fit mission accomplished that
[1562.74 --> 1569.78]  it was exactly the goal yeah because consistency is your hand doesn't fit in it at all not even slightly
[1569.78 --> 1577.30]  i love it consistency is like honestly 80 of the battle we wouldn't have we actually had a lot of
[1577.30 --> 1582.58]  internal debate around different uh different materials uh there was there was a lot of push
[1582.58 --> 1589.06]  internally for like a bamboo based fabric um there was a lot of push internally for uh playing around with
[1589.06 --> 1595.38]  the cotton poly blend uh the blend that american apparel uses it turns out is extremely unusual it's
[1595.38 --> 1603.06]  a 50 50 and what's way more common is a 60 40 or a 70 30 blend uh 60 40 is the big one though and so
[1604.82 --> 1611.70]  if there were cases where we would go to fabric fabric wholesalers and they'd be like 50 50 what's that
[1612.66 --> 1617.78]  no we we literally cannot create it and we're sitting here going well do you make fabrics or not
[1617.78 --> 1624.66]  isn't that your entire job to make fabrics um i forget where i was going with this story but it's
[1624.66 --> 1633.22]  like ridiculous so anyway so because because it was so important to me that the feel be consistent
[1633.22 --> 1638.66]  because people love our shirts like have you seen the reviews of any design of shirt yeah there will
[1638.66 --> 1643.22]  be comments about the design but a lot of it is just like especially on like mystery shirt some people
[1643.22 --> 1646.82]  get upset because they get like three of the same one they order like three mystery shirts and they get
[1646.82 --> 1650.90]  like all the same one we've mostly resolved that by the way guys we actually go out of our way to
[1650.90 --> 1655.62]  print like old out of print designs sometimes so that mystery shirt will just have like kind of fun
[1655.62 --> 1661.06]  random stuff in it um and if you get more than one reach out if you get more than one of the same one
[1661.06 --> 1666.50]  yeah reach out to support we'll get you sorted out this is a 60 40. oh this is a 60 40. oh i didn't even
[1666.50 --> 1672.02]  actually realize that this is a 60 40 but it feels basically the same so the point was we needed to
[1672.02 --> 1676.18]  find something that had the same feel because people love the shirts and we didn't want to put
[1676.18 --> 1682.26]  ourselves in a situation where people are going to go man these guys shirts used to be really nice yeah
[1682.26 --> 1691.06]  yeah how much would that suck yeah i i don't need that in my life so it's launched it's launched it's
[1691.06 --> 1696.18]  out there the privateer shirt will be your first what is this face you're making
[1698.74 --> 1705.46]  oh my goodness this will be your first opportunity to try our own label shirts there was actually one
[1705.46 --> 1710.50]  other reason for us to do this and it had to do with uh getting our trademark application sorted out
[1710.50 --> 1718.18]  so if we didn't have our own label on the garment it was going to affect our ability to get our ltt or
[1718.18 --> 1724.82]  ltt store or whatever the trademark application was through because there's a big difference between
[1724.82 --> 1731.70]  printing your logo on someone else's garment versus having your own garment with your own labeling and
[1731.70 --> 1741.62]  your own yeah um your own your own care tag your own like not you know product makeup stuff anyway so pretty
[1741.62 --> 1753.78]  cool so i it's in your eye oh man so for mine i was shooting with a prime you need to and i have a hard time not laughing
[1753.78 --> 1760.26]  if something's funny so half of these things half of these shots i'm pretty sure i'm like literally mid laughing
[1760.26 --> 1765.62]  because he would tell me like i'd be trying to make an angry face and i feel like i'd be doing an okay job and he'd be like
[1765.62 --> 1774.90]  and he'd be like look constipated and i would just burst out laughing two eye patches the world's unluckiest pirate
[1774.90 --> 1779.22]  i have no clue what's happening with my left hand in that photo i don't remember doing that i feel
[1779.22 --> 1784.26]  like i was going to like do something else and he just took the photo i mean you clearly couldn't see
[1784.26 --> 1790.90]  what you were doing so there's that true yeah i think my one though my favorite for me is definitely this one
[1790.90 --> 1797.46]  yeah that was good i was i was talking to him about it because that stupid gun had like an orange
[1797.46 --> 1803.86]  you know this is definitely a toy tip on it man when we were kids like toy guns were still cool
[1803.86 --> 1809.22]  they didn't have to have like and it's not just an orange tip it's like this big around like it has
[1809.22 --> 1814.98]  like an orange plunger on the end of it it's so dumb anyway i was like hey can you photoshop that off
[1814.98 --> 1820.50]  and can you actually give me like uh like a muzzle blast on it and he's like sure
[1823.38 --> 1828.74]  so we also launched the oh that's right this isn't the only launch the women's i forgot about that
[1828.74 --> 1837.46]  home so our first ladies garment yeah is finally here i'm sorry for everyone who was excited for the
[1837.46 --> 1844.82]  underwear it's not the underwear yet that is coming but our first ladies garment to
[1844.82 --> 1851.62]  dresser is gonna be this the women's cropped sweatshirt and the women's high-waisted sweat
[1851.62 --> 1859.22]  pants so we asked the ladies in the office to model this up for us got yvonne nicole oh that's so
[1859.22 --> 1865.54]  cool they all coordinated to go beyond set together that's awesome oh and hey how does the um how does
[1865.54 --> 1870.10]  the how does the mouse over thing work where you can sorry we didn't have time to put it on this one
[1870.10 --> 1874.50]  it's on everything oh that's not on this one yet for the stuff for today okay so the stuff for today
[1874.50 --> 1879.70]  doesn't have it but every other item on the store says the size the model is wearing now so it'll give
[1879.70 --> 1886.66]  you a better idea of uh whether you can expect it to fit or not oh this is so fun look at these guys
[1886.66 --> 1891.54]  and they're matching actually you guys probably don't know some of these people so sarah obviously
[1891.54 --> 1900.26]  and then we've got nicole and then that's emily uh who's one of our editors there you go um did did
[1900.26 --> 1904.74]  uh did my picture where i ambushed yvonne end up in here yep it's there there's just a million photos
[1904.74 --> 1910.90]  so yeah hard to find i snuck up on her she didn't know it was coming that one's funny uh she's wearing
[1910.90 --> 1916.90]  the black one anyway so yeah we've got the women's crop sweatshirt and we've got the uh
[1916.90 --> 1922.02]  but high-waisted sweatpants there they are do do do do do do
[1925.70 --> 1932.42]  sure i'll show you the swag it thing is there logos on the women's clothes i don't think there's
[1932.42 --> 1940.90]  anything on these also the rose color on the store today was a little crazy yeah today was a little
[1940.90 --> 1946.34]  hectic i think power went out i think this had like 40 images or something like that i mean we never go
[1946.34 --> 1952.74]  we never go easy on the images no so yeah that sometimes it takes some time and there was a
[1952.74 --> 1962.10]  power outage today so that was pretty cool um anyway there it is oh yeah yeah okay nick insists
[1962.10 --> 1967.46]  nick insists that i show you guys it's insist that i show you guys the sizing thing it is very cool
[1967.46 --> 1973.46]  so model size model linus size medium so as you go through you can see who is it on your screen what's
[1973.46 --> 1978.74]  oh shoot yeah sorry uh who is it what size are they wearing and then we're i think working on a
[1978.74 --> 1985.22]  feature where you're going to be able to see other ltt items that are also pictured no eta on that
[1985.22 --> 1990.18]  yeah so a lot of the time when i'm modeling a new shirt i'll also be wearing a toque yeah so if you're
[1990.18 --> 1994.66]  able to be like oh yeah here's all the things that are in here so there's anthony with our triple xl
[1995.30 --> 2001.46]  so this is this is going to be really great because it's a lot easier to kind of put yourself into like
[2001.46 --> 2007.06]  oh i'm more of a ploof or i'm like more of an anthony body type how do i want it to fit on me
[2007.62 --> 2012.42]  and kind of looking at how it hangs on them and and imagining that for yourself i mean we're going
[2012.42 --> 2018.42]  to obviously continue to revise this keep keep trying to do better um keep adding more variety but
[2018.42 --> 2024.82]  that's kind of the update for today pretty exciting freaking day i'm i'm super stoked yeah bunch of stuff
[2024.82 --> 2030.98]  heck yeah thanks nick um toby g asked can you put the model's height as well i mean yeah we'll we'll get
[2030.98 --> 2036.82]  you guys more detail as time goes on obviously with in some cases we don't want to get too granular
[2036.82 --> 2040.50]  i think we're not going to get to the point where we're like yeah here's everyone's measurements and
[2041.06 --> 2047.86]  height and weight and you know shoe size and blood type like i don't think we're going to get that
[2047.86 --> 2053.86]  detailed but we just want to underwear that'll get really interesting yeah we just we want to get you
[2053.86 --> 2065.62]  guys as much detail as we can all right all right why uh will there be more designs coming down the
[2065.62 --> 2072.90]  line in that particular color combo asks wd stevens i have no idea i i quite frankly don't know like this
[2072.90 --> 2079.70]  uh really liked the aqua yellow color combo that you're wearing oh yeah yeah my favorite two are the
[2079.70 --> 2087.14]  pink and um pink and aqua i guess and the and the purple i actually really liked the green one really
[2087.14 --> 2091.62]  like but a prime said i should wear this one and i don't i like this one i just i really like the the
[2091.62 --> 2098.74]  dark green one yeah oh the olive olive this is this is olive luke okay all of drab sarah's my uh it's
[2098.74 --> 2105.30]  like the idea of a pirate shirt being in all of drab a privateer shirt higher i the tear yes get the words
[2105.30 --> 2110.10]  right yes it's very important that there's a distinction there the word matters a lot really
[2110.10 --> 2117.06]  important okay it's a big deal yeah all right why don't we jump into our next topic oh whoops that's
[2117.06 --> 2122.02]  not what i meant to do why don't we jump into our next topic here ladies and gentlemen yes nintendo
[2122.02 --> 2130.10]  pulls an opposite of valve and makes your old device worse instead of helping you make it better nice
[2130.10 --> 2137.86]  no i mean there was dozens of us that owned we use so wanna wanna talk honestly i'm i'm kind of upset
[2137.86 --> 2143.22]  so one of the things that prompted me to ditch our wii which was the kids only cared about wii
[2143.22 --> 2149.14]  games anyway for a wii u and do the migration thing because that was actually kind of cool in its own
[2149.14 --> 2154.42]  sort of nintendo very locked down kind of way um yeah yeah so i did the migration because it was unique
[2154.42 --> 2159.30]  from the wii to the wii u uh one of the things that prompted me to do it was the shutting down
[2159.30 --> 2166.50]  of the wii e-shop and i was like oh okay i can't buy like retro games and or anything anymore so this
[2166.50 --> 2171.70]  thing is sort of deprecated so we gave it away and we switched over to the wii u and it's like oh great
[2171.70 --> 2179.70]  so now that's gone too like this sucks is the overhead of maintaining this really so high that it
[2179.70 --> 2184.82]  doesn't justify i really don't think so that it doesn't that you can't justify the occasional like
[2184.82 --> 2189.54]  if people are buying this stuff from time to time i seriously doubt there's almost nothing any amount
[2189.54 --> 2195.30]  of people buying that type of stuff and i seriously doubt the overhead's very high at all i i really
[2195.30 --> 2198.98]  think they're just trying to get people on newer devices that are better at pushing things towards
[2198.98 --> 2206.98]  you that's that's my uh things are bad well talk us through it talk us through it so yeah e-shops are
[2206.98 --> 2213.54]  shutting down wii u 3ds uh late march 2023 so you've still got a while the shutdown will remove
[2213.54 --> 2219.86]  access to the online libraries for both consoles where many games are still e-shop exclusive uh some
[2219.86 --> 2227.22]  of the games that are going to be lost in regards to being able to purchase them legally um i mean
[2227.22 --> 2230.74]  there's a long list i don't think i need to go through all of this maybe pick some highlights for
[2230.74 --> 2234.98]  us some of them are kind of surprising like there's a phoenix right game phoenix right ace attorney dual
[2234.98 --> 2241.70]  destinies um push mo slash crash mo stretch mo which i don't know what that is but it's highlighted
[2241.70 --> 2247.54]  so i'll go with it um also there's a mario and donkey con game mario and donkey con minis on the
[2247.54 --> 2253.78]  move i don't know what that is but it's a mario game and it's no longer purchasable which is surprising
[2253.78 --> 2261.06]  um and a bunch of other kind of mostly smaller games but still um that you won't be able to access
[2261.06 --> 2268.34]  properly anymore that sucks all the all the like really big names all the really recognizable
[2268.34 --> 2275.94]  titles are accessible somewhere else um but some are getting locked and even if you purchased them
[2275.94 --> 2280.58]  or wanted to purchase them legally on the previous platform you won't be able to in 2023 so you have
[2280.58 --> 2288.42]  a while until then yeah kind of brutal um apparently nintendo started and then removed a preemptive
[2288.42 --> 2293.86]  and defensive q a basically saying that uh they don't have to justify anything to anyone and people
[2293.86 --> 2299.54]  are being unreasonable and to just buy switch online um and any remakes that make it into the i'm sure
[2299.54 --> 2304.10]  they didn't word it that way i think the person who wrote this is a little upset uh is it anthony it's
[2304.10 --> 2311.22]  anthony yeah i knew it i don't think the person who wrote this is wrong to be fair anthony we could
[2311.22 --> 2317.94]  just say anthony at this point i think he's out now but but but i think that was i think there was
[2317.94 --> 2325.30]  some some charge behind that um anthony's take is that they they do make one good point switch online
[2325.30 --> 2329.14]  is pretty good for finding titles you've never heard of by putting them next to titles that you have
[2329.70 --> 2334.10]  but it's a bit like saying hand in your old game cartridges and pay us to keep playing them but not all
[2334.10 --> 2339.62]  of them that is absolutely true um that is what they're doing and it's brutal uh for that matter
[2339.62 --> 2346.90]  3ds and wii u emulators are unlikely to join switch online anytime soon uh very true uh but yeah that's
[2346.90 --> 2357.06]  are likely to be available elsewhere like the computer oops dang uh while online storefronts
[2357.06 --> 2361.46]  have always had this problem looming over them absolutely they will always be deprecated eventually
[2361.46 --> 2368.34]  if they are fixed to one console um the this one seems to have stirred the hornet's nest among fans
[2368.34 --> 2371.86]  it's always going to happen with nintendo fans it's always going to happen with a console that
[2371.86 --> 2377.62]  has an install base of like over 100 million units like the 3ds like the wii u yeah sure fair enough
[2377.62 --> 2382.18]  you could kind of go ah this thing doesn't really matter anymore and will never matter except that it
[2382.82 --> 2388.82]  that it will it's going to be this piece of gaming history that in the same way that the virtual boy is
[2388.82 --> 2394.18]  great are sorry what's that that was what's the move more units than virtual boy that yeah that's the red one
[2394.18 --> 2398.50]  yeah no i mean it moved more units than virtual boy but i just mean that virtual boy is sort of this
[2398.50 --> 2403.54]  this curiosity so no matter how successful or unsuccessful something is it's still going to be
[2403.54 --> 2408.18]  part of gaming history due to how they marketed it i think for pretty much ever people are going to look
[2408.18 --> 2413.54]  back at nintendo's historical consoles and go like wait what that was actually its own console because so
[2413.54 --> 2419.46]  many people thought it was an add-on to the original wii and to not be able to go back and get content for
[2419.46 --> 2427.06]  it like it just oh it sucks and it's just so unnecessary this is a big part of the reason
[2427.06 --> 2434.74]  why i buy physical switch games that's the thing that makes me so mad it it's not that it's a bad
[2434.74 --> 2441.14]  thing it is a bad thing but it's how unnecessary the bad thing is obviously in the world there are much
[2441.14 --> 2447.30]  bigger problems than some game marketplace not being available for sure a year from now yeah i've got a year
[2447.30 --> 2454.10]  to save my to put quarters in my swear jar and save up to buy whatever it is that i'd like to buy and
[2454.10 --> 2458.10]  download it to my console part of the problem is though it's just and i know you're making a point
[2458.10 --> 2463.14]  but yeah part of the problem with that though is like it's it's an old console it's an old portable
[2463.14 --> 2468.98]  console it's an old uh home console whichever one you have it might break you might still want to play
[2468.98 --> 2474.50]  that game so you go buy another one and what you can't download it nothing because nintendo has this
[2474.50 --> 2482.34]  this extraordinarily anti-consumer approach to game data yeah it's still like honestly if there were
[2482.34 --> 2490.02]  if there was literally a single gamer in the entire united states congress there would be some kind of
[2490.02 --> 2497.46]  law against what nintendo's doing holding your save game data just hostage and there's most people seem
[2497.46 --> 2501.46]  kind of on my side but i saw at least one comment go by talking about like oh they're not going to do
[2501.46 --> 2506.18]  that's a switch they sold so many units they did that to the wii yeah do you know how many wii's
[2506.18 --> 2511.94]  they sold they sold so many units of the wii i think there are more nintendo wii's than there are like
[2511.94 --> 2519.70]  actual wii's on earth just kidding there are a lot of penises on yeah yeah world's full of dicks if you
[2519.70 --> 2523.86]  know what i mean yeah it'll happen to the switch and there's there's like i want to be able to go back
[2523.86 --> 2530.58]  and play the games that i paid for on the switch yeah and you know what sucks is that again back to
[2530.58 --> 2536.42]  good guy valve to be clear not everything valve does is right absolutely just want to make that
[2537.22 --> 2541.54]  abundantly extra super clear all right also give them credit when they do things that are right we
[2541.54 --> 2545.78]  have to give them credit when they do things that are right valve has come out and said if we ever
[2545.78 --> 2552.42]  deprecate this platform we will we will engineer a way that you'll just still have all your stuff
[2552.98 --> 2557.06]  like i don't know what that would look like exactly and i doubt even they know exactly what
[2557.06 --> 2563.86]  that would look like yeah some type of peer-to-peer some kind of okay download it before this day and
[2563.86 --> 2570.10]  it goes it goes good old games drm free i i don't know i i don't know exactly what that would look like
[2570.10 --> 2575.78]  and since they made that commitment that commitment has gotten exponentially more complicated to actually
[2575.78 --> 2581.70]  follow through on oh yeah especially now that they've got you know partner software like a halo
[2581.70 --> 2587.54]  infinite's a perfect example i own halo infinite on steam because i can't be arsed to deal with
[2587.54 --> 2593.06]  microsoft's spectacularly broken launcher crap i unfortunately you still have to deal with their
[2593.06 --> 2598.98]  accounts and their matchmaking and networking and all that because of how intertwined they are the
[2598.98 --> 2607.78]  experience is terrible and this is with all the services still like running properly yeah i'm afraid to
[2607.78 --> 2613.62]  know what that would look like when you know valve doesn't exist anymore and valve not existing anymore
[2613.62 --> 2618.34]  is actually like kind of a scary proposition to me because aren't they privately held still
[2619.38 --> 2623.46]  as far as my understanding goes yeah i believe they i believe they're privately held but the the
[2623.46 --> 2628.42]  thing is that okay no i know they're privately held but what i don't know is who the shareholders are
[2629.94 --> 2634.82]  that i'm not sure and i don't guys feel free to let me know in the chat this is just one of those
[2634.82 --> 2639.86]  things that i've been curious about but never gone out of my way to look up because um one of the
[2639.86 --> 2646.58]  things that i've done as part of owning a business is estate planning if yvonne and i
[2648.74 --> 2654.18]  get hit by a bus at the same time do you know what happens to linus media group
[2656.34 --> 2663.78]  uh no what would be your assumption i if i remember correctly because i think we talked about no no no give
[2663.78 --> 2668.98]  me an assumption give me an uneducated assumption okay okay what would be your lay person's assumption
[2671.06 --> 2676.34]  honestly if i didn't know some of the context that you guys had told me i would just genuinely have no
[2676.34 --> 2685.14]  idea um i would assume that it would go to uh like next of kin inheritance okay and then i have no idea how
[2685.14 --> 2693.38]  that would work because you're like offspring are too young so the way that that would typically work is
[2693.38 --> 2699.62]  when your offspring are not of legal age yet there would be some kind of trustee yeah yeah and and
[2699.62 --> 2704.82]  they would be responsible run the trust like there's a lot of things that i i yeah so they would be they
[2704.82 --> 2710.34]  would be part of them agreeing to be our trustee i can't remember exactly what the term is i think it's
[2710.34 --> 2715.62]  trustee but part of them agreeing to be that would be that we would leave behind a letter of wishes for
[2715.62 --> 2720.42]  how we would want the company to be run or or whatever the case may be but here's the problem
[2721.22 --> 2726.66]  the way that inheritance laws work and to be clear there's a lot of canada there's a lot of good
[2726.66 --> 2735.06]  things about this particular type of law i'm not a huge fan of uh of you know aristocracy just
[2735.62 --> 2743.94]  intergenerational wealth that creates like uh uh like a a lord class and a surf class like that's
[2744.74 --> 2749.86]  that that's not a period of history that we need to go back to although there are strong arguments to
[2749.86 --> 2755.54]  be made that we are already there and have actually managed to zoom past it yeah with the current level
[2755.54 --> 2759.78]  of wealth inequality in the world but that's a separate conversation it's beyond the scope of this
[2759.78 --> 2769.78]  one so i'm not necessarily against inheritance taxes the problem is that in the case of an asset like linus
[2769.78 --> 2779.38]  media group incorporated bequeathing it to a successor is extraordinarily complicated so instead of me
[2779.38 --> 2788.34]  being able to to gift shares or or leave the company to a next of kin like uh mine and yvonne's children
[2788.34 --> 2795.86]  what would happen is the asset would be placed um like like in in escrow or in trust it would be it
[2795.86 --> 2803.30]  would be held by by a neutral party in it would essentially have no owner for a period of time
[2803.30 --> 2811.22]  while they get it valued so the company would have to get valued at that point and then whoever we did
[2811.22 --> 2818.50]  leave it to would have to come up with the cash that they would need to pay the tax on that value of
[2818.50 --> 2825.70]  inheritance and the problem with how companies are valued is that linus media like they can have these
[2825.70 --> 2833.46]  just insane insane multipliers over ebita i don't know if you're familiar with the concept of ebita but
[2833.46 --> 2845.86]  it's earnings before tax and uh tax and uh tax and i can't remember what the the last one is
[2849.54 --> 2856.66]  here we go earnings before interest taxes and depreciation okay so a company like ours that's
[2856.66 --> 2865.46]  in a growth phase in kind of a hot trendy industry online media uh could easily have a multiplier of
[2866.42 --> 2876.34]  like 10x even as high as 11 12 13x now i got to be honest with you guys we've only been running linus
[2876.34 --> 2886.26]  media group for nine years could i possibly have that kind of cash on hand if i'm anywhere near a sort of
[2886.66 --> 2891.38]  responsible business operator he's trying to like reinvest in the company and because that inheritance
[2891.38 --> 2899.14]  tax is deep into double digits like you could end up paying like probably 30 40 plus tax on this
[2899.14 --> 2905.70]  inheritance so if we if we take that that value let's say let's say for the sake of argument that
[2905.70 --> 2911.54]  linus media group makes a million dollars a year okay if we had a 10x so let's go conservative if we had
[2911.54 --> 2919.22]  a 10x multiplier in our valuation that would be 10 million dollars on which they could owe like three
[2919.22 --> 2924.18]  million dollars three or four million dollars or something ridiculous like that these are intentionally
[2924.18 --> 2929.70]  not exact numbers because this is yvonne's department not mine she deals with this stuff the point is just
[2929.70 --> 2939.70]  that it's really complicated and we wouldn't have we wouldn't have 30 percent of 10 years of earnings
[2939.70 --> 2945.14]  sitting in the bank because that would be stupid yeah so what would happen is the company would have
[2945.14 --> 2954.42]  to be sold to some soulless aggregator of media companies and then my kids would obviously be fine
[2954.42 --> 2961.86]  because they'd get a big pile of cash but everything like everything about linus media group everything
[2962.42 --> 2967.94]  about the way we want to do things would immediately be dead gone because it would all be about
[2968.50 --> 2975.22]  getting back a return on this gigantic cash investment in acquiring this company and so i forget why i
[2975.22 --> 2983.70]  started this conversation but there's basically no way to there's no way to leave the company to right
[2984.26 --> 2992.58]  if valve oh if valve is primarily owned still by gabe newell and family or co-founders so i looked that up
[2992.58 --> 2997.30]  and they get old and or die or are not interested anymore or whatever the case may be
[3000.98 --> 3005.30]  hopefully they have billions yeah well i think they probably do it's gonna cost
[3005.30 --> 3010.10]  just no just i mean in the bank well i think they do oh yeah so there's that that's fair
[3010.10 --> 3017.14]  uh so newell owns more than 50 percent the rest of it was buried in a forbes article that honestly i literally could not
[3017.14 --> 3022.34]  navigate through the ads because there's too many on the page and it's bouncing the text around so i
[3022.34 --> 3028.66]  installed an ad blocker live um yeah should i go to your screen but then but no no no um but you know
[3028.66 --> 3032.90]  that those are actually like not allowed on company computers right just remove it when you're done i
[3032.90 --> 3038.02]  will do that okay um but even with the ad blocker i could so i i couldn't read it because the ads kept
[3038.02 --> 3041.70]  reloading and moving the text around which is the only reason why i installed it and then i couldn't read it
[3041.70 --> 3044.74]  and then i couldn't read it with the ad blocker either because they detect that and then block you
[3044.74 --> 3050.74]  from seeing the page so i i actually don't know because it was literally unreadable um got it but
[3050.74 --> 3056.10]  he owns at least 50 and after that i'm not sure uh true scott says you still never told us what
[3056.10 --> 3063.46]  actually happens to lmg if something happens to you i don't know what happens is it gets parted out
[3063.46 --> 3071.38]  and my kids get the proceeds essentially um i would like for there to be a better plan we talked about
[3071.38 --> 3076.82]  uh we talked about this i think on last week's wan show where i was discussing the possibility of
[3076.82 --> 3084.02]  taking on investment um that would actually be one of the main reasons that i could think of for us to
[3084.02 --> 3089.62]  change our ownership structure because one of one of the goals and i've said this since day one is i want
[3089.62 --> 3097.54]  to be a real company right and real companies don't just die when their founder dies so figuring out
[3097.54 --> 3104.42]  some way that we can create an ownership structure that can last longer than my beating heart would
[3104.42 --> 3111.38]  be a goal that i that i would have while i'm while i'm still here and while i'm still alive but i i i
[3111.38 --> 3120.74]  don't i don't know a way to do that without losing um what's what's special about what we're doing here
[3120.74 --> 3126.90]  uh there was an lmg clips video going through um where i talked through that and i read through all
[3126.90 --> 3131.70]  the comments on it there were some really good comments uh a lot of it was stuff i i was already
[3131.70 --> 3135.62]  aware of but there was some stuff in there that i just you know honestly hadn't really thought of
[3135.62 --> 3142.10]  it that way like people with more of a financial background than i have and you know basically the
[3142.10 --> 3147.14]  thing that the key piece that i didn't know like i said my my my business knowledge is all school of
[3147.14 --> 3151.70]  hard knocks i've learned everything that i've learned because i've had to learn it and one of
[3151.70 --> 3158.82]  the things i didn't know was that not only does a publicly held company become soulless because it
[3158.82 --> 3164.74]  serves its shareholders but it's actually legally obligated to be soulless and put its shareholders
[3164.74 --> 3171.06]  first before anything else and what's really complicated about that is that from my point of view
[3171.06 --> 3180.10]  we could make some really short-term fiscally irresponsible decisions that i see in my vision
[3180.10 --> 3186.58]  having enormous an enormous payoff in the long term okay but if the shareholders disagree oh i see yeah
[3186.58 --> 3191.78]  yeah then they can make an argument that i was not acting in their best interest they can push me out
[3192.42 --> 3199.14]  and then they can sit and wallow in their own filth with no vision now and you know that's that's what
[3199.14 --> 3204.18]  happens to a lot of companies it has happened it's happened to a lot of companies yeah yeah founders
[3204.18 --> 3209.94]  get pushed out there's no vision left they chase short-term rewards they they do whatever wall
[3209.94 --> 3215.86]  street tells them to do and then they just have no soul so i just don't know what to do
[3218.66 --> 3224.82]  yeah i i don't think this is actually the same and i'm not exactly saying he was like a good person or
[3224.82 --> 3230.66]  anything um but steve jobs was forced out of apple i don't i don't know if it was through the same means
[3231.54 --> 3236.10]  but i know he was forced out of apple at one point and that's like that's pretty crazy to think about
[3236.10 --> 3239.86]  right lots of really good questions here you are assuming youtube and floatplane will be relevant
[3239.86 --> 3246.90]  in 20 30 40 years i assume nothing uh that's why we're so diversified that's why the lab's coming
[3246.90 --> 3253.22]  that's why ltt store is such a huge place for us put in your mouth that i assume nothing no to that you
[3253.22 --> 3258.02]  assume that floatplane and youtube are going to be around in 30 40 years you said nothing even
[3258.02 --> 3264.82]  remotely like that i sure don't i have no idea where that came from linus media group is a media
[3264.82 --> 3270.66]  company right now youtube is a very favorable platform for us to publish on but if that changed
[3270.66 --> 3276.90]  in the future we'd be on it don't worry we got this that's why you guys are on um fragler says is
[3276.90 --> 3281.54]  there a way to do some kind of employee ownership plan in that case believe it or not that is something
[3281.54 --> 3288.66]  that we have looked into very extensively and unfortunately the exact same problems exist
[3288.66 --> 3297.94]  so even if so if i wanted to get paid the employees literally have to pay a fair market value we have to
[3297.94 --> 3303.78]  make some kind of argument so if i wanted to give them a deal i basically have to put together a legal
[3303.78 --> 3311.38]  document that says this is why the deal is justified i think we're only worth 5x ebitda
[3311.54 --> 3317.94]  because i'm walking away immediately and i'm the freaking man and i'm the man they're gonna have
[3317.94 --> 3323.46]  trouble i'm the dude but i would actually have to do that yeah legally speaking i would have to do that
[3323.46 --> 3331.86]  because any additional value that the asset was found to have i i i think there are there are potential
[3331.86 --> 3338.02]  fraud liabilities there are potential taxation liabilities like there's there's all these problems
[3338.02 --> 3342.58]  if we don't sell it at a fair market value so that's problem number one so they have to actually
[3342.58 --> 3348.34]  have enough money to buy the stupid thing which we're again because we're because we've been
[3348.34 --> 3353.30]  growing for so long and growing at such a great rate like look at the size of this company there's
[3353.30 --> 3359.14]  like 60 people here now it's ridiculous um that multiplier ends up being pretty high and it ends up
[3359.14 --> 3365.46]  being a lot like an unreasonable amount of money so that's issue number one and issue number two is if we
[3365.46 --> 3371.70]  wanted to gift it to them it's still the tax problem they still have to pay taxes it's the
[3371.70 --> 3381.06]  exact same problem as my kids so it's really like it's really stupid um honestly speaking um another
[3381.06 --> 3384.58]  thing what would happen to ltd if only linus died nothing against devon but there are a lot of
[3384.58 --> 3388.74]  responsibilities that would be extremely hard to take on all at once i think you guys overestimate how
[3388.74 --> 3400.42]  important i am i i'm i'm a pretty face um and i do like to think that yvonne and i are the yin to each
[3400.42 --> 3410.02]  other's yang she's very detail oriented um she's very organized i am very creative um i i tend to have
[3410.02 --> 3417.46]  sort of like a big picture vision but i absolutely lack the focus to actually put all the pieces in place to
[3417.46 --> 3423.62]  get there that's what she has uh we we absolutely complement each other nearly perfectly i told her
[3423.62 --> 3430.26]  if i believed in that i would say that she was my soul mate obviously that's that's stupid that's not
[3430.26 --> 3434.82]  how the world works but if i believed in that i'd say she was because it's like we were made for each
[3434.82 --> 3443.46]  other just how perfectly the puzzle pieces fit together um and anyway the point is that you guys
[3443.46 --> 3450.82]  i think underestimate what she does and i think you overestimate what i do and what you also i think
[3450.82 --> 3458.90]  underestimate is the talents and the experience of the people who work here look at a james or an anthony
[3458.90 --> 3467.30]  or a colton or a nick or a luke those five names that i just named okay let's go through them five years
[3467.30 --> 3478.10]  six or seven i think colton's up to i think colton's up to seven you're at 10 at least 10 or 11. yeah so
[3478.10 --> 3484.02]  hold on can you add these up for me we're at the 23 so far i think i'm i think i'm slightly over 12. nick's
[3484.02 --> 3491.06]  at eight years so that's 31 and who what was the last name i think i said anthony anthony is at five so that is
[3491.06 --> 3500.50]  36 years of experience in online media and i picked just five people under this roof this is an
[3500.50 --> 3509.22]  incredible team i mean they will survive without me whatsoever if you were randomly deleted success
[3509.22 --> 3514.98]  would go down a lot but we could keep the ship floating you'd survive if yvonne randomly disappeared
[3514.98 --> 3523.06]  i highly question the ship floating the ship i think the ship could float long term i think the
[3523.06 --> 3530.10]  short-term turbulence might sink it before it gets a chance yeah that's the challenge is that what she
[3530.10 --> 3537.06]  does is so much more important day to day than what i do if that kind of makes sense to you guys
[3538.18 --> 3543.14]  so that's that's that's what's tough about it there's a there's just so many things to consider i wish
[3543.14 --> 3551.22]  it was as simple as writing in my will if i die i would like it to be divided up into 60th and bequeathed
[3551.22 --> 3557.70]  to the employees but what would actually happen is it would be divided up into 60th and sold to the
[3557.70 --> 3564.34]  highest bidder and there would be nothing left of its soul so we need to figure that out but fortunately
[3564.34 --> 3569.86]  we hopefully have some time that's that's where i'm at on that we should talk about sponsors because
[3569.86 --> 3574.18]  if we don't talk about sponsors then the ship will definitely not float the show is brought to you
[3574.18 --> 3582.98]  today by corsair i love it uh thanks to course there their 5000 t rgb case features distinctive contours

[3621.06 --> 3629.06]  flawed to just being the case manufacturer like the default it's pretty nuts it's it's just crazy
[3629.06 --> 3636.02]  i make like they make so many things their culture is bananas like i at risk of saying too much
[3636.98 --> 3644.98]  one of corsair's criteria criteria criterion criterion one of course there's criteria for entering any
[3644.98 --> 3650.10]  category is that they need to be able to see a path to being number one or number two worldwide
[3650.10 --> 3657.94]  and i'm like oh you gotta set the bar high yeah yeah yeah i mean they do it pretty consistently so

[3722.34 --> 3726.58]  sponsor thing are you going to say something controversial yeah no you can uh i so i uninstalled
[3726.58 --> 3735.70]  ad block you can share my screen if you want oh okay um it's all ads the whole page there's one
[3735.70 --> 3744.98]  tiny little bar at the top and then it's ads okay you can close it now there's nothing there
[3746.42 --> 3750.82]  um flow plane chat asked me if we're going to talk about the new york times article and i was like what
[3750.82 --> 3755.14]  one and they linked it to me and i was like oh yeah that merch one so i clicked on it and was
[3755.14 --> 3760.74]  i think you know what's there would you like show them would you like to hear something really funny
[3760.74 --> 3773.78]  sure the link that i tweeted sharing that article was a privateered link i didn't know so the the um
[3775.22 --> 3782.50]  the author of the article did send me a copy of the article but they actually didn't do it as quickly as
[3782.50 --> 3791.30]  one of my one of my bros in uh did they post it in the youtuber lounge or in worth reading slash
[3791.30 --> 3800.58]  watching slash listening to i'm actually not sure this is like my favorite discord ever oh yeah yeah
[3800.58 --> 3812.18]  here it is here it is so uh username ta you know who you are um i didn't recognize this domain
[3812.18 --> 3819.62]  uh messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com i assumed that that was like the official source
[3820.26 --> 3829.14]  so before the author sent it to me i copy pasted this one onto twitter i didn't notice that it was
[3829.14 --> 3834.90]  formatted super weird it says subscriber only newsletter which i didn't really look at
[3834.90 --> 3840.66]  and clearly i'm not a subscriber and clearly this newsletter is totally working just fine
[3840.66 --> 3845.46]  i'm wondering if they just don't bother to have any of that stuff if like i wonder if that guy's a
[3845.46 --> 3851.06]  pay or whoever that is is a paying subscriber and they just send them links that just don't deliver
[3851.06 --> 3856.50]  any of that stuff or something i don't know because that looks like an official link it does so anyway so
[3856.50 --> 3863.70]  people people were replying to my tweet being like um actually you just shared like uh like a paywall
[3863.70 --> 3869.70]  stripped version of the thing i was like well i'm not gonna undo it at this point yeah wow that's so
[3869.70 --> 3874.66]  yeah we we can talk about we can talk about the article they got a lot of things right from our chat
[3874.66 --> 3881.38]  there's a couple of little details that are probably not not quite how i would describe things but overall
[3881.38 --> 3887.78]  i think what was really the coolest thing about that article was being featured in a positive context
[3888.34 --> 3893.94]  it feels like a lot of traditional media anytime they talk about youtubers it's it's just doom and
[3893.94 --> 3901.38]  gloom just looking for an excuse to crap on my colleagues and my entire industry yeah like and i get
[3901.38 --> 3906.50]  it a lot of the time the the negative things they're writing about are super negative and they deserve
[3906.50 --> 3913.62]  negative publicity sure but where's the article about tom scott just like tom scott being awesome
[3913.62 --> 3919.54]  because he's tom scott or just like massive charity drives where is it modern influencers do where is it
[3919.54 --> 3925.38]  yeah and you know it's it's frustrating for me honestly i don't expect a ton of the attention for
[3925.38 --> 3933.78]  myself i i have grown accustomed to being just quietly doing my thing over here the tech niche is like the
[3933.78 --> 3942.10]  least it's the i think it has the highest size to sex appeal ratio on the entire platform because it's
[3942.10 --> 3950.50]  actually a gigantic vertical but no one talks about it no one cares and that's changed a little bit over
[3950.50 --> 3959.54]  the years um uh when i went to the last uh creator summit that i attended uh marquez for example was was
[3959.54 --> 3966.02]  actually like featured in the thing and i was like holy crap someone from our space actually got
[3966.02 --> 3971.86]  noticed um youtube did a thing with us actually where they did a billboard campaign uh and they
[3971.86 --> 3976.42]  just like plastered me on billboards which i was like i was pretty tickled about something that isn't
[3976.42 --> 3982.10]  just like a late night tv show host yeah exactly exactly i was like oh that's pretty cool so they've
[3982.10 --> 3988.42]  actually done a better job recently you've got to give credit where credit's due but um the point is i i
[3988.42 --> 3995.54]  don't expect it to be me i just expect them to like try a little right yeah like it doesn't have to
[3995.54 --> 4003.30]  be whatever pewdiepie's latest controversy is or whatever you know toxic prank channel or like whatever
[4003.30 --> 4009.38]  you know minor got exploited by someone and like to be clear absolutely horrible things all horrible
[4009.38 --> 4015.46]  and you should say it's horrible sure um and okay i think there's room for a little more nuance with the
[4015.46 --> 4022.18]  pewdiepie stuff some of the stuff has been i'll say more nuanced if there's horrible things you can
[4022.18 --> 4025.54]  call them you gotta call them horrible but you should probably show the other side of the coin
[4025.54 --> 4031.46]  yeah there that's all i'm asking for and so that was honestly the best thing about it was someone
[4031.46 --> 4036.66]  reaching out just to have a positive conversation be like hey look isn't this cool because it is cool
[4036.66 --> 4044.66]  it's totally cool i think it's cool we have one more sponsor and it's brought to you by zoho thanks

[4097.38 --> 4101.70]  all right what's our next topic here should we do a couple of merch messages it kind of feels like
[4101.70 --> 4106.42]  we should do that we've got some curated ones we should at least do a few yeah because there have been
[4106.42 --> 4116.02]  a spicy few today great job on that uh that product photography i i never okay i know that you prefer alex
[4116.98 --> 4123.22]  alex p you know in person but i know you still go by a prime online what am i supposed to use for you in front of the
[4123.22 --> 4130.34]  audience i don't know he doesn't know so how am i supposed to know gosh darn it you're killing me here
[4131.06 --> 4136.74]  well whatever you guys know him as a prime he did all the photography for the privateer shirt as we're
[4136.74 --> 4143.70]  calling it and uh you did you did a bang up job that one with the gun i love it the smoke the like
[4143.70 --> 4152.02]  the fog it's it's didn't make it on the story it's sick i love it thank you uh what can i do for you
[4152.02 --> 4158.42]  though oh you're just here to say hi okay cool uh merch messages then uh thomas b says great real talk
[4158.42 --> 4163.78]  linus how's the lab building going and would making your own crypto coin help fund your lab
[4163.78 --> 4174.18]  okay thomas let's have a chat would see i don't want to use the word stealing because if people give
[4174.18 --> 4181.78]  it to you it's not technically stealing and the last thing i want is to use the wrong word to describe
[4181.78 --> 4189.14]  what is functionally the same wood private yet again just use that as a catch-all term for like every
[4189.14 --> 4200.98]  thing would relieving people of their heavy purses make my purse heavier why yes yes it would factually
[4200.98 --> 4207.86]  speaking would i be able to sleep at night knowing that i had executed a perfect rug pull i was gonna
[4207.86 --> 4214.90]  say what you can reword this would rug pulling your own crypto coin help fund your life a rug pulling my
[4214.90 --> 4222.10]  own crypto coin would probably help fund my own small island i mean seriously with our tech savvy
[4222.10 --> 4227.54]  audience and like that's something a lot of people don't realize we have a new section on the forum
[4227.54 --> 4232.50]  where the business team is posting potential sponsors and current sponsors talking about
[4232.50 --> 4239.38]  controversies trying to make sure that we're uh we're we're doing everything in our power to improve
[4239.38 --> 4244.58]  our due diligence on sponsorships is essentially what we're doing is we want to make sure that our sponsors
[4244.58 --> 4252.18]  reflect as well on us as we reflect on them um and as as part of that process uh they've posted
[4252.18 --> 4256.66]  one particular sponsor to which someone replied well i really don't think this makes sense because
[4256.66 --> 4261.38]  ltd's audience is predominantly 14 year olds and i went well that's wrong um
[4264.26 --> 4271.38]  oh man it where does the idea come from that as soon as people turn 15 they no longer have a sense of
[4271.38 --> 4278.02]  humor or like fun can we can't we just be fun for and adults can enjoy it too what's wrong with that
[4278.02 --> 4282.34]  and the funniest thing about it is a lot of the people who seem to have that perception are not 14
[4282.34 --> 4289.86]  years old i know that yeah it's like why are you making this assumption that nobody else out there could
[4289.86 --> 4298.50]  be just like you an it professional that does enterprise stuff or software by day or just enjoys video
[4298.50 --> 4304.42]  games and wants a fun way to stay up to date on technology and enjoys our wacky projects and
[4305.14 --> 4310.02]  and just likes being along for the ride and thinks that we're kind of a cool bunch of people like
[4310.74 --> 4319.46]  is that so impossible to think to imagine right um i've actually been told on many occasions like
[4319.46 --> 4327.14]  i'm super into tech frankly i i know more about high hardcore it tech than you do linus and man
[4327.78 --> 4333.06]  the book of things i don't know about it would be a long one indeed i don't know if it i don't know
[4333.06 --> 4339.14]  if it could fit on our petabyte project server um so i'll get messages from people being like but that's
[4339.14 --> 4345.86]  not why i watch you that stuff's boring i do that stuff every day at work yeah why would you yeah i just i just
[4345.86 --> 4351.62]  want to hear about like the cool consumer gadgets that like i i don't have i don't want to read a dry
[4351.62 --> 4357.94]  boring article about i want the fun version of it and that's what we do like it's amazing to me how
[4357.94 --> 4365.38]  many people watch our content and don't know what we do i i just i love it i i love it you guys it's
[4365.38 --> 4371.06]  it's great i guess that means we're doing it really well lemdog on flowplane chat said bleep i'm a 30
[4371.06 --> 4376.26]  year old director at my company and converted my the entire company to framework laptops because linus
[4376.26 --> 4383.38]  i'm a i'm pretty far from being 14 years old yeah a little bit and to be clear you know that's why
[4383.38 --> 4388.98]  it's so important for us to disclose things like that i am an investor in framework and that framework's
[4388.98 --> 4396.98]  not perfect um you know for me and i i love that lemdog that is absolutely fantastic because what you did
[4396.98 --> 4402.58]  is knowing that there are going to be some pitfalls along the way you put your money where your mouth
[4402.58 --> 4408.58]  is and you supported a company that has a vision that you stand for that's freaking awesome that's
[4408.58 --> 4415.14]  exactly what we do that's exactly what we do that's cool um what am i supposed to be talking about right
[4415.14 --> 4421.70]  now i don't i don't even remember we got here from talking about right so could we rug pull and would
[4421.70 --> 4429.06]  it be a rug pull of epic proportions yes i do believe it would be in the same way that years ago
[4429.06 --> 4435.30]  we could have partnered with a local developer to make a mobile game and we could have just
[4435.94 --> 4443.78]  micro transaction the crap out of it and i could probably own a yacht by this point but not as cool
[4443.78 --> 4451.14]  as bezos's no that one is but a yacht but a small don't have to deconstruct a historical ridge a small
[4451.14 --> 4457.70]  yacht do you yeah if you don't have to deconstruct a historical bridge is it really a cool yacht
[4458.34 --> 4462.66]  no okay so it wouldn't have been cool yeah but it would have been okay can i just call it a boat
[4464.10 --> 4471.30]  a nice boat okay i'd have i i could have a boat so the point is that we've had opportunities where we
[4471.30 --> 4478.82]  could have cashed in on the trendy cool way to make money and we decided not to we decided that
[4478.82 --> 4484.50]  we really like it better slow and steady wins the race and we made the ultimate decision because we
[4484.50 --> 4491.30]  were going to do a coin at one point we were like yes we are going to do it and we learned more and
[4492.90 --> 4499.30]  reflected more and we decided not to do it um so we're not going to do that
[4500.10 --> 4506.66]  it is possible that some kind of blockchain something could make sense that was something
[4506.66 --> 4513.06]  that actually got brought up in the in the comments under that video about potential funding sources
[4513.06 --> 4519.30]  is hey don't go public because the reporting requirements are going to bury you under under
[4519.30 --> 4526.58]  accounting costs um and just just administrative overhead but what if you guys did some kind of like
[4526.58 --> 4536.88]  blockchain based smart contract thing for some kind of like commitment to like if you if you buy
[4536.88 --> 4542.52]  it for this value then it will get paid out at x value as the company something dividend something
[4542.52 --> 4548.72]  i don't know that they they explained it better um the point is blockchain is a super interesting
[4548.72 --> 4554.68]  technology there could be use or something there could be ways for us to to raise funds but it
[4554.68 --> 4559.28]  would have to be in a way where we feel like people are getting something for their money and that's a
[4559.28 --> 4565.64]  big part of why we have merch messages now instead of just doing um i don't even remember what they're
[4565.64 --> 4571.56]  called anymore super chats because a super chat if i don't read it or because i miss it because their
[4571.56 --> 4577.86]  feature is broken or if i forget or whatever the case may be all you got was a colored bit of text
[4577.86 --> 4583.94]  with a merch message you're going to get a product in the mail so even if we don't get to it or our
[4583.94 --> 4587.60]  answer isn't thorough enough for your liking or whatever the case may be you haven't just thrown
[4587.60 --> 4592.80]  away your money which i personally think is really really important so the only way that we would do
[4592.80 --> 4601.14]  any kind of fundraising activity would be if i can figure out what's in it for you yeah and some people
[4601.14 --> 4606.36]  might say you know what in fact i've seen a lot of people say this all i need to be in it for me
[4606.36 --> 4614.68]  is to like own a chunk of lmg and it like where it's like and i've just like the stock i've seen
[4614.68 --> 4619.86]  people compare it to owning owning real estate on the moon you know like it doesn't even need to be
[4619.86 --> 4626.44]  legally binding just a certificate of i own one share of lmg and it's like yeah fine fine fair enough
[4626.44 --> 4633.02]  but instead of nfts yeah you should do like a tile wall in one of the buildings and people can like
[4633.02 --> 4636.46]  buy a tile and put whatever they want on there as long as it's appropriate
[4636.46 --> 4643.24]  that's pretty cool we had an idea like that there was supposed to be a name wall when we moved
[4643.24 --> 4647.54]  do we have that list of names because we really do need to put it up at some point that was like
[4647.54 --> 4653.24]  seven years ago somewhere okay we should can can you can can you make a note to get that list of names
[4653.24 --> 4658.36]  uh and fun fact we actually have something kind of similar to that coming
[4658.36 --> 4665.02]  uh well it's the feature you're working on yeah yeah wait yeah yeah no it's done it's done i mean
[4665.02 --> 4668.54]  well why don't you tell them what the feature is it's super cool conrad pushed it like a bit ago
[4668.54 --> 4674.52]  um anyways it's the free upsell shelf conrad's been done this that is such a terrible internal name we
[4674.52 --> 4679.36]  need a cooler name very quickly my headphones are really having a lot of trouble um mine were too i
[4679.36 --> 4683.14]  think what happened was someone was fidgeting with them and they unscrew so make sure they are
[4683.14 --> 4689.14]  actually screwed together as well as plugged together oh so i i fixed that didn't know that
[4689.14 --> 4695.06]  was a thing yeah all right yeah um but yeah the the the thing that probably needs a more marketable
[4695.06 --> 4701.42]  name than free upsell free upsell shelf what does that even mean the bus man that's less less um but
[4701.42 --> 4704.90]  basically when you're checking out you have things in your cart i don't know if it's populated right
[4704.90 --> 4709.12]  now so i don't know if it's doing it right now um but there's certain free items and there will be
[4709.12 --> 4712.80]  new ones and i'm sure the ones that are in there right now will be circulated out eventually
[4712.80 --> 4717.56]  yeah but there's certain free items that you can choose from to have one of that can go into your
[4717.56 --> 4722.46]  card as well like maybe a sticker or or something else like that sticker pack we do packs of stickers
[4722.46 --> 4726.84]  sticker pack uh the thing you're going to talk about how much i spent on stickers this year
[4726.84 --> 4732.60]  probably a lot over a hundred thousand dollars yeah i'm not even joking i'm not even surprised
[4732.60 --> 4736.60]  because when when i when honestly when we were tasked with this free upsell shelf thing
[4736.60 --> 4744.84]  i was like reading the details on it and i was like this is gonna be expensive because some of
[4744.84 --> 4751.36]  the ideas that you guys have to give away for free people sell for like very notable amounts of money
[4751.36 --> 4758.54]  i'm like what the heck like i'm talking like 15 20 dollars nick sent me the approval other comparable
[4758.54 --> 4763.42]  stores nick sent me the approval request for our sticker po and i was like what
[4763.42 --> 4773.18]  why do you need a ceo signature to buy stick oh oh you might say i got sticker shock oh
[4773.18 --> 4780.72]  oh it's like 140 grand or something stupid like that like how long is this gonna last he's like oh the
[4780.72 --> 4789.70]  year and what wasn't wasn't one of the thoughts too to give away a pin yeah pins are like metal oh wait
[4789.70 --> 4794.56]  this is great they're expensive lee song cray says i don't like the stickers they're just junk to me
[4794.56 --> 4799.46]  that's the point is the point of this feature yeah so we want you to be able to pick your own free
[4799.46 --> 4805.34]  item yeah so you'll be able to choose between stickers uh we want to do pins and the first option
[4805.34 --> 4811.56]  other than stickers is going to be a postcard so if you remember the gpu wasteland mouse pad uh that
[4811.56 --> 4817.64]  sarah designed she adapted it to a little coloring sheet so it's black and white and you can color it
[4817.64 --> 4823.24]  and then on the back is a postcard and the idea is that we're going to encourage people to color it
[4823.24 --> 4830.18]  in and then mail it back to us and then for like a wall of inspiration in the creator warehouse space
[4830.18 --> 4834.58]  that they're going to be moving into hopefully in about a month they're going to have this whole wall
[4834.58 --> 4841.30]  of postcards from all over the world from our customers and the idea behind it for me was just
[4841.30 --> 4845.44]  like making it a little bit more real because right now it seems really cool yeah i think for a lot of
[4845.44 --> 4850.90]  them it feels like they're they just like there's these designs and there's like a photo shoot and
[4850.90 --> 4856.66]  we we we like show it off and we talk about it on when show and then it's just like it's like it's a
[4856.66 --> 4863.58]  one-way relationship you're just firing stuff out into the ether and it's gone and people leave
[4863.58 --> 4868.94]  reviews on the site and i love that i will just sit and idly read reviews on lttstore.com because i i love
[4868.94 --> 4874.50]  it it's a very encouraging most of the time and b very helpful whenever it's not encouraging because
[4874.50 --> 4879.78]  we're always trying to do better um and so i thought it would be really cool to see every one
[4879.78 --> 4885.88]  of those cards and know that someone somewhere is wearing a shirt or drinking from a water bottle
[4885.88 --> 4889.82]  and they like colored that for us and so i'm expecting to see some really cool stuff yeah sweet
[4889.82 --> 4894.96]  conrad also did a cool implementation for it uh on mobile so you can like swipe through them and stuff
[4894.96 --> 4902.22]  because obviously the cool wide shelf isn't super compatible with a tall phone um but yeah yeah yeah it's
[4902.22 --> 4909.74]  good stuff free screwdriver bit that is going to be tough because an individual bit coming back to
[4909.74 --> 4917.74]  our conversation about like uh measuring out spools of tubing and you know managing managing that we're
[4917.74 --> 4924.28]  not going to have individual bits for sale i don't think it's it's just it's it's not worth touching
[4924.28 --> 4929.02]  i guess would be the best way that i can describe it because you got to understand that every
[4929.02 --> 4937.78]  every every item has a cost right because somebody has to touch it to put it there touch it to pick
[4937.78 --> 4943.38]  it up touch it to put it somewhere else and every time you touch something that has a cost because
[4943.38 --> 4949.96]  someone has to do it and so something that has such a low cost it's just not worth even touching so
[4949.96 --> 4954.70]  that's why we're going to have bit clips rather than sell individual bits an interesting idea
[4954.70 --> 4962.12]  mentioned by uh angry panda pc uh he said can i pick nothing yes by the way uh and then says or
[4962.12 --> 4967.76]  like to plant trees or something oh interesting well that's that would be cool i think that's really
[4967.76 --> 4971.84]  cool i'd be super down for something like that sure why not you could maybe go with the mr b special
[4971.84 --> 4979.10]  and just do like remove garbage from ocean or plant tree i love it i think that's sweet yeah we're gonna
[4979.10 --> 4983.26]  have to figure out sort of a way to manage that but absolutely how to figure out like how much
[4983.26 --> 4988.04]  contribution can actually go because it should be fairly comparable to the cost of the other
[4988.04 --> 4992.74]  yeah i think we could probably make it as simple as it's just like like a dollar or something like
[4992.74 --> 4997.14]  that a dollar might might be high compared to the cost of a sticker pack compared to the cost of an
[4997.14 --> 5001.44]  enamel pin and it won't be yeah that's fair so as long as we can figure out maybe what we'll do is
[5001.44 --> 5005.52]  we'll run it without that option for a while figure out what the average cost of what people select is and
[5005.52 --> 5009.08]  then we'll just do some equivalent to that and then we'll just make that part of just cost of doing
[5009.08 --> 5013.22]  business and we'll assume that fixed overhead on every order and we'll just go from there i think
[5013.22 --> 5017.64]  that'd be really cool yeah that'd be super cool uh people are talking like third world computing
[5017.64 --> 5022.98]  projects yeah that's that's amazing i love it and just just like all the other things on the free
[5022.98 --> 5027.50]  upsell shelf it could cycle out so someone mentioned the third world computer projects thing yeah yeah well
[5027.50 --> 5031.36]  we could do trees for sure we could do ocean for a bit we could do a different project for a bit
[5031.36 --> 5035.40]  i like that man merch messages are one of my favorite things because when someone
[5035.40 --> 5043.08]  has to like go on your website shop place an order to send something it ends up being a lot more
[5043.08 --> 5049.08]  thoughtful than a lot of the other interaction that we get so it acts as kind of a really um
[5049.80 --> 5054.20]  it acts as a really great filter because you end up with a lot less garbage mind you maybe part of it
[5054.20 --> 5059.08]  is that we have uh jake sorting through all the garbage now jake bell events i should just call him
[5059.08 --> 5062.28]  bell because otherwise he's going to get confused with the the one true jake
[5062.28 --> 5068.92]  we have too many jakes now we've got jacob at creator warehouse we've got jake bell in the
[5068.92 --> 5073.68]  business team we've got jake tyvee in the writing team i'm probably missing a jake there's just a
[5073.68 --> 5079.22]  handful of names that we have like a freaking ton of uh what's uh what's one of the other ones that's
[5079.22 --> 5085.70]  ridiculous yeah we have like so many alexes yeah we have way too many alexes yeah it's it's terrible
[5085.70 --> 5091.46]  we need to get rid of some of them the field train goes a lot more thoughtful and the message on the
[5091.46 --> 5098.34]  screen is like ayo i mean okay sometimes it's also fun just to like see your message on the show because
[5098.34 --> 5102.34]  if you send us one we actually have to reply to a lot of the time you don't get to see it on the
[5102.34 --> 5108.10]  screen so there's there's benefits to both there's benefits to both uh did i eventually answer that
[5108.10 --> 5114.66]  question i i i can't remember anymore is this still the crypto lab question yeah maybe we should
[5114.66 --> 5119.86]  like talk about a tech topic wow that was that was a really long time on one mercer boy it sure was
[5119.86 --> 5126.90]  we tangented so many times along the way sorry i cried i do i do try microsoft will soon require a
[5126.90 --> 5135.22]  microsoft account and internet connection to set up windows 11 pro this was already a thing for home
[5135.22 --> 5145.14]  but now you will officially be wait hold on a second yeah oh my goodness yeah you will officially
[5145.86 --> 5152.66]  not be able to use windows 11 even the pro version without a microsoft account
[5155.78 --> 5160.34]  it was a matter of time you either buy the product or you are the product ladies and gentlemen
[5160.34 --> 5169.06]  yeah brutal i i i part of me wants to go down the path just to rip them a little bit of like
[5169.06 --> 5173.14]  would you have done this sooner if your driver compatibility was better so it was actually possible
[5173.14 --> 5179.22]  um roasted but i don't know i don't think that's actually the case i just wanted to roast them yeah
[5179.22 --> 5186.98]  the fact that it like today still you can buy a com buy a computer component and install windows on
[5186.98 --> 5192.58]  it and like the ethernet driver doesn't work out of the box insane how many actual network chipsets
[5192.58 --> 5199.30]  are there probably hundreds like not probably hundreds definitely hundreds but when we're talking
[5199.30 --> 5206.58]  the scale of microsoft as a company could they have hundreds of network drivers baked in yes yes they
[5206.58 --> 5211.86]  could and how like at least in in my experience linux has had that just so on lock for so long
[5211.86 --> 5217.94]  i've never had a problem with a network driver on linux not once and i know some people have wi-fi
[5217.94 --> 5223.46]  back in the day i never did for wi-fi back in the day either okay and i know okay i know especially
[5223.46 --> 5227.30]  for wi-fi other people did i'm not saying this was not a case for everyone yeah okay but i it was
[5227.30 --> 5234.66]  always easier for me and at least one was always what you really needed right getting at least one way
[5234.66 --> 5238.42]  to access the internet was always the big problem because once you get the one you can update things you
[5238.42 --> 5246.34]  can fix everything easily yeah so yeah um so privateer shirt is pretty popular uh hold on i'm
[5246.34 --> 5253.06]  gonna i'm gonna refresh this like constantly here to see if i can catch it uh nope ah crap
[5255.78 --> 5261.70]  come on come on just need one more one more to come through i think it's a cool shirt even if you
[5261.70 --> 5268.02]  don't have the context which might help yeah okay okay did we get one more no it was something else
[5268.50 --> 5278.90]  okay crud well whatever we sold 419. wow 420 i got it i got it there's my dashboard you guys can't read
[5278.90 --> 5285.70]  that from there but it doesn't matter the point is 420 of them so really excited to get these shirts in
[5285.70 --> 5292.10]  your guys's hands uh see reviews see what you guys think of how close we got to the feel of the existing
[5292.10 --> 5298.34]  ones um what am i supposed to be talking about right now right so this whole microsoft account
[5298.34 --> 5304.26]  thing was announced as part of windows 11 insider preview build 22 55 7 which is an extensive rework
[5304.26 --> 5310.66]  addressing most of the main issues that's that's and making optimistic uh drag and drop to taskbar now
[5310.66 --> 5319.70]  works unbelievable uh color profile quick settings uh task manager redesign more dark mode themed apps
[5319.70 --> 5325.46]  uh mika ui design and more windows better snap layout picker uh new swipe gestures for notifications
[5325.46 --> 5329.22]  quick settings and start have they fixed the issue where when you have a bunch of notifications queued
[5329.22 --> 5335.30]  up you like cannot get at your taskbar at your uh system tray rather that is so annoying you have like
[5335.30 --> 5340.10]  when you're trying to when you're trying to like sneak in there between notifications to get something
[5340.10 --> 5346.10]  um start menu folders folder content previews couldn't you do start menu folders in like windows 95.
[5346.10 --> 5351.06]  a lot of this stuff honestly i'm like when did that originally come in vista like wow expanded dynamic
[5351.06 --> 5356.50]  refresh rate support the release notes clarify that an internet connection is only required for the ubi
[5356.50 --> 5362.50]  or first time setup but if the pc is for personal use you will need a microsoft account to continue
[5362.50 --> 5371.54]  setup realistically most people will probably want to use a microsoft account xbox services um i mean
[5371.54 --> 5377.46]  find my finding your device uh there are lots of like legitimately good reasons i don't think you were
[5377.46 --> 5382.90]  able to use bitlocker without a microsoft account is that correct i just got a suggestion not sure
[5382.90 --> 5390.82]  for the free upsell shelf yeah the bonus bin the bonus bin oh oh like for a name for it yeah who sent you
[5390.82 --> 5396.90]  that uh uh my chopify friend oh really i don't know if i if he wants me to say his real name yeah sure
[5396.90 --> 5405.06]  that's fine bonus bin that's not bad it's pretty good the bonus bin kind of i'm thinking of like
[5405.06 --> 5413.38]  bargain bin but it's not bargain it's not bonus it's like yeah yeah okay pretty good i'm not paying you for it
[5413.38 --> 5420.58]  i'm private hearing it right now he's trying to pay us i i like it perfect i think he's trying to
[5420.58 --> 5425.38]  play us right now i mean it's there it's in their best interest for us to like sell more stuff through
[5425.38 --> 5432.42]  their platform i suppose so we're both kind of winning here yeah um uh what else okay so i don't
[5432.42 --> 5438.82]  know i do you do you use a non-microsoft account with your computer no yeah i use a microsoft account
[5438.82 --> 5446.42]  you know what's funny is i want to but my microsoft account like randomly is broken on both my work
[5446.42 --> 5452.90]  computer and i think my laptop right now so if i go into my microsoft account it'll be like manage
[5452.90 --> 5457.70]  your microsoft account i click it and like takes me opens a web browser and like takes me to my profile
[5459.14 --> 5466.50]  but my computer just goes straight from booting up to the desktop and i can't uh what was i trying to
[5466.50 --> 5470.66]  enable i was trying to oh i was trying to enable windows hello or something it was like you need
[5470.66 --> 5477.78]  to link an account in order to something something and i was like but but it is so what i'm kind of
[5477.78 --> 5485.22]  thinking is stop what i'm kind of thinking is i'll upgrade to windows 11 and maybe that'll fix my problems
[5485.22 --> 5488.18]  okay
[5488.18 --> 5501.94]  all righty then um so we're both in la la land yeah um uh jay from nukleon who posted this news on the
[5501.94 --> 5509.38]  forum uh sums it up thusly the the the controversial or the uh the mixed reaction to this news i hope
[5509.38 --> 5513.94]  whoever thought of this idea and everyone who approved this steps on a lego barefoot
[5516.02 --> 5522.02]  what a polite what a polite way of uh of saying a pox on you yeah a pox on you and your acquaintance
[5522.02 --> 5529.30]  is all anthony's take uh windows is clearly making money via ad and tracking revenue these days so it
[5529.30 --> 5534.50]  makes sense if microsoft is hoping to transition to a free to use model still even apple doesn't force you
[5534.50 --> 5540.34]  to sign into an apple id on mac windows is becoming more of a walled garden by the day yeah for sure
[5540.34 --> 5547.54]  i think i would be less annoyed by it um if if microsoft services weren't such trash um like you're
[5547.54 --> 5555.22]  saying with the the bug that you've had trying to use any like xbox gaming related software on a pc
[5555.22 --> 5563.62]  is just the worst experience try to game with a minor with a minor like a young person other than
[5564.50 --> 5570.82]  like we did last night right but i set it up okay find a young person in your life a cousin or something
[5570.82 --> 5577.06]  like that try to play a video game with them is the difficulty in like they find it very obtuse to be
[5577.06 --> 5586.34]  able to it's how difficult it is to even be aware that there is anything blocking certain services from
[5586.34 --> 5595.38]  working like minecraft dungeons would not work online for a minor and it's like there needs to be
[5595.38 --> 5603.30]  a wizard oh microsoft you didn't just like lie about their age no okay they have actual minor accounts
[5603.30 --> 5610.90]  okay and there's no like hey we couldn't help noticing that your microsoft account is a minor one
[5610.90 --> 5616.42]  is your mom or dad around to sign in and go through this wizard to that would make sense
[5616.42 --> 5622.42]  because that would make sense yeah it's awful and like the wizard you have to put in a password to be
[5622.42 --> 5625.70]  able to access a wizard whatever it doesn't matter but there should be some type of prompt to let you
[5625.70 --> 5633.14]  know what the heck is even going on it's freaking awful it's so it's so frustrating because you know
[5633.14 --> 5639.78]  that it it's it's you know how like there's the 80 20 rule i feel like they've done like 30 of the job
[5639.78 --> 5643.70]  like they they need a significant amount more effort to get to that 80 percent where it's like
[5643.70 --> 5648.82]  okay this is acceptable now and they're not there and it's really really frustrating and the more that
[5648.82 --> 5654.82]  they set it up as a requirement for things but you have to use this thing the more it needs to be better
[5654.82 --> 5660.82]  yes if it just sits there and it's terrible and i don't have to use it then i don't care yeah go be
[5660.82 --> 5668.02]  go be terrible in a corner microsoft online do whatever whatever but if i have to use it it needs to be
[5668.02 --> 5672.42]  significantly better there's a reason why we didn't talk about this pretty much at all for years
[5672.42 --> 5675.94]  because we didn't have to interact with it and now that the amount that we have to interact with
[5675.94 --> 5680.98]  it is increasing we're going to talk about how terrible it is because it's terrible that's it
[5681.86 --> 5687.54]  really really frustrating um digital matrix io says under 13 is really hard because of copper fair
[5687.54 --> 5693.54]  enough but i think what i suggested is better than just having a hidden control panel for the
[5693.54 --> 5702.18]  parent account that has no like obvious way to create a family group in it and no obvious description
[5702.18 --> 5708.34]  of all the different boxes that you need to tick in order to actually just play games with your kids
[5708.34 --> 5715.22]  and here's another thing that's just common sense to me if i am set up as the parent guardian of my
[5715.22 --> 5721.62]  family group i should automatically be set up as someone who is allowed to interact you should be able to
[5721.62 --> 5728.82]  invite them to things immediately yeah i shouldn't even have to activate their access to online gaming
[5728.82 --> 5734.90]  in order for me to play with them and for them to play with each other because what if i didn't want
[5734.90 --> 5742.58]  to yeah what if i didn't want them to be but how is this a useful protection if there is no if there's
[5742.58 --> 5748.66]  no allow list and no common sense applied to it there's there's lots of scenarios where i could see a
[5748.66 --> 5754.50]  parent one like like let's take halo for instance for instance i want to be able to play halo with
[5754.50 --> 5760.26]  my son i don't necessarily want my son to be able to play halo on his own that seems like a very
[5760.26 --> 5766.66]  reasonable use case i don't know there's a funny comment from uh full plane chat major mayhem said
[5766.66 --> 5774.58]  uh microsoft is the mvp of mvp most valuable player of minimum viable product very funny i liked that
[5774.58 --> 5778.98]  that that was good okay that's pretty funny my problem is like i almost think it's below
[5780.10 --> 5784.66]  like i don't think it's at mvp yet but that is what it is um
[5786.18 --> 5791.46]  disney wants to be your government now this one's just kind of like weird what is this disney live in
[5791.46 --> 5799.86]  a corporate suburban hellscape with disney story living oh my god this is disney hotels but you
[5799.86 --> 5804.42]  actually live there you live there yeah there's some really amazing stuff like members of the public
[5804.42 --> 5811.78]  uh will be able to buy day passes to visit the suburban community um and it's like uncertain if
[5811.78 --> 5816.98]  people that live there will have visitor passes that they can give to their non-disney visiting friends
[5817.94 --> 5824.98]  um there's like some amazing sounding thing in the middle the center of the community is a 24 acre
[5824.98 --> 5833.38]  grand oasis i'm sorry i gotta stop you here for a second no joke this is not like theatrics i'm not
[5833.38 --> 5838.10]  acting for the camera i felt physically ill yeah hearing you say that yep i read it before the
[5838.10 --> 5843.62]  show which is the only reason why i didn't have a strong reaction yeah go on though yeah it's rough
[5843.62 --> 5851.06]  um so yeah 1900 housing units named cotino uh will be built in the city of rancho mirage
[5851.54 --> 5856.98]  um they're hoping to offer some of the same types of experiences that you would find at disney resorts
[5856.98 --> 5862.90]  including this 24 acre grand oasis that will have clear water using the crystal lagoons technology
[5862.90 --> 5867.06]  used at their resorts there will be shopping and entertainment centers as well as a hotel
[5867.70 --> 5873.46]  and a clubhouse for residents it sounds extremely similar to a retirement village if you've ever been
[5873.46 --> 5878.50]  to one of those like i said members of the public need to buy day passes to get there this is not the
[5878.50 --> 5882.50]  first time disney has tried to create this community there's um interesting youtube videos on this
[5882.50 --> 5889.62]  actually epcot or epcot in disney world famously began as experimental prototype community of
[5889.62 --> 5895.62]  tomorrow that was supposed to revolutionize the concept of the american city walt's vision was never
[5895.62 --> 5901.86]  seen to completion and now epcot is uh based on whoever wrote this i've never seen it uh the worst
[5901.86 --> 5911.70]  park at walt disney world fair enough yeah wow um while disney is designing the neighborhoods they won't
[5911.70 --> 5917.06]  be building anything they are handing off that to other developer companies like dmb development
[5917.06 --> 5922.34]  a builder of luxury communities around the us disney has not announced prices or financing options
[5922.34 --> 5929.46]  or anything like that huh i'm extremely uncomfortable right now yeah so when are you
[5929.46 --> 5934.82]  going to make the lion's media group tech community you know what's really funny 24 acre land center in the
[5934.82 --> 5941.30]  middle is that actually is something that luke and i have talked about like there are there are literal
[5941.30 --> 5948.66]  ghost towns like in our province that we could probably swoop in and just be like yep this used to
[5948.66 --> 5956.90]  be like a mining or logging or whatever community and now it isn't and so nobody's like here anymore
[5956.90 --> 5963.30]  uh we're just gonna come in and we're gonna like buy it we're gonna pay for a big fat fiber pipe into the
[5963.30 --> 5969.86]  town because realistically that's all most of us need and this is our hq now it's internet town
[5969.86 --> 5977.22]  british columbia yeah um honestly i think it's a matter of time until a youtuber does it there's been
[5977.22 --> 5984.34]  i mean there's a there's a town in i think it was sweden i don't remember it's one of those three you
[5984.34 --> 5990.50]  know countries up there um that did like they took over it was an old military community based on a base
[5990.50 --> 5995.94]  military base um the base was no longer used anymore the community was thus abandoned because
[5995.94 --> 6001.70]  of that so they revamped the entire thing and they turned it into like tech startup town there's
[6001.70 --> 6006.18]  there's like incredible internet connections to everywhere yeah um and they're they're they're
[6006.18 --> 6011.14]  throwing money into startups to give them grants and stuff to start pushing there so they can like
[6011.14 --> 6019.06]  set up this new town um it's it's very interesting um i don't know that that was like four or five
[6019.06 --> 6022.18]  years ago that i heard about that i don't know if it ever actually like worked out or not but
[6022.74 --> 6027.06]  it's an interesting idea because what you're what we're seeing a lot of right now is the same cities
[6027.06 --> 6034.58]  that have always exist just getting bigger not a ton of like new cities cropping up yeah uh jason k
[6034.58 --> 6043.94]  003 on float plane says how far away is that from a cult well um well if you don't put on your linus
[6043.94 --> 6048.50]  socks and linus sandals and linus underwear and linus pants and linus shirt and linus to can line a sweater to
[6048.50 --> 6053.70]  go outside um then you just get kicked out yeah so i'd say it's pretty close to a cult yeah
[6056.50 --> 6063.22]  internet town bc let's go man i mean float plane chat obviously you know full plane jets in not
[6063.22 --> 6070.10]  representative of the general population but like i'm freaking in i'm coming boys
[6070.10 --> 6080.26]  there's a float plane theater on prem yes uh what else is there apple ssds are ridiculously slow
[6080.26 --> 6087.14]  actually and also don't buy a mac mini or an imac if you like your data this is from anthony so
[6087.54 --> 6094.26]  definitely not biased at all hold on a second let me have a look here while developing linux for m1 it
[6094.26 --> 6099.06]  has been discovered that apple's ssds are running much slower than expected it turns out the fsync
[6099.06 --> 6102.90]  command which is supposed to tell the drive to flush everything out from caches to the main storage
[6103.62 --> 6113.14]  doesn't do that on mac os oh instead it only flushes current writes to the drive leaving cached data in
[6113.14 --> 6118.50]  volatile memory the command to actually do fsync called f underscore full sync has some unflattering
[6118.50 --> 6129.62]  benchmark results so if you're not flushing you get 40 000 iops and if you are you get 46 iops not 46
[6129.62 --> 6139.94]  000 46 and this is on the macbook air m1 running mac os on an x86 imac with a wd one terabyte and vme ssd on
[6139.94 --> 6148.18]  linux um not flushing gets you 20 000 and flushing gets you 2 000 that's still an order of magnitude less
[6148.18 --> 6156.74]  but that's a lot better and on an x86 laptop plus a samsung 860 evo 500 gig sata ssd not flushing is
[6156.74 --> 6163.78]  5000 flushing is 143 the end result is that apple storage appears to be much faster than the others
[6163.78 --> 6167.62]  up until the point where you care about data integrity where it becomes comparable to a spinning
[6167.62 --> 6173.22]  hard drive mac os doesn't even seem to try to proactively issue syncs you can write a file on
[6173.22 --> 6179.22]  mac os f sync it wait five seconds issue a hard reboot eg via usb power delivery command and the
[6179.22 --> 6186.82]  data is gone that's pretty bad is a quote from uh not sure hector martin oh on twitter
[6188.74 --> 6194.74]  that's rough i love this twitter thread the start is amazing well this is unfortunate
[6194.74 --> 6204.82]  oh no apple's one of those companies where i just i get really frustrated because they spend more on
[6204.82 --> 6212.34]  r d than almost any other company on earth and they make like nine products well no okay it's not like
[6212.34 --> 6219.86]  that i'm obviously being facetious they they make they design and through partners build some of the most
[6219.86 --> 6224.82]  amazing silicon in the world obviously that takes a freaking lot of work and they make more than nine
[6224.82 --> 6232.18]  and they make more than nine products but for the the breadth and depth of their product portfolio very
[6232.18 --> 6240.10]  yeah it does seem like they spend a lot of money and i just wish that some of it was on stuff that i cared
[6240.10 --> 6251.46]  about yeah i just i just feel like i just feel like they yeah could do more better um to be clear this
[6251.46 --> 6255.86]  is basically never an issue on laptops because the battery should keep the machine from losing power
[6255.86 --> 6262.18]  before the os has finished a disk flush command but for desktops like the m1 mac mini or 24-inch imac
[6262.18 --> 6268.66]  this could be a huge problem either writing your files is excruciatingly slow or you could lose even a
[6268.66 --> 6274.66]  file you saved five minutes ago to a power outage or a thankfully rare system crash hope you've got
[6274.66 --> 6281.94]  an uninterruptible power supply says anthony and his discussion question is why i guess i already kind
[6281.94 --> 6288.90]  of covered that when you have the r d budget of a small country why don't you get the basics right
[6290.50 --> 6296.34]  i yeah just hold your phone differently dude but hey at least they've uh at least they've got it
[6296.34 --> 6302.66]  nailed down how to like you know lock screen replacements yeah you know so you can't that was
[6302.66 --> 6307.38]  worth it yeah that was totally worth the time they spent on that they shouldn't have spent that time
[6307.38 --> 6312.34]  making sure that you don't lose your data that was i mean you should have just had icloud anyway
[6312.34 --> 6318.10]  realistically so yeah uh okay and i want to clarify i know that they backtracked the whole locking out
[6318.10 --> 6323.46]  screen replacements thing but that doesn't change that they did the r d for it i i think they backtracked it
[6323.46 --> 6329.46]  because they because of the the pushback not because they didn't want it jaden says if you
[6329.46 --> 6339.14]  don't have a ups you are wrong i knew for years that i'm supposed to have a ups before i was willing
[6339.14 --> 6346.02]  to spend ups money on having a ups can't necessarily afford it if you can definitely afford a ups and you
[6346.02 --> 6351.62]  do important things on your computer and you don't have one i think you're wrong that's fair that is fair
[6351.62 --> 6362.58]  and in our final big news topic of the day dr ian cutras has left a non-tech oh no after 11 years dr
[6362.58 --> 6370.74]  cutras aka tech tech potato the tech journalist known for eating giant wafers yes my friends that
[6370.74 --> 6378.50]  is an actual file photo of dr cutras that we have here actually that's his photo um he has announced his
[6378.50 --> 6385.06]  departure from an on tech as senior editor he joined as a freelancer while anand the anand of anand tech
[6385.06 --> 6389.14]  was still editor-in-chief and has been responsible for some of an on-tech's most technical articles in
[6389.14 --> 6395.54]  recent years particularly with respect to cpu architecture excuse me and lithography his crowning
[6395.54 --> 6401.62]  achievement in his humble opinion i added the humble part uh was talking amd into the
[6401.62 --> 6410.50]  the 3 990 price tag for the threadripper 39 90x this is one of those things kind of like how my
[6410.50 --> 6417.86]  crowning achievement is like more packaging on tubing um this is a yeah it's a pretty small win but a
[6417.86 --> 6423.14]  notable one nonetheless i love it dr cutras as for where he's going he says it will be a mixture of
[6423.14 --> 6428.74]  behind the scenes and public facing opportunities as well as consulting within the tech industry he says
[6428.74 --> 6434.02]  he will announce future roles on twitter or linkedin probably both he seems to know where he's going
[6434.02 --> 6440.02]  and is amused by the speculation online his farewell article will not be the last article on anand tech
[6440.02 --> 6444.50]  some have been pre-written and are waiting to go up including an amd rem rent review and an interview
[6444.50 --> 6450.10]  with roger kuduri until senior vp of architecture in the graphics and software division and a google
[6450.10 --> 6455.30]  search for roger kuduri will actually reveal dr cutras's previous interview so there are some discussion
[6455.30 --> 6463.46]  questions around this are we hiring dr cutras is literally in there from anthony yes um well
[6465.70 --> 6470.98]  there are other discussion questions like what does this mean for tech journalism uh what would it mean
[6470.98 --> 6477.06]  if he went to work for an intel uh like okay hold on let's see so if he went to work for an intel like
[6477.06 --> 6484.10]  ryan shroud or went to work for apple like anon did or went to work for uh who are who are some of my
[6484.10 --> 6491.62]  other favorites uh gary key um went to work for asus or went to work for amd like scott wasson from the
[6491.62 --> 6498.50]  tech report now now at intel um is it the fate of tech journalists to work for the companies they cover
[6498.50 --> 6506.90]  given enough time so what i will say about that is that our goal is to do our part to reverse that trend
[6506.90 --> 6514.10]  with the lab we are we're putting serious budgets behind recruitment for serious people who seriously
[6514.10 --> 6519.22]  know serious things about serious tech and we're still going to have a fun way of presenting that
[6519.22 --> 6525.94]  data and that analysis but we we want to get real serious business about the analysis and we recognize
[6525.94 --> 6531.54]  that i'm not going to learn everything there is to know about chip architecture in fact i might not
[6531.54 --> 6537.14]  learn a small fraction of what there is to learn about trip architecture but what i can do is i can
[6537.14 --> 6542.66]  bring in experts make sure that they have a bag of money to tell me all about it and we can continue
[6542.66 --> 6547.94]  making super fun videos for you guys because that's what i'm really good at if i had a superpower it would
[6547.94 --> 6554.34]  be taking something that there's almost no one on earth who understands least of all me and turning it
[6554.34 --> 6559.22]  into something that's really fun and engaging that still manages to teach people something that's
[6559.22 --> 6567.94]  i think what i do so i want the lab to make me way better at that um and then actually there's
[6567.94 --> 6573.78]  like so many oh man there's like the vision for the lab is like broad it's very expensive yeah yeah
[6573.78 --> 6580.18]  it's gonna be really expensive yeah so rug pull is that expansive it's both yeah that's also true
[6580.18 --> 6584.18]  rug pull rug pull the lab we gotta rug pull the lab it's really the only choice i think we don't
[6584.18 --> 6589.70]  only i think we have a moral obligation to rug pull to fund the lab yep would you guys support a
[6589.70 --> 6594.18]  rug pull you know what we don't do too many straw polls these days but i think we have to know the
[6594.18 --> 6603.14]  answer to this i think i think chat is actually going to explode um if you don't say it if i don't say
[6603.14 --> 6608.58]  what uh whether or not we're hiring dr cutras if i don't say whether or not we're hiring dr cutras yeah
[6608.58 --> 6615.70]  oh so how's the poll going uh yeah let me just go ahead and post that i'm going to start in float
[6615.70 --> 6618.26]  plane chat good yeah i'll i'll propagate it from there
[6621.78 --> 6625.38]  okay uh oh you propagate it from there oh you're going to throw it in the other ones well here why
[6625.38 --> 6630.02]  don't you do twitch and i'll do youtube okay okay i'm gonna put it in there boom boom boom guys check
[6630.02 --> 6635.54]  out that chat we're gonna oh oh i'm not logged in on twitch okay well why don't i just do all of them
[6635.54 --> 6645.62]  then nice nice i voted nice that was my contribution thanks luke really appreciate you fam yep okay oh
[6645.62 --> 6651.70]  my god i don't need the chat rules for my own chat i voted for the correct answer wow why does twitch
[6651.70 --> 6658.18]  do that uh it's like not being able to play video games with my own children like why there just needs
[6658.18 --> 6664.74]  to be a common sense filter on this stuff uh all right here we go you guys ready for the results i'm
[6664.74 --> 6670.66]  ready for the results results actually oh i meant to vote hold on i wanted to vote wow it has just been
[6670.66 --> 6679.06]  swinging rug pull the chip pulled from the lab 86 yes you guys are such trolls uh that's why i like
[6679.06 --> 6684.58]  what if we just told everyone it was a rug pull ethical rug pull
[6684.58 --> 6685.14]  yeah
[6687.94 --> 6693.30]  like 100 transparency from the start well we talked about that with ltt coin what if we
[6693.30 --> 6700.90]  we even talked about it back then called it ltc labs rug pull coin like like no no question
[6704.82 --> 6712.18]  oh my goodness oh my goodness that would actually be really funny um megan says first merch order since
[6712.18 --> 6720.50]  ltx 19 can't wait for ltx 2023 oh man thanks megan uh really appreciate you picked up the women's
[6720.50 --> 6726.42]  sweat something i i missed it um jeff bella vance over there moved it on me for those of you not in
[6726.42 --> 6729.62]  on the joke i'm calling him jeff because i accidentally called him jeff because i had a
[6729.62 --> 6734.34]  total brain fart a couple of weeks ago it's it's jake but i'm just gonna go with bell let's go with bell
[6734.34 --> 6739.94]  let's do some curated merch messages shall we bigz asks if you want to do a fundraising event just add a
[6739.94 --> 6744.58]  wallet on the store so people can give you money and get merch in return later that's called a gift
[6744.58 --> 6751.94]  card thank you though thank you i do appreciate the idea um we do have gift cards if you'd like to go
[6751.94 --> 6757.86]  pick up some gift cards on ltcstore.com yeah defrandel picked up a couch ripper pillow will the screwdriver
[6757.86 --> 6764.90]  have a way to adapt for square drive sockets so because it uses a standard hex uh a standard hex
[6764.90 --> 6771.78]  socket you can just get any adapter you want and plug it into it and it will work fine just fine
[6775.22 --> 6779.22]  a question while you're picking that up do you see your children having a part in the business
[6779.22 --> 6782.90]  when they are older i would love for them to but i'm not going to be one of those parents who plans
[6782.90 --> 6789.06]  out my children's future before they even like you know have their first sip of alcohol like
[6789.06 --> 6796.10]  yeah that's why my parents never planned a future for me and why i ended up being such a loser nice
[6796.10 --> 6802.34]  i still haven't done it actually no that's not true i had a sip of beer when i was like seven or eight
[6802.98 --> 6807.14]  have i ever said on the show what my parents did with my brother and i in regards to alcohol i think
[6807.14 --> 6812.50]  it might be luke's story time have i told you i know the story yeah so my my parents both said um
[6812.50 --> 6818.42]  um that we could we could have alcohol we could drink this was like before we were of age or
[6818.42 --> 6823.22]  whatever but the first time that we would have to do it we were gonna we could have as much as we
[6823.22 --> 6830.50]  wanted we would go buy however much they wanted us to buy um but we'd have to be locked in the backyard
[6830.50 --> 6836.26]  with them the whole time and it was like that's the coolest thing ever and then neither of us took him
[6836.26 --> 6842.50]  up on it and i'm pretty sure my brother waited till he was like actually uh not entirely but mostly
[6842.50 --> 6847.06]  until he's reasonably of age and then he's not even anywhere i think he drinks like once a year
[6847.06 --> 6855.30]  and i don't drink at all so it clearly worked yeah i guess so um for for me it was uh it was it was the
[6855.30 --> 6862.58]  classic you know give it to them while their taste buds are still extremely sensitive um and it's really
[6862.58 --> 6867.54]  so it's a combination of things like i have a lot of really negative associations with the smell of
[6867.54 --> 6878.82]  beer and wine um me too i will i will leave it at that um and uh one of one of them is that i tried
[6878.82 --> 6884.98]  it when i was very young and it was just you know obviously it's a god-awful taste when you're not
[6884.98 --> 6889.62]  mostly for me i don't have negative associations from like people necessarily i just remember like
[6890.34 --> 6894.50]  one time i was at a friend's house and the adults were drinking wine and one of the adults offered
[6894.50 --> 6899.46]  me wine i took a sip and i was like that's genuinely disgusting literally fermented that's really gross
[6899.46 --> 6904.90]  yeah and then a buddy in high school was like oh i got some beers do you want one and i was like
[6906.34 --> 6910.50]  no and he was like we'll try a sip and i was like okay and i tried to sip and i was like that's
[6910.50 --> 6916.58]  disgusting you can you can have the rest if you want this is gross i don't know i'm just not into it
[6916.58 --> 6920.58]  i know a lot of people are going to disagree with me yeah i mean and people are welcome welcome to
[6920.58 --> 6927.22]  disagree i mean there's strong arguments to be made for like the the fermentation of of hops and
[6928.50 --> 6934.98]  as like one of the reasons that humanity made it like yeah yeah like modern civilization as we know
[6934.98 --> 6941.86]  it like modern farming and like like centralized cities rather than just roaming you know tribes of
[6941.86 --> 6947.06]  people wandering around wasn't also like a really big part of like being able to uh make water
[6947.06 --> 6951.62]  consumable in an easier way than constantly boiling everything yeah i don't remember there's something
[6951.62 --> 6956.26]  to do with that i don't know but like yeah yeah there's there's like there's like to be clear i'm
[6956.26 --> 6962.58]  not down on it i have absolutely no moral objection whatsoever to consumption of alcohol i don't care
[6962.58 --> 6968.34]  as long as you're not a danger to yourself or others i'm not i i feel my my need to be involved is
[6968.34 --> 6975.38]  exactly zero yep i just it's just not for me yeah not for me either uh flash 728 says the disgusting
[6975.38 --> 6982.58]  taste makes your food taste better is that the whole pairings thing i don't know i don't i don't get it
[6982.58 --> 6989.70]  i don't know man uh love it anyway what i wanted to show you was this is a near final screwdriver
[6989.70 --> 6996.10]  this is from the oh there's ball sweat on it let me get that for you i i just i had it
[6997.62 --> 7004.42]  well it's not really like sweat it's more like um humidity sure yeah uh anyway see he'll touch it
[7004.42 --> 7011.38]  yeah i don't care that ratchet is from the chinese supplier that did not get acquired by a competitor
[7011.38 --> 7017.70]  and therefore is actually willing to produce product for us uh the plastics are all shot in the same
[7017.70 --> 7023.30]  material unlike the one that i've been using for six months the ratchet is not quite there we're
[7023.30 --> 7030.74]  doing some work on the tolerances to make it a little bit quieter the top will still swivel and
[7030.74 --> 7037.22]  the reason for that is a that's how the bit retention mechanism works so you can turn it to
[7037.22 --> 7040.90]  see all the different bits that are in it and b it allows you to use it a number of different ways
[7040.90 --> 7047.14]  yeah i like so you can power drive like that you can use it kind of like the you know the i fix it
[7047.14 --> 7051.94]  one like if you're if you're down on something like this and you're turning it like that or you can turn
[7051.94 --> 7055.46]  the ratchet with your fingers with the knurling the knurling i think we're also going to go a little bit
[7055.46 --> 7063.22]  deeper the taiwanese supplier had the knurling just right on on theirs um but the chinese supplier is
[7063.22 --> 7068.98]  still getting things figured out one of the coolest things about the the switch to the new supplier is a
[7068.98 --> 7076.26]  the quality is way better which is great i guess because um chinese tool manufacturers are not able
[7076.26 --> 7084.34]  to ship into the us without tariffs right now so they need work and because our screwdriver is going
[7084.34 --> 7091.22]  to have all the plastic shot and final assembly done in canada even though the ratchet and shaft are
[7091.22 --> 7097.94]  going to be manufactured and assembled in china and then sent over here enough of the manufacturing and
[7097.94 --> 7102.42]  assembly is done in canada that is now a canadian made screwdriver nice so we are not subject to
[7102.42 --> 7109.30]  tariffs so we can use the high quality chinese supplier that needs work and we can avoid the
[7109.30 --> 7115.54]  tariffs and be price competitive and it's just going to be a really really great tool that's awesome i'm
[7115.54 --> 7121.94]  extremely excited but can it play crisis unfortunately sorry no not so much it'll make a lot of things that
[7121.94 --> 7129.22]  can play crisis though uh nathan h asks how dirty do you let your laptop screen get before you have to
[7129.22 --> 7136.74]  clean it so when i have milk splatter from like eating cereal in front of it that no longer wipes off
[7137.46 --> 7142.58]  i i have to go get water and i have to i have to clean it that's my threshold i mean here you tell me
[7142.58 --> 7147.94]  how how bad is this it's pretty bad i it's greasy i've yeah i know it's it's it's really bad i've pointed
[7147.94 --> 7152.42]  this out before though and you pointed out in a counterpoint that that gets particularly bad because
[7152.42 --> 7157.22]  it's always closed yeah i open it only when i'm using it it doesn't even get wiped by like sliding
[7157.22 --> 7162.74]  in and out of my pocket not even a little so it does tend to get a little grody because i i remember
[7162.74 --> 7168.18]  seeing quite a while ago your phone screen and i was like wow that's really grody i'm not used to
[7168.18 --> 7172.90]  linus's phone screen being really grody um but yeah it's because it doesn't get wiped constantly in and
[7172.90 --> 7181.14]  out of your pocket how about you are you are you here give me your razor okay we're gonna shame him
[7181.14 --> 7185.46]  we're gonna publicly shame him i'm expecting his keyboard to be disgusting his screen to actually
[7185.46 --> 7196.58]  be relatively clean nailed it there's like actual crud in between the keys on a laptop keyboard look at
[7196.58 --> 7201.70]  this under the backspace it's gross and i've actually like cleaned it i for people that don't know my hands
[7201.70 --> 7207.78]  just like leak they like shoof it's onto things it's actually insane it's very it's always annoying
[7207.78 --> 7212.82]  for for uh my current girlfriend and any other girlfriend that i've ever had because i hate
[7212.82 --> 7220.90]  holding hands because my own hand will just any amount of added heat and then also not being exposed
[7220.90 --> 7228.26]  to the air is just gonna make it just soak and even if they don't care i just hate it when we went
[7228.26 --> 7233.14]  work from home luke just like left all his stuff here and nobody wanted to touch his keyboard to
[7233.14 --> 7239.30]  clean it up and like the weird part is that keyboard on my laptop i have actually cleaned like a lot of
[7239.30 --> 7245.14]  times and it just doesn't matter because it's going to immediately come back because i like yeah i don't
[7245.14 --> 7251.14]  know every once in a while when i'm sick i'll have actually dry hands because it will stop and i'm every
[7251.14 --> 7257.54]  reasonable time it happens i'm like whoa this is what it's like to be normal this is crazy i don't
[7257.54 --> 7262.98]  know it's annoying john a asks uh games keep getting bigger some are massive m.2 storage keeps getting
[7262.98 --> 7267.06]  cheaper do you think we'll go back to a cartridge system with games pre-installed on m.2s that we
[7267.06 --> 7273.54]  insert nest style no i really don't think so because the other factor is that the internet keeps getting
[7273.54 --> 7279.30]  faster and that's that's just going to be the way to deliver games i'm afraid brian says finally buying a
[7279.30 --> 7283.46]  shirt got the mouse pad as soon as it dropped what are your cat's names and are they as tech literate
[7283.46 --> 7290.34]  as you our cat's name is dash we only have one cat now um pretty much every story about uh why we only
[7290.34 --> 7296.02]  have one cat is sad and i've definitely told it on the wan show before so i'm not going to revisit it
[7296.02 --> 7301.94]  right now but yeah walter says have you seen the ufd tech new egg scandal they didn't pay for video
[7301.94 --> 7308.26]  sponsorships i have not watched it yet i really need to it's brutal sorry i'm getting away from it
[7308.26 --> 7313.62]  it's very bram it luke you gotta watch it come on man yeah okay you gotta watch it though okay i'll
[7313.62 --> 7318.42]  watch it i know they too i know you don't like watching full-length videos he does a too long
[7318.42 --> 7322.58]  didn't watch thing at the very beginning of the video oh maybe i'll just do that then yeah okay
[7322.58 --> 7327.70]  yeah um i know nick has watched it and i think we're working on some kind of ltd store sponsorship
[7327.70 --> 7332.58]  for him or something like that he actually does a positive call out in the video because the same thing
[7332.58 --> 7337.62]  like ltd store and new egg sponsored the same thing for him yeah ltd store sent him twice the amount of
[7337.62 --> 7342.98]  merch stuff that they were originally agreed to yeah just for like funsies i guess and new egg just
[7342.98 --> 7347.78]  like didn't pay him cool and then try to pay him hush money to like not talk about it what's the
[7347.78 --> 7352.66]  difference between repaying someone what you owe them and paying them hush money i i haven't watched
[7352.66 --> 7360.26]  the video so i'm legit just asking it was uh if i remember correctly he was like trying to get it for a long time
[7360.26 --> 7366.66]  oh man i don't want to misquote you should all just watch the video it's really good um i think
[7366.66 --> 7370.82]  what happened was he started being a little bit more public about it and then they were like hey
[7370.82 --> 7376.10]  we'll give you like three times the amount if everything's cool now it wasn't like we're actually
[7376.10 --> 7382.10]  gonna fix it it was three times the amount and it was clearly only done because he's a public figure
[7382.10 --> 7390.10]  got it which always feels bad because if if they're gonna take care of you just because you're
[7390.10 --> 7396.66]  a public figure it's not okay well it's like the um it's like the the whole someone who is someone
[7396.66 --> 7403.46]  who's kind to you and rude to a waiter is a rude person like it's that simple exactly uh justin k with
[7403.46 --> 7408.34]  nintendo's recent disregard for game preservation will you be throwing caution to the wind and doing a
[7408.34 --> 7413.86]  switch emulation comparison on the various handheld gaming pc something something i am a pirate uh
[7414.42 --> 7422.26]  nice nice privateer shirt by the way uh i actually included switch emulation uh in my coverage of the
[7423.22 --> 7429.70]  ian neo 2021 pro i talked about i think i was using yuzu that's the that's the switch emulator i ended up
[7429.70 --> 7436.26]  using i think that the steam deck is going to be an excellent candidate for switch emulation i would
[7436.26 --> 7441.14]  strongly encourage you guys to do everything in your power to own a legal copy of games that you
[7441.14 --> 7446.34]  are going to play however you know you want to talk ethical piracy i think there's a strong argument to
[7446.34 --> 7452.90]  be made for playing breath of the wild on your desktop at 60 fps with your breath of the wild cartridge
[7452.90 --> 7461.14]  sitting carefully away in your closet somewhere and not being played at 30 stupid fps because nintendo
[7461.14 --> 7466.26]  can't be bothered to release that software on something powerful enough to actually run it like i
[7467.38 --> 7475.38]  i i i have i have always said i think there is a lot of gray in this whole conversation we are not the
[7475.38 --> 7482.50]  arbiterous of what you should and shouldn't do i do intend to discuss switch emulation performance on the
[7483.30 --> 7489.94]  valve steam deck is the short answer to that uh brandon g says love and appreciate all you guys do have you
[7489.94 --> 7493.94]  considered adding an archive page to the store to show all the products and iterations of them that
[7493.94 --> 7498.74]  you've ever released it's a cool idea um no i haven't thought of that i don't know that we would
[7498.74 --> 7504.58]  expend dev time on it since it has i'm gonna get into really boring really boring crappy stupid business
[7504.58 --> 7509.70]  talk with you right now but there's no roi on that yeah i literally can't sell it to you so why am i
[7509.70 --> 7517.30]  even doing that um if we had absolutely nothing else to do sure but even then probably not we'd probably
[7517.30 --> 7521.30]  work on like a really funny april fool's joke or something like that it would maybe because we're
[7521.30 --> 7526.26]  not like getting rid of all that information so it would be maybe be more information uh interesting
[7526.26 --> 7532.66]  sorry to have like a blog newsletter thing that goes out like a bunch of years from now going like
[7532.66 --> 7538.42]  i'll look at 10 years ago versus now i look at five years ago versus now whatever uh we've looked into
[7538.42 --> 7544.42]  uv reactive inc we have not had a ton of success with it so we are not going to release anything that we
[7544.42 --> 7550.02]  can't stand behind alexander jay how did you like using an led wall screen during the deal or no deal
[7550.02 --> 7556.66]  show thing pc or no pc a while back do you plan on any more stage style shows we've had so many
[7556.66 --> 7563.86]  production challenges with those yeah that we just i don't think uh bell we don't have anything like
[7563.86 --> 7569.70]  that in the pipe right now do we i'm getting i'm getting one of these right now so nothing nothing for
[7569.70 --> 7577.30]  the time being any plans for more bts asks patrick s like 17 videos in one week and tech linked make
[7577.30 --> 7581.14]  a video in one day thing as someone in that industry it's been some of my favorite content
[7581.14 --> 7588.50]  also would love more designs in the app and it ended there um any plans for more bts honestly
[7589.22 --> 7594.42]  the bts videos that we've done have mostly been because we had a sponsor that was really like
[7594.42 --> 7599.70]  workflow focused and you know wanted something that would go along with their thing and we couldn't
[7599.70 --> 7605.78]  really come up with any other idea it's not because those are our favorite videos to produce it's just
[7605.78 --> 7612.42]  something that we know that there are people who enjoy and so we wanted to kind of try to find all the
[7612.42 --> 7618.50]  synergies and put them together again it's more like boring business stuff luke have you tried lost ark yet
[7618.50 --> 7626.50]  uh i have the if my like super quick review would be that the story is very skip worthy
[7627.06 --> 7631.54]  the mechanics and gameplay is very fun and it is extremely pay to win and if you think it's not
[7631.54 --> 7636.82]  you're wrong okay cool roberto asks do you have any plans on making an ltt lunch bag to go with the
[7636.82 --> 7644.50]  backpack and water bottle are you in my brain of course i've been wondering you guys should do like
[7644.50 --> 7649.54]  more pirate themed stuff because you have a banana and now you have a pirate shirt like i feel like
[7649.54 --> 7654.10]  i don't i can't think of what you do not have a pirate shirt you have a privateer shirt we do and
[7654.10 --> 7659.14]  you have a privateering banana we have a banana i don't know if it's a privateering banana but we
[7659.14 --> 7663.46]  certainly have a banana i don't know it's honestly not something i want to lean into that heavy i don't
[7663.46 --> 7670.02]  know if you noticed but i haven't even addressed any of what happened on the show today i it's just for me
[7670.02 --> 7677.22]  the whole thing has just been kind of like okay pretty much everyone has moved on there's a very
[7677.22 --> 7685.54]  very very small number of people who are still very very very however it is that they feel about it and
[7687.06 --> 7696.98]  okay yeah i've said everything that i could possibly say about it at this point so here's a shirt lol
[7700.66 --> 7707.30]  um tau t says ah you've privateered me dollars you hearties or me hearties i don't know whatever
[7707.30 --> 7712.10]  i don't have a very good pirate voice real question will mg ever consider making a tech tip wiki kind of
[7712.10 --> 7717.22]  like how lewis is doing with the repair stuff um would you support a well-made community effort converting
[7717.22 --> 7723.22]  and summarizing videos to wiki format uh that's one of the things i would like the lab to tackle uh john our
[7723.22 --> 7729.78]  tech wiki writer actually had the idea of doing like a tech dictionary a tectionary and i was like wait like
[7729.78 --> 7733.78]  physical he's like yeah it would be like it'd be like kind of cool we could bind it really nicely
[7733.78 --> 7738.34]  i was like john we're not doing we're not printing a dictionary it's the year is not 1983.
[7738.74 --> 7743.78]  um the first tip in the dictionary would be that you should look up things online yeah and like trees
[7743.78 --> 7752.74]  man come on um love you john um but what i what that actually got my brain thinking about was hey maybe
[7752.74 --> 7760.98]  that should be part of ltd labs is this just quick and dirty hey what is that i need to know i don't
[7760.98 --> 7766.10]  even have time to watch a video for like three minutes uh absolutely i could see that being something
[7766.10 --> 7770.90]  that we would pursue jake says love the show first time catching live any plans for pet merch
[7774.10 --> 7777.14]  okay why don't you do some stuff i'm gonna go see if i can find something okay
[7779.06 --> 7782.26]  um water cooling stream deck win
[7782.98 --> 7784.66]  oh it's a matter of time yeah
[7785.78 --> 7789.86]  someone will probably beat us to it though we're so slow now if you guys couldn't hear that you said
[7789.86 --> 7795.38]  someone will probably beat us to it though we're so slow now um there's a lot of questions in here that
[7795.38 --> 7799.14]  are very specifically for linus like is there a framework update and stuff so i'm trying to skip
[7799.14 --> 7805.62]  through things and find some find some me stuff um there's one that said my name and then it flew
[7805.62 --> 7811.54]  away here it is james r said luke what is your job title c-o-o-o and what would someone have to do
[7811.54 --> 7817.46]  in school to get a like yours i have no idea uh
[7817.46 --> 7826.18]  uh um i don't know dude i do a lot of weird stuff i'm kind of all over the map so i don't think there
[7826.18 --> 7832.10]  is one thing um that you could go to school for that would cover my i'm not saying like i'm so smart
[7832.10 --> 7838.34]  that it's impossible i just do a weird range of stuff and the stuff that i do covers a lot of
[7838.34 --> 7842.10]  different sections just because of like what linus was talking about earlier i've just worked here for
[7842.10 --> 7847.22]  a really long time so i have experience in a lot of things that we very specifically do and i can
[7847.22 --> 7851.78]  do a lot of those things so there's not like a degree that's like this is how you work at linus
[7851.78 --> 7858.82]  media group or flow plane or creator warehouse or whatever um i just i don't know getting into software
[7858.82 --> 7865.06]  is a really good idea computer science software engineering i i originally took software engineering
[7865.06 --> 7870.90]  um and then got into this but now the majority almost everything that i do doesn't directly have to do
[7870.90 --> 7876.42]  with software engineering so i don't know dude having done that degree does help me though because
[7876.42 --> 7881.22]  when i'm talking to the developers and stuff that i oversee i can actually generally understand what
[7881.22 --> 7888.26]  they're dealing with what problems are having those types of things so i don't know dude um yeah sorry
[7890.58 --> 7893.78]  i'm a fabricator looking to change careers and your job sounds like the most interesting
[7893.78 --> 7900.26]  satisfying thanks um yeah i don't know hopefully that helps but yeah getting into software is a solid idea
[7900.26 --> 7910.42]  um you have to constantly deal with very mentally aggravating problems um it's it's a
[7912.58 --> 7918.10]  challenging job for a perfectionist because there is always things that are changing especially if you
[7918.10 --> 7921.78]  do stuff like web development uh there are always things that are changing that are outside of your
[7921.78 --> 7927.06]  control that are going to impact the thing that you made and potentially make it worse or buggy or or
[7927.06 --> 7932.58]  whatever so it is it is constant and it can be grueling but it can pay really well and there's really
[7932.58 --> 7939.78]  good job security because like everyone's hiring so that's what i'd say i don't remember my wallet is
[7939.78 --> 7946.58]  so that's um probably a problem that's unfortunate uh yeah so i think i have a solution to this i need
[7946.58 --> 7951.06]  a little i need you to stall for me for a little bit though sure can i ask you questions absolutely okay
[7951.06 --> 7957.46]  how is everything going with framework there hasn't been an update in a while uh well i'm not at liberty to share
[7958.34 --> 7966.26]  um everything that's going down with framework so the problem for me is that
[7967.14 --> 7975.30]  okay i don't know anything that any other investor wouldn't but because i've like had conversations with
[7975.30 --> 7982.82]  them and i don't know what's confidential and and what's not i've found that for my part it feels like
[7982.82 --> 7990.02]  the best thing to do is just kind of keep my mouth shut um i was considering doing like a longer term
[7990.02 --> 7995.30]  review now that i've been daily driving the framework and basically the title is pretty simple did i make a
[7995.30 --> 8001.06]  mistake uh would be would be what i would go with for the title and i'll talk about some of the things that
[8001.06 --> 8005.70]  have been really great about my framework laptop and some of the things that have been honestly not
[8005.70 --> 8011.06]  as great about my framework laptop i mean part of the way that i see my role as an investor in framework
[8011.06 --> 8023.94]  is um as being able to give me right like i i feel like i'm i'm there to add credibility but i can only
[8023.94 --> 8029.54]  add credibility if i'm still able to criticize it so in a way it's kind of like being the coach's son
[8029.54 --> 8037.22]  like it ain't an advantage kids yeah so that's kind of how i'm that's kind of how i'm looking at
[8037.22 --> 8043.46]  it right now i just don't have too much to say that i hadn't said before so that's a little tough
[8044.10 --> 8048.50]  nothing right now there's another question from jordan s yeah this is high linus squared i'm a
[8048.50 --> 8053.06]  mechanic or high l squared i should say so i guess he means all of us yeah i'm a mechanical design
[8053.06 --> 8058.90]  engineer and i love the newsletter how did the issue with the magnets in the kids build a pc toy
[8059.54 --> 8066.34]  turn out oh we are working on a different product that is going to require an enormous absolutely
[8066.34 --> 8076.66]  immense volume of neodymium and and magnet purchases so we are at a price break now where we can actually
[8076.66 --> 8084.66]  get custom shaped magnets made that we can embed in the wood in a way that is i that i would i would
[8084.66 --> 8091.06]  trust my life too i would trust my child's life that that magnet is never coming out of that piece
[8091.06 --> 8099.86]  however that project that has the much greater potential for volume has sidelined the kids first pc
[8099.86 --> 8105.94]  project for the time being it's it's if anything it's more hopeful than ever before it's going to be
[8105.94 --> 8111.06]  an insanely expensive toy neodymium i don't know if you guys have been paying attention to this it's like
[8111.06 --> 8119.62]  5x in price in in recent times and that that kids first pc toy is going to have like 50 or 60 freaking
[8119.62 --> 8126.50]  magnets in it like it's ridiculous the the cost of neodymium alone in that stupid toy is going to be
[8126.50 --> 8135.22]  dozens of dollars so it's going to be really expensive um but it's also i think going to be one of those
[8135.22 --> 8141.86]  things that even if we just did it as a as a limited run item you know one time okay yeah we're
[8141.86 --> 8146.50]  going to make this thing i think it could be the sort of thing that is like actually a collectible
[8147.70 --> 8154.42]  so there's an argument to be made for for picking one up when we when we finally do it but it's not
[8154.42 --> 8163.70]  going to be soon all right i'm ready luke hold on don't look don't look okay okay i think i've seen this
[8163.70 --> 8175.78]  though have you i think so okay meet the wag hoodie yeah yeah yeah yeah so awesome uh this is so cool
[8175.78 --> 8186.18]  this is bridget's dog uh why is why is the photo viewer in windows so bad always it's amazing it's
[8186.18 --> 8191.70]  it's actually shocking well no in windows 7 it was fine actually that's fair there it is
[8191.70 --> 8201.22]  it's the wag hoodie so sweet so cute yes that's a real zipper yes it actually functions yes our
[8201.22 --> 8209.94]  supplier told us we were crazy i mean i don't know maybe you like okay here hypothetically dogs are a
[8209.94 --> 8216.18]  great way to pick someone up right so you might need somewhere to keep a condom hey you don't want it to
[8216.18 --> 8220.66]  just be like in your pocket doggy bags yeah because that could be awkward right yeah you just
[8220.66 --> 8226.50]  spare doggy bags just okay guys i'm obviously more on the serious side i'm obviously reaching
[8226.50 --> 8231.46]  here but yeah that that's that's genius yeah for sure you could put your your little doggy poo
[8231.46 --> 8238.58]  pickup bags in there or whatever yeah i'm sure chat is exploding oh yeah no no i shall own this uh yeah
[8238.58 --> 8245.14]  you will yeah i have to get one for my parents dog yeah you will no question we will sell it guys it's
[8245.14 --> 8250.50]  it's going to happen uh i think it was bridget who pitched this i'm not sure but it was one of those
[8250.50 --> 8258.02]  things where everyone's every once in a while we'll have a conversation where she like goes into a thing
[8258.02 --> 8264.18]  and she's like okay hear me out i think we should do i think we should do this and i'm like yes and she's
[8264.18 --> 8270.18]  like here are the reasons i think that between the cost i'm like we're doing it and she's like
[8270.18 --> 8279.14]  right but don't you want to listen i'm like no no disrespect i don't mean to be rude but nothing
[8279.14 --> 8286.10]  that you could say could possibly change this outcome you want it to happen i'm more on board than
[8286.10 --> 8293.70]  you i think let's go let's freaking go part of the idea of like hiring people that are better than
[8293.70 --> 8298.18]  you at the thing that you want them to do is like they should be better than you so if it's if they
[8298.18 --> 8304.82]  if they truly believe in the call that they're making yeah and i will ask a lot of questions yeah
[8304.82 --> 8308.42]  for sure i will ask make sure that they've gone through everything all that kind of stuff one of the
[8308.42 --> 8312.90]  things we're working on right now is that i don't like wearing sunblock and i don't like getting
[8312.90 --> 8317.94]  burned but i am white as the driven snow and i spend most of my time inside so whenever i do go
[8317.94 --> 8324.50]  outside i get burned in like i can literally get a sunburn in like eight minutes if it's if it's like
[8324.50 --> 8330.90]  a really hot like high uv index day or whatever and so one of the things that i want because i will
[8330.90 --> 8335.78]  often wear a hoodie outside because i hate wearing sunblock it makes my skin all greasy and i break out
[8335.78 --> 8340.74]  i just really don't like it so one of the things i'll do is i'll just i'll just sweat buckets i'll just
[8340.74 --> 8345.78]  i'll just like carry a water bottle i'll chug water and i'll just sweat in a hoodie and stay
[8345.78 --> 8352.42]  out of the sun that way and so one of the things i wanted to do was a super super lightweight but full
[8352.42 --> 8358.26]  coverage super breathable but sun blocking garment and it turns out there's a whole industry of like
[8358.98 --> 8364.66]  sun blocking fabrics and i'm like oh okay cool so bridget and i were going back and forth back and
[8364.66 --> 8371.06]  forth on really these three different fabrics one was more like it reminds me of like i don't want
[8371.06 --> 8377.46]  to say it reminds me of burlap because it's obviously a lot better than that we would never
[8377.46 --> 8385.30]  release a burlap hoodie unless you want the new ltt burlap sack yeah i mean that's i'm gonna
[8385.30 --> 8393.70]  i'm gonna attempt it i'm gonna attempt it okay hold on there's gonna be like a few random jokers at
[8393.70 --> 8403.94]  ltx 2023 that show up in burlap sacks that'd be fantastic okay hold on i need a second yeah okay
[8403.94 --> 8411.06]  um anyway so it but it reminds me of that in terms of its breathability like it's a really really loose
[8411.06 --> 8416.58]  mesh and it's a little heavier and you actually want a little bit of weight to it like there's a reason
[8416.58 --> 8422.82]  that in the middle east you know in central america they wear heavier heavy fabrics to keep
[8423.54 --> 8428.66]  to keep the heat of the sun off of them right so so it had a bit of a bit more of that weight to
[8428.66 --> 8434.34]  it while still being kind of a modern feeling you know hoodie garment and then she had one that had
[8434.34 --> 8440.58]  a much tighter weave uh had a higher quantity of bamboo which is a really nice cooling material
[8440.58 --> 8446.18]  and had more stretch to it and she was like yeah i really feel this will be like a nicer garment and
[8446.18 --> 8450.98]  i was like the problem though is that i almost feel like if we were doing a women's garment that one
[8450.98 --> 8458.58]  might be more appropriate but for me as a sweaty boy i want whatever has the biggest holes in it so
[8458.58 --> 8464.42]  every possible breeze that comes by is going to benefit me as much as possible and i feel like you
[8464.42 --> 8469.78]  and i are having like a mars and venus conversation here where we're just coming at this from totally
[8469.78 --> 8474.10]  different perspectives and i feel like different products basically yeah i feel like i feel like
[8474.10 --> 8479.70]  we want very different products so we brought in we brought in nick to sort of as a hey am i crazy
[8479.70 --> 8484.34]  neither of us told him what what were our preferences and he immediately gravitated to mine was like
[8484.90 --> 8491.14]  i'm gonna need the airflow and this isn't gonna cling to me when i sweat like a mother trucker right and
[8491.14 --> 8499.14]  i'm like yeah bingo and like you can you can just tell when someone when someone considers you know how a
[8499.14 --> 8503.86]  garment is going to look on them when they're drenched in sweat versus someone who just doesn't
[8503.86 --> 8509.78]  spend their life or like three months out of the year drenched in sweat right so um so that was just
[8509.78 --> 8515.78]  an example of something where you know i ended up asking a lot of questions um it's not that necessarily
[8515.78 --> 8520.34]  it's as simple as you know you hire people that are better than you because it's when you put
[8521.78 --> 8527.14]  two people in a room even if one of them is better than the other that doesn't necessarily make the
[8527.14 --> 8531.22]  better person's idea the best one by default i feel like we end up with our best products when
[8531.22 --> 8534.66]  we have a ton of conversation you're going for a different thing and you brought different
[8534.66 --> 8543.70]  experience to the table yeah um uh i have questions about labs we're talking about uh uh the the wag
[8543.70 --> 8550.82]  hoodie uh but i have questions about labs you do well no oh adam b and urban forever does okay um
[8550.82 --> 8555.62]  adam b says i was wondering if for ltd labs you might consider finding a way to measure slash report the
[8555.62 --> 8561.22]  exact output of headphones speakers that way you can take out the human element i.e i like bass in
[8561.22 --> 8567.54]  my audio therefore i like these headphones absolutely i believe we have a hire sorted out for that already
[8567.54 --> 8572.26]  i forget their start date but we will be ready to announce that as soon as their probation is up
[8572.26 --> 8578.42]  cool another one urban fervor says how will content for the ltd lab work will it have its own channel or go
[8578.42 --> 8584.34]  up on the main channel for starters i think the lab is going to focus on written for its own content and then
[8584.34 --> 8591.30]  um supporting our other content i expect shorts every short circuit to have hit the lab first once
[8591.30 --> 8597.62]  it's in full swing and then in the longer term i think what we're going to find is that short circuit
[8597.62 --> 8602.82]  is going to run out of stuff that's interesting enough to cover as it continues to grow and have
[8602.82 --> 8607.94]  sort of a higher threshold of viewership that it expects per video and either what will happen is
[8607.94 --> 8616.90]  we'll fragment it out into other circuits or we will uh completely rebrand or we will create a lab
[8616.90 --> 8622.50]  channel that we just don't even worry about any kind of like upload frequency optimization and we just
[8622.50 --> 8630.42]  have way more basic less opinionated videos uh that are just here is everything you need to know about
[8630.42 --> 8634.58]  it in video form if for whatever reason you prefer to watch a video compared to reading an article
[8634.58 --> 8641.06]  yeah uh owen a asks has the knowledge you learned uh has has the knowledge you learned at ncix carried
[8641.06 --> 8648.90]  over to ltd nerch um specifically the distribution knowledge i would say i definitely i definitely learned
[8648.90 --> 8654.82]  a lot theoretically about distribution at ncix but i again that school hard knocks right like i didn't
[8654.82 --> 8660.82]  learn anything i didn't need to know in order to do my job better so i'm not an expert in like you know
[8660.82 --> 8667.54]  what the best brand of conveyor for your warehouse is or anything like that i don't care about that
[8667.54 --> 8672.82]  but i would say that it's carried over in terms of relationships because the guy that runs our
[8672.82 --> 8679.22]  fulfillment warehouse actually was the warehouse manager for ncix richmond um so that relationship
[8679.22 --> 8686.42]  was forged in the fires of ncix and it continues to benefit both of us today austin d says how important
[8686.42 --> 8693.22]  do you think upscaling techniques like dlss fsr x ess will be for the future of graphics rendering as
[8693.22 --> 8698.58]  games get increasingly harder to run i think it's pretty darn important i think it's mostly important
[8698.58 --> 8703.38]  for a specific type of customer i think it's very important for people that don't want to upgrade
[8703.38 --> 8708.50]  their computers as often because for a long time we went through this path where you'd you'd buy a new
[8708.50 --> 8712.82]  system and you could run things on high or ultra or whatever and then as time went on the new games
[8712.82 --> 8717.06]  you'd start bringing it down bring it down bring it down and that's all fine and dandy and you can
[8717.06 --> 8722.90]  still do that but now it keeps going because you can bring it down further with these tools in a way
[8722.90 --> 8728.82]  that the the fidelity is still there um in a lot of the same ways which is very cool um so yeah i think
[8728.82 --> 8733.94]  it's quite important michael w asks you've talked about your time at ncix and how lmg began would you
[8733.94 --> 8739.06]  mind talking about how you got started at ncix i started out as a customer i'm super annoying man
[8739.06 --> 8745.06]  like whenever i had uh like a part that i needed to rma or whatever a lot of time i wouldn't be sure
[8745.06 --> 8752.42]  because you don't have just like a whole set of other hardware to plug it into and figure out like
[8752.42 --> 8758.02]  start troubleshooting what the problem is so i actually managed to sweet talk my way into the rma
[8758.02 --> 8764.58]  room at both the burnaby and vancouver locations on multiple occasions um and just asked hey can i have
[8764.58 --> 8768.82]  some like space on the test bench so that i can diagnose this motherboard can i have like your test
[8768.82 --> 8773.62]  cpu and your test ram uh and then can i put like this different motherboard in my system and then if
[8773.62 --> 8778.34]  the other one worked and solved my problem then i would buy it i was a regular enough i knew everyone
[8778.34 --> 8783.30]  i was like first name basis with everyone uh and then how i actually got my job there was that i was
[8783.30 --> 8790.98]  a very active participant on their forum i had some fire uh i have always had a little bit of fire i i i
[8790.98 --> 8798.42]  sent luke some really funny threads that i have participated in i i've allowed myself um and i i
[8798.42 --> 8804.82]  really i took a long break from this but i have allowed myself as part of this whole privateer thing
[8804.82 --> 8809.22]  that has gone over the last little bit to kind of cut loose a little bit and it's been sort of liberating
[8809.94 --> 8816.98]  because uh i i just i've tried to be i've tried to be really professional in my communication about
[8816.98 --> 8824.90]  a lot of things over the years because i just i i have it seems like something that i should do
[8824.90 --> 8832.10]  and this is one of those things where i'm just kind of sitting here going who cares you know and
[8832.10 --> 8839.38]  there's a lot of reasons for me to sit and go who cares uh one of them is that it just doesn't matter
[8839.38 --> 8844.98]  um it's a semantic argument and it's just really silly that it's managed to drag on for so long
[8844.98 --> 8853.30]  uh especially after i already said yes semantically technically what i said was incorrect um but also
[8853.78 --> 8862.10]  like you i'm giving an inch where's your inch um functionally they really are very similar yeah
[8862.10 --> 8866.42]  uh and and there's no inch so i'm just like yeah well if it's something i can't win anyway i might as
[8866.42 --> 8873.94]  well have some fun and there's also the element of who am i bothering with this whole conversation
[8875.62 --> 8880.26]  literally the only people i could be upsetting with this whole thing
[8882.02 --> 8886.98]  it's like being a shoplifter and boycotting the store i don't care
[8889.94 --> 8895.06]  what can you do to me nothing i never really thought about that angle but that's pretty funny it's
[8895.06 --> 8901.14]  hilarious so i've allowed myself to get a little more combative with people about it than i have in
[8901.14 --> 8908.34]  the past because it's just like it's just ridiculous and so um yeah back in the day i had some i had
[8908.34 --> 8916.50]  some fire i got into my fair share of amd versus intel arguments because it's amazing how high tempers
[8916.50 --> 8923.38]  get when the stakes are at their lowest do you know what i mean because it doesn't matter why am i
[8923.38 --> 8927.70]  arguing with someone about how they spend their money we've talked about this before who cares
[8927.70 --> 8933.62]  people people get really really amped up by defending their own purchasing decisions because
[8933.62 --> 8940.02]  they feel like their purchasing decisions are their identity so that's fair that's fair to some people
[8940.02 --> 8944.50]  the stakes will be high because they're their personal attacks now you made fun of intel well i sided
[8944.50 --> 8953.70]  with intel that means you're making fun of me okay relax so anyway i was a very active participant on
[8953.70 --> 8960.18]  the forum and um you know when i did argue with people i really i genuinely came from a good place
[8960.18 --> 8968.98]  i wanted them to understand a viewpoint that at least to the best of my ability was objective and in
[8968.98 --> 8975.70]  in their best interest and so hiring me was a very controversial decision there i know that for a
[8975.70 --> 8982.18]  fact because they told me much later after it had like worked out that there was a lot of internal
[8982.18 --> 8992.66]  debate about hiring this like kind of pushy kid on the forum um but i guess if i had to say how it began
[8992.66 --> 8998.98]  i would say by participating by being a member of a community right um you know i i
[8998.98 --> 9005.86]  i just cared a lot and i don't think that's ever changed yeah last merch message chris says does
[9005.86 --> 9010.74]  the backpack have some structure that keeps it from going flaccid and droopy when it's mostly empty
[9010.74 --> 9016.34]  except for something heavy in the front pocket it would be awesome if it kept a lie profile in that
[9016.34 --> 9023.54]  scenario okay uh now do you by front pocket do you mean this one because i've got this is the latest
[9023.54 --> 9028.90]  revision of the backpack here i don't know that i could put anything that heavy in the front pocket
[9028.90 --> 9034.74]  i mean i could put this here i guess i could stuff this capture card in there oh uh something fell
[9034.74 --> 9039.70]  out yeah i i will i will get it i will get it so here i will i will jam this capture card and like
[9039.70 --> 9044.82]  cable and stuff in there it's really this pocket's really not um designed i think that's i think that's
[9044.82 --> 9053.62]  a yeah bag of folding main pocket yeah that definitely is um okay now i will strip everything else out of the
[9053.62 --> 9060.34]  backpack so i got my oh my goodness oh i've got proto new prototype underwear don't look too closely at
[9060.34 --> 9070.18]  that oh man okay i'm dropping a lot of stuff here crap sorry i've just i'm i'm committed to answering
[9070.18 --> 9077.22]  hey very nice matthewr picked up the worst value item on the store the expensive edition cpu pillow
[9077.22 --> 9082.82]  love it i mean if you're gonna flex you might as well flex hard
[9086.66 --> 9088.58]  ah pull up the framework
[9091.78 --> 9095.70]  framework charger well it's an asus charger i didn't get a charger with my framework because i didn't need

[9109.94 --> 9110.18]  okay
