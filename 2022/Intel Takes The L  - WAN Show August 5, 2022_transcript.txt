[0.00 --> 6.82]  How y'all doing everybody? Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show. We've got a fantastic
[6.82 --> 10.58]  show lined up for you guys today. See, I told you guys I was going to do it. Yep.
[10.90 --> 16.04]  Lots of great topics. More trouble for Intel Arc as board partners reportedly
[16.04 --> 21.68]  bail on the project. That's a little awkward. In other news,
[21.68 --> 32.60]  Amazon apparently wants to buy iRobot for $1.7 billion. Not the movie. We're talking about
[32.60 --> 37.00]  robot vacuum cleaners. They needed some inspiration. They wanted to buy the movie.
[37.08 --> 41.16]  I actually have a lot to say about Amazon buying iRobot. What else we got?
[41.90 --> 46.94]  We have NCX Tales from Behind the Counter, which I'm going to throw one in for,
[46.94 --> 50.82]  which is not from when I worked at NCX, but I'm going to throw a behind-the-counter
[50.82 --> 58.86]  tale into the pile. Oh, okay. I'm going to put this in. Luke's cryptic story that Linus doesn't know.
[58.94 --> 65.84]  I think. I might have told you at some point. We've had a lot of conversations. Also, other stuff.
[67.38 --> 74.76]  Europe is mad at me. Yeah. We'll talk about why. Yeah. What's up, Europe? How you doing?
[74.76 --> 80.92]  It's going to be a good show.
[80.92 --> 101.62]  The video is brought to you. The show is brought to you by Shortform. I think that was Squarespace.
[101.88 --> 107.96]  It went by pretty quick. And MSI. All right. Why don't we jump right into our first topic for the
[107.96 --> 115.16]  day? More trouble for Intel Arc. It feels like just a few short weeks ago that we had representatives
[115.16 --> 119.68]  from Intel here on the show telling us that things are going swimmingly for Arc and we should be
[119.68 --> 126.32]  expecting a launch imminently. Wait, that is exactly what happened. Yeah. That exact thing I just said.
[126.58 --> 129.66]  That was literally a few short weeks ago. That wasn't a fever dream, right? Nope.
[129.66 --> 136.28]  Like that was a thing. Yeah. Okay, cool. Well, according to Igor's lab, as if all the other
[136.28 --> 141.96]  rumors of Intel's GPU misadventures haven't been bad enough for Team Blue, it now seems,
[142.30 --> 150.70]  according to rumors allegedly, that third parties are abandoning Arc. Igor says there are lots of
[150.70 --> 158.52]  unsold but already produced graphics cards sitting in inventory, likely thanks to the fall of
[158.52 --> 164.22]  cryptocurrency values and the scramble to keep production high to meet that prior demand.
[165.34 --> 173.82]  Whew! That is a bad time. Yeah. Anthony writes, which as Linus should know, is a pretty bad time when
[173.82 --> 180.40]  it comes to tying up your capital. As a result, Intel has been focusing first on OEM partners, but they face
[180.40 --> 185.58]  a chicken and egg scenario. In order for system integrators and OEM customers to place orders,
[185.58 --> 192.52]  there must first be a demand for the products to begin with. But since Arc is an unknown quantity,
[192.62 --> 199.12]  I mean, all we've seen is the small demos that Intel has done. Since it's unproven, there is apparently
[199.12 --> 205.26]  little to no interest from prominent European distributors and dealers. And this was the case
[205.26 --> 212.44]  long before A380 benchmarks reared their ugly head. There's another angle.
[212.44 --> 218.32]  There was still a weird way to launch it, considering it's basically always been Halo product and then
[218.32 --> 220.78]  dropping down from there. And they did like the opposite.
[221.34 --> 226.18]  AMD pulled it the other way once when they launched, I think it was Polaris, I want to say.
[226.18 --> 233.08]  Okay. Mind you, I don't think they had a high-end product for that generation at all. So maybe they
[233.08 --> 237.92]  were just pitching it as, no, no, they launched, because they did 474. No, they launched the whole
[237.92 --> 242.38]  stack. They just didn't have a high-end product. I remember now. Nope, nope, nevermind. Yep, you're
[242.38 --> 247.42]  right. Yeah, it's weird. So I think that set people off on a weird foot as well. You generally try to put
[247.42 --> 252.78]  your best foot forward when it comes to launching a generation of products. Now, there's another angle
[252.78 --> 260.34]  here. Intel allegedly didn't want to give price guarantees, and the conditions around RMA returns
[260.34 --> 264.66]  were worse than their competitors, which is a tough pill to swallow for system integrators
[264.66 --> 270.98]  whose margins, at least on desktop computers, are often low. You know what I want to know? I want to
[270.98 --> 277.96]  know where these RMA conditions for returns are coming from, because back at NCIX, we couldn't
[277.96 --> 285.50]  return jackass. When we bought something, it was ours. How did we get hosed so hard? Is it
[285.50 --> 291.08]  because we were Canadian? That sucks. That's a pretty good joke, though. Okay, to be clear,
[291.16 --> 295.98]  we did occasionally get stock rotation and price protection, but once you committed to having
[295.98 --> 302.46]  something, you pretty much had it. If I was Intel, though, I would recognize that I'm going
[302.46 --> 308.28]  to have to offer price protection of some sort for these ArcGPUs, because if I was a reseller,
[308.38 --> 312.98]  I mean, I remember going through this back when we did the original WAN hoodie, and our strategy
[312.98 --> 319.58]  for international sales was working through resellers. And we basically had to bend over
[319.58 --> 324.26]  in order to get the thing in stock in the store, because they were sitting there going, well, if we
[324.26 --> 328.68]  don't sell it, then we want this to be entirely your problem. We want you to cover shipping back to you,
[328.68 --> 336.30]  take back the entire thing for the entire value. And because we were just small and had absolutely
[336.30 --> 340.28]  no leverage whatsoever, we pretty much had to take whatever offer was given to us. So
[340.28 --> 347.74]  hilariously, we had, I think, three partners, I want to say. It was either two or three. I can't
[347.74 --> 352.68]  remember. I think we had three partners, though, and the only one that didn't manage to sell through
[352.68 --> 357.68]  and that we did end up taking inventory back from was NCIX. Yeah, I know, right?
[360.06 --> 363.74]  They weren't even the ones that gave me a really hard time about terms. I just told them, like,
[363.78 --> 367.60]  just look, look, just don't worry, we'll get it taken care of. And then they just like didn't sell
[367.60 --> 372.50]  it. They, I mean, that's NCIX, right? And just, yeah, if your product sells itself, then great,
[372.58 --> 376.42]  you'll be fine. And if it doesn't, if they have to actually do any work, then it could be a
[376.42 --> 378.64]  challenge. Their site was so bad, man.
[378.64 --> 384.50]  It was atrocious. Yeah. Anyway, without interest from commercial customers, then board partners
[384.50 --> 389.42]  are kind of left out in the cold. I mean, man, if you guys have been following along with the
[389.42 --> 394.42]  screwdriver and the backpack saga, I mean, these are relatively uncomplicated products compared to,
[394.82 --> 400.60]  well, first, you've got this, this, this highly complex integrated circuit, right? You've got,
[400.76 --> 407.56]  you've got this ASIC, right? Then you've got the highly complex board designs, the development that
[407.56 --> 412.26]  goes on around those, the mass production that has to happen in order to reach the kind of scale
[412.26 --> 417.48]  that it even makes any sense economically to produce these things. Then there's the distribution.
[417.66 --> 422.76]  You've got to kind of, you've got to kind of bet, move all your pieces into play globally. You've
[422.76 --> 426.80]  got to bet on where people are going to buy these things and which ones they're going to buy and what
[426.80 --> 431.62]  volumes. Like it's so, it's so complicated. And all of this has to take place in the,
[431.62 --> 438.14]  in the years and then months and then weeks leading up to actually pressing go, this is available.
[438.58 --> 442.92]  And it's all got to be basically perfect or you end up looking like an amateur, right? Cause you're
[442.92 --> 448.68]  going up against AMD and NVIDIA who've been doing this for decades. So without interest from commercial
[448.68 --> 454.38]  customers, board partners are left out in the cold and one has allegedly halted production altogether.
[454.38 --> 462.28]  And this is due to quality concerns. Whether these rumors are true or not, they are emblematic of the
[462.28 --> 469.60]  challenges faced by anyone attempting to enter the GPU market in this day and age. Without a clear value
[469.60 --> 474.74]  proposition or brand recognition, SIs are going to have a tough time accepting it. Without SIs accepting
[474.74 --> 479.48]  it, board partners are less likely to hop on board and without performance leadership or aggressive
[479.48 --> 485.22]  back-end agreements on pricing, especially price protection. Um, not to mention RMA support,
[485.52 --> 492.26]  neither situation is likely to change. So the cycle continues until either Intel blinks or the
[492.26 --> 498.06]  proverbial plug gets pulled. Now we do have some discussion questions here and I don't like this
[498.06 --> 505.64]  first one. Is ARC going to be another Larrabee? I don't, I don't think that's a realistic outcome at this
[505.64 --> 512.50]  point. Like I, I think, I do think Intel is a smart enough company to not go completely sunk cost
[512.50 --> 518.38]  fallacy. Well, we've already put billions in what's another few billion, but it is very clear from a
[518.38 --> 527.96]  strategic standpoint that having a GPU play is what the A players do today. You must have, in addition to
[527.96 --> 536.00]  your x86 compute product, you must have a GPU compute product. And it's also clear from AMD and NVIDIA
[536.00 --> 543.52]  strategy that in order to hit the kind of volumes that you need, you want a consumer product. You
[543.52 --> 549.70]  don't just want it to be a data center compute product, which is ultimately where Larrabee ended
[549.70 --> 558.18]  up if I recall correctly. Yeah. So I don't see it happening. I think Intel has to go down this path, even if
[558.18 --> 565.38]  it's like beating their heads, gang, wall in order to get there, even if it takes another three years.
[566.86 --> 572.34]  I think it's, I think it sucks. I don't remember the exact problem. There was, there was some type of problem,
[572.34 --> 577.12]  which is causing a lot of these performance issues. We talked about it last week. I don't remember exactly what it was,
[577.12 --> 581.72]  but I think that's like really unfortunate, especially considering that you would kind of
[581.72 --> 585.06]  hope that with the pedigree that they brought on board, that they would, they would have been able
[585.06 --> 589.82]  to avoid something like that, but it is extremely technical concepts and it's not like they can
[589.82 --> 595.44]  exactly just copy paste what these guys have done in the past. Yeah. I don't think if Raja Kuduri like
[595.44 --> 603.34]  just recreated. Yeah, that would be a big problem. So you can't exactly do that. So you're going to run
[603.34 --> 608.14]  into some issues. It's unfortunate, but I do agree with, with Linus. I think they're going to try to
[608.14 --> 613.46]  make it work. Um, I hope, I hope they're going to try to make it work. I hope you're right. Yeah.
[613.86 --> 620.78]  I don't know. We'll see. Um, there's another discussion question here, courtesy of Anthony.
[620.90 --> 626.86]  Gamers probably share the concerns around pricing, RMA and driver support that system integrators do.
[627.08 --> 631.96]  How will this impact the role of early adopters? I think early adopters are absolutely critical to
[631.96 --> 635.84]  arc. And, you know, from talking to shroud and tap about it, they seem to understand that they're
[635.84 --> 641.66]  going to have to be priced very aggressively to drive some of that early adoption. But if they
[641.66 --> 647.14]  don't have the buy-in from upper management, if they don't have, you know, tens, hundreds of millions,
[647.96 --> 655.86]  a billion bucks to just kind of get some art GP freaking use out there into users hands.
[656.04 --> 661.06]  Do they even really want to, if it has a lot of issues with this generation? I think they produce
[661.06 --> 667.88]  them allegedly. Yeah. Supposedly they just have wafers upon wafers upon wafers of our GPUs.
[667.88 --> 670.06]  Then they're going to have to make them incredibly cheap if there is problems.
[670.06 --> 674.62]  Yeah. You don't just grind them up and make new GPUs. Although.
[676.72 --> 679.80]  The biggest recycling effort ever. Yeah, exactly.
[679.96 --> 682.98]  Don't bury it in the desert like, uh, the ET video game. Yeah, exactly.
[682.98 --> 691.22]  Grind them up and make new ones. Um, yeah, I, we'll see. I, there was a comment earlier,
[691.22 --> 695.98]  but like no brand recognition. I don't think that's fair at all. Um, because it's going to
[695.98 --> 699.64]  have Intel on it and people that are building computers know who Intel is.
[699.64 --> 707.58]  And Intel's onboard graphics, to their credit, have gotten a lot better in the last five years.
[707.58 --> 713.14]  I mean, I continually, they've gotten continuously better ever since they introduced them back.
[713.84 --> 715.84]  Uh, well, I shouldn't say introduced them, but.
[716.18 --> 722.28]  Okay. Sorry. Jaden just said something in full plane chat. If they allow vGPU, they'll move them.
[722.62 --> 724.34]  Yep. There's, there's absolutely.
[724.60 --> 725.20]  Like a hundred percent.
[725.32 --> 730.78]  Strategic levers they can pull. And Epos Vox did a video recently talking about their AV1 encoder.
[731.02 --> 734.70]  I haven't watched the video yet. I do need to watch it, but I did at least make it to the headline.
[734.70 --> 742.48]  Apparently it's outstanding. Like it is, it is a better video encoder. So as long as OBS gets
[742.48 --> 748.68]  support for Intel's AV1 encoder, I could see a bunch of streamers just throwing it in, in addition
[748.68 --> 751.62]  to their NVIDIA GPU, just so that they have AV1 encoding.
[751.84 --> 755.50]  That would actually be pretty cool. Cause then you can lift a lot of the, it hasn't really been
[755.50 --> 762.74]  worth it to have like a dedicated and vent card, but I mean, it could be if it's like actually really
[762.74 --> 766.66]  killer. Yeah. If it's legitimately better. I mean, remember too, we're talking about people
[766.66 --> 771.40]  that will build an entire separate machine so that they can use CPU encoding for the best
[771.40 --> 777.56]  possible quality. If AV1 meant you just don't have to do that. Although there are other reasons to
[777.56 --> 781.28]  use a separate machine. Like if your game crashes, it means your stream doesn't crash, et cetera,
[781.34 --> 787.50]  et cetera. But if money is no object, or if maybe it's the money is a partial object at that tier,
[787.50 --> 793.82]  if just adding one of these arc cards for, you know, 130, 140 bucks, getting that AV1 encoding
[793.82 --> 798.70]  means that your stream will just immediately look sharper, look better. I could absolutely see
[798.70 --> 804.18]  people doing that. Yeah. If they do, if that's genuinely really good and they have VGPU support,
[804.28 --> 808.60]  they'll move them a hundred percent. They'll move them. I, there's a comment from, from Anthony saying,
[808.60 --> 814.26]  uh, regarding brand recognition, it's more about the Intel HD graphics being poor performers and people
[814.26 --> 819.64]  generally seeing Intel graphics as low and bare bones. That's fair. But I do also think that Intel
[819.64 --> 826.82]  is like a household name that people trust. Um, and like, maybe if you're, if you're very technical
[826.82 --> 831.00]  and you've like messed around with the Intel HD graphics, a bunch of stuff like that, um, then
[831.00 --> 835.40]  you have that opinion. But if you're just someone who like, you'd like building your own computers,
[835.40 --> 841.18]  you build one every like three, four years, and you've had Intel chips since you were fairly young.
[841.18 --> 846.52]  Like, I think it's going to hit for those people. Um, and then on the other end, like we've just
[846.52 --> 851.72]  been saying now, there might be specific scenarios where with the highly technical people, it just,
[851.84 --> 857.66]  it slays. And like, I don't know, I, we tried to tell them here, I'm going to try to tell them
[857.66 --> 863.18]  again, you'll solve, I, in my opinion, they'll solve your problems. If you enable VGPU, one of the
[863.18 --> 868.50]  issues with that is it's going to be hard to take it back with battle mage or whatever the ones are
[868.50 --> 878.34]  really hard. Oh yeah. So, you know, I think you shouldn't, to be fair. I think you should just
[878.34 --> 883.58]  send it out there and just leave it out there and just, um, you know, drop it on the table.
[883.80 --> 889.02]  Be like, Hey, we're actually doing it. We might have cards that have issues, but we have this
[889.02 --> 893.76]  enabled. People are going to buy it. And if the competition doesn't answer to this, we'll just
[893.76 --> 899.86]  take our piece of the pie and run with it. But I don't know. All right. Let's jump into a couple
[899.86 --> 906.42]  of merch messages very, very early on because naturally the big news for us this week was we
[906.42 --> 916.30]  finally, finally launched the LTT backpack. Thank you. Massive shout out to everyone who ordered one.
[916.44 --> 922.18]  It's hilarious. Everyone who watched the video internally is like, Hey, when are the, uh,
[922.18 --> 927.54]  when are the staff ones going out? And I was like, Oh, not soon. Okay. They're going to paying
[927.54 --> 931.30]  customers first guys. There was people from float plane that asked if we're getting like
[931.30 --> 935.52]  backpacks and screwdrivers. And I was like, I seriously doubt it. Cause I did the math and it
[935.52 --> 943.32]  was like, and then you sent that message and I was like, Oh, okay. Yeah. I guess so. We're going to,
[943.40 --> 946.66]  we're going to do it, but it's going to, it's going to take some time. It's going to take some time.
[946.74 --> 950.96]  We got a stock needs to stabilize stuff like that. Anyway, we can do a couple of merch messages. Now,
[950.96 --> 954.92]  if you guys want to send in a merch message, anytime we're alive, when you're checking out
[954.92 --> 959.82]  on LTT store.com, you can check that you want to send a merch message, enter your merch message.
[959.88 --> 965.98]  It'll either pop up down here. It's our replacement for like super chats or, or bits on Twitch or
[965.98 --> 970.84]  anything like that. Because this way, instead of just throwing money into a void, you can throw it
[970.84 --> 977.34]  into a void and the void will spit out a high quality t-shirt or backpack or, or hoodie or whatever
[977.34 --> 982.78]  else it is that you happen to need. And it'll arrive at your door eventually, depending on,
[982.90 --> 985.12]  depending on where you are. All right, hit me bell.
[985.90 --> 990.86]  From Jack, been following the backpack for a while and loved the unboxing on short circuit.
[990.98 --> 991.50]  Hey, thanks.
[991.62 --> 995.38]  With the thought of other LTT products working with the backpack, do you expect to release products
[995.38 --> 1000.64]  that directly work with a backpack, such as hooks or lockers or carabiners or we had people ask
[1000.64 --> 1008.64]  rain covers? Okay. So I've, uh, I've seen quite a few requests for a rain cover. If we can find
[1008.64 --> 1014.26]  something that folds up compactly enough that it could fit in the hidden passport pocket, I would
[1014.26 --> 1018.06]  love to have a rain cover that kind of sits in there and then you can pull it out in an emergency.
[1018.28 --> 1022.06]  So you, so you swap the luggage strap for that is basically what you're saying?
[1022.72 --> 1025.80]  Yeah, exactly. There wouldn't be a place for your luggage strap at that point, but like
[1025.80 --> 1032.72]  just store it somewhere. It can't hold everything. Yeah. Um, I'd absolutely love to do a rain cover.
[1033.00 --> 1039.20]  We are already working on some attachments for the front, but the front, I think I just saw a
[1039.20 --> 1043.96]  secret thing. Yeah. We are already working on some attachments for the front for things like, uh,
[1044.32 --> 1050.96]  oh man, Matthew has this adorable little, uh, like wireless headphones holder that will clip on right
[1050.96 --> 1054.16]  here. So it'll just sit right here. So you can just tuck your wireless headphones in. It's big enough
[1054.16 --> 1060.60]  for AirPods pros in a case or like a large bulky one, like the Sennheiser's. And this will probably
[1060.60 --> 1065.58]  be one of those things where like it fits best on this backpack. Oh yeah. But it'll work on anything
[1065.58 --> 1073.10]  that has like a, we definitely want to keep our accessories, um, generic in terms of their
[1073.10 --> 1079.10]  compatibility with other bags. If we can, the last thing you want to do is make something that then
[1079.10 --> 1084.54]  is married to, I mean, okay. Even if I think these things are going to last you 10 years,
[1084.54 --> 1090.84]  they're not invincible. So if you'd be able to carry on, you know, some of the accessories to a
[1090.84 --> 1096.08]  future bag, then great. Like that's even if it's a future bag that we potentially make,
[1096.18 --> 1099.62]  yeah. Whether it's us or whether it's someone else, like if you find a use for it, that isn't
[1099.62 --> 1108.30]  even a bag. So that's something we're working on. Uh, another cool one is, uh, this, we recognize
[1108.30 --> 1116.46]  that not everyone is necessarily going to prefer just that, that, that compartment of holding,
[1116.46 --> 1123.54]  um, as I, as I like to call it, the, the just uninterrupted, you know, place to stuff everything.
[1123.78 --> 1128.32]  So this is an accessory that we are currently working on. That's going to be called the tech
[1128.32 --> 1134.02]  pouch. It's built to the same standard of quality as the backpack, which means, you know, we've got
[1134.02 --> 1140.46]  entirely unnecessary, like reinforced stitching on the handle on the end. It uses waterproof zippers,
[1140.78 --> 1149.96]  even though like, come on, get real. This has to be rainproof. Um, but it does anyway. And then
[1149.96 --> 1156.98]  this is really cool. So it opens up into like an accordion style, uh, thing that is just chock full
[1156.98 --> 1160.22]  of Dan, are you trying to do something here? Should I be switching to that camera? Is that,
[1160.56 --> 1165.00]  should I be switching to the loop cam? Yeah, here you go. So it's got like, you know, a little spot
[1165.00 --> 1169.30]  for pens. You know, we only have one spot for a pen, like a native spot for a pen in the,
[1169.38 --> 1174.78]  in the backpack as it is. Uh, this is an, this is an earlier version. We actually already have a newer
[1174.78 --> 1180.94]  version than this one that has changed this to either two medium sized ones or one big and one small.
[1180.94 --> 1187.08]  I can't remember, but I, I just found this, uh, three by small configuration was not that useful.
[1187.26 --> 1190.68]  I need to take my, uh, you know what? No, it's fine. I'll just leave that in there for now.
[1190.80 --> 1195.32]  That is an old school flash drive. Yeah, I know. Right. Uh, there's, these are supposed to be,
[1195.32 --> 1200.40]  um, uh, knitted. So when they're knitted, these are going to be stretchy and then this is supposed
[1200.40 --> 1205.86]  to be elastic at the top. So there's like a stretchy thing here. And then you can, uh, also
[1205.86 --> 1210.58]  undo the zipper here. There's like a zipper thing. Basically you can just kind of like
[1210.58 --> 1217.44]  cram it with whatever you want. Uh, there's another thing of like, uh, so this would also be,
[1217.52 --> 1221.44]  I forget one side's going to be stretchy and one side's not because when you fill up the stretchy
[1221.44 --> 1226.48]  side, we want it to bulge out. And when you fill out the not stretchy side, we want it to bulge in
[1226.48 --> 1232.74]  so that you can still fit, uh, the spacing of this, uh, elastic here has been changed so that you can
[1232.74 --> 1236.66]  kind of put tools in it or you could put like thumb drives in it. You can kind of put whatever
[1236.66 --> 1240.64]  you want in it. And then it'll also be tighter because right now it's a little loose. So once
[1240.64 --> 1245.06]  it wears out a bit, it's going to have a hard time holding things in place. But this is basically
[1245.06 --> 1251.04]  exactly the width of the bottom of the, the, the chamber of holding pouch of holding or whatever.
[1251.50 --> 1255.38]  And it'll be, it'll just kind of sit there. And then the idea is that because it's made of that
[1255.38 --> 1261.64]  same sturdy reprieve fabric, you just kind of roll up, put it on your desk,
[1261.64 --> 1266.70]  and it just stands on its own and you can get whatever you need, put all your stuff back away,
[1267.20 --> 1273.44]  whether it's like tools or, you know, USB drives or, or if you testers or whatever it is that you're,
[1273.44 --> 1278.62]  that you're using and then you tuck it away. So that's, that's something, that's something.
[1279.02 --> 1283.72]  Cool. Um, you could also use it for toiletries and stuff like that. Yeah. People have, have clued
[1283.72 --> 1289.60]  in that. Yeah. It could also be great for travel. So we're working on that. When, when is no idea.
[1289.60 --> 1293.40]  Okay. Yep. Can't promise anything. I shouldn't even be showing it to you.
[1294.48 --> 1300.24]  I, I was wondering when you put it over there, I was like, uh, I've never seen this before or heard
[1300.24 --> 1308.50]  of it. Yeah. It'll absolutely work standalone, but it's kind of made to, to sit in. Well, that's,
[1308.62 --> 1313.36]  yeah, that's just, that's a good idea to do everything that way. Right. But you could use
[1313.36 --> 1316.88]  it without it. You don't even have to use that with a bag. Technically, like you said,
[1316.88 --> 1322.10]  it could just be like a travel thing. Yeah, exactly. Whatever. Have it in the car.
[1322.10 --> 1327.50]  Question is from Brian. Could the lab possibly do USB hub reviews? Everyone I've purchased has been
[1327.50 --> 1334.38]  terrible. I think that's a fantastic idea. I don't even know where we'd begin. I mean,
[1334.44 --> 1342.18]  obviously you'd want to know how, how hot it gets when you're pulling the maximum amount of power that
[1342.18 --> 1348.96]  it can support. You'd want to know what its internal inefficiencies are. So if you could test
[1348.96 --> 1353.84]  how much power you could draw with a device that's actually plugged in on the other side of it,
[1354.78 --> 1360.72]  uh, you'd want to, you'd want to create some kind of like a torture test, right? Where you have,
[1360.84 --> 1367.82]  you know, data streaming over, like, let's say it was a USB C hub, right? That has HDMI and, uh,
[1367.82 --> 1373.06]  also, you know, USB type A's or something. So if you have some kind of data storm going on over
[1373.06 --> 1378.40]  the USB ports, does the HDMI cut out? You know, I'd want to know things like that. Yeah.
[1378.52 --> 1381.22]  That is a good question because that's one of those types of things where like,
[1381.42 --> 1386.10]  if you go on like Amazon or whatever, and you want to buy one, there's just like a billion of them.
[1386.24 --> 1390.98]  And I just, how are you supposed to know that the brand recognition isn't going to be there.
[1391.30 --> 1396.66]  It's from like 30,000 brands you've never heard of. Um, yeah. Yeah. I don't know.
[1396.66 --> 1399.78]  That would be one of the things that I would, I would like there to be some,
[1399.86 --> 1404.38]  some kind of like answers for. Yeah. If we could find a way I'd, I'd, I'd love to.
[1404.86 --> 1410.46]  Cause it's, man, I get so frustrated. I get so frustrated. I, we went through this with dash
[1410.46 --> 1415.18]  cams recently. We actually have a video coming where we bought every a hundred dollar and under
[1415.18 --> 1421.56]  high, like the top, uh, a hundred dollar and under dash cams on Amazon. Because I just,
[1421.56 --> 1426.62]  I went on the site. I'm like, I don't understand that most of these reviews are obviously
[1426.62 --> 1433.34]  fake. Um, but they, they all are rated pretty well. And even some of the genuine real users
[1433.34 --> 1440.92]  seem to say like, it's really good. So why would, why do $300 dash cams exist if there are $70 dash
[1440.92 --> 1447.06]  cams? Like it was just, it was overwhelming. Even as a, as a tech savvy person, it was absolutely
[1447.06 --> 1452.52]  overwhelming. So I kind of went, well, conveniently I'm in a position where I can commission my own
[1452.52 --> 1460.92]  independent test. I need a fricking dash cam. Uh, you buy all the dash cams and then let's share
[1460.92 --> 1464.84]  our findings with the people. So that video is coming pretty soon, but that's actually cool.
[1464.98 --> 1469.64]  I will, I will genuinely very likely buy one based off that video. That's the type of things that I
[1469.64 --> 1476.06]  like where like, to be completely honest, uh, they're almost more interesting to me than computer
[1476.06 --> 1480.58]  stuff reviews. Cause at this point I can often like suss out what I need to know about computer
[1480.58 --> 1484.32]  hardware. But when it goes into something like dash cams, like USB hubs, stuff like that,
[1484.34 --> 1488.36]  and we're just like, I don't know. Even something like a thumb drive. Yeah. Okay. I still need a
[1488.36 --> 1492.04]  thumb drive for whatever reason. I got to carry around a lot of ISOs. Who knows?
[1492.04 --> 1497.68]  They're useful. Whatever. Uh, how do you know if it's good? Which one? Which one's good? Yeah.
[1498.34 --> 1503.30]  Cables. Cables are going to be huge. That's, that's going to be the main like tertiary product
[1503.30 --> 1508.26]  thing. That's, I'm, I'm very excited about, about the cables. Oh, the ones that we're planning
[1508.26 --> 1512.64]  to make or the testing, the testing mostly to be completely honest. Yep. But then I'm hoping
[1512.64 --> 1516.10]  that the ones that we make are like some of the best ones that come through testing. Right. So
[1516.10 --> 1521.28]  I should hope so. If they're not, then we suck and we need to start over. Yeah. See, this is,
[1521.52 --> 1526.66]  this is hilarious. Uh, Scali over in Twitch chat says Garmin makes decent dash cams. No,
[1526.74 --> 1531.94]  they don't. I see. I would have thought that too. Garmin's like a brand name, right? Like they're,
[1532.00 --> 1535.08]  they're a trusted name. They made like GPSs or whatever. That is a direction that I would
[1535.08 --> 1540.80]  likely go in. Exactly. And instead, no, it turned out it just costs another 10, $20 and
[1540.80 --> 1547.14]  was not better at all. Alrighty then. Great. Now I know, but I didn't. And it's so hard to
[1547.14 --> 1554.76]  tell because your intuition might tell you this, but then when you go empirically test it and
[1554.76 --> 1559.24]  you go, Oh yeah, I can't see jack at night. Oh great. Well, it's good to, it's really good
[1559.24 --> 1564.04]  to know. Yeah. No, for sure. Oh, well really? Everyone's using, everyone's using one of the
[1564.04 --> 1570.56]  same two Chinese chipsets. Oh, all right then. That's interesting. That's very interesting.
[1570.74 --> 1573.18]  That's not something that you're going to be able to easily figure out in any other way.
[1573.66 --> 1578.88]  No, no, not at all. You're going to, you're going to tear down some, uh, some fanboy fences
[1578.88 --> 1583.04]  with that one. I think there's already people charming and like, ah, the anchor, the Garmin,
[1583.14 --> 1587.06]  whatever. And it's like, Hmm, we'll see. Yeah. We'll see. We'll see. Cobra.
[1587.06 --> 1593.04]  Yeah. Related to that. Uh, I asked if there's any plans for the labs to release a spreadsheet
[1593.04 --> 1596.94]  list or ranking chart for the products you test, whether it's paid or free.
[1600.02 --> 1607.70]  Uh, yeah, I don't know. We still, I still have to sit down with a lot of people from labs that,
[1607.88 --> 1614.70]  that have experience at, um, related, um, uh, websites, uh, and, and figure out exactly what
[1614.70 --> 1620.00]  we're going to do because we've been waiting to get development on staff, but, um, there was
[1620.00 --> 1626.98]  paperwork signed. Really? Okay. Um, done deal. Love to hear it. So very soon it'll technically be
[1626.98 --> 1631.52]  before that person actually starts, but I want to get these meetings started anyways, and he's
[1631.52 --> 1636.34]  volunteered. So we're going to have a call just to go over some of the road mapping stuff before he
[1636.34 --> 1641.74]  actually starts so that we can start doing design so that we can start hitting it hard right when he's
[1641.74 --> 1646.54]  actually full, full time. Can I tell you something wild? Sorry. Hold, hold that thought. I want to
[1646.54 --> 1654.26]  hear the rest of that, that what you're about to say thing. You manage a larger team now than I did
[1654.26 --> 1663.86]  when we moved into this building. Nice. And there's a lot more coming. By the way, if you just heard
[1663.86 --> 1669.70]  that backpacks, yeah, fair. Uh, if you just heard that back, that, uh, that contract thing, you're like,
[1669.70 --> 1673.76]  what? I didn't get it. I'm still, I'm still working on it. I need a few of you guys, not just one.
[1675.26 --> 1675.58]  So.
[1678.58 --> 1684.58]  Yeah. In summary. Yes. Our intention in the longer, I mean, screw it. Should I just,
[1684.66 --> 1691.58]  should I just bring up the doc? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1691.58 --> 1698.50]  no. I'm serious. Do not. There are things on there. We're not showing. No.
[1700.58 --> 1706.38]  I'm getting it. No, I'm serious. I'm getting a maybe vibe. I will switch off. I will switch
[1706.38 --> 1711.38]  the camera off his screen. I'm getting a maybe vibe. I'm getting a maybe vibe. No. What do you,
[1711.46 --> 1718.54]  what do you think? Okay. Can I at least, can I at least talk about MVP? Yes. Okay. I'll tell you
[1718.54 --> 1723.06]  what why don't you talk about mvp okay okay i thought you were gonna say why don't i just show
[1723.06 --> 1731.24]  that part of this yeah why don't i just show that no the mvp the chat screaming do it oh my goodness
[1731.24 --> 1734.38]  is someone calling me to prevent this line is speaking
[1734.38 --> 1745.46]  i don't know what this is nope definitely spam definitely spam that's a hilarious spam call
[1745.46 --> 1754.38]  it started with yo we're all out of vaccines and then i hung up because it was obviously very stupid
[1754.38 --> 1766.36]  um i was gonna say mvp is is is minimal minimally viable product uh sure yeah um it's it's not
[1766.36 --> 1772.68]  technically 100 locked down the general features are which is what's on that sheet but exactly what
[1772.68 --> 1777.38]  the site will actually look like it's not 100 locked down okay we still have to nail that in
[1777.38 --> 1781.80]  but it's so you want me to read it or do i need to share this with you or like share it with me okay
[1781.80 --> 1789.32]  i'm not gonna share with you it's it's mostly i i actually might have to see it yeah you can there
[1789.32 --> 1795.34]  you go yeah it's essentially like a the the mvp to be completely honest is essentially like a really
[1795.34 --> 1802.54]  fancy blog um because that's i mean that's what it is right you're you're reading so there will be
[1802.54 --> 1807.76]  there will be reviews we're going to try to make sure that the the search is very strong um the
[1807.76 --> 1812.40]  the fuzziness of the search is very good um so you can find things that you're looking for that's
[1812.40 --> 1818.10]  there's all going to be categorized to some degree we want to be able to uh generate and display graphs
[1818.10 --> 1823.96]  and tables obviously which already sort of works it just needs to work on the website as well we
[1823.96 --> 1829.50]  can't be painstakingly you know graphing things and making tables by hand like we do on the video
[1829.50 --> 1834.96]  production side of things and yeah they might not be as pretty but they need to be fast i'm going to
[1834.96 --> 1840.74]  be taking in goals and desires from a lot of different people on the on the technical side of labs so we
[1840.74 --> 1845.62]  can figure out what they want on the website i can tell you one of the really wild things they want
[1845.62 --> 1852.98]  um i i had a chat with gary recently or someone did somehow this this floated back to me and
[1852.98 --> 1863.56]  apparently the target maximum throughput for headphone testing is 50 a month oh yeah so hopefully you guys
[1863.56 --> 1870.00]  are ready to store a lot of data well that's yeah that's in graphic yeah yeah i just mean like that's
[1870.00 --> 1874.24]  a freaking lot of headphones yeah that's fine are there even that many headphones like i think you're
[1874.24 --> 1877.62]  gonna run out of headphones yeah i think we're gonna run out of headphones before we run out of
[1877.62 --> 1884.52]  testing throughput yeah um what was i gonna say yeah but so one of my two okay two core concepts that
[1884.52 --> 1890.72]  i'm gonna try to champion one of them is that it needs to not be like overwhelming and intimidating
[1890.72 --> 1895.02]  when you land on the website yeah um and when you're looking through the website to be honest
[1895.02 --> 1902.44]  there should be deep hardcore information but it should feel accessible um it should you shouldn't hit
[1902.44 --> 1906.96]  land on the website be like oh my goodness this looks like a ui from the 90s we're gonna trick
[1906.96 --> 1912.14]  you into thinking you can handle this data pretty much yeah but like actually though we want to make
[1912.14 --> 1917.02]  it a comfortable experience to dive really deeply into something um to encourage people to actually
[1917.02 --> 1922.62]  take that extra step so that's one of my things the other one is i want the cms to be really strong
[1922.62 --> 1929.80]  um the cms is actually extremely important because i don't want someone to have to spend their whole
[1929.80 --> 1936.88]  freaking day building uh these articles because they because i don't know if we're writing individual
[1936.88 --> 1943.92]  articles for each one of those 50 headphones that we're testing a month um what's all this no no
[1943.92 --> 1949.42]  you're good you're good um so the cms has to be pretty strong if we're if we're building a little
[1949.42 --> 1955.36]  thing like a graph or whatever it should be very easy to add that not labor intensive as few clicks as
[1955.36 --> 1959.94]  possible that type of stuff so there's going to be a lot of work in that regard we want to have
[1959.94 --> 1965.68]  product browsing by category by tags by search we want to have pictures and videos embedded we
[1965.68 --> 1971.58]  obviously want to have affiliate links working because they gotta pay for this um it's so expensive
[1971.58 --> 1978.60]  yeah uh we shot a video this week oh man i'm excited for you guys to see this thing have you seen
[1978.60 --> 1985.72]  the psu tester we bought i have heard that it was purchased i have not seen it it's here oh boy it
[1985.72 --> 1991.92]  arrived on i think it was tuesday or wednesday and we did our unboxing video which is an uncrating
[1991.92 --> 2000.06]  because it's taller than you are it's an entire 40 u cabinet
[2000.06 --> 2014.00]  uh-huh uh-huh full of ac load generation dc load generation oscilloscopes um uh loads themselves so
[2014.00 --> 2020.26]  you need like the you need the power supply and then you also need the loads uh logging uh like
[2020.26 --> 2028.10]  monitoring and logging uh hardware it's it's it's packed it is stuffed to the gills it's apparently
[2028.10 --> 2036.82]  a better one than c sonic has yeah and they're an actual power supply manufacturers yeah like a lot
[2036.82 --> 2042.34]  of your favorite power supplies are probably once you go down to it c sonic xpure asks bigger than the
[2042.34 --> 2050.22]  one gamers nexus got yeah definitely it's big we go big or we go home it's good we had the land when
[2050.22 --> 2054.46]  we did because you guys are going to fill that space up pretty quick pretty quick considering the
[2054.46 --> 2060.74]  anechoic chamber was just like leaning against the wall the whole time i had to point that out to a
[2060.74 --> 2064.64]  couple people because i guess when it's deconstructed people don't necessarily recognize what it is
[2064.64 --> 2070.40]  um but yeah that was uh that was pretty that was pretty crazy here i can i'll show you uh i'll show you
[2070.40 --> 2075.14]  the company that we got it from there has been a lot of mentions about getting electro boom to come
[2075.14 --> 2080.86]  check out the uh space once it's set up yeah i mean sure i'm down for whatever so yeah it's basically
[2080.86 --> 2088.74]  like one of these so they're highly configurable kyle actually uh went through a whole did a whole
[2088.74 --> 2094.20]  bunch of research working with uh c sonic and i believe you know i'm not sure who else he talked
[2094.20 --> 2099.46]  to so i'm not going to name anyone else but working with c sonic as well as engineers from chroma
[2099.46 --> 2107.08]  to ensure that we have exactly what we need for the ultimate the ultimate configuration for testing pc
[2107.08 --> 2111.48]  power supplies because they make gear for testing all kinds of stuff batteries any kind of power
[2111.48 --> 2120.20]  system and the only piece that we don't have yet the only piece that was not included in our 133 000 us
[2120.20 --> 2129.30]  dollars was an oscilloscope so once we get the scope in the front of it it's that price tag goes
[2129.30 --> 2137.44]  goes up a little bit goes up a little bit oh boy uh no we're not going to be blowing any breakers
[2137.44 --> 2143.56]  the plug on it's like this big it's got its own special plug there's a lot of power in that building
[2143.56 --> 2148.36]  yeah oh there's tons of power in that building i mean we ran like a 200 plus person land in there
[2148.36 --> 2151.54]  no problem whatever you know no problem yeah
[2151.54 --> 2159.92]  well that's crazy yeah i can't wait man we're going to be able to churn through like the capability
[2159.92 --> 2168.60]  the capabilities of this thing are so cool the ac the ac power source for example you can get it to run
[2168.60 --> 2177.08]  automated scenarios for things like okay uh what's it like if you're on you know a really crappy
[2177.08 --> 2181.16]  up setup and someone like flicks on a blender somewhere else in the house
[2181.16 --> 2187.86]  so you can find out you know hey if i if i live some if i you know in a developing country
[2187.86 --> 2194.00]  and my power is really inconsistent there's brownouts frequent brownouts yeah so you can you can create
[2194.00 --> 2199.70]  all these test scenarios where it'll it'll simulate a brown out here and then another brown out there
[2199.70 --> 2205.42]  and then uh you know uh uh a really a really um i'm trying to remember what the problem is certain
[2205.42 --> 2211.14]  types of motors though when they spin up they can cause problems for other devices that are on the
[2211.16 --> 2219.74]  same circuit so you can have those spin up um the dc oh man this is super cool so the we have a we
[2219.74 --> 2228.96]  have like a dc uh power source and the reason for that is that it allows us to fake our power supply
[2228.96 --> 2235.76]  accidentally over supplying like overvolting so we can we can take whatever our power supply is outputting
[2235.76 --> 2241.90]  and we can actually add a little bit to make sure that overvoltage protection works for example so
[2241.90 --> 2246.06]  we're going to be able to test uh safety mechanisms and power supplies if there's anything that's not
[2246.06 --> 2252.22]  safe we can hook it up run through our automated test suite and it'll tell us that we're going to
[2252.22 --> 2258.14]  build a chamber for it that will be both uh acoustically isolated and thermally isolated so we'll be able
[2258.14 --> 2264.96]  to tell you okay under different load scenarios how loud is it going to get uh how hot is it going to
[2264.96 --> 2272.00]  how efficient is it going to be if it's in a particularly hot environment as the world heats up
[2272.00 --> 2279.44]  i guess that could become more and more of a concern for people and uh this one's really cool we have
[2279.44 --> 2287.88]  i think it was i it's either six or seven of the 400 watt loads and the reason that we got so many
[2287.88 --> 2294.60]  was actually not because we needed that much sustained load but because of the their like transient
[2294.60 --> 2302.30]  performance so by having that many in parallel we are able to simulate the effect of like an rtx 3090
[2302.30 --> 2309.94]  having a momentary power draw spike yeah now nvidia might have kind of kind of screwed us here
[2309.94 --> 2315.82]  with some even higher power draw gpus coming oh yeah uh but i mean we won't know that for sure until
[2315.82 --> 2320.98]  it actually happens so we might actually have to get more of those modules to there was a comment
[2320.98 --> 2328.00]  for that there's a comment in flow plane chat about hoping that we don't um like squeeze steve out
[2328.00 --> 2333.42]  that's squeeze steve out not going to happen well you need multiple independent sources i was just
[2333.42 --> 2340.52]  gonna say so if if anything uh it should bolster because then people are going to be looking for
[2340.52 --> 2346.26]  that type of content exactly we're bringing it back yeah bringing it back and we have dead literally
[2346.26 --> 2351.24]  always said um that you should look at multiple reviews for products that you're buying so like no
[2351.24 --> 2358.66]  that's that's not happening not a thing i mean another thing too is that yeah this is pointed out
[2358.66 --> 2365.82]  by daffoid over on in the float plane chat is we don't intend to just focus on pc components that too
[2365.82 --> 2373.26]  i mean one of our first hires has a ton of experience in mobile phone testing uh so that's i mean that's
[2373.26 --> 2378.52]  not something steve touches as far as i can tell at all in fact doesn't he still use like a dumb phone
[2378.52 --> 2386.00]  or something i i i know he last time i talked to him he used like ancient ancient phone i just don't
[2386.00 --> 2390.96]  think he cares about it at all so so we are we are absolutely going to be looking at different
[2390.96 --> 2397.86]  verticals and we also think that even for the things we both cover there is and yeah a lot of
[2397.86 --> 2407.10]  situations validity to more than one testing methodology too so you know maybe maybe one of us uh you know
[2407.10 --> 2412.78]  tests coolers with an artificial load maybe one of us is all about you know embedding a thermal diode
[2412.78 --> 2419.00]  in the ihs maybe you know you know whatever right like and to be clear that's a bad example because
[2419.00 --> 2424.46]  obviously we would both care about it from both perspectives but i just mean that there is not
[2424.46 --> 2432.06]  always the one and only single way to test something i mean okay games games are a really good example
[2432.06 --> 2438.78]  maybe you know we really feel like yeah our audience has moved past 1080p so we're really
[2438.78 --> 2444.62]  focused on how good cards are for 1440p and up you know that that could be something that could
[2444.62 --> 2450.20]  realistically happen in the next two to five years or if we start automating the if we start automating
[2450.20 --> 2457.20]  custom benches instead of uh or custom runs instead of just running the the canned benchmarks or something
[2457.20 --> 2463.84]  like that i don't know more more sources is good you should you should read slash watch both yes
[2463.84 --> 2473.22]  and we've literally always said that so yeah one note for people who are thinking about the backpack we
[2473.22 --> 2480.00]  do have a promo on right now for the wan hoodie and backpack so if you get a wan hoodie and a backpack
[2480.00 --> 2488.28]  at the same time you save 20 and that's only valid until tomorrow evening so no pressure but uh you
[2488.28 --> 2488.64]  should do it
[2489.28 --> 2497.66]  question here from nathan for luke and linus what is your favorite piece of freeware or open source
[2497.66 --> 2505.20]  utility software like nine night or something else favorite piece of freeware i mean we're streaming
[2505.20 --> 2510.96]  on obs right now i think it sort of has to be obs well i wouldn't say favorite i don't have an
[2510.96 --> 2517.50]  emotional attachment to obs there's a lot of stuff that's not that perfect imagine it didn't exist
[2517.50 --> 2527.08]  yes uh i mean i was i was using i have you know i was using x split before and like it had some
[2527.08 --> 2532.26]  problems but i i actually kind of want to try it again to be perfectly honest with you see where it's
[2532.26 --> 2536.64]  yeah see where it's at they've sponsored the show a couple of times and it kind of made me think oh
[2536.64 --> 2540.94]  yeah x split i mean i have a lifetime license for it i might as well maybe i'll do like a game stream
[2540.94 --> 2546.44]  at home or something like that fire up x split see how it does play some play some obsidian when it
[2546.44 --> 2551.02]  worked well for me it worked great or divinity sorry yeah like there were things that x split did
[2551.02 --> 2558.14]  way better for me the game detection was so sick back then yes yeah and obs is still sucks we also had a
[2558.14 --> 2563.12]  lot of problems we did that was a long time and the wan pc had a lot of gremlins i don't know how
[2563.12 --> 2570.82]  much of that was x split that's fair enough honestly so man favorite free utilities i mean
[2570.82 --> 2577.12]  you can't you can't not mention you know your paint.nets of the world paint on net notepad plus
[2577.12 --> 2584.14]  plus yeah night winter stat um back putty someone said putty yeah putty seven zip oh there's so
[2584.14 --> 2588.56]  many good ones vlc you already said notepad plus plus right yeah okay heck yeah love notepad plus
[2588.56 --> 2593.50]  plus uh i actually i used to do that thing i think i told you about it way back in the day
[2593.50 --> 2598.84]  where you can overwrite all the like uh you can essentially like reg edit windows so anytime you
[2598.84 --> 2603.16]  even try to open notepad it just opens notepad plus plus that's hilarious i don't remember exactly
[2603.16 --> 2607.54]  how it works so i might have said something wrong there but it was actually really nice because
[2607.54 --> 2613.54]  you should just never use notepad you should use notepad plus plus i thought about uh resurrecting lsd
[2613.54 --> 2619.06]  remember oh yeah luke software discoveries yeah yeah yeah um chocolatey is apparently a
[2619.06 --> 2622.76]  nine-night alternative that's like way more powerful way more customizable so i thought
[2622.76 --> 2629.90]  maybe we'd like check that out and then i found something really cool oh no did i misplace the name
[2629.90 --> 2633.98]  of it chocolatey okay i can't find the name of it right now i have it written down somewhere
[2633.98 --> 2641.78]  but this is so this blew my mind there's this utility that lets you turn your usb drive bootable
[2641.78 --> 2648.68]  which i know won't impress you yet but turn your usb drive bootable so that it just loads
[2648.68 --> 2655.76]  like a list of all the isos that you've drag and drop onto that usb that's cool so it's like the
[2655.76 --> 2661.10]  ultimate utility usb actually i really like just throw your you just literally drag and drop your
[2661.10 --> 2666.78]  mem test iso your windows install iso and then you just plug this thing in and it just goes which one
[2666.78 --> 2673.56]  would you like this one that reminds me a lot of like so cool the no it's not rufus ventoi that's
[2673.56 --> 2680.72]  the one geek squad used to have this tool um that was actually really good um and i don't i don't
[2680.72 --> 2685.64]  remember the name of it but this was back in the day when every computer had a cd drive so they were on
[2685.64 --> 2694.44]  cds and you you could like burn the like geek squad tool onto these cds yeah and uh um people used to
[2694.44 --> 2699.58]  effectively like sell them outside of geek squad because they were so good they were actually
[2699.58 --> 2705.74]  valuable and like local repair shops would buy the updated versions of these like geek squad cds
[2705.74 --> 2711.06]  that were bootable and they had uh like mem tests and like all these other types of things on them
[2711.06 --> 2717.24]  right just all arranged really nicely yes yeah yeah yeah god it was nice like in one place but
[2717.24 --> 2722.94]  yeah ventoi is what it's called super super cool little tool yeah that's sweet
[2722.94 --> 2732.90]  all right what else we got from i think we brought down ventoi's website oh man mri yeah geek squad mri
[2732.90 --> 2739.54]  that way back in the day way way way long ago that used to be really genuinely good i have no idea if
[2739.54 --> 2747.90]  it even exists anymore uh but it was awesome back in the day yeah from aiden any updates on the big
[2747.90 --> 2751.26]  tall or women's sizes hyron's bootsy yeah
[2751.26 --> 2755.66]  uh no
[2755.66 --> 2767.68]  we're we got a lot we got a lot of stuff going on yeah a lot of stuff going on there's always like man
[2767.68 --> 2771.50]  it's it's kind of amazing how many projects they have rolling right now for how few people
[2771.50 --> 2778.74]  work at creator warehouse relatively speaking a lot of stuff going on yeah yeah
[2778.74 --> 2785.74]  apparently geekswatch still uses mri and it's still pretty cool all right that's actually good
[2785.74 --> 2789.86]  to hear because i know they've like outsourced a lot of their repair and stuff like you just
[2789.86 --> 2793.58]  plug the computers into a network connection and then people fix them remotely and stuff which
[2793.58 --> 2800.02]  kind of made me really sad um but the fact that mri is still cool is is pretty sweet also hyron's
[2800.02 --> 2804.00]  boot cd and all that type of stuff there's lots of cool things yeah i don't know i'd be super down
[2804.00 --> 2811.68]  from dominic hey linus i noticed wrist rest for keyboards are super boring have you ever
[2811.68 --> 2816.46]  thought of creating your own wrist rest in the typical ltt quality and style we all know and love
[2816.46 --> 2822.68]  why you gotta read it like that so far over the top dude
[2822.68 --> 2829.78]  in all seriousness yeah we've thought about it but the way that i see it the the custom keyboard
[2829.78 --> 2836.64]  market is so saturated there are so many players there's there's so many boutique wrist rests and
[2836.64 --> 2844.44]  keyboards and cables and all that stuff that i just i feel like we'd just kind of be adding to the noise
[2844.44 --> 2849.18]  at a certain point and the reason that it's occurred to me to make that product is because
[2849.18 --> 2858.44]  my wife is an avid wrist rest user she uses a steel series 7g which has that super long wrist rest on it
[2858.44 --> 2864.82]  and she just basically won't touch any other keyboard because it really is way better and so if we were
[2864.82 --> 2871.38]  going to do one it would probably be in that long gently inclined style and she also uses a wrist rest
[2871.38 --> 2877.96]  for her mouse but i think the mouse one would be more likely just because there are so many options
[2877.96 --> 2885.78]  for keyboard rest rests due to the explosion in enthusiasm for mechanical keyboards and and super
[2885.78 --> 2891.70]  cool keyboards a mouse rest rest i could actually see us exploring because the razor one that she's
[2891.70 --> 2897.10]  been using all these years it's it's kind of disgusting i was gonna say is it like yeah it's it's
[2897.10 --> 2903.34]  pretty gross at this point there's there's you maybe just haven't looked in the right spots or
[2903.34 --> 2911.54]  maybe deep enough or whatever but there's a lot of options for wrist rest um i i have this wooden
[2911.54 --> 2917.12]  one right now that's pretty sweet that i got from my mom for christmas um and i like it but it wasn't
[2917.12 --> 2925.40]  like sealed super well yeah i know i i know it's wearing out yeah so it's just like dang because it's it
[2925.40 --> 2931.70]  aesthetically is really nice in my opinion and then now it's actually yeah um and then it's it's
[2931.70 --> 2935.70]  i find it quite comfortable i actually like that it's just solid wood i know not everyone would like
[2935.70 --> 2942.46]  that but i i do um but yeah it's it's like i'm like wearing through it pretty rapidly um so that's
[2942.46 --> 2950.54]  the only disappointing part now that's an interesting idea if we were to do a wooden one instead of using a
[2950.54 --> 2953.80]  stain like they did i think i know the one you're talking about it's kind of reddish right is that the
[2953.80 --> 2959.58]  yeah yeah yeah instead of using a stain if we used something like a danish oil then we could just
[2959.58 --> 2965.40]  like man i bet we could just do like a little like a little bottle of it included yeah a little
[2965.40 --> 2971.46]  maintenance kit that actually be sweet so that because it will wear away a little bit but when it
[2971.46 --> 2976.18]  does with something like a danish oil you just recode it and it will actually match the surroundings
[2976.18 --> 2981.44]  even like it'll still look like new that would be awesome that'd be pretty sweet okay maybe we'll do it
[2981.44 --> 2987.22]  i'd be interested in that i would genuinely like yeah i if there was that option and it was advertised
[2987.22 --> 2994.46]  as like look it looks like this it will change over time because it's wood and your hands are on it all
[2994.46 --> 2999.46]  the time yeah you can maintain it here's how and we're going to include some that would have that
[2999.46 --> 3005.08]  would have sold me at the time pretty much for sure huh yeah okay all right all right i'll think
[3005.08 --> 3011.36]  about it think about it yeah uh i did get a message from one of our labs folks i don't know is uh
[3011.36 --> 3020.60]  is is he off probation yet this particular one uh i think as of like a day or two after the land yeah
[3020.60 --> 3027.56]  okay all right so well do you know that for sure not technically 100 okay then i'm not i'm not going
[3027.56 --> 3033.34]  to say it just in case but uh one of our software developers for the lab says read the usb hub testing
[3033.34 --> 3039.90]  question that came up yes we can and gary and i have already had a chat around testing usb power
[3039.90 --> 3046.62]  banks etc as well good that's something that i really want to know because you buy these things
[3046.62 --> 3052.92]  they say however many milliamp hours they are but we all know that even on something like an iphone
[3052.92 --> 3061.02]  right and apple for all their faults does have pretty strict quality control even on something like
[3061.02 --> 3065.84]  an iphone i think is it plus or minus five percent it's quite a bit for the battery capacity yeah
[3065.84 --> 3071.16]  like what i'm sorry what do you mean plus or minus five percent so on something that you know might
[3071.16 --> 3076.92]  handle a screen on time of you know eight nine hours you mean my friend might get an extra hour
[3076.92 --> 3082.56]  if i get the worst one and they get the best one that's ridiculous i also i have some battery banks
[3082.56 --> 3090.46]  that are still working from like 2013 that i have thrashed and they're still like they have a decent
[3090.46 --> 3094.96]  amount of charge like i'm very impressed with some of them and then i have a small army of other
[3094.96 --> 3099.76]  battery banks that are essentially like decommissioned because they they've just completely died yeah this
[3099.76 --> 3105.20]  is another perfect example of one of those techie product categories that even as someone knowledgeable
[3105.20 --> 3114.42]  you can go in and go well i know the reviews are horse i know that the specs are horse so i'm basically
[3114.42 --> 3121.62]  just like taking a complete shot in the dark hoping that i hit something decent yeah and there are brands
[3121.62 --> 3128.50]  that have built a reputation over the years brands like an anchor for example i expect to be better most of my
[3128.50 --> 3136.24]  anchor ones are pretty solid but you know good brands can release a bad product or they can sorry
[3136.24 --> 3143.90]  or they or they can turn bad right you can have a good a brand that starts out good and then leverages
[3143.90 --> 3149.54]  that trust that they've built with their audience to start cranking out crap we've seen certainly seen
[3149.54 --> 3155.22]  that time and time again oh yeah definitely yeah i'm i'm super into that that sounds great
[3155.22 --> 3162.48]  and then dad dude over on floatplane chat says hey and remember too that the milliamp hour rating
[3162.48 --> 3169.36]  even on an honest company spec is based on the battery capacity not what it will output at the ports
[3169.36 --> 3175.52]  yes that is true uh it also doesn't account for oh i guess this is kind of the same thing so any
[3175.52 --> 3182.20]  inefficiencies that exist within the design of the bank any loss well there you go also some batteries
[3182.20 --> 3189.06]  will actually discharge at a less efficient in a less efficient manner if they are discharging
[3189.06 --> 3193.70]  quickly compared to others so depending on the chemistry depending on the quality of that
[3193.70 --> 3200.54]  particular battery if you use slow trickle charging versus fast charging one or another could perform
[3200.54 --> 3210.38]  dramatically different yeah there's so much boy is there ever a lot to it uh eternal salt says like
[3210.38 --> 3214.68]  pyrex when that chinese mega company bought them out i actually didn't know that pyrex got bought and
[3214.68 --> 3218.88]  i didn't i don't know if the quality has gotten worse i i heard that they got bought out i have no
[3218.88 --> 3224.52]  idea about the quality interesting i mean the old school stuff lasts forever yeah literally forever
[3224.52 --> 3229.94]  yeah i don't know there's some people saying beeswax seals would really well against like
[3229.94 --> 3235.60]  hand oils and stuff oh interesting well that's cool i'm sure i'm sure the greater warehouse
[3235.60 --> 3240.54]  engineer team would would figure out what the best option would be too bad there are not going to be
[3240.54 --> 3246.90]  any bees yeah yeah so that's sad yeah
[3246.90 --> 3255.50]  yeah uh from benjamin next question uh hello from germany do you think the escalation with china
[3255.50 --> 3260.06]  and taiwan could crash the entire tech industry yes sure could
[3260.06 --> 3272.66]  like immediately overnight sure could because basically tsmc is by far the largest player for chip fabrication
[3272.66 --> 3281.46]  particularly advanced chips uh samsung is is a distant second if i recall correctly or is intel still ahead of them
[3281.46 --> 3288.06]  but that then intel until they really ramp up their third party fabrication strategy is not really doing that
[3288.06 --> 3293.18]  as far as i know they're mostly fabbing their own products as it stands right now and
[3293.18 --> 3298.30]  tsmc um it's right in the name is in taiwan
[3298.30 --> 3306.80]  so looking at the the chip race that's going on right now you look at the chips act in the u.s
[3306.80 --> 3314.36]  you look at the way uh china has been uh fighting to get their hands on high-end lithography equipment
[3314.36 --> 3321.06]  uh i forget what that like chinese state owned basically uh chip faber is i i forget the name
[3321.06 --> 3327.00]  but i think they're doing up to 14 nanometer right now and they're trying to get their hands on more advanced stuff
[3327.00 --> 3334.74]  look at the way this this technology arms race is ramping up right now because it's so obvious that next generation weaponry
[3334.74 --> 3348.18]  unless it is ai powered is going to be utterly useless um and the incentive that china has to just claim taiwan
[3348.18 --> 3358.00]  um is higher than ever you know up until now it seems like it's been mostly an emotional incentive to claim
[3358.00 --> 3367.54]  the island nation but that was big industry yeah but now with what a technological hub taiwan is
[3367.54 --> 3371.46]  i i i can only see it going up
[3371.46 --> 3378.90]  smic that's the one thank you uh thank you float plane chat they fired missiles over taiwan
[3378.90 --> 3384.58]  like a couple days ago yeah well there was the whole thing with uh nancy pelosi visiting taiwan which
[3384.58 --> 3391.80]  i gotta say um not a huge fan nancy pelosi but ballsy move yeah i mean respect for that
[3391.80 --> 3403.92]  yep um you know maybe a bit of a bit of a weird move given the you know um profiting that her husband
[3403.92 --> 3412.32]  technically i guess um has has done uh with like uh through chip stocks and and not definitely not
[3412.32 --> 3416.96]  insider trading um you'd think they wouldn't want to disrupt the tech industry but then
[3416.96 --> 3419.94]  you know who knows maybe they're shorting it now i don't i don't know
[3419.94 --> 3428.48]  inferno says nobody likes nancy pelosi to be frank i mean yeah yeah that's that's that's fair
[3428.48 --> 3439.92]  moving on we've got another question from liam wondering what your take is on the hasbro selfie
[3439.92 --> 3444.68]  series where you use an app to take pictures of your face then hasbro sends out and has your face
[3444.68 --> 3455.32]  made into a custom action figurehead uh well hasbro selfie series is that is that pulse what's oh hold
[3455.32 --> 3461.76]  on i thought i yeah here we go i thought i searched for this what happened create your own custom action
[3461.76 --> 3468.12]  figure choose your location uh not canada okay then sure i'm german today
[3468.12 --> 3474.80]  make room on your and it's english of course for yourself sure i'll take your cookies that's actually
[3474.80 --> 3485.86]  a really good tagline new rangers look at this uh okay boba fett in disguise sorry what is this how's
[3485.86 --> 3490.38]  my face on i think you need to do the u.s because the page change we did germany might not be available
[3490.38 --> 3495.70]  yeah mine's work i clicked on us and mine's well i don't know these are that is definitely not the
[3495.70 --> 3500.88]  green and black ranger from the show that i watched so well this has got to be it right there's been a
[3500.88 --> 3506.60]  new show what's the lightning yeah but no these look like the retro uniforms though this is definitely
[3506.60 --> 3511.48]  the retro megazord should we show luke's screen yeah i think you're totally off yeah i think you're
[3511.48 --> 3517.62]  totally off so this is the hasbro selfie series not what you were just looking at this is the tagline
[3517.62 --> 3521.70]  that i liked a lot make room on your shelf for yourself i think that's hilarious okay that's
[3521.70 --> 3526.96]  pretty good uh pretty classic yep they have this thing which is i guess trying to represent
[3526.96 --> 3532.52]  you getting scanned yeah and then just a stay in you know stay in the know thing nothing really going
[3532.52 --> 3539.58]  on this one of a kind experience will be launching in fall 2022 exclusively on the hasbro pulse mobile
[3539.58 --> 3545.62]  app for fans aged 16 and older in the u.s only so that's yeah that's why it didn't show all right
[3545.62 --> 3550.58]  why did they even give me the option to go to germany then who knows uh sign up below for the
[3550.58 --> 3556.72]  exclusive selfie series mailing list would you do it um do you get an action figure of yourself
[3556.72 --> 3565.54]  i mean i could see myself just being like well uh then again i don't i don't know hard to say i don't
[3565.54 --> 3572.78]  actually buy that much well yeah kind of stuff yeah i could definitely see a lot of people doing it
[3572.78 --> 3580.26]  though oh yeah like this is this is next level like genius tier product management i think if
[3580.26 --> 3587.00]  hasbro really wants to pop off with this they should let people merchandise them oh like like
[3587.00 --> 3591.22]  offer like a bulk right you know what i think the way they're going to be manufacturing these though
[3591.22 --> 3596.60]  they're going to be inherently like low volume i i don't think it'll barely even be much of a savings
[3596.60 --> 3603.48]  yeah i don't know i just i just think there's there's creators out there that would want to sell
[3603.48 --> 3609.48]  like an action figure of themselves hasn't hasbro already done partnerships like that though i think
[3609.48 --> 3616.72]  so i don't know but if they if maybe if they use this to like widen that okay flow plane chat reminds
[3616.72 --> 3621.36]  me that i already have multiple 3d printed action figures of myself yes but i don't think this is true
[3621.36 --> 3627.06]  but i for yourself i didn't buy them for me yeah so that doesn't count oh as a gift though i could
[3627.06 --> 3632.72]  see myself buying someone an action figure of themselves yeah for sure okay i thought you're
[3632.72 --> 3637.24]  gonna say as a gift you could see yourself buying them an action figure of you and giving it to them
[3637.24 --> 3641.74]  and i was gonna be like whoa i could see him doing that i could definitely see him doing that
[3641.74 --> 3655.36]  come on come on it's like dang dude okay that's brutal no what do i think of it i think they're
[3655.36 --> 3660.62]  geniuses i think as long as they can make the economics work they're gonna sell so freaking
[3660.62 --> 3665.84]  many of these yeah why not i i assume they'll start with just faces and then from there you'll actually
[3665.84 --> 3671.08]  be able to like you know design what you're what you're want to be wearing and all that kind of stuff
[3671.08 --> 3677.84]  guarantee you you're gonna see some wedding cakes oh yeah with action figures oh yeah on top
[3677.84 --> 3683.38]  um especially with with the way that like marvel's been popping off and stuff the whole like superhero
[3683.38 --> 3688.98]  action figure thing is like totally yep 100 and the number of people that do like a star wars themed
[3688.98 --> 3696.14]  wedding or one that i saw recently because i was i was checking out covers of the um romantic flight
[3696.14 --> 3702.66]  uh song from the soundtrack of how to train your dragon there are some amazing amazing covers of it
[3702.66 --> 3709.78]  um anyway i i saw someone walked someone had it as they had a live orchestra at their wedding playing
[3709.78 --> 3715.80]  how to train your dragon music while they walked up to the altar yeah no kidding right uh but anyway
[3715.80 --> 3722.84]  you know with that in mind how realistic would it be to have astrid and hiccup with the with the
[3722.84 --> 3728.14]  the heads of the bride and groom on top of the cake obviously by the time you hire an orchestra
[3728.14 --> 3735.58]  you know what's a custom figurine from hasbro 99 99 easy forever right yeah exactly exactly i could
[3735.58 --> 3743.56]  totally see people people manufacturing like landfill like that it's good i read a really interesting
[3743.56 --> 3747.26]  article recently actually i don't think i talked about this on land show i think i was talking to you
[3747.26 --> 3752.72]  about it at some point though about how one of the big industries that is just popping off
[3752.72 --> 3762.96]  right now is junk removal because millennials have like no space and baby boomers had nothing but space
[3762.96 --> 3771.48]  and a compulsive desire to acquire shit and so as they are downsizing or passing away
[3771.48 --> 3780.20]  there's just this there's this mountain this veritable mountain of garbage that the next generation
[3780.20 --> 3787.48]  either doesn't want or has absolutely nowhere to put and and this generation of people that are like
[3787.48 --> 3795.12]  yeah we accumulated this bone china that i'm sitting here like i was in i was in thrift store the other
[3795.12 --> 3800.86]  day picking up like cheap archie comics for my kids and i was like i was looking at all the like
[3800.86 --> 3805.86]  the fine china gold leaf stuff i'm like who the fuck would want any of this
[3805.86 --> 3814.76]  are you like are you for real this is worth nothing now right and this is like a prized possession for
[3814.76 --> 3820.86]  silent generation or for for your baby boomers out there oh we we won't eat on this because it's like
[3820.86 --> 3826.06]  the nice it sits in the cupboard and never gets taken out until no one wants it now give me some
[3826.06 --> 3830.92]  mel mel mac is it called uh is is that what that like super cheap
[3830.92 --> 3840.04]  yeah mel mac yeah melamine from american cyanamide here let's let's check you and i have talked about
[3840.04 --> 3844.74]  fast fashion before yeah here we go my girlfriend told me about this website give me some mel mac this
[3844.74 --> 3851.92]  is my childhood right here boys yeah definitely okay uh my girlfriend told me about this website i'm
[3851.92 --> 3859.02]  probably going to pronounce it incorrectly but sheen sheen shine sheen bell recognizes it yeah i think it's
[3859.02 --> 3867.48]  sheen sheen there's like eight dollar shirts pants for six bucks oh yeah so like there's no way these
[3867.48 --> 3876.24]  things last beyond like a season 100 and like i don't know yeah it is super cheap it is super cheap
[3876.24 --> 3881.68]  it definitely has that going for it and they like look relatively trendy and stuff yeah fast fashion but
[3881.68 --> 3889.62]  like environmental disaster oh yeah actually there's this whole thing um how like the the
[3889.62 --> 3894.32]  donated clothes they have too much of it yeah they're just like there's just like mountains
[3894.32 --> 3903.48]  of donated clothes i don't have anyone to give it to you like okay brutal man there's gotta be stuff
[3903.48 --> 3908.94]  that you can just like make out of it like just shred it and like make stuff you know like it can't be
[3908.94 --> 3914.14]  that hard can it i think you'd have a lot of inconsistency in like fabric quality and stuff
[3914.14 --> 3918.50]  like that yeah and getting back down to like string is going to be basically impossible no you wouldn't
[3918.50 --> 3923.78]  you know no it wouldn't be to get back down to string you would just like like i oh okay like for
[3923.78 --> 3929.38]  example that insulation that we have that's made out of uh recycled blue jeans where they just shred
[3929.38 --> 3934.12]  jeans and then just like turn it into like blue jean cake that you stuff in your walls like it
[3934.12 --> 3942.82]  i mean that's pretty much what it is um yeah i don't know i think i think in like shirts and stuff
[3942.82 --> 3946.70]  it's going to be more inconsistent though yeah no i don't think you wouldn't be able to make shirts
[3946.70 --> 3952.20]  oh oh you mean just like the materials in them i mean i don't know here's a question if it cost half
[3952.20 --> 3959.12]  as much and there was a chance that from one bat to the next the performance was going to be plus or
[3959.12 --> 3963.78]  minus you know never mind five percent like we were talking about for batteries i'm talking 25
[3963.78 --> 3970.58]  would you just would you buy would you buy fabric fabric insulation that's just like
[3970.58 --> 3975.42]  ah screw it some shirts yeah it's like i don't know it's made of shirts there's some skirts in there
[3975.42 --> 3984.56]  a few buttons oh man maybe you gotta find something to do with it um yeah used clothing ends up in
[3984.56 --> 3993.88]  in landfills yeah yeah pretty much that's bad question here from luke hi linus i do cell phone
[3993.88 --> 4001.32]  repair that's not really a question luke yeah yeah yeah got him what's going on luke classic luke
[4001.32 --> 4006.08]  but i was also curious if when labs is up and running fully there'll be any testing of durability
[4006.08 --> 4012.16]  of mobile devices or tad teardowns like iFixit does i don't think that we are going to get into
[4012.16 --> 4018.36]  either of those um durability testing is not useful on a sample size of one and quite frankly
[4018.36 --> 4024.50]  it's not even useful on a sample size of 10 we showed back when we toured one plus's manufacturing
[4024.50 --> 4031.78]  facility that what it takes is specialized equipment whether it's for drops or whether it's for tumbles
[4031.78 --> 4039.74]  that is run on many many devices and they have the luxury of many many disposable devices to chuck into
[4039.74 --> 4045.92]  these things that are not finished quality right that might have engineering sample grade socs in
[4045.92 --> 4051.00]  them for example like they literally couldn't sell them is ready to test exactly or they could make
[4051.00 --> 4057.68]  dummy ones that have exactly the same body and they can investigate it for screen cracking without
[4057.68 --> 4061.54]  actually wasting hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of internal hardware on them
[4061.54 --> 4067.76]  uh we we just don't we don't have that kind of a luxury and that's the kind of thing that you know
[4067.76 --> 4075.20]  what hey three to five years from now if the community said we want this we might even create
[4075.20 --> 4079.94]  a system actually this is a really good idea we should write this down but we could create a system
[4079.94 --> 4089.96]  where our community could could fund could specifically fund specific tests they could say hey uh we want to see
[4089.96 --> 4096.88]  we want to see 10 iphones in a tumble dryer um and then we would have basically build a mechanism
[4096.88 --> 4101.56]  where they could we could say like look we're not gonna we're no we're not paying out of pocket for that
[4101.56 --> 4107.32]  there is there is no way there's you're not getting your return make up that ten thousand dollars worth
[4107.32 --> 4114.76]  of iphones on this video or this article or just this data sheet right it's not happening but if you guys
[4114.76 --> 4120.68]  really want to see it then sure yeah we're into it uh we could even see manufacturers potentially
[4120.68 --> 4127.38]  funding something like that like if you're a um oh no i don't know that'd be tough that'd be tough
[4127.38 --> 4133.20]  like if i'm an otterbox and i just said hey i want independent third-party testing of how well the iphone
[4133.20 --> 4138.62]  holds up to this thing there's no way that they're gonna just write the check and walk away
[4138.62 --> 4143.98]  uh and not expect us to also test otterboxes for example so that's
[4145.06 --> 4152.38]  yeah that's tough is that an acceptable thing as long as they don't interfere with our data and
[4152.38 --> 4156.78]  they understand as long as as part of our agreement we basically say yeah you got to understand that
[4156.78 --> 4161.72]  once you write the check we're publishing the data regardless of the outcome i don't think it's bad
[4161.72 --> 4166.76]  to test otterboxes i could see us doing it for ltt but i don't think that's something that the lab
[4166.76 --> 4171.94]  would just do and publish the data so that's something where ltt could use the lab yeah i
[4171.94 --> 4175.80]  that's where i would kind of draw the line there that seems fair yeah
[4175.80 --> 4183.62]  question here from william hi linus and one of your oh sorry no i'll get to that one sec as for i
[4183.62 --> 4187.60]  fix it i think they do a great job i don't think we'd be contributing anything to that particular
[4187.60 --> 4194.02]  space at this time low priority we love i fix it uh from william hi linus in one of your at-home
[4194.02 --> 4199.50]  videos i saw a zuma plush in your kids playroom is zuma your favorite paw patrol pup or do you
[4199.50 --> 4206.24]  prefer a different one i can't say that i have a favorite pup but i can definitely recite the the
[4206.24 --> 4212.34]  intro theme song from my kids watch thankfully they're over paw patrol at this point they're um
[4212.34 --> 4217.26]  man what do they don't really watch much tv lately actually now that i think about it they'll watch
[4217.26 --> 4222.22]  wild kratz if they're if they're just like down to never even heard of that never heard of paw patrol
[4222.22 --> 4229.46]  but not kratz brothers yeah like zabuma foo oh okay i know zabuma foo sure okay i don't know what the
[4229.46 --> 4235.22]  heck zabuma foo is but oh wow zabuma foo is legit dude okay you don't know the good stuff well
[4235.22 --> 4242.94]  uh this question's from ryan but we've had a couple people ask if we had any information about
[4242.94 --> 4247.00]  what the backpack's warranty will be now that we've started getting ready to ship out it's a
[4247.00 --> 4254.18]  wonderful question right now we are we're holding firm with we are not formalizing anything but we
[4254.18 --> 4261.46]  will stand behind our products um i think that we have a pretty good tracker i think we have a pretty
[4261.46 --> 4270.14]  good track record for just kind of dealing with it the last thing that i would want to do is create
[4270.14 --> 4278.10]  some kind of like legal liability um for you know like i don't i don't know what the future holds
[4278.10 --> 4287.20]  right like i could die tomorrow and let's say let's say my you know my my my muse my my flame
[4287.20 --> 4296.52]  uh yvonne is like i can't do this like i can't walk in every day and you know see linus all over
[4296.52 --> 4301.80]  the place and she's just like yeah i can't right that that that's that's possible and i respect that
[4301.80 --> 4308.74]  um so the last thing i want to do is create some kind of of legal obligation because of some kinds of
[4308.74 --> 4316.02]  t some kind of t's and c's that we have created around our uh our our warranty policy for example and
[4316.02 --> 4321.32]  like yeah i guess that does put you guys in a bit of an uncomfortable position but it's not our
[4321.32 --> 4328.22]  intention to go away it's not our intention to do anything about our current policy of just
[4328.22 --> 4336.90]  dealing with it but um it's not our primary business making backpacks and so the last thing i would want
[4336.90 --> 4345.12]  to do is hang this albatross around my family's neck um when they're already have other stuff to deal with
[4345.12 --> 4349.00]  so that's where that's where we're at on that
[4349.00 --> 4357.36]  question here from chester any suggestions for ethernet cable routing along the inside of brick
[4357.36 --> 4365.30]  walls i mean other than just running it along the mortar and then using like those um using just
[4365.30 --> 4370.08]  like plastic drywall anchors you kind of drill them out you put in the anchors you screw it in so
[4370.08 --> 4373.60]  they expand so they so they grab on i mean i don't know what else to tell you
[4373.60 --> 4379.26]  if the brick wall is painted you can paint the cable to match um it's just always going to look
[4379.26 --> 4384.46]  pretty bad yep painting it to match never fully solves that problem
[4384.46 --> 4389.94]  you briefly mentioned it in the pre-show so we got a few people asking if there are any new house
[4389.94 --> 4398.14]  updates actually we shot two today we're gonna say you were i heard you're at home yeah i i did
[4398.14 --> 4405.46]  away with my 48 inch monitor 48 inches it's pretty big it's it maybe is too big
[4405.46 --> 4414.34]  so uh i tried a couple different options the alienware 34 inch ultra wide with the cutie oled
[4414.34 --> 4424.66]  screen looks so good but then lg also has the c2 42 inch which also looks almost as good oh and is
[4424.66 --> 4432.28]  bigger yeah but not as big as 48 inches so that one's gonna be pretty good i also uh in that video
[4432.28 --> 4438.96]  we update you know how i changed my microphone yeah so i do that in that video got it um what else
[4438.96 --> 4444.94]  what else did we do oh and then we also shot one that's about sort of fun novel interesting
[4444.94 --> 4450.88]  charging solutions it doesn't sound very interesting but i will tell you that within
[4450.88 --> 4457.84]  the first 10 seconds of the video you're gonna be hooked okay because i managed to rip uh a car
[4457.84 --> 4464.50]  charger out of the ceiling of my house and i can't promise that there won't be other shenanigans we're
[4464.50 --> 4469.18]  actually not done shooting that one yet so i don't know what else will happen okay we should um we
[4469.18 --> 4475.54]  should probably hit the sponsors oh do we have sponsors are there sponsors for the show no maybe not

[4658.68 --> 4666.30]  uh the problem i i don't i can't possibly understand how that happened but they reply to every
[4666.30 --> 4674.32]  ticket that they receive so what you might have to do is um you can try tweeting uh at nick and then
[4674.32 --> 4679.20]  maybe just say like hey here's my order number or my ticket number ideally and then they can go track
[4679.20 --> 4684.56]  it down nothing is perfect but if you're if you're not getting a reply from support eventually sometimes
[4684.56 --> 4689.50]  we do get behind then something is wrong that's not how that works
[4689.50 --> 4698.42]  all right what else we got to talk about today should we talk about the uh tales behind the
[4698.42 --> 4702.24]  counter do we save that for another time uh we can save that for another time i want to talk about
[4702.24 --> 4708.52]  amazon buying i robot okay yeah you you have strong opinions about this uh my reaction to it was just
[4708.52 --> 4713.94]  like okay they just moved closer to being an entire country but yeah what's what's uh what's up with
[4713.94 --> 4722.44]  amazon has signed an agreement to purchase i robot maker of the roomba for 1.7 billion dollars
[4722.44 --> 4727.38]  almost as much as twitter loses every year in specific money talk it is an all cash transaction
[4727.38 --> 4733.98]  wow for 61 dollars a share no that's a big deal that's a big deal no i know that's why yeah earlier
[4733.98 --> 4741.58]  this year i robot launched its latest i robot os an ai platform for its vacuums and mops i robot os was
[4741.58 --> 4747.30]  designed to separate roomba from the rest of the vacuums out there amazon has not detailed plans for
[4747.30 --> 4753.94]  what it intends to do with i robot um and the big a actually launched their own smart home robot last
[4753.94 --> 4759.98]  year called astro for a thousand dollars uh it could map out floor plans listen for commands and
[4759.98 --> 4768.50]  recognize faces it could not clean so here is kind of on the surface you can kind of go okay
[4768.50 --> 4777.66]  amazon is buying competent cleaning technology so that's one thing but hear me out what i think
[4777.66 --> 4782.98]  is amazon just wants yet another camera in your house oh they're also mapping your house yet another
[4782.98 --> 4790.90]  sensor array that patrols your house and monitors what the heck it is that you're doing and where
[4790.90 --> 4796.36]  you're going recognize your face and vacuum definitely needs to do that what you like to spend your time on
[4796.36 --> 4806.52]  yeah this is brutal don't buy it please i mean you can buy it no but like just know what you're
[4806.52 --> 4812.38]  getting yourself into that's all i ask that's all i ask i asked that you don't buy it between ring
[4812.38 --> 4824.62]  roomba astro and echo amazon will now be able to basically not basically literally follow you around
[4824.62 --> 4833.48]  and know exactly who you're talking to about what and what you're doing anytime you are at home
[4833.48 --> 4837.38]  isn't that wild super cool
[4837.38 --> 4846.30]  very very cool uh yeah that was it that was it i just wanted to kind of laugh
[4846.30 --> 4853.56]  at how amazon is basically the buy and large from wall-e yeah at this point stop bending over and
[4853.56 --> 4858.82]  giving amazon so much money please thank you people complain about like all these working conditions
[4858.82 --> 4863.78]  and stuff and they're like uh still can't drive to the store still gonna buy everything off amazon
[4863.78 --> 4870.78]  yeah and then i'll go protest amazon at the same time yeah as as supporting them financially as hard as i
[4870.78 --> 4878.14]  possibly can at all points in time i have a prime membership come on guys i know i know but it's so
[4878.14 --> 4880.64]  convenient for business oh my goodness
[4880.64 --> 4887.88]  i've talked about this too much on wayne show people don't like my spicy amazon takes it's fine
[4887.88 --> 4892.30]  i get it guys just keep supporting them eventually they'll own your house and your car and you but
[4892.30 --> 4897.32]  that's okay that's fine no no tesla will own your car buy the vacuum so that they can track your face
[4897.32 --> 4900.70]  because that's definitely required that makes a lot of sense cool
[4900.70 --> 4912.62]  anyways uh europeans mad oh we got to tackle it at some point yeah okay a lot of folks in europe
[4912.62 --> 4921.54]  are mad about the ltt backpack price amazon has free shipping why doesn't ltt store okay well hold on
[4921.54 --> 4926.96]  hold on don't don't be condescending a lot of people don't necessarily okay i know i was just
[4926.96 --> 4933.12]  trying to tie in the amazon thank you for one thing when we assess tax in the checkout that's
[4933.12 --> 4938.22]  the one time that tax should be assessed that's not canadian tax and then you pay your own country's
[4938.22 --> 4944.06]  tax after if you're getting assessed tax again when the package arrives you need to take that up with
[4944.06 --> 4949.42]  the last mile courier because they are doing it wrong you already paid the tax to be clear i don't
[4949.42 --> 4955.12]  think the way that we communicate it is the same way that it is normally communicated i'm not
[4955.12 --> 4959.46]  necessarily saying that we're communicating it poorly or that we're not communicating it but i think it is
[4959.46 --> 4965.92]  abnormal so when i think when people see it they're assuming that it is different okay for another
[4965.92 --> 4972.46]  thing so thing number two the expensive shipping we have i believe it is capped at either 50 or 60
[4972.46 --> 4980.56]  dollars on average looking at our order history and the quotes that we got across many couriers we we
[4980.56 --> 4990.88]  really did work hard at this um already our average costs and our average um amount that we're charging
[4990.88 --> 4997.92]  um are subsidized or sorry already the the costs are higher than what we're actually charging we are we
[4997.92 --> 5004.72]  are subsidizing backpack shipping to i believe everywhere but canada and the u.s who are helping us
[5004.72 --> 5012.10]  subsidize the other regions but nominally so yeah i think we're eating somewhere in the neighborhood of
[5012.10 --> 5020.02]  10 to 20 dollars on pretty much everything outside of north america per shipment there just is not
[5020.02 --> 5026.96]  more that i can do at that point someone in the phone chat said my shipping was 89 dollars so there is
[5026.96 --> 5032.22]  no cap you probably had other things in your order more stuff so that was a judgment call that we made on
[5032.22 --> 5038.70]  backpack knowing that it wasn't going to be in stock for i believe wave one ships out september 20th by
[5038.70 --> 5045.60]  september 20th so we made a judgment call because either we were going to have to hold people's entire
[5045.60 --> 5051.56]  order until their backpack was ready and if we did that we would be able to charge one shipping fee
[5051.56 --> 5058.64]  or we were going to ship out everything else on your order and then the backpack separately which meant
[5058.64 --> 5064.20]  that well because we were paying for the shipping twice we have to charge the shipping twice and there
[5064.20 --> 5070.00]  wasn't a way with our limited internal systems right now to have that be a toggle option that people
[5070.00 --> 5077.44]  could choose so we made the call because we know no matter how many times we say it no matter how clearly
[5077.44 --> 5084.58]  we say it there are always a very significant number of people who get confused and frustrated when they order
[5084.58 --> 5090.00]  something even though they know one of the items is going to be delayed whether it's a custom printed
[5090.00 --> 5094.84]  shirt or something like that there are always people who get confused and angry and message customer
[5094.84 --> 5100.26]  service and create a ton of work because they haven't received the other items from their order yet
[5100.26 --> 5105.98]  and so we made the call to ship out everything we have and follow up with the backpacks later so for the
[5105.98 --> 5109.32]  backpack itself there was a completely separate shipping fee assessed
[5109.32 --> 5120.04]  if there is a legitimate problem and you legitimately did encounter something else then please do message support
[5120.04 --> 5131.00]  oh yeah there was also the sticker the sticker controversy if you ordered a backpack and just free
[5131.00 --> 5136.20]  stickers you got charged shipping for the stickers we are dealing with that yeah it's being it's being
[5136.20 --> 5141.44]  refunded it's it's been fixed so it shouldn't happen anymore and it's being refunded so we're taking
[5141.44 --> 5146.66]  care of it across the board um what i don't fully remember and i think some other people might be
[5146.66 --> 5151.60]  might be interested what are the complications about setting up distribution from europe do you have to like
[5151.60 --> 5159.50]  tax be a company there yeah yeah so that's that's that's a lot that's like it's not trivial yeah um and
[5159.50 --> 5167.14]  so aside from aside from just the cost of running a physical location there uh the logistical nightmare
[5167.14 --> 5175.86]  of splitting our inventory there is also the um the the taxation and reporting uh obligations that come
[5175.86 --> 5182.44]  with being now an eu company we're all of a sudden a multinational do you think it's a coincidence that
[5182.44 --> 5189.40]  oneplus started out as having one location web only from which they shipped all phones that
[5189.40 --> 5195.90]  charged three hundred dollars for a phone to becoming a multinational that has support and service
[5195.90 --> 5202.00]  centers in multiple countries um that charges six seven eight hundred dollars for a phone it's not it's
[5202.00 --> 5208.64]  not there's no free lunch you have to pay for it somewhere yeah uh aiden yeah go for it
[5208.64 --> 5220.02]  but then i'd rather wait i don't want to pay 2x shipping i literally don't know what that means
[5220.02 --> 5226.24]  no they would prefer to have a single shipment oh yeah i get it um
[5226.24 --> 5234.30]  unfortunately we didn't have a way to do it either way so we're we're working on i mean we're constantly
[5234.30 --> 5242.06]  doing development on our on our shopify store it just takes time it just takes time and we
[5242.06 --> 5248.82]  fortunately thanks to the amazing support that we've gotten from you guys on backpack uh we have
[5248.82 --> 5253.48]  some money that we are spending we are actively spending on hiring developers i mean how many are
[5253.48 --> 5261.84]  you hiring right now okay thank you for that um no more for the store but um a huge amount of the
[5261.84 --> 5266.82]  effort that's gone into store development for a while the the person who does that is in flowplane
[5266.82 --> 5273.50]  chat right now i think i saw him in here recently um a lot of that effort has gone to a big redesign
[5273.50 --> 5279.24]  uh that we wanted to happen because we wanted to freshen up the site but also because we need to move
[5279.24 --> 5285.46]  on to a new theme um just because of like i mean we don't like own the platform and things are changing
[5285.46 --> 5292.10]  and we're moving to the dawn theme um and that's really good for like a wide range of reasons once
[5292.10 --> 5296.76]  we are on the dawn theme then we'll start being able to get back to features and stuff specifically
[5296.76 --> 5305.14]  for the store but there's been a a very big effort to get us um to the new version yeah aria lux in
[5305.14 --> 5310.00]  twitch chat asks have you ever looked into variable pricing based on location it might ease shipping costs
[5310.00 --> 5318.50]  if it appears not too exorbitant the problem with that is that it will for the people who live in
[5318.50 --> 5325.62]  areas that are very well serviced by couriers or by their their local postal service um it will be a
[5325.62 --> 5332.86]  savings yep you're right unfortunately what it will do is it will basically put ordering from ltt store
[5332.86 --> 5338.96]  completely out of reach for people in rural areas it generates it's it's just like the situation we're
[5338.96 --> 5344.08]  running into now where the people who are fine with the shipping costs will be fine and they'll be
[5344.08 --> 5350.14]  quiet and the people who are upset because they are at the high end of the shipping costs will be
[5350.14 --> 5357.12]  absolutely outraged and we'll bring that outrage online and into our customer support inbox and
[5357.12 --> 5363.34]  so what are we what are we supposed to like there there's there's a there's a trade-off no matter which
[5363.34 --> 5368.68]  way we do it yeah in a in a perfect world i would say yeah sure that makes total sense that
[5368.68 --> 5374.04]  people should just pay exactly the amount that the shipping cost uh maybe with a slight surcharge
[5374.04 --> 5377.36]  so that we have a slush fund for running shipping promos or whatever else yeah i'd say something
[5377.36 --> 5386.40]  like that makes a ton of sense but unfortunately in the real world we can't charge you know 19 for
[5386.40 --> 5396.16]  shipping to vancouver and 362 for shipping to iqaluit sorry we we can't we can't give the middle finger
[5396.16 --> 5403.62]  to that customer in a remote region that hard even though that's how much it costs i don't know that
[5403.62 --> 5409.94]  that exact amount is right but it is not inconceivable within canada alone for shipping charges on a product
[5409.94 --> 5417.22]  like the backpack to exceed 100 canadian dollars easily so yeah if you're somewhere where typically
[5417.22 --> 5423.10]  you're accustomed to it being cheaper you're probably subsidizing someone else well we've said that
[5423.10 --> 5430.36]  forever to be fair that is not a it's not new information shipping is really expensive i'm a
[5430.36 --> 5434.26]  flanker says one additional warehouse would cover all of europe and slash shipping times i know but
[5434.26 --> 5442.18]  you're not listening what it wouldn't do is decrease our overall overhead our costs would go up our prices
[5442.18 --> 5450.84]  would just go up once we have a physical location in a region it gets really complicated like we will need
[5450.84 --> 5457.52]  a team of people to manage it right now the entire creator warehouse teams like 10 people
[5457.52 --> 5466.22]  so what we're gonna go hire another team well you're gonna pay for it right so i don't know it's tough
[5466.22 --> 5472.88]  it's tough i there there's no perfect answer we would love to do it what i had wanted to do way back
[5472.88 --> 5479.44]  in the day was um especially back when hong kong was so heavily subsidizing international shipping
[5479.44 --> 5485.50]  like you you could get a package shipped from hong kong for like a dollar you could buy stuff yeah you
[5485.50 --> 5490.60]  could buy stuff on like aliexpress or whatever for like three dollars with free shipping and you're
[5490.60 --> 5495.76]  sitting here going how does this make any sense whatsoever well it's all state subsidies right
[5495.76 --> 5500.86]  um so what i had wanted to do was find a region like that where there's heavy state subsidies
[5500.86 --> 5505.86]  in international shipping and just take advantage of that but to my knowledge nobody is really doing
[5505.86 --> 5516.26]  that to the same degree anymore yeah and shipping in canada in general is quite brutal yeah yeah canada
[5516.26 --> 5523.42]  uh yeah even just shipping something like like you actually mentioned just a minute ago shipping
[5523.42 --> 5529.52]  something inside canada not even leaving the borders can be like astronomically shipping something from my
[5529.52 --> 5533.80]  house to your house would cost me like 20 bucks exactly i was just gonna say even if you're not going
[5533.80 --> 5539.56]  to a quality or whatever like if if you're going if you're going basically down the street it can still
[5539.56 --> 5540.70]  be really expensive
[5540.70 --> 5555.00]  and i mean the the reality of it is that the backpack launch was a smash success so you know did we get
[5555.00 --> 5564.16]  it perfect maybe not but we did get it pretty good and if if huge shipping costs are a concern for you but you
[5564.16 --> 5567.90]  you know you want to support the channel or whatever else we do have things that don't weigh as much
[5567.90 --> 5574.14]  screwdriver is coming really soon it's a lower cost item and it's a much smaller item um if you're if you're
[5574.14 --> 5580.06]  frustrated with how much backpack cost to ship um what something that i would recommend that you do if you want
[5580.06 --> 5584.72]  to understand it a little better at least is look into the concept of dimensional weight the backpack
[5584.72 --> 5592.18]  itself is not that heavy but in shipping because their costs are less to do with the actual weight
[5592.18 --> 5597.08]  unless it's air freight in which case weight matters a lot uh but less to do with the actual weight but
[5597.08 --> 5603.58]  more to do with the dimensions of it backpack is huge and it takes up a lot of space on a pallet and
[5603.58 --> 5612.22]  every time a pallet gets moved there's a cost so the farther it goes the more it costs and the more
[5612.22 --> 5618.14]  of the pallet takes up the more of the overall cost of moving those goods around has to be borne by that
[5618.14 --> 5624.42]  one package and this this is some assumptions but well i am assuming i'm assuming they're correct
[5624.42 --> 5629.28]  i don't know maybe you can correct me because i know in the boxes for the backpacks the backpacks
[5629.28 --> 5634.52]  themselves are filled with airbags they are um it's to help them keep their shape because the
[5634.52 --> 5640.74]  reprieve fabric is really like strong right and we want it to be in in good quality and in with the
[5640.74 --> 5646.78]  proper shape and holding its form so if it gets crushed like really badly like sits crushed crumpled
[5646.78 --> 5651.80]  you uh you know it gets delayed in shipping and it sits in a warehouse for six weeks under a giant
[5651.80 --> 5658.30]  pile of other stuff uh it could have a hard time bouncing back it is meant to it is meant to retain
[5658.30 --> 5664.08]  yeah because there's a lot of other like purses or backpacks or small bags or whatever that will
[5664.08 --> 5670.58]  come flat yeah but they're like like tent material yes it's it's very different so it's not made for
[5670.58 --> 5673.18]  that yeah yep that's correct
[5673.18 --> 5682.74]  have you this is another thing i think you're just reading comments so i'm just gonna keep riffing sure
[5682.74 --> 5689.24]  yeah this is this is another thing that i uh had thought of recently is we talk about this with
[5689.24 --> 5696.22]  graphics cards so you release the halo product first have you considered releasing a like ltd backpack
[5696.22 --> 5704.12]  light um i i hadn't i i mean the backpack was built to be the one that i want yeah which that's what i
[5704.12 --> 5710.62]  want i carry a lot of stuff around and i i like that whether i well whether i like it or not that's
[5710.62 --> 5719.12]  my life but i have seen so many requests for it that i feel like we'd be morons to not at least
[5719.12 --> 5724.38]  explore it i can't guarantee anything right now it's absolutely not something that we have in
[5724.38 --> 5730.32]  development at the moment but we had had people ask about it internally and we have had so many
[5730.32 --> 5736.02]  people ask about it from our audience that we'd be yeah there's just there's just no way we won't
[5736.02 --> 5743.46]  at least explore it cool interesting yeah all right want to give us another one bell sure do how
[5743.46 --> 5753.78]  about a softball yes let me pick a different one then just kidding this question is from a whale from
[5753.78 --> 5758.96]  the land event oh hi the event was super fun and i hope we get to focus more on lands at ltx in the
[5758.96 --> 5765.08]  future that's not a question luckily they followed up with a question i wanted to ask one thing about
[5765.08 --> 5769.54]  head phone testing at the lab oh sure do you have any plans to do frequency response at different
[5769.54 --> 5774.58]  volumes versus an equal loudness curve it's something i've always wondered about frequency response graphs
[5774.58 --> 5784.20]  interesting um i don't know that is a tremendous wonderful question i don't know that i'll be able to
[5784.20 --> 5791.34]  get you an answer back in a in a convenient way but what i can do is i can definitely forward that
[5791.34 --> 5797.24]  actually i'm gonna have bell forward that to uh the head of the lab and that's something that they
[5797.24 --> 5804.26]  can at least explore for the creation of our test suites uh thank you for asking and i'm glad you had
[5804.26 --> 5811.28]  fun at the land i i also had fun the land was awesome yeah i i had a i had a blast i we should probably
[5811.28 --> 5817.56]  wow we should probably talk highlights hey yeah i'd be down um beating everyone beating everyone
[5817.56 --> 5824.46]  at left for dead i mean okay that was kind of mean though was it like bell bell we told them it was
[5824.46 --> 5831.22]  gonna happen yeah we warned them they all knew they signed up for that yeah we we basically assembled a
[5831.22 --> 5838.86]  team uh like a a crack team of left for dead players and i got up on the microphone and said
[5838.86 --> 5847.14]  assemble a squad if anyone can beat us i will give every member of your team a backpack an early
[5847.14 --> 5854.26]  screwdriver hand built by kyle head of engineering at creator warehouse and 250 us dollars in store
[5854.26 --> 5861.48]  credit at ltt store so naturally teams were assembled the teams yeah people signed up for the tournament
[5861.48 --> 5871.90]  and one by one we absolutely crashed them into the ground it wasn't even fair we had chase who is just
[5871.90 --> 5880.92]  like a mad lad in general and who is really good at left for dead we had bell who streamed probably
[5880.92 --> 5888.34]  hundreds of hours of left for dead back in the day we've got me i've got 250 300 hours of left for
[5888.34 --> 5894.12]  dead one and left for dead two under my belt it's been a while but like there's a big difference
[5894.12 --> 5901.64]  between having 250 hours of left for dead playing on like public servers and me the vast majority of
[5901.64 --> 5908.40]  my hours were with a crew that did nothing but get home from work and play left for dead with some
[5908.40 --> 5913.82]  really like legit gamers sharpen that sword a lot a lot more than just like randomly playing against pubs
[5913.82 --> 5918.48]  absolutely yeah and so the vast majority of my hours are playing with that with that crew i have
[5918.48 --> 5924.92]  significantly less hours than everyone else that was on that team um by like probably hundreds but
[5924.92 --> 5932.04]  uh i've only really played with all of them yeah so and you follow orders good yeah and your fps skills
[5932.04 --> 5937.82]  are yeah that's that's right every every once in a while i was you i usually did okay every once in a
[5937.82 --> 5943.66]  while if i got like the right zombie characters i'd like top damage or whatever i really my favorite one's the
[5943.66 --> 5953.24]  spitter oh spitter so much so much so much fun yeah yeah um and like it's not like linus is quiet
[5953.24 --> 5958.76]  so anytime that i'm like not necessarily sure what i should be doing i just like hey where am i going
[5958.76 --> 5963.34]  or like whatever and i'll i'll get information quickly but yeah it was good we ended up playing
[5963.34 --> 5972.34]  against um like essentially my family and friends in the final so that was weird because like their team
[5972.34 --> 5977.84]  name is generally the team name that i'm under and we like had to beat them up which was kind of funny
[5977.84 --> 5983.56]  had to crush them it was it was there was a few funny moments where like i would just like take
[5983.56 --> 5988.20]  someone out or just like there was a boomer time where i got all four of them and i was just like
[5988.20 --> 5994.68]  brutal there was one time i was a smoker i was on top of the building you guys hit them all at the same
[5994.68 --> 6002.28]  time yeah and i 100 to ko'd someone with the smoker nice and i was like yeah let's go um linus against
[6002.28 --> 6009.44]  again my crew did a charger run down a set of stairs and hit literally every single one of them which was
[6009.44 --> 6016.62]  awesome yeah it was pretty good it was pretty fun it was good heart i mean as much as i love just
[6016.62 --> 6023.34]  crapping all over noobs though i'd say the most fun that i had at the land was halo ce blood gulch
[6023.34 --> 6031.42]  you can't you you can't plan we can show the clip i was looking for it just now okay you i haven't
[6031.42 --> 6037.82]  found it yet but you cannot plan this out okay you can't have ranked players go into a tournament
[6037.82 --> 6046.24]  and set up teams this even and we basically just luke and i started up a lobby each of us went to one of
[6046.24 --> 6052.82]  the teams and then we just broadcast the password on discord and people flooded in randomly populated to
[6052.82 --> 6059.22]  the teams we broke it into separate discord chats and i kid you not i have never seen a competition
[6059.22 --> 6069.06]  so even in my life we played 8v8 on blood gulch capture the flag three full rounds with neither team
[6069.06 --> 6075.94]  scoring a single flag capture and it got close to the end of the fourth one as well and then finally
[6075.94 --> 6080.84]  finally and it was like it was not because people didn't know what they were doing or weren't following
[6080.84 --> 6087.00]  instructions or weren't good fps players if anything it was just that each team had the
[6087.00 --> 6095.62]  perfect mix of elite tier players and lower end scrappers and there was just this it was like
[6095.62 --> 6102.28]  playing warcraft one right where where the orcs and the humans are exactly equivalent like you would
[6102.28 --> 6107.56]  have a swordsman and uh and uh what are they called grunts they're they're just like swordsman
[6107.56 --> 6113.62]  equivalent ish and they would just go uh uh uh uh uh uh uh and then the last two swords would hit each
[6113.62 --> 6116.96]  other at the same time and they'd both die right like that that would that would actually happen oh
[6116.96 --> 6123.90]  in warcraft 2 as well uh so so it would that was just how every conflict would go down both teams would
[6123.90 --> 6132.50]  annihilate each other and respawn over and over and over again until until finally finally the stalemate was
[6132.50 --> 6140.82]  broken by just a fluke lucky situation sick to watch it back if if anyone's in the whale land discord
[6140.82 --> 6146.56]  because it's still up uh if you can find the video and post it in general because i can't really find
[6146.56 --> 6151.42]  it right now uh i just don't remember what channel it's in but if you can post it it'd be really cool
[6151.42 --> 6158.84]  to show because it's actually crazy like it's it's pretty sweet oh man i was raging out so hard
[6158.84 --> 6168.06]  luke uh luke mentioned that i'm not a quiet gamer which is fair i like it i'm not complaining it's
[6168.06 --> 6177.54]  just it's a fact so when my driver the driver of my warthog who i asked to take asked very politely
[6177.54 --> 6183.90]  and calmly asked luke was actually sitting next to me so he could hear me just like
[6183.90 --> 6190.04]  to my mic the whole time i would try not to i would try to mute my mic when i heard you actually
[6190.04 --> 6195.10]  saying commands and if i heard like okay we're going in whatever amount of time i would not
[6195.10 --> 6200.60]  relay that information i'll try not to act on it but sometimes it was so loud that it would go through
[6200.60 --> 6205.48]  other people's mics in the convention and i would hear you saying it through my headphones from someone
[6205.48 --> 6212.90]  else and i was just like okay so i tend to be a bit of a loud boy gamer we got it
[6212.90 --> 6218.90]  uh okay uh do you want to send it to you on post it in the chat or oh yeah sure yeah yeah if you
[6218.90 --> 6227.70]  send it to me here i can just play it um okay so someone's hiding behind the base okay and they
[6227.70 --> 6234.92]  went they stole one of the warthogs from that base happened to pull up right as some lone wolf rogue
[6234.92 --> 6238.76]  came out the back of the base with the flag grabbed them like it couldn't have been timed more
[6238.76 --> 6242.42]  perfectly if we were professional players uh where will i find i'm just trying to figure out where
[6242.42 --> 6248.18]  to send it to you oh then the dog yeah the dog is good just right at the top is perfect um so they're
[6248.18 --> 6252.06]  coming back and i'm like guys guys you got to talk you got to communicate communicate they're like we
[6252.06 --> 6256.14]  got the flight okay where where are you going what can we do what can we do to support you they're
[6256.14 --> 6260.12]  like okay we're coming back like which side where are you coming back like oh so i'm talking to my
[6260.12 --> 6268.28]  driver i'm like go go go you gotta go go up here my driver bless his heart bless his heart soul mind
[6268.28 --> 6278.08]  and body okay drives headlong into the warthog that is coming back after literally an hour of stalemate
[6278.08 --> 6286.72]  an hour no one can score okay drives headlong into the warthog that is carrying their flag back
[6286.72 --> 6292.92]  this is an 8v8 we are right next to the portal that comes out of their base i just
[6292.92 --> 6302.50]  should be under the uh right above intel slowing down right above that topic okay yeah i'm i'm like
[6302.50 --> 6310.14]  i'm getting anxiety just thinking back to it okay here it is fortunately uh fortunately the the capper i
[6310.14 --> 6318.12]  believe yeah yeah the the capper managed to manage to uh screen record and upload the whole thing
[6318.12 --> 6324.42]  so this particular player on our team was kind of playing hide hide up near the base kind of take
[6324.42 --> 6329.34]  pot shots or whatever one of the things we were trying to do was accumulate all the warthogs yeah
[6329.34 --> 6335.82]  so that we could do like a four warthog push look at this didn't know they were coming because people
[6335.82 --> 6340.00]  don't communicate i had no idea in ce you could get in the gunner seat with a flag that also
[6340.00 --> 6343.58]  confused the crap out of me a lot of people were shooting at the passenger seat so we're actually
[6343.58 --> 6351.30]  missing them nice so this is my hog that drives headlong into them i didn't see it our hog crashed
[6351.30 --> 6357.28]  so i didn't actually see that they landed on all four wheels nobody talks so i didn't know what the
[6357.28 --> 6361.76]  heck was going on we have someone in their base grabbing their flag who goes out the back which you
[6361.76 --> 6367.48]  would think would be smart but that's actually where they pulled up their flag they like barely make
[6367.48 --> 6374.88]  it through but they cap it crazy ending scored oh man one nothing after four full rounds is
[6374.88 --> 6380.48]  absolutely wild i mean that's the kind of thing i love at lens is the second that happened the and
[6380.48 --> 6388.30]  you could just hear oh yeah just all over the room like you can't oh there's playing online yeah it's
[6388.30 --> 6394.22]  fine i guess right you don't get the same uh but it's not the same response and stuff like there's
[6394.22 --> 6400.94]  nothing better than dueling someone finishing them off with a headshot and being like ah like
[6400.94 --> 6409.20]  the first round linus and i were like fighting over kills uh and then event one i thought it was me
[6409.20 --> 6414.68]  it was oh no i won the second yeah not even close the first one you were even close i stopped going
[6414.68 --> 6419.80]  for kills because i started realizing no one is ever going to win the game and i followed suit because
[6419.80 --> 6426.84]  their team got way more organized yeah because it was like the the respawn timer what i think the
[6426.84 --> 6432.48]  shortest respawn timer is like five seconds and then you have eight people and the flag return is
[6432.48 --> 6439.02]  instant if you touch it it's just gone so actually getting one of the flags out is really hard um but
[6439.02 --> 6444.72]  that's just i mean one of the teams pulled it off just saying just saying i mean one of the teams had a
[6444.72 --> 6453.12]  commander who was able to i did make some sus calls here and then your your four warthog push thing was
[6453.12 --> 6460.10]  never gonna work by the way um it's fair we had we had like beautiful strategies for that um yeah
[6460.10 --> 6466.24]  sneaky boy warthog though we also did sneaky boy with like the spring bounce if that's one thing that i
[6466.24 --> 6472.08]  think my people not people might not know is there was like grenades and stuff under that hog if it stayed
[6472.08 --> 6478.28]  on the ground it was dead the fact that it got ran into and did a perfect flip in the air and landed
[6478.28 --> 6486.20]  with like still having momentum like what was amazing um it's actually such a cool clip i seriously doubt
[6486.20 --> 6490.68]  there's clips that have like the exact same series of events oh and it's an ancient game that people
[6490.68 --> 6496.00]  played a ton so that's super cool yeah it was it was awesome man yeah that was that was really sick
[6496.00 --> 6505.48]  love land gaming although i think my favorite moment was when i hoodwinked literally everyone
[6505.48 --> 6512.48]  at the entire event including me and i was sitting right next to it in the minor vga competition
[6512.48 --> 6520.90]  okay minor vga pretty tough game pretty unforgiving game all right we gave people what was it 10 or 15
[6520.90 --> 6526.32]  minutes yeah it wasn't that much to accumulate as much money in their bank account as possible
[6526.32 --> 6532.44]  and at the end of it i was like yeah there's no way that anyone's gonna beat me at minor vga
[6532.44 --> 6540.46]  and we actually had someone who did shockingly well like they had what like 5 000 a lot like a lot like
[6540.46 --> 6545.36]  far and away more than anyone else did they win a gaming pc i think so i think so yeah they won
[6545.36 --> 6553.54]  absolutely wild prize but anyway sick gaming pc too before before i admitted that they that they won it
[6553.54 --> 6564.28]  i um i went back to my machine i was like i'm gonna win this one and i managed 15 000 15 000
[6564.28 --> 6570.94]  that's nearly end game for minor vga i had like all the items i had the four leaf clover i had the
[6570.94 --> 6576.62]  wedding ring i had the condom okay i had everything that is that is an item that is an item in the game
[6576.62 --> 6581.74]  okay gotta get the condom okay play it safe you know what i'm saying yeah uh so i had the condom
[6581.74 --> 6588.76]  and uh you know everyone luke included i was like luke did i cheat he looks over at my computer he's like
[6588.76 --> 6595.12]  well not only that i i was playing next to him part way through i'm like man this is really hard
[6595.12 --> 6598.78]  because i've never really played before because i knew it was coming but i didn't like practice or
[6598.78 --> 6603.72]  anything um and i was like losing money and i thought i was doing the right strategy but i i
[6603.72 --> 6610.64]  wasn't linus told me how to play after that uh but i glance over and he has this amount of money
[6610.64 --> 6616.38]  and he's like basically given up and i was like what you have whatever the thing that convinced me
[6616.38 --> 6623.10]  about it was that you didn't seem to care which was really i was very smart because you just kind of
[6623.10 --> 6629.68]  shrugged it off and you're like yeah no one's gonna beat me and i was like okay all right sounds
[6629.68 --> 6633.70]  good so i was convinced because i was sitting right next to him never saw him open the vm because i was
[6633.70 --> 6640.38]  focused on trying to learn the game but so i had a game that i had already played for like two hours
[6640.38 --> 6646.16]  because i was ripping footage for the upcoming channel super fun where colton and dennis uh attempt to hide in
[6646.16 --> 6653.42]  my house again um and the way that the downloader works from the ubiquity ui is that you it breaks up
[6653.42 --> 6662.40]  the files and you can only confirm the save location of the file once each one is done and so i was just
[6662.40 --> 6667.06]  stuck sitting at my computer confirming downloads because it's like 200 files or something stupid
[6667.06 --> 6670.82]  like that for all the different cameras and all the time span that we that we had to record them for
[6670.82 --> 6677.64]  so i was like ah screw it i'll i'll play minor vga in the other tab so then what i did was i left my
[6677.64 --> 6684.48]  computer in a state where i would land on minor vga in kind of a believable scenario so i went down
[6684.48 --> 6691.36]  sat at my computer like started one fresh and then it was like team viewer hide hide interface
[6691.36 --> 6694.02]  okay yeah yeah i'm doing good
[6694.02 --> 6701.76]  and i even had luke check my computer when i was like yeah i did way better he's like no it's legit
[6701.76 --> 6707.04]  it's legit i'm like are you sure he's like yeah it's legit i didn't notice there was there was the
[6707.04 --> 6711.86]  little like because it was a full screen and stuff there's just the little tiny drop down thing at the
[6711.86 --> 6716.98]  top and uh i think there was like a mic in the way or something someone on the other side of the table
[6716.98 --> 6721.54]  was like no it's there and i had to lean around to be able to see it it was awesome yeah
[6721.54 --> 6729.22]  oh boy i had so much fun with that the winner of space cadet table played on a steam deck
[6729.22 --> 6736.16]  yeah that's actually pretty cool that was hilarious there was the counter-strike tournament which i
[6736.16 --> 6741.44]  enjoyed because usually at most lands that i've been to that there is a counter-strike tournament
[6741.44 --> 6751.12]  some like local team will show up and it's just like not even remotely close but all the like like
[6751.12 --> 6756.60]  quarter semi and actual final every single one of them was down to the wire that's which was really
[6756.60 --> 6761.94]  cool and like that's super cool that was that was actually sweet it like actually felt like a real
[6761.94 --> 6766.60]  tournament despite being kind of the opposite because it was mostly just a bunch of randoms but
[6766.60 --> 6771.90]  it wasn't like just a complete slaughter by like one pro team or something like that's so important
[6771.90 --> 6780.18]  for fun i would rather have lost that halo match than won it easily yeah like just a close game is
[6780.18 --> 6787.20]  so much better than a blowout no matter which side you're on yeah the the multi like flash game style
[6787.20 --> 6793.38]  tournament thing was really cool i'm very happy that it culminated with nidhogg because nidhogg is such a
[6793.38 --> 6800.12]  cool like 1v1 like oh yeah stressor type of game oh yeah so having it end with nidhogg was awesome
[6800.12 --> 6807.76]  the fact that i got robot unicorn attack in there was cool um yeah yeah yeah we had some good space
[6807.76 --> 6812.42]  cadet table players there i thought i was pretty good i played a lot when i was a kid but i was not
[6812.42 --> 6816.64]  even close in fairness to me though you saw how leggy it was running on my machine mine was i don't
[6816.64 --> 6821.12]  know what was up it was pretty brutal i could barely even shoot a new ball like it was it was totally
[6821.12 --> 6822.62]  totally glitched out
[6822.62 --> 6827.32]  but yeah yeah land was really good
[6827.32 --> 6834.82]  all right why don't we uh jump into another topic uh what else did we say we would talk about
[6834.82 --> 6839.56]  when did we start the show i don't know oh how long have we been streaming that's what i was wondering
[6839.56 --> 6844.00]  it's eight it's about two and a half hours oh we should probably call it at some point jeez we
[6844.00 --> 6849.70]  have we've hardly even touched the merch messages um there's just been a lot i don't know if the rest of
[6849.70 --> 6854.40]  the topics are like all that well i definitely want to talk about how there are now two google meets
[6854.40 --> 6860.82]  okay yeah i heard about this and my eyes rolled into the back of my head and i moved on because i
[6860.82 --> 6866.60]  didn't even want to know what was happening so yeah what what is it um google now has two
[6866.60 --> 6873.18]  two google meets it's not enough for them to have competing video chat products internally
[6873.18 --> 6881.56]  now they actually have the same name even though they're different programs in fairness in fairness
[6881.56 --> 6888.18]  microsoft i think was the first to this innovation with their multiple versions of skype and now
[6888.18 --> 6893.08]  multiple versions of teams wasn't okay hold on wasn't it skype for business
[6893.08 --> 6898.30]  uh yeah but still that's clear enough no just log in with a business
[6898.30 --> 6906.24]  login freaking account and have business features you idiots no i know you don't have skype for
[6906.24 --> 6912.60]  business and skype i think there's different ways that it's like actually built well then pick the
[6912.60 --> 6918.18]  one that's good and use that one yeah it's probably more expensive i mean it's like wow back when they
[6918.18 --> 6923.90]  used to have two separate freaking kernels for their operating system the good one for business and the
[6923.90 --> 6930.14]  crap one for home so to get get rid of the crap one that one's less defensive obviously
[6930.14 --> 6938.68]  obviously who's in charge skype for business was link yeah and i in my opinion that was a better name
[6938.68 --> 6945.40]  to be honest sorry i get kind of angry about this kind of crap so tell me about the two meets all right
[6945.40 --> 6950.68]  um google meet was originally launched as a zoom like video communication successor to hangouts which
[6950.68 --> 6956.82]  hilariously still exists the fact that all the video like video to video communication companies
[6956.82 --> 6965.68]  allowed zoom to like become what it is is pathetic i'm sorry yeah but it is from january to april 2020
[6965.68 --> 6971.78]  meets user count grew by a factor of 30 with roughly a hundred million users per day google duo was
[6971.78 --> 6977.78]  launched earlier as a one-to-one and group call app meant for a firm for smaller scale use think facetime
[6977.78 --> 6987.90]  skype or discord if it's scalable then use it if it's not scalable then put it on the shelf goodbye
[6987.90 --> 6996.24]  why do you need a good scalable one and a crap not scalable sorry sorry okay as the pandemic went on
[6996.24 --> 7003.20]  the need for both styles of communication grew and so did the apps as a result duo as the smaller service
[7003.20 --> 7009.04]  has been rebranded meat and will receive the features from both apps and meat is still meat
[7009.04 --> 7017.94]  so we have two meats um so what's not even like a business they're both business or consumer so meat
[7017.94 --> 7026.88]  is compatible with both duo and meat but meat is compatible only with meat eventually the old meat app
[7026.88 --> 7032.20]  will be phased out in favor of the duo app with meat functionality which is now being called meat
[7032.20 --> 7038.20]  this is horrible how did this stuff happen
[7038.20 --> 7049.94]  users of duo don't have to do anything the app was updated automatically with meat support last month
[7049.94 --> 7056.54]  it has icon changed earlier this week and i'm assuming its name want to see something that makes me really
[7056.54 --> 7064.62]  angry as someone who used hangouts as our internal business chat as part of g suite for so long then
[7064.62 --> 7071.66]  switched off of it first to slack which we had issues with was it slack i i wasn't a part of that i think
[7071.66 --> 7076.62]  it was slack first to slack then to teams both of which we've had numerous numerous issues with hangouts
[7076.62 --> 7082.40]  for all its warts and all its simplicity did did mostly just work um and was convenient because it was
[7082.40 --> 7089.28]  always open in your gmail tab always okay so every time i see this i get irrationally angry because
[7089.28 --> 7095.52]  they told me hangouts is going away so we like rush migrated off of it now when you go to share something
[7095.52 --> 7105.68]  in android and you click gmail it freaking prompts you gmail or chat no no no gmail you told me chat which
[7105.68 --> 7109.68]  is what hangouts is now and the one that's built into you you know you told me it was going away
[7110.88 --> 7118.48]  i believed you that's what i get for believing anything you say when i click gmail i mean a email
[7119.12 --> 7124.96]  that's what i mean don't make me press more don't make me press more buttons and the hilarious thing
[7124.96 --> 7130.48]  is that oh okay it doesn't it doesn't right now so i'm not sure why but there used to be
[7130.48 --> 7136.08]  a chat oh this is chat this is different chat no no that's because that's there's a standalone chat
[7136.08 --> 7144.48]  app aside from chat built into the gmail app how are they so bad at this so bell said that the the
[7144.48 --> 7149.20]  meat app on his phone is now named meat and then original in brackets
[7151.28 --> 7154.96]  yeah just updated one day on my iphone i was like what is this long name that is
[7154.96 --> 7167.36]  meat original funny yeah mine is that too what the heck wow crazy all right let's talk merch messages
[7167.36 --> 7173.60]  i gotta i got a lab to pay for read me merch messages wow from calvin hi i've been following
[7173.60 --> 7180.64]  your coverage on the use of hdr video very closely any updates on lc hdr in the future we did one we did
[7180.64 --> 7189.36]  one recently the uh the video on glossy monitors on the eve excuse me doe spectrum uh is in hdr so if
[7189.36 --> 7194.40]  you watch it on an hdr compatible display with hdr enabled you will experience it in hdr and for
[7194.40 --> 7200.88]  videos about displays in particular it it is a huge difference maker it really helps you to better see
[7201.52 --> 7207.84]  through the screen the differences between two two different experiences it's more true to life
[7210.64 --> 7217.12]  from miluton oh hold on i i saw a little bit more to that merch message and yes we've learned a lot
[7217.60 --> 7224.00]  um we are working closely with adobe and with youtube there seems to i don't know if i can take credit for
[7224.00 --> 7232.08]  it but there seems to be a fire lit in the online video streaming industry um to to better support hdr and
[7232.08 --> 7240.88]  i'm really excited for it we we are we are moving slowly but surely toward hdr particularly on ltt
[7240.88 --> 7244.32]  there have been two to three videos someone in flow plane chat said there have been two to three hdr
[7244.32 --> 7251.76]  videos on flow plane there has been um but i will admit they're quite the pain to get going
[7252.32 --> 7259.60]  um and we do need to update our stiffs so that it can be done better fortunately the king has returned
[7259.60 --> 7266.88]  yeah well that we're not yeah yeah that's all i'm saying yeah float plane people will know sure has
[7268.24 --> 7271.84]  i had a wonderful day me too
[7274.08 --> 7278.32]  actually my day was pretty chaotic but that was a good that was a high point a good moment yeah
[7280.32 --> 7285.36]  uh from maluton hi luke and linus long time fan i wanted to ask what you think of smartwatches are they
[7285.36 --> 7290.24]  a fad that have run their course where they become a ubiquitous gadget on everyone's wrist
[7290.24 --> 7298.08]  or remain a niche product like i feel they are now i really want them to be good but i give up so i'm
[7298.08 --> 7304.40]  just using uh the withings you know one that is a clock and lasts for a month and i guess there's like
[7304.40 --> 7311.20]  some heart recording stuff but i don't really care about any of that i have always done really really bad
[7311.20 --> 7318.80]  with any accessories that you wear uh if they're glasses i will lose them or drop them or step on
[7318.80 --> 7327.44]  them um is that why you don't wear glasses yeah oh that's sort of sad yeah i'm not even kidding i i
[7327.44 --> 7333.52]  have a pair of glasses don't you have a close uh a close associate who literally works in the glasses
[7333.52 --> 7338.80]  industry and that's why i have two i have sunglasses and i have those mm-hmm the sunglasses you don't wear
[7338.80 --> 7344.72]  them never leave my car ideally because if they do they will be gone because you know you know how
[7344.72 --> 7348.72]  i like if i leave your house what percentage chance would you say that i have to come back to get my
[7348.72 --> 7356.48]  keys oh yeah yeah yeah just there's no number it's just yeah yeah yeah so like i that type of stuff if
[7356.48 --> 7363.12]  it's a ring if it's a watch if it's glasses if it's a necklace it's gone and i just like know that about
[7363.12 --> 7369.28]  myself so i don't wear any of it um and that's it so like i i think they're cool they're just it's not
[7369.28 --> 7373.92]  for me i would go with something like that where it's relatively simple and toned down because i
[7373.92 --> 7377.68]  honestly wouldn't want to like daily charge a watch that would just be very annoying to me
[7378.96 --> 7383.76]  yeah it's all about battery life i wear the fossil hybrid hr for the same reason i get steps and basic
[7383.76 --> 7388.88]  stuff for two weeks and that's better than charging an apple watch every day yeah that's pretty good yeah
[7388.88 --> 7395.92]  uh from sal question for luke you mentioned did freelance it work before fully committing to ltd
[7395.92 --> 7397.60]  what did you do to find work to make it possible
[7401.12 --> 7401.36]  um
[7405.12 --> 7409.92]  this isn't entirely above board but i haven't worked there in forever so whatever uh back when i used to
[7409.92 --> 7414.88]  work for geek squad there was customers that would come in that would want things that are services
[7414.88 --> 7420.40]  that geek squad could not provide um so in those cases i would potentially step in
[7421.12 --> 7427.68]  that is how i got one of my clients um that's pretty one of my main ones it was stuff that they
[7427.68 --> 7432.56]  literally didn't do yeah you're just like not really supposed to do that no for sure yeah for sure yep
[7434.40 --> 7439.76]  i was very young with that and extremely poor so that's i did i did what i did i mean at least you
[7439.76 --> 7448.56]  didn't steal toilet paper for like a long time um but yeah like i there was there was one guy who
[7448.56 --> 7453.28]  needed server work done like on location like this is not something that geekswad would ever do
[7453.28 --> 7458.08]  they'd never touch that no like i i only did stuff where it would never be something that they would
[7458.08 --> 7464.24]  do um and then that got me some other jobs because he was business person who talked to other
[7464.24 --> 7468.00]  business people that had the same problem and then blah blah blah blah blah and it just kind of
[7468.00 --> 7476.00]  growed from there grew from there um um getting late some yeah something that you can do though
[7476.00 --> 7481.36]  is just like go talk to businesses fine i've talked a few times about how like notaries and law offices and
[7481.92 --> 7488.88]  and uh medical practices and stuff like that they need very good uh data storage and security yep it
[7488.88 --> 7494.64]  needs to be extremely reliable etc be good so that you're not screwing them over because there is liability
[7494.64 --> 7500.64]  um but yeah then just go walk into places and be like what is your solution like do you need a
[7500.64 --> 7506.56]  better one etc etc this is great and then he graduated to grossly misrepresenting his qualifications on his
[7506.56 --> 7510.88]  ltt application love it all right what's next
[7513.36 --> 7519.68]  uh next one we have here it's from uh radioactive twinkie hello as pc enthusiasts and gamers do either
[7519.68 --> 7525.28]  you do routine wrist exercises to keep your wrist limber and to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel
[7526.48 --> 7536.88]  um i play badminton which involves a lot of uh squeezing and like like these motions these motions
[7536.88 --> 7545.44]  squeezing motions so i probably unintentionally do a ton of wrist exercise but no i don't go out of my way to
[7545.44 --> 7550.56]  to do it uh when i was rehabbing a problem that i was having with my arm i spent a lot of time with
[7550.56 --> 7557.36]  the powerball um like a gyro gyro ball and that worked really great for me but other than that no i
[7557.36 --> 7563.44]  can't say that i do uh nope never been even remotely a problem with me though um
[7563.44 --> 7572.88]  if i use a mouse that does is not compatible with my grip um i'll get like like ice like shooting
[7572.88 --> 7579.84]  feelings through my wrist um but it hasn't been a problem with the corsair m40 or 45 or whatever that
[7579.84 --> 7583.76]  one that i used for so long was and it hasn't been a problem with the g pro wireless so i'm pretty happy
[7583.76 --> 7589.36]  with where i'm at for that right now yeah i don't know i've never had any thing like that my wrists are
[7589.36 --> 7597.76]  kind of huge i don't know if that like helps at all but yeah question here from alex a few years ago
[7597.76 --> 7602.72]  i managed to make my hard drive burst into flames despite having built multi multiple computers at
[7602.72 --> 7607.44]  that point i'd never heard or assumed that psu sata cables were not cross compatible do you have any
[7607.44 --> 7616.48]  other explosive stories i'd say my best story just like lighting something on fire was probably
[7616.48 --> 7625.04]  oh i mean i had one recently actually okay i got a couple never mind i i tried to install a pci card
[7625.76 --> 7631.68]  oh man no i oh man i don't remember anymore exactly what i tried to do i wrote this out on the forum
[7631.68 --> 7636.48]  like back in the early probably nine years ago on the forum so i might tell the story wrong but
[7636.48 --> 7647.92]  in a nutshell i tried to install a pci card into a uh oh no i remember okay i there was a pci card
[7647.92 --> 7654.88]  that had some kind of a four pin header on it and probably it was for something to like some kind
[7654.88 --> 7662.64]  of breakout cable or something like that i mistook it for a four pin floppy female connector for like
[7662.64 --> 7670.16]  auxiliary power for the card so i plugged it in powered on the system and promptly released the
[7670.16 --> 7675.68]  magic smoke that was inside that card that made it work um i had a buddy who sorry i thought you're
[7675.68 --> 7681.84]  done no no go ahead i had a buddy who was uh fairly aggressively overclocking a computer and shot some
[7681.84 --> 7685.92]  blue flames out of the back of the power supply i like it but i have never
[7685.92 --> 7694.72]  i think been in that scenario i managed to scorch the back of a motherboard just uh just a couple
[7694.72 --> 7704.40]  weeks ago nice yeah i uh was helping the neighbor build their pc and uh young young neighbor and um
[7704.40 --> 7710.16]  one of my son's friends and i wasn't paying close enough attention this is at least partially on me
[7710.16 --> 7717.12]  and he was trying to put it into the back of the io shield spot and dragging it around on the
[7717.12 --> 7725.20]  standoffs knocked a couple caps off the back so i made a clumsy attempt at putting them back on
[7725.20 --> 7730.24]  knowing that it was probably dead anyway and whether it was the scratches to the traces around
[7730.24 --> 7737.04]  it or whether it was something else you know when you hear that sound yeah it's bad
[7737.04 --> 7744.08]  yeah so that was that was pretty recent yeah i i haven't killed anything with like fire you know
[7744.08 --> 7748.64]  but i've i've bricked some stuff but i guess it doesn't fit in this story hit me
[7750.64 --> 7755.84]  from me sale excited to get my backpack hope have you guys thought about making wallets
[7758.00 --> 7762.16]  i'm a simple man i like to put my stuff in my wallet
[7762.16 --> 7769.92]  i feel like i just don't really i don't demand much of a wallet i use this i use this homemade
[7769.92 --> 7777.52]  one from yvonne and i i'm sure there are wallet connoisseurs out there who would who would ask for
[7777.52 --> 7785.52]  so much more performance from their wallet than i do but for me it's just like speeds and feeds yeah can i
[7785.52 --> 7793.92]  can i reach the card can i can i flash my identification i've had all right then wallet
[7793.92 --> 7802.16]  ever since we went to germany for um the the cherry tour oh wow that's a long time i i bought a wallet
[7802.16 --> 7807.20]  while i was there because mine like literally fell apart i'm exactly the same one i've only ever owned
[7807.20 --> 7813.76]  three wallets in my entire life i have probably similar to me used all of them until they disintegrated
[7814.56 --> 7820.96]  and then i have gotten a new one that is as simple and usually a gift actually i yeah i think two of
[7820.96 --> 7826.48]  them were gifts so i've gotten whatever simple basic black men's leather wallet has been handed to me
[7826.48 --> 7836.16]  nice yeah that's how i roll from sergeant kilgore great name uh do you guys think modular phones will
[7836.16 --> 7842.48]  ever make a comeback also do you have any opinions on vtubers man i had a vtuber conversation with the
[7842.48 --> 7847.52]  whales at the whale land when i was doing the studio tour where i was basically saying you know i'm i'm
[7847.52 --> 7854.00]  getting too old for this i'm getting too old to be the the front man of this band and um they kind
[7854.00 --> 7861.92]  of laughed right and i was like no like for real i'm gonna be 40 like in a few years i'm i'm gonna be
[7861.92 --> 7869.76]  not young and cool at all i mean i was never cool but i won't be young either and you know i think the
[7869.76 --> 7875.12]  next generation of tech enthusiasts are going to want a face that looks more like theirs to tell them
[7875.12 --> 7881.04]  about their you know their their tech purchases or whatever else like we have to i i have to realize
[7881.04 --> 7888.08]  that there's a shelf life how many youtubers can you name who are over 50 yeah not many they
[7888.08 --> 7893.04]  definitely exist but not many part of that's because the the platforms age itself sure right
[7893.04 --> 7899.44]  but then that's where i was going next how many how many prominent tiktokers are over 40 yeah right
[7899.44 --> 7904.32]  so there's going to be new platforms there's going to be new ways that the younger generation prefers
[7904.32 --> 7910.64]  to communicate and i am not necessarily going to understand it i'm not necessarily going to be there so
[7910.64 --> 7919.20]  uh one of the one of the solutions to aging out of your of your media platform is going digital right
[7919.20 --> 7924.00]  and i think a really good example of this is ryan's toy reviews ryan's toy reviews started as a cute
[7924.00 --> 7930.32]  little kid unboxing toys right but obviously uh his parents who seem to manage that particular media
[7930.32 --> 7936.24]  empire recognized very early on that their son wasn't going to be five forever right and so they built
[7936.24 --> 7944.16]  up a team of animators and writers and they built out content around ryan's persona around ryan as a
[7944.16 --> 7949.68]  character right um and part of that is just making sure that he wasn't being exploited right that he wasn't
[7949.68 --> 7956.16]  working 60 hours a week making making youtube videos uh but part of it is the longevity and so
[7957.68 --> 7963.84]  um red and link it's yeah it's a viable strategy and you know i could just pursue cosmetic surgery
[7963.84 --> 7967.12]  right you know try and look young for as long as possible try and stay limber
[7969.12 --> 7972.80]  but that's going to run out at some point i've got a lot of people relying on me so it's definitely
[7972.80 --> 7977.20]  something that i've considered like would you watch an animated review of something i don't see why not
[7977.20 --> 7983.28]  i i think and i've kind of always thought this that and and i know i know i know but i think you put too
[7983.28 --> 7991.60]  much stock into it i think uh if it was a piece of technology that was like totally out of your
[7991.60 --> 7997.76]  realm sure but i don't think you lose legitimacy with like phones vr tech and computers just because
[7997.76 --> 8003.60]  you get old sure that is something from our generation yes but there will be things that
[8003.60 --> 8008.08]  are not from our generation like i don't have a ton of interest in things like smart speakers because
[8008.08 --> 8014.32]  i just grew up without them and i don't care about them and so i i think that whether it's whether
[8014.32 --> 8021.60]  it's just the face like i okay so i won't look like someone who knows about whatever that new thing
[8021.60 --> 8029.04]  is and people do they do generalize they do stereotype right so i just i think it's something
[8029.04 --> 8033.84]  to be aware of we've had people in chat bring up adam savage adam savage is a great example of of
[8033.84 --> 8042.24]  someone who has transcended you know generational gaps right i think adam savage is cool pretty much
[8042.24 --> 8047.04]  across the board but maybe that's the millennial in me talking maybe adam savage isn't cool to young
[8047.04 --> 8053.04]  people i i wouldn't know because i think he's cool so yeah i don't know bixby says i see old
[8053.04 --> 8057.20]  man tech wizard is more legitimate sure but how many of them do you actually watch every day
[8058.08 --> 8062.48]  i just don't think there are that many sure there are i mean you could watch uh you could watch get
[8062.48 --> 8068.48]  connected uh does he even still make videos you could watch rodney reynolds
[8068.48 --> 8073.20]  i feel like i can hear hi i'm rodney reynolds in my brain
[8076.32 --> 8079.28]  does leo laporte still make content i believe so
[8082.80 --> 8091.76]  get connected i can't find out here uh leo laporte podcasts like yeah i think so eight days ago well
[8091.76 --> 8097.44]  you guys gotta make more content there you go yeah see look pixel buds pro you can hear about pixel
[8097.44 --> 8102.72]  buds pro from uh from mike right like it's it's one of those things i think this is someone else
[8102.72 --> 8112.32]  now what oh hold on we got a mr mr that's a that's a face that we recognize yeah okay so they've hired a
[8112.32 --> 8118.96]  host yeah i i he's definitely still has some of it i know that okay i looked at it not that long ago
[8118.96 --> 8125.76]  so you know i it's it's tough it's something that i think about a fair bit um float plane says i should
[8125.76 --> 8134.72]  get the tom cruise package yeah i i i was watching top gun with uh with yvonne um i remember it being
[8134.72 --> 8139.92]  a lot cooler when i was a kid it's the original yeah it's like pretty hard to watch actually anyway
[8140.80 --> 8146.96]  and i was looking at the other people in that movie whether it's val kilmer or whether it's um
[8148.64 --> 8154.88]  is it hold on a second no no robin wright played the princess in the princess pride which i had no idea
[8154.88 --> 8158.88]  because when i was a kid i didn't care about like who the cast was or whatever i was so i was i saw
[8158.88 --> 8168.24]  that in like my plex no way that was robin wright anyway um uh really yeah she plays jenny and forrest
[8168.24 --> 8177.20]  gump she plays the the wife in house of cards okay okay well anyway uh meg ryan's in top gun and so
[8177.20 --> 8187.36]  you look at like you look at everyone else in top gun literally okay literally 35 years later right
[8188.72 --> 8196.08]  none of them have aged anywhere close to as well as tom cruise so yeah whoever's doing his work man
[8196.80 --> 8203.76]  gotta get me some of that for realsies it's zenu dude for realsies he's making it happen keeping him
[8203.76 --> 8211.44]  young all right what else we got uh from mark with the steady progression of human enhancement tech
[8211.44 --> 8215.68]  what would be your line for what is too much to replace would you get an rfid implant or digital
[8215.68 --> 8222.32]  eyeball or something else oh i'm down as long as it's like probably pretty safe and or i have like
[8222.32 --> 8228.88]  nothing to lose like if i if i lost my hearing i'd be first in line for a cochlear implant like let's go
[8228.88 --> 8239.28]  if you guys start getting into biohacking i'm in dude yeah i'm in next question here for luke from
[8239.28 --> 8244.96]  alex how do you and your engineers approach planning and roadmapping and how do you guys organize do you
[8244.96 --> 8252.96]  leverage scrum scrum so the whole thing of like agile and scrum is is almost i i've been paying attention to
[8252.96 --> 8257.44]  a lot of spaces a lot of people are kind of moving away from it it was it was very much the rage when we
[8257.44 --> 8266.16]  first started and we've kind of landed on a bit of a weird mix which seems to be true for a lot of
[8266.16 --> 8271.04]  teams um i don't know for everybody and i'm sure people can be like well my team does what i know
[8271.04 --> 8278.08]  i'm not talking for everybody um but our mix is that we do uh twice a week meetings so we do a meeting at
[8278.08 --> 8282.96]  the end of the week and we do a meeting near the end of the week uh monday and thursday generally
[8282.96 --> 8288.88]  those meetings are supposed to be fast um they're not supposed to take a lot of time we've had
[8288.88 --> 8294.32]  those meetings that last less than five minutes um in total not per person they're they're supposed
[8294.32 --> 8299.60]  to be quick they're not supposed to take a lot of your day um and that's like the the stand up from
[8299.60 --> 8306.80]  the scrum mentality stuff that we do uh but then we dive into kanban with uh like issue tracking and
[8306.80 --> 8312.32]  and task tracking boards um that people manage themselves and yada yada yada uh planning and
[8312.32 --> 8320.64]  road mapping um planning as much as i can try uh often just has bombs dropped on it all the time
[8320.64 --> 8325.36]  and if people are in this space i think they probably have experienced the same thing whether
[8325.36 --> 8329.84]  that's linus just randomly coming in and be like hey guys we're doing all these things now good luck i
[8329.84 --> 8335.20]  need it in a month um or if i don't usually give you a month uh yeah usually it's less than that um
[8336.16 --> 8341.84]  or if it's me doing effectively the same thing to be completely honest um because i'll i'll be like
[8341.84 --> 8346.72]  oh wait this like creator wants this thing uh so you're halfway through that that's cool what if
[8346.72 --> 8352.32]  you worked on this thing now uh especially with a small team sometimes there can be staffing challenges
[8352.32 --> 8357.68]  and it's beyond our control like yeah they were gonna do that but they didn't so here we go
[8357.68 --> 8362.80]  you know and it's not anyone's fault it just does still need to be the show must go on at the end of
[8362.80 --> 8368.88]  the day development is uh inconsistent progress that that is going to be a thing that you experience
[8368.88 --> 8374.40]  is inconsistent progress you'll have someone who will make absolute leaps and bounds in like two days
[8374.96 --> 8380.40]  and then they get stuck on something that like actually wasn't that difficult for like two weeks
[8380.40 --> 8386.80]  because they just happened to not approach it in the exact right way or see it from the exact right
[8386.80 --> 8392.00]  angle and they spend a bunch of time trying like more difficult solutions than what it actually
[8392.00 --> 8395.60]  needed and then they figure out that it's something simple whatever and that's going to happen and
[8395.60 --> 8403.04]  that's fine that just happens in this space a lot um this is hilarious sorry i'm just gonna jump in
[8403.04 --> 8407.52]  this is from twitch chat nido says it's easy to say we need to plan better and end up in an infinite
[8407.52 --> 8411.68]  loop of meetings discussing how to plan and never end up doing it yeah and a lot of times you just need to
[8411.68 --> 8417.52]  act so in in regards to architecting too like i don't know we do our best uh we we try to figure
[8417.52 --> 8422.00]  out all the different components that are going to end up going into something but a lot of times
[8422.00 --> 8428.64]  linus or me or someone else on the team it doesn't matter is going to change what we need to do because
[8428.64 --> 8433.36]  we'll learn something or we'll experience something right we'll go oh this tool that's currently in
[8433.36 --> 8438.64]  development actually needs to work this way or we'll get user feedback or that so like sometimes things are
[8438.64 --> 8444.00]  going to change so we architect the best that we can to try to set ourselves up for the best possible
[8444.00 --> 8452.80]  result but i never i think it's a fool's path to go into it assuming that uh it's not going to change
[8452.80 --> 8457.60]  sometimes potentially drastically hopefully that answered your question this is i could talk about
[8457.60 --> 8465.04]  this for a long time so that's that's the compressed version but yeah nice the last question we have here
[8465.04 --> 8470.64]  is from anon as a frequent phone switchers for smartphone reviews how do you manage to transition
[8470.64 --> 8475.68]  of data apps messages and contacts between your temporary daily drivers i haven't found a reliable
[8475.68 --> 8484.72]  oh it sucks that was one of the main reasons that i dailyed the note 9 for so long was that i just got
[8485.44 --> 8491.28]  tired of switching my daily driver actual daily driver phone all the time so what i would do is i would
[8491.28 --> 8496.56]  mostly sloppy transition over to whatever i was reviewing and i would just have my note 9 in my
[8496.56 --> 8502.16]  pocket for certain things like i just didn't want to move my offy onto the one that i was reviewing or
[8502.16 --> 8508.32]  i didn't want to move my uh we chat was one that was really annoying like i lost my entire we chat history
[8508.32 --> 8514.32]  a couple of times because the process for backing it up and restoring it is like kind of arcane um
[8514.32 --> 8520.56]  um so yeah i'm sorry i don't really have like a perfect solution for you it sucks and it will always
[8520.56 --> 8530.56]  suck as far as i can tell it is what it is and it is over thank you for tuning into the wanshow yeah
[8530.56 --> 8533.36]  we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[8533.36 --> 8541.60]  bye
[8543.12 --> 8543.68]  sorry i didn't
[8547.92 --> 8551.04]  i didn't even i wasn't even like thinking it was probably do the show i took the time
[8551.04 --> 8553.60]  oh yeah yeah
