[0.40 → 1.64] How you all doing everyone?
[2.18 → 4.26] Happy Friday and welcome to the WAN show.
[4.34 → 6.42] We've got a great show lined up for you guys today.
[6.56 → 8.28] We are well into TikToker.
[8.64 → 10.28] We got Pixels to talk about.
[10.44 → 12.32] We got Arc GPUs to talk about.
[12.40 → 14.70] We got 4090 GPUs to talk about.
[14.94 → 16.24] We got 13th Gen.
[16.30 → 18.24] Wait, no, no, we're not talking about 13th Gen.
[18.52 → 21.18] Not, uh, that's still under NDA.
[21.42 → 22.04] Hold on.
[22.18 → 23.22] But there's lots more coming.
[23.28 → 23.98] What else we got?
[24.40 → 25.58] I took all the good ones.
[25.62 → 25.96] Got them.
[26.00 → 27.04] I think you took everything.
[27.04 → 27.82] No, no, no.
[27.82 → 31.70] YouTube test putting 4K behind a paywall.
[32.08 → 33.48] I have the hottest take.
[33.60 → 34.46] You do, actually.
[34.58 → 35.50] I actually have the hottest take.
[35.50 → 37.02] And I am here for it this time.
[37.12 → 38.12] I got your back.
[38.40 → 40.58] Also, there was a made by Google event,
[40.96 → 44.70] which broadcasted all the most boring things
[44.70 → 46.02] you could possibly imagine.
[46.10 → 46.64] Oh, come on.
[46.64 → 48.34] But we will make it interesting.
[48.46 → 49.04] Oh, come on.
[49.04 → 50.50] Just like we always do.
[51.36 → 52.28] Hit it, Chewy.
[53.82 → 54.72] I'm Chewy.
[54.98 → 55.86] I got him.
[57.82 → 60.42] Punch it.
[60.78 → 61.28] Darn it.
[62.10 → 63.08] Yeah, you were close.
[63.40 → 64.38] I know.
[64.64 → 65.98] He doesn't Star Wars.
[66.96 → 68.12] He thinks he's Star Wars.
[70.76 → 72.66] He's a wannabe Star Wars-er.
[73.78 → 74.80] That's so sad.
[74.80 → 79.42] The show is brought to you by Zoho One, Savage Jerky, and Squarespace.
[79.64 → 83.00] And I guess we're going to have to jump right into the big topic.
[83.26 → 83.48] Now.
[83.98 → 84.24] Yeah.
[84.36 → 91.46] I'm not going to break down the extremely long and detailed argument that I have for my position
[91.46 → 91.86] here.
[91.92 → 92.70] Oh, we're going to do it.
[92.72 → 94.48] Because it's going to be a separate video.
[94.92 → 96.24] I recorded it today.
[96.50 → 98.88] Hopefully it'll go up early next week.
[98.88 → 103.46] But the word, well, not the word on the street.
[103.74 → 110.50] YouTube has tested putting 4K behind a YouTube premium paywall.
[110.90 → 114.94] So essentially making access to the 4K resolution.
[115.72 → 118.48] I mean, it's not really a drop-down because it pops up.
[119.64 → 120.70] Jump up.
[120.94 → 121.82] The cog.
[122.06 → 122.16] Sure.
[122.66 → 122.72] Whatever.
[122.72 → 128.56] YouTube has made access to the 4K quality selection in the cog in the player.
[129.16 → 134.64] A premium exclusive feature along with other premium features like background playback,
[135.24 → 139.82] the removal of ads, bundling with YouTube music and such things.
[141.26 → 150.74] This is an unexpected course change if you don't really, if you weren't really ready for
[150.74 → 151.50] it, I think.
[151.50 → 159.00] I mean, considering that YouTube has over time done nothing but add higher resolution,
[159.54 → 161.34] higher quality media support.
[161.48 → 162.32] 360 video.
[162.66 → 163.62] To their paid tier.
[163.76 → 165.38] 8K, HDR.
[166.18 → 173.62] They have never actually hidden or blocked off or paywalled the highest quality experience.
[174.44 → 175.22] Subtitles.
[176.10 → 177.76] No matter what it is.
[177.88 → 178.10] Yeah.
[178.10 → 181.72] It's always been available to everyone.
[181.90 → 183.86] They introduced 4K in 2010.
[184.20 → 186.32] They did 8K in 2015.
[186.70 → 193.14] Which, given the technical challenges around 8K, seven years ago?
[193.34 → 193.50] Yeah.
[194.46 → 196.06] Was kind of wild.
[196.60 → 201.58] Honestly, I am surprised that more people didn't cause problems for them with it.
[201.58 → 207.78] Because you don't need an 8K camera to export an 8K video and take advantage of that extra
[207.78 → 208.20] bit rate.
[208.26 → 211.28] I'm surprised that more people didn't take advantage of it.
[211.42 → 215.16] High refresh rate is another thing that YouTube has added for all users.
[215.16 → 217.76] A lot of this all came at a pretty similar time.
[217.88 → 222.78] It felt like there was almost a video technology kick that YouTube was on.
[223.26 → 225.44] Around when they launched 8K.
[225.54 → 226.58] They launched 360 video.
[226.76 → 230.38] They launched VR support, which is kind of similar to 360 video.
[230.48 → 231.28] It's not exactly the same.
[231.56 → 233.40] They launched all this other type of stuff.
[233.70 → 235.40] They did all of it at a very similar time.
[235.58 → 238.86] And they've continued pushing for it, but not quite as hard as they did in the past.
[238.86 → 240.30] Yeah, but here it is.
[240.98 → 241.46] Confirmed.
[242.08 → 242.64] Witnessed.
[242.66 → 243.96] Out in the real world.
[245.42 → 246.48] 2160p resolution.
[247.02 → 247.88] Premium feature.
[248.06 → 248.74] Look at that.
[249.84 → 250.28] Premium.
[250.50 → 251.28] Tap to upgrade.
[251.28 → 251.94] Tap to upgrade.
[252.08 → 252.88] Right there.
[254.46 → 256.14] What else can we say about it?
[257.34 → 258.14] Excuse me.
[258.60 → 261.80] And this is not just one post.
[262.12 → 264.02] So there have been multiple posts on Reddit.
[264.82 → 268.80] And this is coming right on the heels.
[268.86 → 272.12] Of the extra unskippable ads' controversy.
[272.60 → 276.82] Just last month, which was as little as eight days ago.
[277.08 → 282.36] Some users were experiencing up to 10 unskippable ads in a row.
[282.98 → 284.74] YouTube said this was a small experiment.
[285.78 → 288.92] Everything that I heard about it was off the record.
[289.56 → 293.48] So I can't quote anybody or anything or whatever.
[293.58 → 295.36] I can't tell you how I know any of this.
[295.36 → 301.20] But what I will say is that Google is a very engineering focused company.
[301.82 → 309.50] And engineering, a scientific approach, requires experimentation and evaluation of results.
[309.50 → 315.86] And what I will say is that before you assume that YouTube is just a bunch of dunderheads,
[317.38 → 324.68] everyone that I did or didn't speak to, who knows, allegedly,
[325.36 → 328.42] knew that that was an terrible idea.
[328.64 → 331.08] And that it was not necessary to test that.
[331.08 → 339.28] Just so you guys know, I mean, it's not that I think YouTube does everything right by any stretch of the imagination.
[339.78 → 342.40] But that I think was not.
[342.52 → 346.20] I think that was more of like a policy problem than an actual.
[346.78 → 348.60] We think this is a good idea.
[348.60 → 357.10] I think it's one of those situations where like a bunch of people probably really were very certain that something wouldn't work.
[357.46 → 360.24] And then someone finally was like, no, we have to test it.
[360.38 → 361.82] They tested it, and it worked really well.
[362.58 → 365.34] Or they like just differing from the expected result.
[365.34 → 365.60] Right.
[365.68 → 369.62] And then the person who was right was like, no, now we have to test everything.
[369.62 → 380.02] YouTube has been quoted saying the goal of that experiment was to see if it was a better experience for viewers to reduce the number of ad breaks.
[380.24 → 380.48] Yeah.
[380.92 → 382.78] While, of course, still getting all of that.
[382.86 → 384.02] Yeah, still getting all the ad revenue.
[384.16 → 385.04] And no.
[385.66 → 386.80] The answer was no.
[386.88 → 388.26] That was not a better experience.
[391.26 → 392.38] Which is honestly.
[393.68 → 396.18] I could kind of see it being a better experience sometimes.
[396.62 → 398.00] Yeah, I could see.
[398.00 → 398.72] Especially for music.
[399.62 → 400.02] Yeah.
[400.76 → 401.82] Yeah, I could see that.
[401.88 → 404.58] Having a longer uninterrupted period.
[404.58 → 405.34] Like if you wanted to.
[405.54 → 407.14] I've never actually done this, but I know people do.
[407.72 → 409.36] If you wanted to watch like a concert.
[410.00 → 410.28] Sure.
[410.50 → 413.00] Having that get interrupted by an ad break would be really weird.
[413.40 → 414.52] Yeah, that'd be really disruptive.
[414.76 → 414.94] Yeah.
[415.22 → 415.50] Yep.
[415.66 → 415.92] Yep.
[415.92 → 416.70] I can see that.
[417.78 → 426.28] Making matters even more challenging for web users who are not super into paying for premium and not super into ads.
[426.28 → 433.96] Chrome will be making it more difficult to use ad blocking extensions to rectify any of these problems for yourself.
[433.96 → 437.84] Manifest v3 is the new extension platform for Chrome.
[438.04 → 442.68] And they may start turning off support for v2 as early as January 2023.
[442.88 → 443.82] That's like three months.
[444.18 → 444.92] Three and a half months.
[445.06 → 445.56] Oh, yeah.
[445.56 → 452.12] Most modern ad blockers rely on Chrome's web request API to block categories of HTTP requests.
[452.32 → 452.98] They sure do.
[452.98 → 462.70] But Manifest v3 requires devs to use a declarative net request, which forces them to use a block list of specific URLs.
[462.70 → 465.42] And that list of rules is limited to 30,000 entries.
[465.94 → 471.04] Many ad blocking lists can exceed 300,000 entries to give you guys some idea.
[471.04 → 474.84] Malvertising providers are rejoicing at this.
[475.54 → 476.40] I think...
[476.40 → 481.36] Yeah, I think that's something a lot of people have misunderstood about our previous discussions about ad block.
[481.36 → 496.46] I think that there are a lot of people who saw us make a video about Pinhole and then saw me discuss the impact of ad blocking on online content creators and saw hypocrisy there.
[496.78 → 499.82] But actually, there's no hypocrisy there.
[499.98 → 500.88] There is an impact.
[501.04 → 504.70] And technology like Pinhole does exist and does have valid uses.
[505.50 → 509.82] There's absolutely malicious advertising online.
[510.04 → 513.48] Or rather, not necessarily even advertising at that point.
[513.52 → 514.22] It's just malware.
[514.76 → 516.88] But it uses many of the same delivery mechanisms.
[517.16 → 518.82] Yeah, they sneak through advertising platforms.
[520.26 → 523.04] And so this is...
[524.88 → 525.70] It's interesting.
[525.70 → 533.10] You block origin, I think, but I don't remember, said that they believe strongly that they're going to be able to make it work.
[534.20 → 534.70] But I'm kind of...
[534.70 → 535.50] I mean, they have to say that.
[535.78 → 535.96] Yeah, they do.
[535.96 → 536.70] What else would they say?
[536.86 → 537.06] Yeah.
[537.42 → 537.78] I'm...
[537.78 → 538.36] Sorry, guys.
[538.44 → 539.24] We will...
[539.24 → 540.42] We have no idea.
[540.94 → 541.16] Nope.
[541.28 → 542.26] We're going to toss on the towel.
[542.44 → 542.58] Yeah.
[542.58 → 546.16] I'm hoping that it's a bit of a resurgence for Firefox.
[546.50 → 547.04] That's my...
[547.04 → 548.04] That's my hope.
[548.04 → 549.24] You're a Firefox fanboy.
[549.28 → 550.16] I always forget about that.
[550.24 → 550.42] Yeah.
[550.64 → 551.64] I try to...
[551.64 → 557.04] I often end up not really being able to use it because I...
[557.04 → 558.94] Because it hasn't been very good in a long time.
[558.94 → 560.94] And I have a pretty strong stance of...
[560.94 → 561.08] Yeah.
[561.16 → 565.98] If I'm using this thing for work, it has to be the best thing, even if I don't like it.
[566.10 → 566.26] Yeah.
[566.48 → 573.14] And, like, having interruptions in my work because my browser is having issues when I could just use Chrome is, like, unacceptable.
[573.42 → 577.14] So I've been on Chrome for a while because every time I've tried Firefox, I've had issues.
[577.22 → 578.56] But I know you're not happy about it.
[578.60 → 580.20] But I'm not happy about it.
[580.38 → 581.56] And I'm going to try...
[581.56 → 582.84] He's a nightly boy, you know?
[582.94 → 583.16] Yeah.
[583.26 → 584.22] I used to love that.
[584.42 → 584.74] I know.
[584.84 → 585.14] I know.
[585.14 → 587.28] And I deal with the problems when it was personal stuff.
[587.42 → 587.56] Yeah.
[587.56 → 589.06] But, yeah.
[589.24 → 592.48] So I'm going to try again, probably in January.
[593.50 → 593.90] Firefox.
[594.28 → 594.68] Hear me out.
[594.68 → 594.82] See how it goes.
[595.80 → 596.24] Safari.
[596.82 → 597.06] Oh.
[598.44 → 599.96] People were talking about it in the chat.
[600.06 → 601.08] I'm like, sure.
[601.26 → 602.40] I'll pitch it for you.
[602.68 → 603.64] I'll pitch it.
[604.14 → 605.24] See how it goes.
[605.84 → 610.70] Now, aside from the ad blocking conversation, let's jump back to 4K for a second.
[610.70 → 615.68] One of our discussion questions here is, should 4K be a premium perk?
[615.68 → 618.14] And it says here, most people don't even need it.
[618.22 → 620.20] I think that's a deeper, longer conversation.
[620.34 → 621.88] That's going to happen in the dedicated video.
[621.88 → 622.18] Yeah.
[622.40 → 626.66] But I want to have a separate conversation about Float plane.
[627.48 → 630.62] Our video platform, Floatplane.com.
[631.36 → 632.34] Yeah, I know, right?
[632.82 → 634.12] Officially, Trailblazers.
[634.12 → 639.26] Our video platform actually charges extra, not just a little bit.
[640.02 → 644.88] It works out to, for the platform, more than double for 4K.
[645.44 → 650.02] And the way that that works, it's actually from $5 to $10, which is double.
[650.24 → 654.52] But the way that that works out is that at the lower transaction amount, it's more of
[654.52 → 656.80] it gets eaten up by credit card processing fees and stuff.
[657.02 → 657.46] Hold on.
[657.88 → 660.20] The $5 to $10 jump is your pricing.
[660.82 → 660.94] Yeah.
[661.06 → 662.54] You're just talking about the platform.
[662.88 → 663.56] Oh, sorry.
[663.80 → 664.36] Yes, yes.
[664.36 → 669.40] So the way that it ends up working on the Linus Sec Tips page that is on the platform
[669.40 → 671.10] is a $5 to $10 jump.
[671.32 → 671.50] Yes.
[673.34 → 674.08] It's different.
[674.40 → 674.98] Oh, okay.
[674.98 → 678.16] So anyway, the point is, for you, the end user.
[678.26 → 679.62] Because creators can set their own pricing.
[679.82 → 680.06] But anyway.
[680.28 → 680.76] It's double.
[681.10 → 685.12] But the way that it actually works out is that it is more than double.
[685.54 → 692.16] And the reason for that is that the additional cost of serving 4K is a lot more than I think
[692.16 → 694.22] people necessarily realize.
[695.06 → 699.08] And like bandwidth is hyper expensive and also very difficult.
[699.34 → 701.48] So let's talk a little bit about that.
[701.48 → 707.24] Because I tweeted about sort of my hot take about this whole thing that I think YouTube
[707.24 → 714.20] is actually not only maybe justified in doing this, but that it also could be the right move
[714.20 → 718.22] for the platform in general, like for the entire ecosystem.
[718.84 → 720.50] So I tweeted about this hot take.
[720.50 → 733.96] And I had some people who I feel like have maybe not the full picture of how this works.
[734.10 → 737.68] Because like, to be clear, I understand being upset about it.
[737.98 → 744.48] Like, obviously, I hate when you tell me I, you know, have something, and you take it away.
[744.54 → 747.70] Like, I'm always reminded of that scene from Empire Strikes Back.
[747.70 → 749.70] Like, I'm altering the deal.
[750.00 → 751.48] Pray I don't alter it any further.
[751.64 → 751.72] Right?
[751.80 → 754.32] Like, that's so iconic.
[754.64 → 761.24] Because we're in this position where whether you're an individual end user, whether you are a creator,
[761.72 → 763.82] where Google holds all the power.
[764.16 → 771.60] If they decided tomorrow that not only was, did they not feel like serving 4K video to,
[771.70 → 775.08] you know, non-paying customers anymore, but they were going to remove it from the platform
[775.08 → 775.58] outright.
[775.88 → 783.38] And, oh, by the way, that, you know, semi-archive of content that you've uploaded over the last
[783.38 → 787.64] 12 years, we're just going to, we're going to get rid of all the high quality copies of
[787.64 → 787.86] everything.
[787.94 → 788.52] We're going to prune it all.
[788.70 → 791.68] They could decide that tomorrow on a whim.
[792.02 → 792.56] They could.
[793.16 → 794.52] And we're utterly powerless.
[794.82 → 795.80] And that's frustrating.
[796.30 → 797.56] And that sucks.
[797.56 → 801.66] Where was I going with this?
[801.74 → 802.36] I don't remember.
[803.66 → 803.78] Right.
[803.92 → 804.60] But I, but, right.
[804.74 → 809.30] So I, so I, but I, but I, so I made that, anyway, I made that argument that, right, but
[809.30 → 810.86] it could actually be the best thing.
[810.90 → 812.42] And you'll have to, you'll have to hear me out.
[812.68 → 812.94] Really.
[813.34 → 814.06] Please hear me out.
[815.38 → 821.22] But one of the some of the responses that I got from people who, who were upset about
[821.22 → 824.48] it, I feel like we need to kind of talk about those things.
[824.48 → 831.50] So one person that I went back and forth with had said, well, you know, they, what do you
[831.50 → 832.68] mean bandwidth costs?
[833.12 → 833.34] Right.
[833.40 → 836.22] They laid that coax cable 30 years ago.
[836.24 → 837.36] Oh, that's not how that works.
[837.38 → 837.58] Right.
[838.22 → 838.54] Okay.
[838.60 → 841.16] So explain how that works for the people.
[841.16 → 846.46] Google doesn't own all the, uh, you know, cables that go around the entire internet.
[846.60 → 849.00] All the also all that stuff takes maintenance and whatnot.
[849.18 → 854.46] So like if Google wants to send you data, it's going to have to go over ISS.
[854.48 → 856.34] P's lines and stuff like that.
[856.40 → 858.64] They have to, you have to pay for bandwidth at some point.
[858.88 → 865.62] Google did spin up their own ISP, uh, in the States, which probably gives them some,
[865.68 → 868.08] some, uh, cool abilities to do different things.
[868.08 → 870.18] They're on a certain scale that I don't fully understand.
[870.18 → 874.90] Like once you have date, your own data centres and stuff like an OVH has their own dark fibre
[874.90 → 879.32] lines running all over the place and all this neat things like that stuff is beyond my scale
[879.32 → 879.92] of understanding.
[880.28 → 880.38] Sure.
[880.38 → 885.20] But bandwidth is highly expensive, and you have to deal with a lot of other entities.
[885.34 → 886.44] I was going to say people, but entities.
[886.44 → 889.72] Talk about some of the other entities that we've had to deal with in order to maintain
[889.72 → 891.14] quality of service for users.
[891.68 → 896.50] Uh, one of the problems that we have right now, I'm going to call out a country specifically
[896.50 → 897.84] that we're actually having problems with.
[897.90 → 902.30] So sorry if you're having this problem, but in Germany, uh, there are multiple ISPs, right?
[902.30 → 909.26] And the, the pathways that we're using work great for some users in Germany, and it works
[909.26 → 911.56] really poorly for other users in Germany.
[911.96 → 913.94] We have perfect service in Germany.
[914.04 → 914.46] Right.
[914.62 → 916.76] We also have not perfect service in Germany.
[917.32 → 917.80] Right.
[917.98 → 920.94] It's not a cut and dry thing.
[921.04 → 925.02] And when you get on this scale, like there are stories that I actually talked about on Sancho
[925.02 → 930.56] in the past of, of Netflix back in the day, installing these red box Netflix servers
[930.56 → 937.22] in ISPs, like data centres and in ISPs nodes and stuff, because such a huge percentage of
[937.22 → 939.00] internet usage in these areas was all Netflix.
[939.16 → 942.00] And they were actually helping the ISPs by doing this.
[942.00 → 946.36] Like the ISPs wanted these things installed, uh, because it was getting it closer to the
[946.36 → 946.64] users.
[946.64 → 948.86] It was using less of the ISPs available bandwidth.
[948.86 → 950.44] It was helping them in general.
[950.94 → 955.40] Um, now you think about the usage of YouTube and all the rest of Google stuff.
[955.56 → 957.92] Um, and it gets very complicated and very expensive.
[957.92 → 966.62] And the impossibility of trying to cache any, any, I mean, you could take, you just scatter
[966.62 → 967.16] shot it.
[967.26 → 967.40] Right.
[967.50 → 967.70] Yeah.
[967.70 → 972.96] You could just hope that you've got something cached close to the, to the, to the end user.
[972.96 → 978.48] But like, uh, that, that, that's a just dice rolls.
[978.48 → 978.74] Right.
[978.82 → 979.44] At that point.
[979.52 → 979.90] Pretty much.
[979.90 → 983.18] And like really advanced caching systems are great and stuff like that, but like, it's
[983.18 → 987.64] all highly complicated, highly difficult and very highly expensive.
[988.86 → 996.42] Um, and there was also, uh, like, like, uh, I, I feel like, um, uh, this perception, right.
[996.60 → 1004.58] That once the once those lines though are laid, that they're the ongoing cost is, is, is
[1004.58 → 1006.76] negligible or, or, or very low.
[1007.12 → 1012.48] And, uh, this, this individual pointed out that, well, you know, that those coax lines
[1012.48 → 1018.40] keep getting faster and there's no additional cost, but it's actually the, the, the getting
[1018.40 → 1024.16] faster, even though you might be running over the same pieces of copper or even the same
[1024.16 → 1029.50] pieces of fibre, the way they get faster is through ongoing maintenance.
[1029.50 → 1029.78] Yeah.
[1030.02 → 1035.96] And network upgrades and R and D and everything else that continually get more and more and
[1035.96 → 1042.24] more and more expensive because the bottom line is that Moore's law might not be dead,
[1042.98 → 1045.82] but, uh, Moore's a little bit more difficult to keep up with.
[1045.98 → 1046.40] Dr.
[1046.50 → 1051.42] Moore is struggling a little bit, you know, it's, it's, it's not, Moore's law is not keeping
[1051.42 → 1053.18] up the way that it has.
[1053.50 → 1058.94] And even if you were to compare to something like electrical or water infrastructure, for example,
[1058.94 → 1064.92] just because those pipes are in the ground, that doesn't mean that they stop needing maintenance.
[1065.78 → 1069.62] That doesn't mean, you know, you don't still have to make sure there's clean water going
[1069.62 → 1070.10] through them.
[1070.40 → 1071.04] You know what I mean?
[1071.48 → 1078.22] Um, infrastructure that, that exists must be maintained and upgraded.
[1078.84 → 1080.52] Yeah, absolutely.
[1080.76 → 1080.94] Yeah.
[1080.94 → 1082.16] There are tons of costs to it.
[1082.48 → 1086.66] Um, and, and something that you go over in the video as well, but like there's, I'm seeing
[1086.66 → 1087.58] comments about it.
[1087.82 → 1091.22] I'm seeing notes about all this kind of stuff like, oh, we shouldn't feel bad for
[1091.22 → 1092.38] billion dollar companies.
[1092.48 → 1095.84] I'm the first person to jump on that train and I don't feel bad for them.
[1095.90 → 1097.06] No, why would I feel bad for them?
[1097.06 → 1098.98] Um, none of this is feeling bad for them.
[1099.18 → 1103.26] A lot of this is understanding, um, and not understanding me like, oh, it's okay.
[1103.36 → 1103.68] It's okay.
[1103.82 → 1111.24] No, it's, it's the classic thing of a web company that is valued purely on scale.
[1111.24 → 1117.30] And then when scaling becomes difficult or your costs start ramping to a certain degree,
[1117.30 → 1118.80] you need to start making money.
[1118.94 → 1123.78] And often how they start doing that is ugly.
[1124.42 → 1129.88] Um, and when he says need to start making money, I don't think either Luke or I would
[1129.88 → 1133.48] make the argument that Google does not make enough money.
[1133.68 → 1134.30] No, no, no, no, no.
[1134.30 → 1141.70] But they do need to make money because if they don't make money on a given project, they're
[1141.70 → 1145.14] going to do Google things, and they're going to shut it down.
[1145.14 → 1145.66] Yeah.
[1147.18 → 1151.76] So, so yeah, it's, they're, they're going to make it make more money.
[1152.06 → 1154.10] Um, and 4k is really expensive.
[1154.10 → 1155.26] Like we've already talked about.
[1155.52 → 1164.10] Um, and they have done actually a lot of research figuring out that almost no one actually cares.
[1164.30 → 1167.26] Um, which is potentially an uncomfortable thing to hear.
[1167.42 → 1169.42] Uh, it's something that float plane ran into.
[1169.98 → 1174.62] Um, we, we had a bunch of conversations with users and with creators.
[1175.04 → 1179.14] Um, one of the original ideas of float plane was like, Hey, we're going to offer better
[1179.14 → 1179.98] quality everything.
[1180.12 → 1182.52] And that's going to be a huge selling point to the platform.
[1182.56 → 1185.88] People are going to want to join because their content will have never looked or sounded
[1185.88 → 1186.90] as good online.
[1187.30 → 1190.76] Um, and users are going to want to subscribe because they can see their creator's content
[1190.76 → 1193.52] and in higher quality, and they can hear it in higher quality.
[1193.52 → 1195.00] Which makes a big difference.
[1195.18 → 1196.50] Man, audio matters.
[1196.66 → 1197.52] Oh, it super does.
[1198.04 → 1200.44] Um, your, your video can look as good as you want.
[1200.48 → 1201.94] If your audio sucks, no one's going to watch it.
[1202.04 → 1203.10] Did anyone care ever?
[1203.72 → 1204.50] Like even once?
[1204.80 → 1205.10] Nope.
[1205.92 → 1206.70] We have, actually.
[1206.84 → 1207.50] That's not true.
[1207.62 → 1208.88] We have one person who cares.
[1209.00 → 1209.36] Garbage time.
[1209.38 → 1209.92] Garbage time.
[1210.32 → 1212.06] Garbage time cares that it sounds good.
[1212.36 → 1213.30] And that's great.
[1214.32 → 1215.12] That's awesome.
[1215.46 → 1221.40] I love and appreciate that because boy, howdy, did we put some work into it, and it really didn't
[1221.40 → 1221.90] pay off?
[1222.82 → 1223.84] Hey, it is now.
[1224.08 → 1224.50] It is.
[1224.54 → 1224.70] Yeah.
[1224.78 → 1225.12] It is.
[1225.12 → 1225.68] It is now.
[1226.06 → 1230.52] Um, I mean, from like a purely like dollars and cents standpoint, I don't think it's paying
[1230.52 → 1233.84] off, but it's, but at least we get to feel warm and fuzzy about it.
[1233.92 → 1234.08] Yeah.
[1234.08 → 1234.98] We've stuck to our guns.
[1235.06 → 1236.22] It still looks and sounds good.
[1236.40 → 1238.50] Um, and there's people, each other is like, Oh, I care.
[1238.50 → 1239.26] And you know what?
[1239.30 → 1244.36] You might, you might be, if I remember correctly from the video, uh, that I am probably going
[1244.36 → 1244.84] to misquote.
[1244.94 → 1245.42] So I'm sorry.
[1245.56 → 1247.34] You might be the what was it?
[1247.42 → 1251.86] 1.5% of people who actually care.
[1252.02 → 1255.10] It's such a tiny percentage of people.
[1255.46 → 1260.32] YouTube ran some experiments where they started just changing people's settings, and they would
[1260.32 → 1261.86] set them to way lower.
[1262.18 → 1262.36] Yeah.
[1262.36 → 1263.36] Like 480, I think.
[1263.76 → 1264.02] Yeah.
[1264.14 → 1266.46] People that were running at 4k, they changed it to 480.
[1266.46 → 1268.76] And it was like, so I'm going to misquote the percentage.
[1269.00 → 1269.34] I'm sorry.
[1269.48 → 1270.02] I don't remember.
[1270.30 → 1273.38] I think it was like 1.5% of people actually changed it back.
[1274.66 → 1281.82] So you wonder, you wonder why the, uh, there's no persistent default video quality anymore and
[1281.82 → 1284.44] why they default to such a low video quality.
[1284.56 → 1291.22] It's because you are a discerning individual and notice the difference.
[1291.36 → 1294.42] And I can certainly tell the difference.
[1294.42 → 1296.10] Like I, I get it.
[1296.46 → 1297.18] I'm with you.
[1297.96 → 1302.40] But my aunt, there is no way.
[1302.60 → 1304.52] My sister, love her to pieces.
[1304.86 → 1305.48] Bless her heart.
[1306.10 → 1310.60] She wouldn't be able to tell a 480p YouTube video from a 1080p YouTube video.
[1310.98 → 1313.10] Maybe not even from a 4k YouTube video.
[1313.20 → 1315.84] She's just, she doesn't care.
[1316.10 → 1317.14] It doesn't matter.
[1317.52 → 1321.90] I'm actually, I'm actually pretty proud, proud of that whole stat because I'm rather certain
[1321.90 → 1322.58] it happened to me.
[1322.62 → 1328.04] And I noticed because I was like getting really annoyed that YouTube kept on looking like
[1328.04 → 1328.34] junk.
[1328.64 → 1329.00] Yeah.
[1329.00 → 1330.54] And I'm used to watching on float plane.
[1330.66 → 1331.56] So I could tell.
[1331.96 → 1335.20] Um, so I kept changing it back up, and I was like, what is going on?
[1335.20 → 1337.10] And I remembered that there used to be the default setting.
[1337.10 → 1338.64] So I was like hunting for it and I couldn't find it.
[1338.66 → 1339.44] It was like, something's wrong.
[1339.44 → 1344.22] Um, I'm pretty sure I don't know at all, but I'm pretty sure you can teach it.
[1344.60 → 1345.70] I think you can teach it.
[1346.00 → 1346.52] I think so.
[1346.72 → 1350.44] I think if you keep forcing it to go up, it'll naturally slowly increase.
[1350.70 → 1352.42] I'm pretty sure mine defaults to 4k.
[1352.60 → 1352.86] Yeah.
[1353.16 → 1353.42] Yeah.
[1353.62 → 1355.28] I've noticed that behaviour.
[1355.68 → 1359.20] So if you actually care, maybe do it.
[1359.50 → 1365.70] Um, you know, what's annoying to me is that I'm probably going to end up with a ton of YouTube
[1365.70 → 1372.02] premium subscriptions now because all the different, depending on which profile I'm logged into
[1372.02 → 1376.40] while I'm, cause a lot of the time I'm not necessarily using YouTube for leisure.
[1376.58 → 1378.68] I'm actually using it for work.
[1378.76 → 1382.66] I'm, I'm checking a video, or I'm finding a timestamp so I can send it to an editor or
[1382.66 → 1384.02] whatever else it is I'm doing.
[1384.36 → 1390.34] And I've complained about this to YouTube many times, but something about the way that the
[1390.34 → 1395.68] sessions are handled makes it so that when you click out of creator studio onto a video
[1395.70 → 1397.24] you get served an ad.
[1397.48 → 1404.82] I kid you not 100% of the time, like every single time I get an ad while I'm working,
[1405.12 → 1411.42] trying to watch my, like get something out of my own video, which as far as I know, wasn't
[1411.42 → 1415.00] that against Google's terms of service at some point clicking your own ads?
[1415.18 → 1420.08] I think it always has been like you would think logged into my own account.
[1420.08 → 1428.82] I would not get an ad on my own video because clearly, clearly that is self-dealing clearly.
[1429.04 → 1429.24] Right.
[1429.88 → 1434.12] And it's, this isn't me just saying, oh, well there should be different rules for me and
[1434.12 → 1434.78] for other people.
[1434.78 → 1441.18] I'm saying from a common sense standpoint, you shouldn't pay me whatever it is, 35 or 45%
[1441.18 → 1444.74] or whatever of my own ad consumption.
[1445.62 → 1446.06] Duh.
[1446.28 → 1446.54] Right.
[1447.46 → 1448.14] But it does.
[1448.24 → 1455.08] Something that annoys the crap out of me is I use the different like, uh, uh, Google profile
[1455.08 → 1456.26] things for my browser.
[1456.42 → 1456.72] Yes.
[1456.88 → 1457.90] So I have like a work one.
[1457.96 → 1458.64] I have a personal one.
[1458.70 → 1459.88] I have other various work ones.
[1459.96 → 1461.56] Get ready to get premium for all of them.
[1461.56 → 1465.84] Because otherwise you're going to have ads everywhere, and you're not going to be able
[1465.84 → 1466.60] to watch 4k.
[1466.74 → 1467.04] Yeah.
[1467.56 → 1471.94] So like I have premium on my personal one, but in the relatively rare occasion that I
[1471.94 → 1475.06] open YouTube on my work one, it splashes me with an ad right away.
[1475.06 → 1478.90] And then I have to throw the video that I wanted to watch for work into my personal YouTube,
[1479.00 → 1480.68] which means that it gets lost from the history.
[1480.80 → 1482.78] And when I need to find it later, it's annoying.
[1483.00 → 1489.34] I'm just like, man, if I'm actively signed in to one premium account on this computer, like
[1489.34 → 1491.64] I'm, it's not like I'm sharing it with other devices.
[1491.88 → 1494.52] It would be nice if it made it so that it wouldn't serve ads on all of them.
[1494.66 → 1496.16] Riddle me this.
[1497.48 → 1498.30] Where's your line?
[1499.46 → 1504.88] If YouTube said, no, 1440p and up, uh, that's premium now.
[1505.38 → 1508.30] What if they said 1080p and up is premium?
[1508.68 → 1511.04] 720 is all, is more than anyone should need.
[1511.64 → 1517.36] Where's your, where's the line where you kind of go from, okay, I could kind of understand
[1517.36 → 1522.76] this from an infrastructure cost scaling standpoint to, no, this is bulls**t.
[1522.94 → 1524.54] I won't take it anymore.
[1525.08 → 1529.56] And like, you know, tell me, walk me through your reaction at each stage.
[1529.60 → 1531.14] So we've already got your 4k reaction.
[1531.40 → 1531.60] Yeah.
[1532.08 → 1534.02] Let's say they cut off 1440p.
[1534.18 → 1536.78] That's, that's also very reasonable in my opinion.
[1536.90 → 1537.28] In your opinion.
[1537.38 → 1537.62] Okay.
[1537.74 → 1537.98] Okay.
[1538.34 → 1543.92] I mean, 1440p is not nearly the increase in data rate that 4k is.
[1544.00 → 1545.54] It's, I think it's about double 1080p.
[1545.54 → 1549.66] If I recall correctly, that's 2560 by 1440.
[1549.74 → 1552.44] 1080p is two megapixels is.
[1554.24 → 1554.64] Yeah.
[1554.70 → 1555.44] I think it's about four.
[1555.64 → 1557.92] It's like four and change or something like that or close to four.
[1558.08 → 1562.34] So it's about double, but it's not 4x, which is, you know, good.
[1562.68 → 1562.86] Yeah.
[1562.98 → 1567.92] I still think that's in a premium tier of resolutions though, if I could say that.
[1568.04 → 1571.08] But YouTube's 1080p looks like dog crap.
[1571.20 → 1571.64] It does.
[1571.98 → 1573.66] So 1440p.
[1573.66 → 1575.04] But it's also a free platform.
[1576.84 → 1579.04] Is it free if you pay in your time?
[1579.12 → 1580.02] If you pay in your time with ads.
[1580.04 → 1581.28] So it's only sort of free, right?
[1581.34 → 1584.92] Like there's, to be clear, I'm playing devil's advocate a little bit here.
[1585.00 → 1587.26] I don't necessarily disagree with Luke.
[1587.48 → 1590.86] It's free in the sense that it is broadly available.
[1591.20 → 1591.76] Monetary exchange.
[1591.76 → 1592.32] Exactly.
[1592.70 → 1594.76] You don't need to own a credit card to use it.
[1594.82 → 1596.60] You don't need to be an adult to use it.
[1596.64 → 1601.46] You can be anyone, anywhere in the world as long as you don't have an oppressive government that blocks access to it or whatever.
[1601.72 → 1609.84] And you can benefit from the wealth of creation and knowledge that is on YouTube, which is great.
[1609.84 → 1611.04] It's amazing, right?
[1612.72 → 1614.04] But it's not free.
[1614.52 → 1617.52] There's an interesting comment in Flow plane.
[1617.52 → 1620.28] A lot of people are saying 1080p is their line.
[1620.66 → 1625.54] And I see one person who said 1080p should be free because competition said so.
[1625.78 → 1627.72] So here's where I'm going to throw a bit of a monkey wrench in things.
[1627.72 → 1627.84] What competition?
[1628.92 → 1629.48] Exactly.
[1630.08 → 1633.60] So this is where my line is actually a lot lower.
[1633.60 → 1641.94] Because ultimately, I'm going to end up continuing to use it because there's content on YouTube that I cannot access elsewhere.
[1642.24 → 1645.82] Including, I've seen an example from you about like fixing a washing machine.
[1646.20 → 1650.34] I fairly recently had to fix my dryer, my clothes dryer.
[1650.44 → 1650.94] There you go.
[1651.14 → 1653.60] How was I going to do that without YouTube?
[1653.88 → 1654.14] You weren't.
[1654.14 → 1655.48] To be completely honest, I wasn't.
[1655.48 → 1660.74] You were going to pay someone like $400 to come and replace some stupid little $20 part.
[1661.02 → 1661.22] Yeah.
[1661.60 → 1662.54] That's what you would do.
[1662.54 → 1668.02] The coin collection thing was like jammed.
[1668.18 → 1669.98] And in a lot of them, you can access it from the front.
[1670.08 → 1672.22] In mine, you have to take the entire thing apart.
[1672.60 → 1673.50] It's a huge pain.
[1674.84 → 1678.78] And there was like the manual that you could read.
[1678.96 → 1682.58] And I was like, wow, I'm going to break this for sure.
[1682.78 → 1689.44] Or there's the YouTube video of the dude just being like, all right, so scroll these things, toss it over there.
[1689.56 → 1690.22] Watch out for this.
[1690.52 → 1690.82] Yeah.
[1690.82 → 1690.90] Yeah.
[1691.14 → 1696.96] And it's like, okay, five to 10 minutes later, I kind of know what to do, and I can replay this a million times and it's fine.
[1696.96 → 1704.18] And I would have watched that in very low resolution with ads on it because it's that or nothing.
[1705.22 → 1706.42] Luke wants a laundromat?
[1706.72 → 1707.16] No.
[1707.16 → 1711.34] I think you meant lint collector or coin collector?
[1711.58 → 1713.34] It's called a coin collector on mine.
[1713.70 → 1714.16] Oh, okay.
[1714.30 → 1717.78] I don't know if it has like an actual name on mine.
[1717.86 → 1718.90] It's called a coin collector.
[1719.04 → 1719.44] I don't know.
[1720.88 → 1721.24] Cool.
[1721.24 → 1724.28] Oh, I see what people are saying for coin.
[1724.36 → 1733.88] No, it's like when it's in the wash, like little bits of things would get like ejected, but it doesn't want to go down the water pipe.
[1734.30 → 1734.70] Oh.
[1734.70 → 1738.04] So it's like a mesh filter that collects like things.
[1738.16 → 1740.60] I have never cleaned that on mine.
[1741.00 → 1741.92] Did you say it was your dryer?
[1742.20 → 1743.16] Why does it have water in it?
[1743.52 → 1743.90] Is it water?
[1743.96 → 1744.72] Maybe it was the washer.
[1744.96 → 1745.94] It's been a while since I did it.
[1745.94 → 1746.72] Okay, fair enough.
[1748.00 → 1749.96] Do you put water in your dryer?
[1749.96 → 1752.96] Because it probably takes a long time to...
[1752.96 → 1754.26] I think you're using this wrong.
[1754.52 → 1755.02] A long time.
[1755.34 → 1756.60] Yeah, that's probably why it broke.
[1759.72 → 1760.68] Yeah, no, sorry.
[1760.74 → 1762.34] It's been like quite a bit.
[1762.38 → 1763.04] So where's your line?
[1763.34 → 1763.74] 720p?
[1766.06 → 1772.70] See, this is where it gets complicated because even if it was 480, there are use cases where I would still use it.
[1772.98 → 1778.64] Right, but what if you were trying to follow a tutorial, like a software tutorial at 480p, and you can't read the bloody text?
[1778.64 → 1781.44] But not everything that I would do is watching a software tutorial.
[1781.88 → 1791.44] I'm also trying to devil's advocate a little bit, but not too much because with the dryer example, I could have, or whatever it was, the thing.
[1792.00 → 1793.56] Turns out it was a waffle iron.
[1795.60 → 1798.36] With the clothes do to things machine that I have.
[1798.46 → 1798.86] With an oven.
[1801.62 → 1804.08] I would have watched that in 480.
[1804.26 → 1807.76] I don't know if it would have been like functional to watch below 480.
[1807.98 → 1808.24] Sure.
[1808.64 → 1816.18] But like, if it's a free thing, if when it starts playing an ad, I can just put my phone down and start grabbing my tools or whatever.
[1816.34 → 1819.64] And when it's done playing an ad, I can start trying to follow the tutorial.
[1820.00 → 1824.72] I'm going to still use the service because there's nothing else out there like it.
[1825.08 → 1826.34] What is it even called?
[1826.44 → 1827.16] Daily motion?
[1827.34 → 1828.66] That's not a realistic competitor.
[1828.82 → 1829.30] Yeah, get real.
[1829.70 → 1829.92] Yeah.
[1829.92 → 1836.46] Vimeo has gone far down the we are just a paid platform route.
[1836.46 → 1839.18] Yeah, because it makes sense because it's really expensive to serve video.
[1839.52 → 1845.12] So like, I would love to be like, 10 ATP is my line because below that it kind of sucks.
[1845.42 → 1847.80] But no, I'm going to keep using the platform if it's lower than that.
[1848.18 → 1850.16] Ultimately, I've already subscribed to premium.
[1850.16 → 1852.04] So this problem doesn't really affect me.
[1852.16 → 1854.34] But I think that's true for a lot of people.
[1854.34 → 1856.42] Transit Biker on Twitch says,
[1856.42 → 1872.82] I mean, that's what, you know, your free market is supposed to alleviate.
[1873.20 → 1876.90] It's supposed to create competition that drives pricing down.
[1877.28 → 1883.62] The issue here is that YouTube is in a position where they can essentially do whatever they want.
[1883.62 → 1883.82] Yeah.
[1884.38 → 1886.10] Because there isn't any competition.
[1886.10 → 1888.72] That's my whole argument for lowering the bar.
[1888.88 → 1895.84] And the reason that there isn't any competition is that nobody can make this cost-effective.
[1896.10 → 1896.28] No.
[1896.86 → 1905.10] And like, we have actually done a lot more work on that than almost anyone else.
[1905.78 → 1909.60] Like, for real, not me, like him and the float plane team.
[1909.66 → 1909.84] Yeah, yeah.
[1910.94 → 1913.58] You're the CEO of the company wearing the shirt.
[1913.58 → 1915.64] And so, hey, yeah, it's my float plane shirt.
[1915.70 → 1915.82] Yeah.
[1916.10 → 1918.24] And it's tough.
[1918.38 → 1919.78] I don't have a good answer for you.
[1920.22 → 1920.48] Yeah.
[1920.98 → 1921.82] That sucks.
[1922.20 → 1923.18] I mean, honestly, honestly.
[1923.18 → 1923.66] It does suck.
[1923.78 → 1940.72] Should there be, maybe this is a separate conversation, but should there be a similar price break for services like YouTube Premium or Netflix or Steam games for low-income people who live in high-income countries?
[1940.72 → 1941.40] Right?
[1941.40 → 1944.70] Like, so YouTube Premium is like two bucks in some countries.
[1944.94 → 1947.44] Like two, three American dollars a month.
[1947.44 → 1949.16] In America, it's over 10.
[1949.16 → 1950.22] It's over 10.
[1950.22 → 1956.54] But there are people living in North America who are on such low incomes.
[1957.96 → 1958.48] Yeah.
[1958.48 → 1959.90] I forget how much it is.
[1960.12 → 1961.28] $12 or $13 or whatever else.
[1961.28 → 1963.16] Or like whatever it is in the U.S.
[1963.16 → 1963.52] I'm sorry.
[1963.94 → 1965.60] I'm Canadian and I have a family plan.
[1965.66 → 1967.30] So I actually do not know the exact amount.
[1967.56 → 1969.90] This is not me not knowing how much a banana costs.
[1970.08 → 1971.76] I just don't know because I'm Canadian.
[1971.94 → 1972.12] Okay.
[1972.12 → 1981.90] But the point is that there are people for whom even that $2 or $3 could be a stretch, let alone being something that is comfortable for them.
[1982.38 → 1984.00] So how do we solve that, right?
[1984.06 → 1992.02] Because theoretically, you know, theoretically, we have different prices in these different geopolitical regions.
[1992.02 → 1998.62] But in practice, these are extremely coarse and in many cases kind of arbitrary lines.
[1998.62 → 2004.88] I've mentioned this in the past, and it's hyper unpopular, and I'm going to win no fans right now.
[2005.78 → 2007.12] I've mentioned it on WAN Show.
[2007.12 → 2007.26] I'll defend you.
[2007.36 → 2008.68] I'll defend your hot takes.
[2008.80 → 2009.18] We're playing.
[2009.30 → 2010.30] We're doing some role reversal.
[2010.54 → 2010.68] Yeah.
[2010.74 → 2010.90] Yeah.
[2011.14 → 2015.32] And I know it's like not okay to be completely clear.
[2015.50 → 2015.78] All right.
[2015.78 → 2023.40] I think the only solution is government ran, which is so not okay for a totally different giant ball of wax.
[2023.66 → 2024.04] Okay.
[2024.46 → 2024.98] So.
[2027.16 → 2027.64] Maybe.
[2028.16 → 2028.60] Hold on.
[2028.62 → 2036.68] You legislate the availability of 4K YouTube.
[2037.38 → 2039.74] Like all the premium ness, whatever.
[2040.02 → 2040.90] 4K is a human, right?
[2041.02 → 2041.94] Yeah, I don't know about 4K.
[2041.94 → 2042.28] Hold on.
[2042.66 → 2043.08] No, no, no.
[2043.08 → 2043.56] For real, though.
[2043.62 → 2044.06] For real, though.
[2044.12 → 2044.44] Hold on.
[2044.62 → 2044.74] Okay.
[2044.74 → 2045.92] So full quality.
[2046.12 → 2046.66] No ads.
[2047.00 → 2049.14] 4K in public libraries.
[2050.12 → 2051.62] Oh, that's sweet.
[2051.62 → 2055.52] So that way you can allow free market capitalism.
[2055.52 → 2061.28] And if people want to have their private access to their high quality YouTube, they can pay.
[2061.64 → 2068.74] But that would make it available to everyone in the same way that you can buy books, and you can maintain a personal library.
[2068.74 → 2073.30] Or you can go to the public library, and you can access them there.
[2073.30 → 2078.74] Now, to be clear, not every community has proper functioning community infrastructure like public libraries.
[2079.48 → 2080.60] Especially not anymore.
[2080.84 → 2083.30] Now that books are out of fashion and stuff.
[2083.32 → 2084.20] Public libraries are changing.
[2084.32 → 2085.12] Let me talk about that in a second.
[2085.22 → 2085.24] Sure.
[2085.24 → 2086.52] I need to defend my thing.
[2086.76 → 2088.22] There's one of people who are like, that's a horrible idea.
[2088.42 → 2088.92] I know.
[2089.08 → 2091.38] That's why I prefaced it by saying it's a horrible idea.
[2091.38 → 2101.76] My reason for saying that is because a lot of non-economically viable things basically have to go to governments if you want them to be maintained.
[2101.92 → 2105.94] Because businesses are going to go, hey, this isn't economically viable.
[2106.06 → 2107.10] And they're going to stop doing it.
[2107.24 → 2107.42] Yeah.
[2107.66 → 2109.76] So that's why I say that.
[2109.82 → 2110.92] Not because I want that.
[2111.02 → 2112.28] I think it's a horrible idea.
[2112.60 → 2114.94] There are tons of massive problems with it.
[2115.00 → 2116.06] It is not cool.
[2116.62 → 2117.28] But okay.
[2117.40 → 2118.08] Public libraries.
[2118.16 → 2118.84] I want to talk about that.
[2118.84 → 2120.64] Public libraries have changed a bunch.
[2121.38 → 2124.78] There are local public libraries that have tools.
[2125.00 → 2125.78] Have you heard about this?
[2126.04 → 2126.44] No.
[2127.00 → 2128.54] That is so cool.
[2128.68 → 2131.20] You can go sign out a tool.
[2131.82 → 2133.38] So that you can like.
[2133.46 → 2135.00] Go home and work on things.
[2135.18 → 2135.28] Do maintenance or whatever.
[2135.28 → 2135.76] Do maintenance.
[2136.44 → 2137.94] Public libraries are becoming.
[2139.10 → 2144.06] They're continuing to be in the spirit of what they always were.
[2144.16 → 2147.62] Which is communal resources that we all share.
[2148.58 → 2148.82] Yeah.
[2148.82 → 2149.96] As an option.
[2150.34 → 2152.50] You can absolutely buy your own tools.
[2152.50 → 2153.16] Or books.
[2153.40 → 2153.82] Or books.
[2154.04 → 2154.64] Or high speed.
[2154.64 → 2155.02] Or games.
[2155.26 → 2155.78] Or movies.
[2155.78 → 2156.44] Or whatever.
[2156.66 → 2156.90] Sure.
[2156.90 → 2158.60] Now there's a bunch of them that have.
[2159.22 → 2161.06] They're actually technically pirated.
[2161.22 → 2163.70] But because of laws around public libraries.
[2163.70 → 2166.24] They were pirated in a completely legal way.
[2166.24 → 2168.16] But there are certain libraries.
[2168.26 → 2169.32] I know of this in the states.
[2169.64 → 2170.88] I don't know of this in Canada.
[2171.08 → 2174.34] There are certain libraries in the states that have just straight up pirated games.
[2174.54 → 2176.68] And you can go sign them out.
[2176.88 → 2177.60] Take them home.
[2178.18 → 2180.54] And play the pirated game completely legally.
[2180.74 → 2181.74] As long as you like.
[2182.26 → 2183.52] Also return it.
[2183.80 → 2184.52] To the library.
[2184.52 → 2184.82] How you're supposed to.
[2184.96 → 2185.70] To the library.
[2186.08 → 2187.36] Everything is above board.
[2187.48 → 2190.24] Because of laws around libraries specifically.
[2190.60 → 2191.56] Libraries are adapting.
[2191.68 → 2192.38] It's very cool.
[2192.70 → 2193.94] I wish I knew more about it.
[2193.94 → 2196.24] I didn't expect we were going to talk about libraries on the wine show.
[2196.40 → 2199.90] Ninja Star and Float plane Chat is talking about some libraries having 3D printers.
[2200.10 → 2200.26] Yeah.
[2200.64 → 2200.98] Yes.
[2201.06 → 2201.88] That's super cool.
[2202.06 → 2202.08] Yeah.
[2202.08 → 2202.86] I forgot about that.
[2202.90 → 2203.86] But that's totally a thing.
[2204.12 → 2204.28] Yeah.
[2204.66 → 2207.80] They're turning into like sort of maker spaces.
[2208.04 → 2213.14] That's a way that you could have a relatively low impact on Google's ability to run YouTube
[2213.14 → 2214.46] as a profitable business.
[2214.80 → 2221.36] While also making a real like tangible effort.
[2221.36 → 2224.92] to make this amazing resource that YouTube is.
[2224.98 → 2226.84] I think we need in all of this.
[2226.94 → 2228.28] We need to not lose track of that.
[2229.10 → 2230.56] YouTube is unprecedented.
[2231.18 → 2231.32] Yeah.
[2231.98 → 2232.92] It's amazing.
[2234.48 → 2235.48] We have to.
[2235.86 → 2236.12] Yeah.
[2236.12 → 2237.44] There are a lot of things wrong with it.
[2237.70 → 2238.36] A lot of warts.
[2238.66 → 2239.00] Oh yeah.
[2239.08 → 2239.78] A lot of warts.
[2239.92 → 2240.08] Yep.
[2240.20 → 2241.68] I don't agree with everything they do.
[2241.80 → 2242.50] Not even close.
[2242.68 → 2245.08] But a world without YouTube would be extremely different.
[2245.36 → 2245.62] Yes.
[2245.62 → 2250.18] And so I think that figuring out a way to bridge this gap.
[2250.28 → 2250.44] Yeah.
[2250.56 → 2251.08] Absolutely.
[2252.08 → 2252.96] Has to happen.
[2254.00 → 2254.10] Yeah.
[2254.24 → 2254.76] Someone said.
[2255.00 → 2255.28] You can't just.
[2255.40 → 2256.14] You can't just say.
[2256.24 → 2256.42] Well.
[2256.94 → 2257.90] It's not fair.
[2258.46 → 2262.68] I should have access to everything on the platform with no ads in the highest quality.
[2263.70 → 2263.88] They are.
[2264.24 → 2264.68] They are.
[2264.74 → 2264.96] They are.
[2265.08 → 2265.24] They are.
[2265.24 → 2265.76] They're business.
[2265.76 → 2266.84] I.
[2267.32 → 2268.56] And you know what.
[2268.64 → 2274.74] We could have a way longer conversation about you know capitalism versus other.
[2275.46 → 2276.40] Other systems.
[2276.56 → 2276.78] Right.
[2277.26 → 2277.70] Sure.
[2277.80 → 2279.20] You know you can have that conversation.
[2279.64 → 2284.22] But within the bounds of the system that we all live in at this point.
[2284.32 → 2285.56] Not all of us I guess.
[2285.56 → 2286.62] But we do.
[2288.92 → 2289.82] There are limits.
[2290.24 → 2291.88] There are limits to what we can expect.
[2292.02 → 2292.14] Right.
[2292.14 → 2298.54] And you're not going to be able to expect a for-profit corporation to just take a loss
[2298.54 → 2303.60] on something out of the know good feelings that it will make for people.
[2305.18 → 2305.54] Yeah.
[2305.62 → 2307.02] I mean you can hope for that.
[2307.22 → 2307.96] It's not going to happen.
[2308.32 → 2308.48] Yeah.
[2308.58 → 2308.94] You're going to.
[2309.08 → 2310.26] It's not going to hold your breath.
[2310.34 → 2311.56] That company is going to go under anyway.
[2312.58 → 2315.30] So like even if they did do it they're just going to die.
[2316.26 → 2319.34] A bunch of people in chat talking about cool things that their libraries have.
[2319.62 → 2321.78] Temporary books on Kindles and stuff.
[2321.78 → 2328.58] Someone talking about gaming PCs and laptops available for temporary borrow.
[2328.60 → 2329.40] Shut up.
[2330.30 → 2331.24] That's so cool.
[2331.44 → 2333.92] And again it's not every library.
[2334.48 → 2340.28] And someone brought up a very major issue that libraries in low income areas can sometimes
[2340.28 → 2341.06] just suck.
[2341.68 → 2343.50] I don't know.
[2343.82 → 2345.64] That's probably fairly legit.
[2345.64 → 2350.24] But all I'm saying is that libraries are changing.
[2350.46 → 2352.92] They're not necessarily just books now.
[2353.10 → 2353.26] Yeah.
[2353.62 → 2354.36] They are.
[2354.52 → 2356.20] They're trying to evolve from beyond that.
[2356.42 → 2359.64] Trust AFT says their local library runs D&D sessions.
[2360.06 → 2361.10] That's super cool.
[2361.50 → 2361.72] Yeah.
[2361.86 → 2362.44] That's sweet.
[2363.32 → 2363.48] Yeah.
[2363.48 → 2369.56] I just want to point out that Prime Gaming Soviet Rambo in chat said that putting 4K behind
[2369.56 → 2376.58] a paywall has already been utilized by pornographic naked sites.
[2377.04 → 2378.76] YouTube just copying them again.
[2378.76 → 2387.48] If you want to see about people copying those types of platforms and filming styles look into
[2387.48 → 2394.12] the evolution of cameras and also look into the evolution of online video existing at all.
[2395.06 → 2395.56] Yeah.
[2395.56 → 2397.52] Because you owe a lot of it to that.
[2397.80 → 2399.80] A lot more than you probably know.
[2399.80 → 2400.92] So, yeah.
[2401.00 → 2401.38] Wild.
[2402.70 → 2408.34] On the subject of viewer interactions here, guys, don't forget about merch messages.
[2409.18 → 2410.42] Don't use Twitch bits.
[2410.76 → 2413.12] Don't send super chats or whatever else.
[2413.16 → 2415.56] Send merch messages over on LTTstore.com.
[2415.56 → 2418.06] We've got a bunch of stuff that's back in stock.
[2418.46 → 2420.36] Multistep t-shirts?
[2420.70 → 2421.20] The RGB...
[2421.20 → 2422.88] I think it's the t-shirt that's back in stock.
[2423.38 → 2425.30] We've also got the workshop jacket.
[2425.56 → 2428.74] We've got the short circuit sweatpants that launched recently.
[2428.74 → 2431.26] And we've got an announcement for you guys.
[2431.34 → 2435.80] So, if you're in the checkout, you will have the option to fill out a merch message when we're live.
[2435.94 → 2442.32] And our producer, Dan, is going to either pop up your merch message down here or answer it for you.
[2442.32 → 2443.14] Or both.
[2443.20 → 2444.46] It can pop up with an answer.
[2444.62 → 2449.02] Or curate it so that it's something that we can talk about later on the show.
[2450.60 → 2451.04] Oh.
[2452.52 → 2456.62] We have the original classic lids from our...
[2456.62 → 2456.92] Oh, yeah.
[2456.98 → 2457.42] Here we go.
[2457.42 → 2460.48] So, our current water bottles come with these lids.
[2460.92 → 2466.32] But we are now stocking the classic screw top lids like that one for $5.99.
[2466.96 → 2470.70] And we have an end-of-season deal on our swim trunks.
[2471.16 → 2475.20] We are clearing out our inventory of them at $24.99.
[2475.62 → 2478.92] So, you will see some new swimwear next year.
[2478.92 → 2481.60] Let me just bring that up for you guys.
[2481.78 → 2485.72] I also have one other pretty exciting announcement for the store.
[2486.22 → 2489.40] And you guys are going to want to move pretty quick styles on that.
[2489.84 → 2491.44] 40 reviews, four and a half stars.
[2491.54 → 2492.08] Not bad.
[2492.16 → 2498.56] Unlike Logitech, we do not conceal the reviews that are not 100% positive unless they are spam.
[2498.66 → 2499.40] We do remove spam.
[2499.64 → 2499.72] Yeah.
[2499.72 → 2501.14] Here it is.
[2501.22 → 2501.46] Wait.
[2501.54 → 2503.08] Am I ready to announce this yet?
[2503.56 → 2506.24] How do I know if it's live?
[2506.90 → 2507.20] That?
[2507.40 → 2507.64] Yeah.
[2508.98 → 2509.96] Like, is he watching?
[2510.78 → 2511.34] Okay.
[2512.18 → 2513.12] So, okay.
[2513.20 → 2513.50] All right.
[2513.56 → 2514.16] We're doing it.
[2514.44 → 2515.20] We're doing it.
[2515.20 → 2518.30] There are only 69 available.
[2518.66 → 2519.24] That's right.
[2519.40 → 2522.94] We've got another limited edition product.
[2523.60 → 2525.56] Sarah pushed hard for this one.
[2525.92 → 2536.76] She was like, oh, man, we should totally do a gold controller version of the controller character from the ABCs of Gaming Book.
[2536.76 → 2537.16] I love your version of her voice.
[2537.24 → 2537.42] Yeah.
[2537.52 → 2538.68] She doesn't sound anything like that.
[2538.72 → 2538.88] Yeah.
[2539.06 → 2540.84] But it's super cute.
[2542.10 → 2544.88] Honestly speaking, guys, this is a novelty item.
[2544.88 → 2546.74] It doesn't have alpaca wool in it.
[2547.52 → 2551.74] It, you know, the gold fabric.
[2552.20 → 2552.40] Yeah.
[2552.44 → 2554.38] Just kind of like, you know, crumply and stuff.
[2554.54 → 2555.98] But it's super cute.
[2556.10 → 2556.98] And it's gold.
[2557.06 → 2558.20] It's a gold controller.
[2558.72 → 2560.46] Are you wanting me to switch to that camera?
[2560.58 → 2561.38] Oh, that's not the one.
[2561.82 → 2562.18] Luke cam.
[2562.24 → 2562.74] There you go.
[2563.20 → 2563.80] It's gold.
[2564.20 → 2565.64] They are individually numbered.
[2566.06 → 2567.58] There will be 69 only.
[2567.92 → 2569.76] I have no idea how much they cost.
[2569.84 → 2573.40] It's not cheap because, yeah, it's limited edition.
[2573.40 → 2577.80] And you'll, you know, they'll be sold regardless of how much we charge for them.
[2578.92 → 2580.72] And they come with this cute little sticker.
[2581.20 → 2581.44] Look.
[2581.70 → 2582.22] Okay, look.
[2582.28 → 2584.60] It's actually a ton of work to do a product.
[2584.86 → 2585.44] A one-off.
[2585.52 → 2586.06] And we can't.
[2586.18 → 2586.94] Especially in such low run.
[2587.06 → 2587.20] Yeah.
[2587.26 → 2590.88] We can't do a ton of volume of something like this because we're not going to sell that many.
[2590.88 → 2601.80] So, essentially, it's expensive because you're subsidizing the, you know, the larger production run costs that you would normally have to pay in order to make a product at all.
[2601.90 → 2605.70] Because we only made like 72 of them or something like that.
[2605.76 → 2606.70] Whatever it works out to.
[2606.88 → 2609.32] To make sure that we have a couple spares in case something goes wrong.
[2609.70 → 2611.50] Oh, apparently it's 69.69.
[2611.78 → 2612.24] Hilarious.
[2612.24 → 2616.22] It comes with a little golden controller sticker as well.
[2617.00 → 2621.02] And then a signed card thing that is in here.
[2621.10 → 2622.74] I think I'm supposed to sign these on the show.
[2623.20 → 2624.74] Certificate of Authenticity.
[2625.32 → 2627.68] 1 to 69 of 69.
[2628.32 → 2632.60] This is one of 69 official Linus Tech Tips gold controller plushes.
[2633.00 → 2633.46] Nice.
[2636.34 → 2637.62] You have to, I wonder.
[2637.88 → 2638.32] Classic.
[2638.32 → 2641.96] You have to make number 69 out of 69 special.
[2642.24 → 2643.20] We're live on what now?
[2643.62 → 2645.12] They are live on the website.
[2645.20 → 2646.14] Oh, they're live on the site.
[2646.24 → 2646.50] Okay.
[2646.68 → 2646.96] Okay.
[2646.98 → 2647.74] They're up apparently.
[2648.22 → 2649.04] There they go.
[2649.30 → 2650.16] There they go.
[2650.46 → 2650.92] All right.
[2651.14 → 2652.88] Why don't we move on to our next topic here?
[2653.62 → 2654.00] Yeah.
[2656.16 → 2658.82] Which GPU do we want to talk about?
[2659.08 → 2659.68] I don't know.
[2659.76 → 2661.14] Which one do you want to talk about?
[2661.48 → 2663.36] I want to talk about the Ark, to be completely honest.
[2663.36 → 2663.68] Okay.
[2663.70 → 2664.74] Let's talk about the Ark.
[2664.84 → 2665.16] Which one?
[2665.28 → 2665.64] The Covenant?
[2666.42 → 2666.86] Yeah.
[2667.54 → 2667.94] Survival?
[2668.40 → 2668.82] No.
[2669.20 → 2669.74] Ark of the Covenant.
[2669.96 → 2670.24] Okay.
[2670.32 → 2670.96] Ark of the Covenant.
[2671.08 → 2671.42] Covenant.
[2671.56 → 2671.96] Let's go.
[2671.96 → 2672.42] Yeah, yeah.
[2673.50 → 2674.50] Indy should have opened it.
[2676.68 → 2678.90] He was pure of heart enough that he would have been fine.
[2679.02 → 2679.28] Yeah.
[2679.58 → 2679.94] Yeah.
[2679.94 → 2680.34] Definitely.
[2680.54 → 2680.76] Okay.
[2680.84 → 2681.22] No, sorry.
[2681.36 → 2681.42] Carry on.
[2681.42 → 2684.68] Because taking artifacts from elsewhere and bringing them back to your home country is
[2684.68 → 2685.52] very pure of heart.
[2685.86 → 2688.02] Yeah, that's, uh...
[2688.02 → 2688.22] Okay.
[2688.26 → 2690.02] Indy's less of a modern hero.
[2690.64 → 2691.84] More of a...
[2691.84 → 2692.98] Yeah.
[2693.30 → 2694.10] More heroic.
[2694.24 → 2694.80] Yeah, a little bit.
[2694.84 → 2695.44] A little bit.
[2695.98 → 2697.06] In a different time.
[2697.06 → 2702.00] Anyway, Intel Ark A770 and A750 reviewed.
[2702.50 → 2703.18] And streamed.
[2703.22 → 2703.92] I thought that was cool.
[2704.10 → 2704.54] That was a good idea.
[2704.58 → 2704.88] Yeah.
[2705.08 → 2705.30] Yeah.
[2705.30 → 2706.20] I thought that was a good idea, too.
[2706.26 → 2707.02] That was Alex's idea.
[2707.14 → 2707.32] Good.
[2707.32 → 2708.56] Um...
[2708.56 → 2713.24] After years of exciting announcements and then months of radio silence, Intel has finally
[2713.24 → 2715.62] released their Ark GPUs.
[2715.62 → 2719.08] Their pricing, the A750 8GB is $289.
[2719.52 → 2722.22] The A770 8GB is $329.
[2722.64 → 2727.22] And the same card, but in the 16GB variant, is $349.
[2730.48 → 2731.04] But...
[2731.04 → 2732.38] There are complications.
[2733.24 → 2733.62] Yeah.
[2734.02 → 2734.64] Um...
[2734.64 → 2735.84] Horrific driver problems.
[2736.06 → 2736.56] I mean...
[2736.56 → 2737.10] Rebar required.
[2737.58 → 2742.78] If it's not DX12 or Vulcan, oh boy, you might not even want to play it.
[2742.78 → 2747.54] We got some games that were not DX12 or Vulcan that they gamed.
[2747.66 → 2748.54] You know, they were gaming.
[2748.72 → 2748.96] Okay.
[2748.96 → 2750.74] Oh yeah, they were gaming on the stream.
[2750.76 → 2751.46] I didn't watch the whole stream, so...
[2751.46 → 2752.06] Okay, yeah.
[2752.28 → 2753.42] I'm...
[2753.42 → 2755.46] Most things were pretty playable.
[2755.46 → 2760.78] And the problems that we had on older or lighter games...
[2760.78 → 2761.78] Are they seriously sold out?
[2761.86 → 2762.80] Running older APIs...
[2762.80 → 2763.48] Oh, of course they are.
[2763.86 → 2765.20] Running older APIs.
[2765.54 → 2770.56] The problems that we had were not necessarily ones that every casual user would experience.
[2770.56 → 2777.36] Like, Alex, for example, was finding the wild FPS, like frame time swings in Rocket League,
[2777.56 → 2778.24] unplayable.
[2779.52 → 2783.08] I, a Rocket League moron...
[2783.08 → 2785.40] I was just going to say, you don't play, and he probably does, right?
[2785.62 → 2786.54] He plays hard.
[2786.80 → 2786.98] Yeah.
[2787.10 → 2791.90] So I was like, yeah, I see the frame times are all over the place.
[2791.90 → 2797.56] And it's definitely less smooth than my RTX 3060 over here beside you.
[2797.78 → 2797.88] Sure.
[2798.54 → 2801.26] But this would not affect my ability to play this game.
[2801.62 → 2802.28] You know what I mean?
[2802.50 → 2805.20] But it could be the same thing in Beat Safer.
[2805.52 → 2805.78] Okay?
[2806.06 → 2809.52] You give me those kinds of frame time variants, I'm going to be like, this is unplayable!
[2809.86 → 2811.52] I'm going to be hurling all over the place.
[2811.90 → 2812.12] Yeah.
[2812.12 → 2814.90] You know, so it depends on, it depends on your skill level.
[2814.98 → 2821.14] So if you're a casual gamer, I would say that many games were quite playable.
[2822.24 → 2824.06] Many were problematic.
[2824.44 → 2828.96] I think this is a sidebar thing, but if you remember correctly, the first time in many
[2828.96 → 2834.20] years that I actually felt my computer performance not being where I wanted it to be was with Beat
[2834.20 → 2834.52] Safer.
[2834.52 → 2840.06] Because I started getting into difficulties where it was too fast, and I started to lag.
[2840.46 → 2840.74] Yes.
[2841.42 → 2842.64] I was just like, well, this sucks.
[2842.88 → 2843.48] This sucks.
[2843.66 → 2843.82] Yeah.
[2843.92 → 2849.22] At those speeds, you know, nine milliseconds of stutter or whatever.
[2849.52 → 2852.66] And when you're in VR, like, it's very off-putting.
[2852.74 → 2855.40] It's not like, there are certain games, like, you know, if you can't afford the upgrade,
[2855.48 → 2856.42] you can fight through it, it's fine.
[2856.94 → 2859.74] Beat Safer, like, no, you put that game down, you do something else.
[2860.32 → 2862.10] But anyway, back on topic.
[2862.10 → 2865.40] So this raises a lot of questions.
[2865.68 → 2872.36] With all the experience that Intel has making GPUs, and they do, right?
[2872.82 → 2879.04] They've been doing onboard GPUs for, like, over 10 years now, right, on their CPUs.
[2879.14 → 2881.06] And they've even gotten a lot better.
[2881.40 → 2881.68] Oh, yeah.
[2881.80 → 2886.90] They've made major pushes, you know, whether it's, like, Iris or, like, early HE onboard
[2886.90 → 2887.84] or whatever else.
[2887.84 → 2893.12] But they've made major pushes in improving these from, actually, man, no.
[2893.78 → 2896.00] Intel's been doing onboard graphics since before that.
[2896.08 → 2898.46] They used to have their onboard chipset graphics, too.
[2898.96 → 2899.40] Oh, yeah.
[2899.46 → 2901.64] Intel's been doing onboard graphics flipping forever.
[2901.98 → 2903.64] So it raises the question.
[2904.02 → 2910.86] If they've made their way all the way through DirectX 10, 9, 8, 7, so far back,
[2911.04 → 2913.80] how can they suck at it so much?
[2914.02 → 2915.70] The teams are disconnected or something?
[2915.70 → 2916.18] No.
[2916.18 → 2916.42] No.
[2916.78 → 2916.98] Oh.
[2917.40 → 2918.78] It's more interesting than that.
[2919.04 → 2919.26] Oh.
[2919.60 → 2928.94] With onboard graphics, one of the main tasks of the software team is to take as much GPU
[2928.94 → 2933.88] load away as possible and put it onto the CPU.
[2934.44 → 2935.56] Anything they can.
[2935.66 → 2937.60] Pull it off that weak-sauce GPU.
[2938.08 → 2939.08] Put that on the CPU.
[2939.22 → 2941.28] Put it on those general-purpose processing cores.
[2941.28 → 2946.46] With a dedicated graphics card, well, it's the other way around, isn't it?
[2946.50 → 2946.72] Yeah.
[2946.94 → 2948.16] You've got to take everything you can.
[2948.18 → 2949.64] You want to do as little as possible on the CPU.
[2949.96 → 2954.48] I mean, that's one of the big innovations recently is allowing the GPU to talk directly
[2954.48 → 2955.50] to system memory, even.
[2956.10 → 2956.32] Right?
[2956.38 → 2957.46] Because that's what we want.
[2957.68 → 2959.34] You don't want it to go through that processing unit.
[2959.44 → 2960.68] Why are we adding bottlenecks?
[2960.84 → 2961.04] Yeah.
[2961.32 → 2962.78] CPUs, and that's another thing.
[2962.78 → 2966.74] CPUs used to be very fast compared to GPUs.
[2967.16 → 2970.82] Now, it's not really necessarily the case.
[2971.06 → 2972.62] We're going to put a whole computer in your computer.
[2973.50 → 2974.68] Hey, thanks, Mumbles Malarkey.
[2976.56 → 2980.16] So, that's a big challenge.
[2981.66 → 2985.88] It is also my understanding that, hey, this is a first-gen product, right?
[2985.88 → 2997.56] Like, it's very clear from the power consumption, the die size, just like the elaborate design
[2997.56 → 2999.64] of the card itself, even.
[3000.12 → 3005.34] Like, you guys got to understand, that's an expensive cooler on Intel's Arc GPUs.
[3005.62 → 3007.84] There's a lot of plastic moldings that went into it.
[3008.14 → 3010.18] It's premium, right?
[3010.18 → 3010.22] Right?
[3011.88 → 3017.52] That's not the kind of cooler you design for a $289 graphics card.
[3017.88 → 3021.52] So, there are a lot of indicators that Intel intended for this product.
[3021.60 → 3024.44] The width of the memory bus, for example, 256-bit.
[3024.72 → 3030.54] There are a lot of indicators that Intel intended for this to be a much higher-end product,
[3030.64 → 3033.76] something that would compete more with an RTX 3070.
[3033.76 → 3040.94] But, what it seems to me is that, even with the hard work that the software team is undoubtedly
[3040.94 → 3047.24] doing, there could be some just plain architectural stumbles that were made.
[3047.74 → 3050.84] And, at some point, Intel had to make the call.
[3051.22 → 3056.92] Do we re-spin this again to the point where it's going to launch at the same time as the
[3056.92 → 3061.06] next-generation Battle mage, which cannot be delayed, right?
[3061.06 → 3065.58] So, if you guys watched our video touring the Intel fab, which I think you probably did,
[3065.72 → 3065.84] right?
[3066.02 → 3072.78] You see that there are actually multiple generations of products in flight, right?
[3072.84 → 3073.82] At the same time.
[3074.00 → 3079.24] So, if you delay one of them, you can actually end up stomping right on top of its launch with
[3079.24 → 3082.42] a next-generation way better, way more cost-effective product.
[3082.60 → 3084.50] We actually saw this happen with Bradwell.
[3085.18 → 3086.00] Do you remember Bradwell?
[3086.00 → 3092.54] The 5775C was the flagship Bradwell desktop CPU.
[3092.70 → 3095.68] Bradwell was, I believe, a moderate success in mobile.
[3096.28 → 3106.20] But, on desktop, the 5775C launched, and then almost immediately, the 6700K Skylike architecture
[3106.20 → 3108.66] came out and replaced it.
[3109.16 → 3109.92] So, here we go.
[3109.92 → 3114.36] So, 5775C came out June 2nd, 2015.
[3116.62 → 3117.20] Okay?
[3117.28 → 3120.18] Or at least that's when the article went up on Nantes.
[3121.28 → 3123.96] And August 5th, 2015.
[3124.70 → 3125.54] Oh, wait.
[3126.08 → 3127.38] May 5th, 2020?
[3127.76 → 3128.24] No, no, yeah.
[3128.28 → 3130.44] August 5th, 2015, Skylike launched.
[3130.44 → 3134.30] So, like, K.
[3135.40 → 3141.16] It had two months of being the hotness before immediately there was a better product.
[3141.30 → 3146.26] So, at some point, the ARK team had to look at it and go, well, we're either going to launch
[3146.26 → 3149.24] Alchemist, or we're not.
[3150.52 → 3152.80] And, you know, you can imagine how these things work, right?
[3152.82 → 3155.50] Because the software team is working before there's final hardware.
[3155.74 → 3158.98] The hardware team is working on the hardware before there's final software.
[3158.98 → 3163.08] It's a hope and a prayer that any of this stuff works at all, right?
[3163.22 → 3166.62] So, they might have gotten back to silicon, thought, we can fix this in software.
[3166.70 → 3167.92] I'm speculating right now.
[3168.08 → 3169.10] We can fix this in software.
[3169.28 → 3172.24] Then they get to a point in the software where they're like, holy crap, we need to fix this
[3172.24 → 3172.64] in hardware.
[3173.02 → 3173.94] Rinse and repeat, right?
[3174.10 → 3179.04] Well, you can only go through that cycle so many times before you run out a window for where
[3179.04 → 3180.70] you're actually going to be able to deliver a product.
[3180.70 → 3187.28] So, I think it is entirely conceivable that Intel fully understands that this is going
[3187.28 → 3188.42] to be a bit of a limited product.
[3188.62 → 3193.46] And hopefully, they can take those learning outcomes and apply them to Battle mage, apply
[3193.46 → 3196.54] them to Celestial, which are their upcoming generations of products.
[3196.88 → 3203.66] And this is not going to be something where management goes, well, that wasn't successful.
[3203.76 → 3204.40] Let's just kill it.
[3204.40 → 3206.96] I sincerely hope, and I sincerely doubt.
[3207.58 → 3208.90] Yeah, I'm on board as well.
[3208.92 → 3214.08] I doubt that that's what's going to happen in spite of all the I think the rumours of
[3214.08 → 3217.94] gaming, Intel gaming GPU's death have been greatly exaggerated.
[3218.26 → 3227.90] If these Arc GPUs did not have the, you know, DX12 and Vulcan or bust issues, how well do you
[3227.90 → 3228.42] think they would have done?
[3228.96 → 3229.64] A lot better.
[3230.16 → 3233.78] Yeah, but like, is this something you strongly recommend at that price point?
[3234.40 → 3235.36] It's tough.
[3235.50 → 3237.98] If it, again, if it doesn't have that problem.
[3238.06 → 3239.96] Here's something we ran into during the stream.
[3240.52 → 3244.44] We noticed, and I don't know for sure that this is an Arc issue.
[3244.72 → 3247.08] This could have been an issue with our displays or capture cards.
[3247.18 → 3249.06] So, don't take this for what it is.
[3249.18 → 3251.00] It's an observation.
[3251.64 → 3256.56] We noticed that when we were cloning our display, okay, between our capture card and
[3256.56 → 3260.00] the monitor that I was gaming on, we actually had some issues with the NVIDIA card around
[3260.00 → 3263.56] this too, where it was running at 120 hertz and the mouse was smooth, but dragging
[3263.56 → 3264.36] Windows was horrible.
[3265.02 → 3265.58] I don't know.
[3265.78 → 3267.40] I forget how we ended up solving it.
[3267.46 → 3268.86] We did ultimately solve it.
[3268.90 → 3269.54] It was really dumb.
[3270.06 → 3276.96] But on the Intel side, we were getting the limited gamma value thing.
[3276.96 → 3282.56] So, we were in limited mode, which is for TVs of like 16 to 235 or whatever it is, instead
[3282.56 → 3287.86] of full range, which is 0 to 255, which was causing the stream to look fine, because I
[3287.86 → 3290.02] think that device was expecting limited input.
[3290.26 → 3290.34] Yeah.
[3290.34 → 3295.16] And then the monitor looked like crushed and clipped because it was expecting a full range
[3295.16 → 3295.52] input.
[3295.64 → 3299.50] And there wasn't an obvious way in Intel's dashboard to fix that.
[3300.62 → 3306.58] So, just because the performance is okay, and just because we value competition in the
[3306.58 → 3312.66] marketplace doesn't necessarily mean that I can unequivocally say, go for it.
[3312.70 → 3314.04] It's going to be a great experience.
[3314.08 → 3314.94] You're going to love it.
[3314.94 → 3315.34] I don't know.
[3315.40 → 3315.80] Right?
[3315.96 → 3319.74] Because if you enjoy messing around with things more than playing games.
[3319.74 → 3321.04] I can wholeheartedly recommend it.
[3321.16 → 3321.34] Yeah.
[3321.98 → 3327.24] It looks, honestly, it sounds very interesting just to like, that's why I was happy that
[3327.24 → 3327.96] you guys did that stream.
[3328.10 → 3329.28] I mean, it's long.
[3329.42 → 3330.36] I haven't watched the whole thing.
[3330.52 → 3333.54] It's got timestamps now, so you can just check specific games if you're into that.
[3333.60 → 3334.38] I saw that comment.
[3334.76 → 3338.74] But I was happy that you guys did that because it's just so interesting.
[3339.30 → 3339.54] Yeah.
[3340.16 → 3342.04] Like, it's very cool for that fact.
[3342.04 → 3346.02] But if you want something that's like rock solid, reliable, and you can play games all
[3346.02 → 3346.36] the time.
[3346.86 → 3347.04] Yeah.
[3348.44 → 3350.98] NVIDIA and AMD have a little more experience.
[3351.46 → 3357.26] I just hope enough people buy them that the whole project doesn't get canned.
[3357.68 → 3357.82] Yeah.
[3357.88 → 3359.76] Because I really want to see Battle mage.
[3359.94 → 3361.38] I really want to see beyond that.
[3361.66 → 3369.42] Intel has some serious, I think Intel, to be clear, haven't seen Radeon 7000 yet.
[3369.42 → 3378.46] But I think from what I know about their organizational structures, I think Intel is a much more credible
[3378.46 → 3381.54] competitor to NVIDIA when it comes to machine learning.
[3382.06 → 3382.76] Oh, okay.
[3383.04 → 3383.78] Compared to AMD.
[3384.14 → 3384.28] Yeah.
[3384.30 → 3388.66] I was going to say with the whole, I can't think of the name for it right now, but like
[3388.66 → 3390.74] stitched together cores.
[3392.06 → 3393.90] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[3393.96 → 3394.50] Oh my goodness.
[3394.64 → 3396.10] Why is this escaping me as well?
[3396.32 → 3396.44] Yeah.
[3396.60 → 3397.52] Now you've thrown me off.
[3397.62 → 3397.94] Chaplets.
[3397.94 → 3398.06] Chaplets.
[3398.26 → 3399.10] Yeah, with chaplets.
[3399.24 → 3399.54] There we go.
[3400.34 → 3400.94] I am pretty.
[3401.32 → 3401.68] Jeez.
[3402.20 → 3403.60] I didn't know you were going with machine learning.
[3403.96 → 3407.62] But before you were going with machine learning, I was thinking, the chaplets might change everything up.
[3407.88 → 3413.70] But the thing is that so much of gaming performance for us to continue to improve from here.
[3414.10 → 3417.44] I don't necessarily think Jensen's correct that Moore's Law is dead.
[3417.82 → 3421.02] But as we talked about earlier, it certainly slowed down.
[3421.02 → 3426.24] And I think a lot of the improvements to gaming performance going forward are going to be driven by machine learning.
[3426.32 → 3430.04] And not just gaming for gamers, but also gaming for developers.
[3430.70 → 3430.80] Right?
[3431.26 → 3440.54] I mean, in a world where you can just kind of, you know, make a brown box and then just tell your AI texture generator, yeah, it's wood.
[3440.54 → 3441.84] I don't know.
[3441.84 → 3442.60] Oh!
[3443.60 → 3443.90] Woo!
[3445.22 → 3445.64] Right?
[3445.74 → 3447.10] Like, that's a game changer.
[3447.22 → 3447.48] Oh, yeah.
[3447.60 → 3448.26] Ha ha ha ha ha.
[3448.68 → 3448.94] Right?
[3450.38 → 3451.68] It took me a second.
[3452.40 → 3454.02] Yeah, it totally is, though, actually.
[3455.40 → 3456.28] So, yeah.
[3456.36 → 3456.68] I don't know.
[3456.76 → 3457.06] We'll see.
[3457.06 → 3462.62] core dog asks who from LTT is going to buy an intel arc
[3462.62 → 3469.24] I mean is this one of those things where I should just like put my money where my mouth is
[3469.24 → 3476.56] go to memory express buy an arc put it on my mantle just be like okay I walked the walk
[3476.56 → 3485.14] I just put it on the shelf I don't know if that counts is i I think I've said it before and i
[3485.14 → 3491.24] would still say it now if I was still buying hardware I would seriously consider it because
[3491.24 → 3496.80] it's just so interesting and I would find playing different games and testing them stuff I would
[3496.80 → 3504.62] find that interesting, but that's not going to be for most people for sure um and there are the
[3504.62 → 3509.00] you brought up last time you brought up the social issues like if you can't play some game
[3509.00 → 3514.66] with your friends yeah okay so are you ready yeah we've been challenged the 30-day arc challenge
[3514.66 → 3522.16] 30-day arc challenge I'm down are you gonna actually do it this time though I'm mr I'm
[3522.16 → 3527.06] going to install Linux on my computer and then play VR games for the entire duration of the challenge
[3527.06 → 3534.80] not fair i I played VR games a handful of time, and you just avoided pc gaming the whole time though
[3534.80 → 3542.98] that's a valid result that's a valid outcome that's fair enough it's a valid outcome it was too much work
[3542.98 → 3546.82] to game yeah I mean it was it actually
[3546.82 → 3556.60] to be clear state Linux gaming changed a lot since then even like man steam deck is kind of wild we did
[3556.60 → 3562.62] know that was likely to happen yes to be fair but I'm glad we tried it before it got easy mode I'm glad
[3562.62 → 3570.48] to have had the experience yeah trial by fire man I'm forged LTT labs Jake uh says I'll be buying one
[3570.48 → 3579.18] for my wife wow what I'm going to throw under that yeah wife for now why do you hate your wife
[3579.18 → 3590.46] hopefully she likes diagnosing why games are hard to play um or hopefully you know that the game
[3590.46 → 3599.10] in then in brackets s that she plays um works well on it, I guess okay loser shaves their beard that's
[3601.66 → 3606.06] wow I saw that I didn't want to say because I really don't want to do that well how do you lose
[3606.06 → 3613.62] though you game on anything other than an arc GPU okay then I think I'll be fine okay i could
[3613.62 → 3618.24] do it for a month I could do it for a month I've done it before I've I've put friendships on pause for a
[3618.24 → 3622.72] month okay sure why not all right arc challenge uh not this weekend we're going to have I don't know if
[3622.72 → 3631.02] we have enough arcs but uh we'll, we'll set a start date and uh yeah yeah we'll do we'll do the arc
[3631.02 → 3640.92] challenge okay all right VR included uh crap um it's a game all right
[3640.92 → 3650.16] all right my deal uh my deal for that though is that I don't want to be the one that has to
[3650.16 → 3656.52] change the GPUs in my computers and put them back I'll do my personal rig I don't want to do like the
[3656.52 → 3661.60] VR machine or whatever oh okay just because it's like a lot of work and that's not actual content
[3661.60 → 3668.58] creation so uh Dan can you swap my GPUs for arcs please sure okay you only have like one computer
[3668.58 → 3676.72] right nothing complicated yeah exactly yeah oh my goodness no okay in all seriousness though I'm not
[3676.72 → 3683.28] trying to just be a diva when we do videos at my house that actually disrupt my personal setup and
[3683.28 → 3691.22] my personal life I'm sure, and we do it often people leave my place in a state where
[3691.22 → 3697.82] if I had done it at work there's two or three hours of putting things back to the way they were
[3697.82 → 3703.44] that is typically handled by the writer or by logistics or whatever else that that like shouldn't
[3703.44 → 3709.70] actually be a CEO task that just gets dumped on me when we do things at my house like it's actually
[3709.70 → 3717.46] kind of unfair so that's my that's my only requirement I'm not going to lose I'm not going to lose
[3717.46 → 3722.10] neither we're both way too stubborn so it like doesn't really matter what the stakes are neither of
[3722.10 → 3728.04] us are going to give up before 30 days yeah I would never give it up or let it down hey we should
[3728.04 → 3733.28] probably uh never give up talking about our sponsors yeah man we've got a lot of topics to get through
[3733.28 → 3741.46] good gravy we're going to do show and tell Luke hasn't seen a RTX 4090 in person yet yep, and we brought all
[3741.46 → 3747.98] of them yeah yeah do you want to see all the different i also actually haven't seen anyone holding
[3747.98 → 3752.86] one I haven't watched a video or seen a picture of anyone holding one I have heard anecdotes of how
[3752.86 → 3759.10] big they are prepare to prepare yourself yeah all right cool uh let's talk through some sponsors
[3759.10 → 3765.38] though the show is brought to you by Zoho one if you run a business you probably know how hard it is

[3846.26 → 3851.80] where there's one standing at every one I'm like that's maybe they're transitioning or something I don't

[3902.46 → 3906.26] saw it that it would have been and mojo jalapeño was my favourite one so i think that's what
[3906.26 → 3912.40] they did I hope so yeah because i have missed my savage jerky here uh savage jerky it's
[3912.40 → 3918.60] made with premium quality beef and their bacon jerky is crafted oh well all of it is uh and bacon

[3954.32 → 3962.46] it's been years and just immediately I know right immediately started salivating yeah the maple cayenne
[3962.46 → 3966.56] is my is my one that jerky
[3966.56 → 3973.28] someone tagged me was like that's not chicken that's fair
[3973.28 → 3977.24] it's good
[3977.24 → 3985.90] I mean you say that like you're surprised oh it's been a while it tastes like I mean mine didn't have
[3985.90 → 3990.14] a name change, and it tastes about the same as it used to do yours taste different
[3992.50 → 3997.00] all right you want to see some 4090s yeah all right I'm going to go get them you want to talk about
[3997.00 → 4001.90] some notes sure where is the topic
[4001.90 → 4012.00] some 4090 notes the public has received their first glimpse of the 4090s I'm intentionally not
[4012.00 → 4018.20] looking up right now, and they are big news literally they're huge while the founder's edition is shorter
[4018.20 → 4026.14] in length than the 3090 ti it is thicker and wider and some add-in board cards are comedically large
[4026.14 → 4032.54] apparently the Asus rogue makes the already massive founder edition card feel downright reasonable
[4032.54 → 4037.16] Jats two cents did a size comparison video I'm sure he did
[4037.16 → 4042.86] um where he compared it to the PlayStation 5 what
[4042.86 → 4050.78] I'm still not looking up that's crazy uh he also tried installing the Asus card
[4050.78 → 4060.52] in the Leon lee land cool uh jay again what uh oh I don't know what this is jay again some Leon lee
[4060.52 → 4066.90] land cool case okay, and it looks like uh it won't fit in any smaller mid-tower cases in many
[4066.90 → 4075.34] with many Luke's tired yeah um I'm also I'm also dyslexic um power usage board partners have
[4075.34 → 4081.66] announced their recommended plus for the 4090 many are using the same 850 watt PSU suggestions as
[4081.66 → 4086.90] NVIDIA but Asus and gigabyte are recommending a minimum of a thousand watts and I always forget
[4086.90 → 4097.68] pallet pallet pallet is recommending a 1200 watt minimum okay let's begin no, no no, no no, no no this is a
[4097.68 → 4105.32] 3090 okay, okay let's begin with a 30 I have also never held or actually seen in person one of
[4105.32 → 4111.94] these and that is absurd yeah uh oh hey Dan do you want to uh do the camera let's play Luke show
[4111.94 → 4118.14] and tell for a little bit here okay so I've I've been saying for a long time a little joke
[4118.14 → 4123.26] about how GPUs are just little computers inside your computer um because they like totally are if
[4123.26 → 4128.88] you look at them in an architectural way this weighs about the same weight as a little computer
[4128.88 → 4133.08] okay so just you can stash that right here and I'm going to get you a 4090
[4133.08 → 4141.78] uh who do you want first do you want colourful MSI uh Asus to be fair it looked a lot bigger or total
[4141.78 → 4146.50] uh I think we just send it go with Asus
[4146.50 → 4153.26] first still in the box the package is your first hint
[4153.26 → 4159.12] yeah okay that's a pretty uh it's a thick box sure it is thick box okay we're going to do a
[4159.12 → 4163.04] little live unboxing for you ladies and gentlemen here, here on the wan show okay
[4163.04 → 4169.34] uh there are some discussion topics by the way there it is I will say it is a little shocking
[4169.34 → 4176.24] like I've I've seen a lot of people holding 3090s I knew they were huge um but seeing and
[4176.24 → 4182.58] holding one in person it is massive and I haven't seen the 41 yet oh my goodness oh my god
[4182.58 → 4186.00] what the heck
[4186.00 → 4198.30] my poor old like GTX 260 I bought back in the day would just be embarrassed
[4198.30 → 4207.76] um it doesn't feel like it's the same thing this is a 30 90 for comparison here if we have to get
[4207.76 → 4212.54] it a little higher for the message no Dan don't chase us higher the message just cover it go down
[4212.54 → 4217.42] go down slightly you're good you're good there you go look at that okay and thickness look at the
[4217.42 → 4226.52] thickness what the heck is going on here like that is how many slots thick is that Luke is that
[4226.52 → 4235.72] three or four three and a half I think it's over three yeah over three and a half slots yeah yeah
[4235.72 → 4241.30] yeah absolutely wild you know what hold on I'm going to while you unbox the next one it's heavy while
[4241.30 → 4245.36] you unbox the next one I'm going to run and grab something a little more reasonable for scale I'm
[4245.36 → 4250.90] going to go grab a 1080 okay, okay okay, okay here I'll give you the next one what do you want next what do
[4250.90 → 4260.48] uh just uh hit me with anything doesn't matter total okay big box these are crazy
[4260.48 → 4269.30] these are crazy just the cost in like metal that'd be quite a bit how do I open the box
[4269.30 → 4275.84] that's a way that's okay I don't feel bad for being confused by that now
[4275.84 → 4286.14] all right card looks sick though it does look cool it's also literally the size of a computer
[4286.14 → 4295.42] I have to lean away from the mic to do this so I apologize
[4295.42 → 4298.54] oh my goodness
[4298.54 → 4312.80] hi he's back yeah and like that wasn't a small card no, no not even a little okay here we go here we go
[4312.80 → 4318.80] okay, okay okay
[4318.80 → 4334.52] like what like here thickness look at this is not a small GPU no not at all this is a 1080
[4334.52 → 4341.38] it's kind of big actually like it was relatively long yeah, and it's like where's the length difference
[4341.38 → 4346.80] between these like look at the look at the amount of like you said the amount of metal
[4346.80 → 4352.62] yeah on this thing it is it like this end I don't think you can see it quite as well I'm going to angle
[4352.62 → 4359.18] it there I'm going to angle it like that it looks like a spaceship yeah it's just huge yeah
[4359.18 → 4365.24] like I think when I was holding the 3090 up to it, it was hard to tell the scale but you have to
[4365.24 → 4374.20] understand the 3090 was already ludicrously big yeah ridiculously big yeah okay just i I'm pretty
[4374.20 → 4380.38] sure yeah I'm rather certain just the heat fins on here are but just the heat fins are bigger than
[4380.38 → 4388.48] the entire 1080 okay this uh MSI supreme is that even bigger doesn't need an unboxing because it's
[4388.48 → 4393.76] already unboxed I think this might be even thicker than that one yeah it's shorter but I think it's
[4393.76 → 4400.72] thicker yeah here let's let's go like this hold it is like this yeah oh my gosh oh my goodness yeah i
[4400.72 → 4407.94] think I think mine's a little thicker Luke oh wow yeah you know you have to deal with what you got i just
[4407.94 → 4414.56] I can't even you know okay there's one there's one last one here we've got a've got a colourful eye game
[4414.56 → 4425.94] here we go ready here you want to just uh maybe just yeah just toss that down there that's fine
[4425.94 → 4433.80] yeah I'm sure it's fine okay here we go is this like did you save this for last for a reason no, no i
[4433.80 → 4437.56] don't even know if this one's because I got the bottom okay yeah yeah there you go
[4440.76 → 4446.36] man people support braces are just going to be oh my goodness necessary
[4450.36 → 4454.12] yeah do they ship with them, I don't know I hope so
[4454.12 → 4459.08] so
[4459.08 → 4462.36] no not now that I'm not holding in a weird way hold on let's bring our 1080 back
[4470.04 → 4478.76] oh no that's ridiculous yeah I mean to be clear um these are sixteen hundred dollar GPUs
[4478.76 → 4483.96] yeah you know uh for most people this is a non-issue um
[4486.20 → 4492.44] or for your pro gamers out there you know I guess you have to you might need to think about upgrading your
[4493.00 → 4493.88] your system
[4496.84 → 4498.20] you're good Dan time to uh
[4500.04 → 4507.56] what about uh you know LTT store GPU support braces i just you know they're buying one of these maybe you
[4507.56 → 4512.44] can afford one in like pure gold or something yeah there 's's so many different cases and
[4512.44 → 4518.28] honestly so many different of these gigantic GPUs that I wouldn't even know I wouldn't even know where
[4518.28 → 4524.20] to begin to try to build a universal one that's why I'd be surprised if there wasn't one that came in
[4524.20 → 4533.16] the box to be honest oh, oh wow there's a liquid cooled one back there to a supreme x from MSI it's just
[4533.16 → 4539.56] this is wild man uh our founders I think is supposed to make its way over here after they were
[4539.56 → 4545.80] done filming Dan did it never materialize over there no, no no, no you're good you're good you're
[4545.80 → 4550.36] good it's okay it basically looks like the 3090 but bigger it's ridiculous to find a mini it motherboard and
[4550.36 → 4555.88] plug it in yeah I know right there's going to be there's going to be builds where the GPU is going to do that
[4555.88 → 4561.32] larger than the entire rest of the computer including like a giant a NHD 14 like you know
[4564.44 → 4571.40] that's that's pretty wild anywho they were I think that's the first time that I've ever felt a
[4571.40 → 4579.32] personal computer component that wasn't a case and been like wow this is genuinely heavy yeah like it's
[4579.32 → 4588.76] never been a thing before that's crazy yeah I can see that how big is too big that big i I joked in
[4588.76 → 4595.72] my unboxing of one of them on short circuit I joked that it feels like a matter of time before
[4595.72 → 4603.08] your GPU just takes up all seven slots, and it's like a just big module that you plug in
[4603.08 → 4609.32] are we heading there it feels like it is like genuinely does um
[4611.88 → 4616.04] would that matter what other PCIE cards do you need and the rest of the computer is trying to get
[4616.04 → 4624.52] smaller and more uh like data travelling distance efficient and stuff like that um like with
[4624.52 → 4627.64] drives coming onto the motherboard and stuff it's going to turn into the situation where you have
[4627.64 → 4632.92] like this weird module that you plug your GPU into and that's your whole thing might you just
[4632.92 → 4639.08] plug your computer into your GPU yeah basically seriously though have dedicated power to the
[4639.08 → 4647.32] graphics card stop calling it a card the graphics unit it's crazy I mean that is what the u in GPU does
[4647.32 → 4654.84] stand for yeah i know but it's not card that's what I'm saying yeah um that's wild I don't
[4654.84 → 4659.80] know um I didn't necessarily know how I would make that that would make me feel and now that I've
[4659.80 → 4667.48] held them i I still don't know, but they're absurd insecure I don't want one which is a weird reaction
[4667.48 → 4674.60] I think but like that thing's ridiculous I don't like I don't think I've ever held a computer component
[4674.60 → 4682.84] and immediately been like this is unnecessary as hardcore as I just did like there is no reason
[4682.84 → 4687.88] this thing needs to exist in its current form at least for me, I'm sure there's some people that'll do
[4687.88 → 4693.32] some crazy things with them that need every little tiny bit of power they can possibly get
[4693.32 → 4699.88] sure some there are applications like modded out you know sure yeah yeah or like machine learning
[4699.88 → 4709.24] applications or some type of whatever um but like wow how much does one of those weigh like do you have
[4709.24 → 4717.96] you have that stat I actually don't know, but a lot yeah let's see Asus 40 90 weight
[4723.96 → 4728.84] let's see if it's listed here might not be because why would you bother include that with
[4728.84 → 4733.08] the graphics card, but it matters now oh yeah okay so it's yeah 3.65 slot
[4733.08 → 4739.80] might as well just call it four but yeah it's its not quite four technically right um not quite
[4739.80 → 4744.68] four mm-hmm yeah they don't list weight here as far as I can see maybe they do i just yeah maybe they
[4744.68 → 4750.44] should start yeah because it seems like it's getting kind of necessary it might actually matter yeah
[4751.00 → 4758.60] five pounds someone said that's a lot for a graphics card yeah, yeah crazy
[4758.60 → 4767.08] so here's something that I'm kind of struggling with a little bit lately
[4768.04 → 4775.88] there was a comment on my AirPods Pro 2 video by the way for those of you wondering uh I was swiping
[4775.88 → 4781.56] on both sides to try to go back it didn't make it into the cut but I did try both sides I do know the
[4781.56 → 4789.96] correct swipe for back gesture on iOS um i kind of went on a rant about some some unintuitive
[4789.96 → 4796.20] to me elements of iOS um I get very frustrated by the absence of a back button because having a
[4796.20 → 4804.28] universal way to go back just seems very obvious to me um and there's one comment in particular that
[4804.28 → 4809.96] I was kind of sitting there going you know um I'll just I'll just show you guys on the
[4809.96 → 4816.52] doc because i I put it in there it's like is it me or is it the children who are wrong basically
[4816.52 → 4821.64] uh the quote was its obstinance not to do things that are better for the user that's that's what i
[4821.64 → 4828.20] said in the video and uh this is the response um just say you Linus you're not every user uh just
[4828.20 → 4832.36] because it's something you don't like doesn't mean it's the correct way you do this nonsense with
[4832.36 → 4836.04] every video about iOS macOS and sometimes Linux if something isn't the way you're used to doing
[4836.04 → 4840.36] things then it's incorrect as if he doesn't do with windows too also the back gestures on the
[4840.36 → 4846.92] other side like I said I know that I tried both ways it wasn't working um if it isn't the way I'm
[4846.92 → 4852.52] used to then it's wrong you have a massive sense of entitlement so I guess I'm trying to figure out
[4852.52 → 4859.72] how to reconcile this because on the one hand it's my job to advocate for things that are better
[4859.72 → 4865.16] and from my point of view there are things that are objectively better um you know one of the ones i
[4865.16 → 4870.68] always come back to even though a lot of people still don't really seem to appreciate the value
[4870.68 → 4876.60] of it is t9 dialling uh t9 dialling is objectively faster pull out your phone I'll pull out my phone
[4876.60 → 4883.88] at the same time I will be done calling before you are done it's it is actually faster and the best
[4883.88 → 4889.88] thing about how it's faster is that it doesn't interfere with any of the other ways of dialling
[4889.88 → 4896.20] you could still dial by numbers and have things autocomplete like that, or you could still look up
[4896.20 → 4904.44] a contact list so my way of dialling which is objectively faster also objectively does not
[4904.44 → 4914.76] interfere with however you want to do things I don't see that as a sense of entitlement, and so I guess i
[4914.76 → 4922.36] just I get kind of I get kind of lost sometimes because I'm supposed to be saying yeah here is
[4922.36 → 4928.20] something that would make this better I was in a piece of software where there was no obvious
[4928.20 → 4935.72] visual indication of how to go back to where I was before and yeah it is frustrated me because it
[4935.72 → 4942.76] often frustrates me because there are often situations where no apple's way of handling back
[4942.76 → 4949.40] on iOS is not always consistent sometimes it's a swipe back except when it isn't sometimes there's
[4949.40 → 4955.72] a thing up in the top left corner except that's obviously a bad place to have it because most of
[4955.72 → 4960.84] the world is right-handed meaning that most of the world holding their phone in their dominant hand
[4960.84 → 4965.48] has to reach all the way across it all the way to the top in order to activate that or use a second
[4965.48 → 4972.28] hand it seems to me that it should at least be an option to have back somewhere where you can
[4972.28 → 4977.80] actually reach it without reaching a second hand over to your phone and I don't I guess what i
[4978.92 → 4983.48] what what what's challenging for me is I don't know why that bothers people
[4984.84 → 4993.08] that I should think that that should be a choice um I mean it got zero replies and zero likes yeah it's
[4993.08 → 4998.36] not the only it's the only reason that I'm bringing it up it's not the only one that I've seen like this
[4998.36 → 5003.88] and so I guess I'm I'm struggling a little bit because I'm not sure what to do should I not speak
[5003.88 → 5009.96] my mind then now should I just let it go should I let go that apple doesn't have a back button even
[5009.96 → 5015.08] though it's wrong should I let go that they don't have t9 dialling even though they could probably have
[5015.08 → 5019.00] a dev implemented in literally an afternoon people are going to get annoyed um
[5019.00 → 5025.56] um i I think you remember like way back in the day when somebody sent me a death threat because
[5025.56 → 5031.00] I reviewed something negatively um not that I ever thought it was like real um yeah I'm not
[5031.88 → 5039.08] saying that but like people are going to get really defensive about stuff and if this individual person
[5039.08 → 5046.68] is hyper used to it so due to their familiarity yeah disagrees um they might find a different way
[5046.68 → 5054.12] to try to explain that where they seem i I don't know they might be using that feeling to justify this
[5054.12 → 5061.08] approach um but your reviewer I think you have to do that type of stuff um, and you're going to lose
[5061.08 → 5066.76] some people because of it sure, but that's fine they can just go find a reviewer that feels more similarly
[5066.76 → 5073.40] to how they feel someone says iOS has t9 dialling are you sure when did they add it if that's true
[5073.40 → 5081.24] you would just make him a happy man uh no they don't seem to have it
[5086.04 → 5092.20] uh you can get a third-party app like a third-party dialler it doesn't count yeah that's no, no so iOS does
[5092.20 → 5099.16] not have t9 dialling also especially when you have gigantic borderline unlimited development teams like
[5099.16 → 5104.28] companies at this scale um are able to have I'm not necessarily saying they do but are able to have
[5104.28 → 5113.00] um I think an option even if quite buried would be great um I think the average user is not going to
[5113.00 → 5119.56] change defaults on practically anything yep especially if you don't like prompt them or let them know that
[5119.56 → 5126.92] it's there so if you have some menu that's like uh like navigation options or something right and you
[5126.92 → 5132.68] you throw like uh swiping from the side will always go back or whatever right as an option in there i
[5132.68 → 5138.84] think that's an easy solution that hurts no one so why not do it yeah I don't know i I went through
[5138.84 → 5146.44] something similar when i um I forget which car review it was but I complained that it didn't have uh it
[5146.44 → 5152.12] didn't allow you to set cruise control under I think about 50 kilometres an hour and the use case
[5152.12 → 5159.40] that I brought up for that was school zones and the number of people who were very angry at me for
[5159.40 → 5166.04] thinking that that was just an obviously good feature was kind of it is took me by surprise
[5166.84 → 5172.44] like they were furious because I should be paying attention to the school zone oh and not in
[5172.44 → 5177.80] cruise control right like I'm I'm serious I'm actually not overselling how angry some
[5177.80 → 5186.44] people were about this and I was kind of looking at it going right but if I set my cruise
[5186.44 → 5192.04] control at the right speed right at the beginning of the school zone then what I can do is I can not be
[5192.04 → 5197.24] watching my speed because I don't have to worry about on the road a speed trap or anything like that I can
[5197.24 → 5202.68] be at exactly the right speed not only that but I can take my foot off my accelerator and I can cover
[5202.68 → 5210.20] my brake pedal it makes a lot of sense to me objectively better yeah and so
[5213.00 → 5221.40] is the problem the way that I am presenting it is the fact that I say it is objectively better is that the
[5221.40 → 5229.08] problem maybe but I still don't necessarily think you should change that because but people are
[5229.08 → 5233.32] still misunderstanding I thought i I thought I explained it so clearly who watches their feet
[5233.32 → 5237.80] while driving nobody's talking about watching your feet what are you talking about
[5240.28 → 5244.84] i so I don't think you should concern yourself with people that interpreted everything you just
[5244.84 → 5251.16] said as watching your feet okay that's I think that's my argument uh I think there's always going to be
[5251.16 → 5255.64] people that hearing correctly I think there's always going to be people that take an um countering
[5255.64 → 5259.80] stance for whatever reason I think you just got to ignore it and keep pushing forward um
[5261.64 → 5265.96] but apparently my point is moronic speed should not be locked on in a school zone
[5268.04 → 5274.36] why not it's also not drive the speed it's also not locked if he brakes yeah I'm covering the
[5274.36 → 5278.68] brake I'm I'm like I'm ready I'm dialled in it doesn't keep gassing while he's
[5278.68 → 5284.04] breaking do you not know what cruise control does maybe that's a misunderstanding
[5285.64 → 5290.60] we both come to that conclusion at the same time yeah maybe that's the problem it's not it's not
[5290.60 → 5295.72] gonna the car isn't going to keep trying to go at the same speed if he brakes it's going to let him stop
[5295.72 → 5300.20] it's not going to keep going yeah no there's no there's still people like really misunderstanding
[5300.20 → 5304.28] this how gigantic is the school zone that you would engage cruise control it's not about it's not
[5304.28 → 5310.36] about the way it's about covering the brake yes it's about those like fractions of a second of
[5310.36 → 5315.40] time that it takes to move your foot from the accelerator to the brake in an emergency situation
[5315.40 → 5321.88] the likely it's its not about the speed limit it's about the situation that you're in
[5321.88 → 5329.16] and the desire to have a higher level of awareness defensive driving exactly it's not about
[5329.16 → 5335.64] whatever you guys are talking about so when a full plane chat mentioned it's not autopilot yeah yeah
[5335.64 → 5346.04] it's its just it's its just setting a speed um yeah I don't know I just okay so I think what we
[5346.04 → 5351.00] need to talk about then is how do i how do I present these things better right someone in full plane chat
[5351.00 → 5356.92] said lol Linus you're letting yourself get trolled so hard this is a problem the whole i I hated when
[5357.72 → 5366.36] trolling and trolled entered the lexicon of internet speech because it's such a scapegoat
[5366.36 → 5375.24] for such trash behaviour by so many people the amount of people that I am 100 certain were totally serious
[5375.24 → 5382.68] and then figured out that they were just totally ridiculously wrong and then went oh I be the
[5382.68 → 5388.92] trolling is very high it gets used for that yes there's legitimate trolling I have engaged in it he
[5388.92 → 5396.68] engages in it daily I am 100 certain um, and it can be very funny and like entertaining whatever when used
[5396.68 → 5410.92] in the right way but like I don't think this is that yeah and I've seen a lot of um takes that without an utterly um
[5412.44 → 5422.20] unfamiliar type of logic uh just could not possibly be conceived of as a troll they just
[5422.20 → 5429.48] are really really bad like the road's going right, and they turn left right and
[5430.28 → 5436.84] as someone who's read I promise you a hundred times more YouTube comments than you have right
[5437.56 → 5443.32] I've seen everything, and you can, you know there's like a spectrum of likelihood that someone is trolling
[5443.32 → 5450.28] and sometimes no it really isn't that it actually is just not getting it at all um
[5450.28 → 5457.80] like why would it occur to someone to troll about something as sensible as
[5458.52 → 5463.48] I would like to have my foot covering the brake while I'm in a school zone just in case a kid runs in front of my car
[5465.64 → 5471.40] right why would you troll about that that's like it's like trolling someone because they're like yeah
[5471.40 → 5477.64] this cup shouldn't have it shouldn't let water through the bottom what no it should
[5477.64 → 5485.80] like i it's not funny so i uh maybe that's maybe that's it I don't know so then what do i
[5487.96 → 5492.92] yeah guilty logic you're you're right people think criticism of a product they use is criticism of them
[5492.92 → 5498.52] but if I recall correctly it was the review of the Chevy volt so I don't think a lot of people were using it
[5498.52 → 5508.68] oh man whatever I'm volt gang, so someone said and I don't know how true this is or anything but
[5508.68 → 5513.56] laddie says psychologically braking a little is perceived as more significant than lifting off
[5513.56 → 5518.68] the gas a little the argument is that when driving through those situations people tend to slow down a
[5518.68 → 5524.92] bit more which is safer but on cruise control they won't break enough they won't break because it
[5524.92 → 5534.92] doesn't feel enough to break for what don't know what does that even mean I think they're saying that
[5534.92 → 5541.40] you are less if you see something happening you're less likely to break than to slow down if you're unsure
[5541.40 → 5547.80] if the thing that is happening is uh, uh dangerous for you to be going your current speed at towards
[5549.64 → 5555.32] like if you see something moving behind a car uh-huh I think they're saying that you're less and
[5555.32 → 5559.96] you're like oh they could dart out to the streak, or it could be a kid or whatever you're I think that
[5559.96 → 5566.04] they're saying you're a terrible driver I agree okay yeah but I think that's what they're saying
[5566.04 → 5574.68] so I have come to a complete stop because some kid was playing behind a car and I just didn't trust it
[5574.68 → 5583.24] yeah I don't know maybe i uh maybe i I don't know uh anyway thought there's a lot of people asking
[5583.24 → 5590.68] what the devil t9 dialling is uh basically think about it like autocomplete while you're dialling a number
[5590.68 → 5598.68] okay so except that normally if you're you know if you live somewhere and have acquaintances who live
[5598.68 → 5605.08] near you, you would all have kind of the same area code right so you might type in 604 and that's going
[5605.08 → 5612.12] to autocomplete 80 of the people in your address book right so that kind of autocomplete for dialling is
[5612.12 → 5618.44] not super useful so I feel like the way most people probably dial these days is either through
[5618.44 → 5622.12] pre-programmed favourites, or you can just you know hold one of the buttons or whatever and dial them
[5622.12 → 5627.64] using their voice control or going into their contacts list searching or scrolling and calling
[5627.64 → 5634.84] someone from there t9 dialling is amazing because what it lets you do unfortunately I can't really
[5634.84 → 5639.88] show you my screen because the numbers show up as part of the preview is instead of dialling the
[5639.88 → 5644.92] number you dial the letters so you know how on your dial pad there's little letters that
[5644.92 → 5654.04] correspond to every number so if I wanted to call Luke I just type 585 and swipe it is fewer
[5654.04 → 5662.04] interactions it's really, really fast, and it means that even if I have a ton of contacts it's no more
[5662.04 → 5669.64] than three to four interactions right on the dial pad and I can immediately call someone that's why it's
[5669.64 → 5676.92] good it takes away absolutely nothing from anyone else's preferred way to use it and like I said
[5676.92 → 5681.40] before and this is why it's so frustrating to me, it's like not allowing people to put icons anywhere they
[5681.40 → 5689.16] want on their desktop right it costs apple nothing to implement it um, but they don't because
[5690.20 → 5696.60] why I don't know oh someone's saying call Luke is too hard well a that's I mean it's what you want to use voice
[5696.60 → 5702.84] control all the time no no it's not always appropriate, and voice control is freaking terrible
[5702.84 → 5706.84] I was going to say I never use it because it tends to call the wrong person and that's really annoying
[5706.84 → 5713.56] okay you guys want to hear me go off on Google instead of apple this is fun watch this okay here we go
[5714.84 → 5715.80] call Jake Tyree
[5715.80 → 5721.80] sorry who do you want to call look at this
[5724.92 → 5726.12] call Jake Tyree
[5730.68 → 5737.88] calling Jake TV mobile I said the exact same bloody thing both times the first time it goes Jake TV
[5737.88 → 5748.20] now the way it should work is google should take that uh should take that input right, and it should
[5748.20 → 5757.96] go hmm Jake I understood is there anything that could be kind of close in this address book to Tyree
[5758.76 → 5764.20] and it won't do it I've got I've got another perfect one this one feels like the um this yeah it
[5764.20 → 5769.72] feels like the searching in windows problem where when you search in windows if it's not 100 certain
[5769.72 → 5775.64] it immediately just beings it, and it's like maybe you should have looked at local files yeah okay this
[5775.64 → 5778.36] is a perfect one call Hoffman
[5780.84 → 5784.04] this can be like hot man or something choices which would you like
[5786.84 → 5792.28] got a bunch of uh google results for Hoffman and sun limited rob Hoffman realtor it's trying to google
[5792.28 → 5796.28] maps him somewhere you want to know why because Hoffman's name is spelled with two ends at the end
[5800.20 → 5808.84] all you have to do is check what's in my address book and find something kind of close
[5809.40 → 5816.36] do you know how often I try to call my wife and I am not able to you'd think it would contextually you
[5816.36 → 5824.12] know AI who I usually call and figure out who I'm talking about, so there's someone named Yvonne or
[5824.12 → 5830.44] some business called Yvonne something that if I just say call Yvonne occasionally it'll dial so if
[5830.44 → 5834.92] I don't pay attention which is dangerous when I'm driving and stuff right if I don't pay attention to
[5834.92 → 5839.24] what number it says it's calling it'll call this other random thing probably one out of every 10 times
[5839.96 → 5848.36] but it gets even better okay easy solution call Yvonne ho right I'm sorry there's no number for Yvonne home
[5853.80 → 5858.68] there's one that's real close someone in chat said yeah it should prioritize your local contacts
[5858.68 → 5864.44] yeah yeah it's like I said it's the same it's the same thing as the window search problem uh it's the exact same issue
[5864.44 → 5869.40] so this is the kind of stuff that i just I don't know how to handle right because other than getting
[5869.40 → 5876.76] angry about how obvious this problem is and how obvious the solution is and staying angry forever
[5876.76 → 5884.60] because it's still not fixed um isn't it my job to I think there's always going to be a certain minimum
[5884.60 → 5892.44] amount of alienation uh because people are going to uh misinterpret or disagree and disagree is
[5892.44 → 5894.28] completely fine like someone might
[5897.64 → 5903.80] someone might think that not prioritizing looking at local files on Windows and not prioritizing local
[5903.80 → 5909.64] contacts when trying to voice call someone is the right way I'd be very interested in hearing that
[5909.64 → 5915.48] argument but considering they both work that way that argument's got to exist somewhere I have no idea
[5915.48 → 5920.68] how it makes any sense, but it's got to exist somewhere and guys maybe they disagree adding nicknames like
[5920.68 → 5927.16] wife or like changing people's names in your contact book to no that that's a bad solution that's a stupid
[5927.16 → 5935.24] solution that's a manual solution in an automated world like that's not how it should work you can tell
[5935.24 → 5946.92] google who your wife is and call say call my wife um no that's no I respect your opinion
[5946.92 → 5955.48] but I believe that google with their experience could probably engineer a superior solution and
[5955.48 → 5960.12] yes I'm aware that you can say call Ivan home mobile the problem is that sometimes it just doesn't
[5960.84 → 5966.52] sometimes it'll still do the home it'll, it'll grab the word home first the one that really makes me
[5966.52 → 5973.56] more angry than anything is when I'm dictating to the Google Assistant, and it hears me just fine it is
[5973.56 → 5983.48] exactly what I wanted call jams stripe, and then it's like sorry can't find jams strobe or what
[5984.04 → 5990.76] because it just doesn't know that name, and it's like no, no phonetically you were fine
[5990.76 → 5996.84] everything was fine, and then you were like oh you surely you couldn't have meant that even though I have
[5996.84 → 6005.24] a contact in my contact list that matches what you had perfectly you would think you would check
[6005.24 → 6012.84] right because like fuzzy logic right you would check the the 90 and then the 85 and then the 75
[6013.40 → 6020.12] certainty if they prioritize local storage or in this case local contacts the second you say call as your
[6020.12 → 6027.56] prime first word it should immediately prioritize local contacts but yeah I feel like I've said the
[6027.56 → 6033.16] same thing like a billion times but the same as the windows problem it just it the windows one is almost
[6033.16 → 6039.80] worse because even if you have a perfect match it will first look online and then look local so if you
[6039.80 → 6045.88] type it and then press enter quickly it'll just bing search it which is so annoying yeah that one bothers me
[6045.88 → 6052.60] um but yeah I don't know but yeah I don't know I think you just got to keep doing it and I think
[6052.60 → 6058.92] you would just keep doing it anyway I don't think it matters yeah in infamous Alex says I believe
[6058.92 → 6063.48] it's in how the message is delivered people will always expect you to come to them so you're stating that
[6063.48 → 6068.68] something is objectively better even when it is come across as arrogant, or otherwise you know I think
[6068.68 → 6072.92] that's fair so that's probably fair but I don't necessarily think you should change it well
[6074.84 → 6079.48] yeah what is it you catch more flies with honey than vinegar or whatever it is so I just have to
[6079.48 → 6084.12] like be nicer sometimes you don't want that fly to have honey should I just say should I just say um
[6084.68 → 6093.32] your stance that apple should not build features that are better for some people is valid
[6093.32 → 6097.96] but I respectfully wish that they would build features that are better for some people is it valid though
[6097.96 → 6101.56] um I mean it's valid to them
[6105.00 → 6111.96] no I mean I don't know man i just people might not appreciate my stance on all that but i just
[6111.96 → 6115.32] I don't know I think sometimes you lose people and I think sometimes it's worth it
[6116.52 → 6121.24] meet ready to eat says I'll play devil's advocate here having a name at all is a manual solution in an
[6121.24 → 6126.44] automated world so adding wife in the relationship box is the same as putting a name in the name box
[6126.44 → 6132.28] uh disagree actually a lot of my contact list is automatic because I use Google for work so yeah
[6132.28 → 6139.32] it gets populated by yeah it just gets populated yeah um and the more that we can automate the better
[6139.32 → 6146.68] so any excuses that we make for not automating things properly I think is just a setback right like why are
[6146.68 → 6153.08] we why do we accept it yeah, yeah like if I email someone, and they email me back I don't actually
[6153.08 → 6157.32] know at what point in that chain this happens but if there's email exchanges with someone they're added
[6157.32 → 6165.96] to my contacts and just it happens yeah I want that that's good cork 1947 says no f the haters
[6165.96 → 6171.88] accessibility and inclusiveness is something that every dev should strive for anyone who disagrees is wrong
[6171.88 → 6176.36] okay but I'm not gonna I'm not going to win any friends that way no but I agree it's great I need
[6176.36 → 6182.28] people to like me yeah or at least tolerate me sometimes uh as someone who works with developers
[6182.28 → 6190.60] on a platform sometimes it is very technically expensive um to incorporate those things but we
[6190.60 → 6197.24] are currently talking about a platform that is at a scale where their technical powerhouse behind it is
[6197.24 → 6202.36] immense, and they could absolutely do these things, and it wouldn't be a big deal right
[6203.80 → 6205.88] all right what else we got to talk about today
[6207.56 → 6212.04] uh oh man do you want to talk about the Mario movie teaser trailer I haven't even watched it
[6212.60 → 6217.96] if we bring it up we're immediately losing monetization it's Nintendo no, no no we're not gonna
[6217.96 → 6222.12] we don't have to show it we can just all watch it together guys we'll just post the link in the
[6222.12 → 6227.08] chat we do a bit of a timer yeah, and we'll just all press go yeah let's watch it together i I have
[6227.08 → 6231.80] watched it yet either okay so I'm throwing it in the twitch chat you got float plane chat yeah we're
[6231.80 → 6237.48] not going to have audio uh aren't we I mean, but we can't play it through the stream oh we can just look
[6237.48 → 6249.48] at if it's fine that's fine it's fine all right ready set go oh good gravy it's over two minutes long
[6249.48 → 6254.44] yeah uh oh man I don't know if I want to watch the whole two minutes okay, so there's some
[6255.56 → 6260.76] magma what's the difference between lava and magma I forget one of them's underground one of them's not
[6260.76 → 6269.56] cool thanks so it's lava then I think so well lava is definitely the one above ground I know that okay
[6270.84 → 6277.96] okay, okay big castle right next to the other castle sup magic Hoopa how you doing
[6279.48 → 6284.12] it's kind of surprising they didn't do a Mario movie before now that I think about it
[6285.00 → 6289.96] they did they the Mario brothers it's like horrible it's live action
[6290.84 → 6295.16] a movie I thought they did I know about the TV show oh I didn't know it was a TV show maybe
[6295.16 → 6296.36] it's just a TV show I don't know
[6299.16 → 6304.76] who is this isn't the oh penguins let's go
[6304.76 → 6314.60] they're going to lose yeah and stuff i kind of see this coming yeah, yeah okay, okay so it's going to
[6314.60 → 6319.88] be predictable but that makes sense that's okay oh I liked a little the little fur
[6321.72 → 6325.16] cute they don't have realistic uh penguin teeth, but that's probably good
[6325.80 → 6328.44] because that's terrifying Bowser kind of looks like an old man
[6328.44 → 6338.44] and he breathes fire he doesn't breathe fire like that yeah he shoots fireballs doesn't he
[6342.52 → 6346.52] it was a movie apparently it was a movie well I'll show you what I know or there is a movie
[6346.52 → 6349.24] I don't know maybe there's also a TV show wow great lighting
[6349.24 → 6360.84] I first noticed this with how to train your dragon having cartoon characters in like
[6362.28 → 6366.28] two realistic looking fantasy environments it's kind of jarring it's a little weird
[6367.56 → 6373.16] like showing one showing the like kind of like the mushrooms look like they're plush what the heck
[6373.16 → 6375.40] they look like their fabric
[6377.64 → 6382.36] okay and that's it all right official teaser trailer I think the kids will like it
[6384.20 → 6391.40] Bowser could breathe streams of fire in the OG Mario games and in 64 that doesn't sound right
[6391.88 → 6397.16] in the OG Mario games I thought it's fireballs in the very first one it's fireballs I know that much
[6397.16 → 6403.80] yeah and I don't think he throws any fire anything in Super Mario world for the SNES
[6405.32 → 6411.72] I don't remember Super Mario brothers 3 though, and he also said 64 and I didn't I didn't play that
[6413.16 → 6419.08] oh I can't hear anything so I don't get to hear the voice you must hear Chris Pratt play Chris Pratt
[6419.96 → 6425.48] uh I don't think I need that I'm sorry guys I don't need it I'm good but yeah that's a thing it
[6425.48 → 6432.52] happened Chris Pratt's Mario voice is just Chris Pratt oh Riley says it seems like he might be able
[6432.52 → 6438.52] be trying to do a slight New Yorker accent like hey I'm walking here that seems like an oversight
[6438.52 → 6441.64] why didn't they just get the Mario guy to do the voice of Mario yeah he's still alive
[6443.08 → 6449.64] this has been weird the entire time oh and I think it's probably really weird for him as well because
[6449.64 → 6455.80] again he's still alive like it's not like they couldn't get him to do it okay our discussion
[6455.80 → 6463.96] question here is more than an hour of that voice might be a little much um but is Chris Pratt's
[6463.96 → 6466.84] regular speaking voice too far in the other direction
[6466.84 → 6479.72] uh probably I would think yeah probably um all right in other news overwatch 2 had a pretty
[6479.72 → 6485.64] rough launch this week have you played have you tried to play I guess this is a more valid question
[6485.64 → 6493.08] I have tried to play I have not played um yeah very funny very not surprising given that it's blizzard
[6493.08 → 6499.48] and this is how every single game that they launch goes um, but yeah overwatch 2 launched October 4th
[6499.48 → 6505.24] sort of players was stuck queuing with tens of thousands of other players' blizzard president mike
[6505.24 → 6510.04] Barbara initially tweeted that they were experiencing server issues he later tweeted that they were
[6510.04 → 6518.36] experiencing a massive DDoS attack there are known bugs many of them some are very bad there's a known bug
[6518.36 → 6524.28] list um there was a beta I don't know why they sometimes bother if they're not going to do anything
[6524.28 → 6530.12] about the things that were found in the beta there were four hours of downtime Thursday evening during
[6530.12 → 6538.36] prime time that is specifically when I tried to play hooray very cool cues are apparently still terrible
[6538.36 → 6544.12] uh even without the issue some critics are still upset at overwatch 2 just in general this has nothing to
[6544.12 → 6548.68] do with the launch problems they're saying that it's basically overwatch one with a couple very
[6548.68 → 6555.56] minor feature updates to be fair they literally told you that um like doesn't it not cost extra
[6555.56 → 6559.56] no it doesn't yeah, and they said that the like the multiplayer is going to merge in and like
[6560.36 → 6565.24] you wouldn't have to pay for it uh in order to play like I think you gain like single player stuff
[6565.24 → 6569.48] if you pay for it, it's one of those types of things which people were praising at the time and they
[6569.48 → 6575.32] got it, and it wasn't different, and now they're upset I don't know um there's not much of a
[6575.32 → 6581.08] graphical update uh as far as I've heard it's basically like it's six hours later like every
[6581.08 → 6586.60] map that is like sort of night time is like kind of morning and every map that was night time it's
[6586.60 → 6591.64] like, or you know what I mean it's just every map seems like it was pushed slightly further in the day
[6591.64 → 6600.76] um the battle it's a battle pass instead of loot boxes which I mean maybe that's better pick
[6600.76 → 6610.52] your poison I guess maybe it's not um the Eve mode got delayed I didn't know that this is basically
[6611.80 → 6616.36] the only true new feature of overwatch 2 as far as my understanding was back in the day that's why
[6616.36 → 6622.44] they did it uh that they were mentioning, and now it's delayed like halo's campaign co-op
[6624.12 → 6628.76] I'm sure it feels very similar the cosmetics and their pricing has been heavily criticized as per
[6628.76 → 6635.40] usual uh there's a rare skin that costs three or a rare skin costs 300 coins which will take over a
[6635.40 → 6642.12] month to acquire and legendarily cost 1900 so you're spending many months if you want to get a legendary
[6642.12 → 6648.44] okay is this me being out of touch why do you care just use a default skin yeah let's go I agree um
[6649.00 → 6657.32] I well I also don't want like ridiculous priced things for people that are going to buy it but yeah
[6657.32 → 6664.20] i just I wish people would default skin more often um and I think it's like ridiculous and stupid and
[6664.20 → 6670.36] should be frowned upon um when anyone criticizes anyone else for not having skins in video games because
[6670.36 → 6677.72] like wow that's probably the least valuable purchase you can make in your day um other than
[6677.72 → 6681.88] okay actually that's very not true there are a lot of other things that could be worse but anyway it's
[6681.88 → 6687.48] not great uh there's a discussion question Windows 11 was a free upgrade from Windows 10 is blizzard
[6687.48 → 6693.16] doing the same with overwatch but worse seeing as overwatch 1 server are shutting down so you're
[6693.16 → 6698.76] required to upgrade if you want to keep playing the game I don't think it's necessarily that much worse
[6698.76 → 6704.76] because I don't think it's that different the whole argument of the game has barely
[6704.76 → 6708.84] changed means that I don't think you can really complain too much that overwatch servers ended
[6708.84 → 6715.24] overwatch 1 server ended I do know that player teams went from six to five so if you had a friend
[6715.24 → 6722.52] group of six people that all played overwatch that sucks a lot um I didn't see like that too
[6722.52 → 6727.48] particularly in any part of the notes but I think that's going to be quite brutal I think they went to
[6727.48 → 6732.52] five because basically every other game is five so it'll make it easier for friend groups of five
[6732.52 → 6737.64] to transfer over to overwatch um that makes sense, and you can't really have you can't really maintain
[6737.64 → 6744.36] the competitive balance at five or six yeah but then if they didn't it's going to be rough make many
[6744.36 → 6749.88] changes to the maps anyway then maybe it didn't matter yeah maybe it never mattered I don't know yeah
[6749.88 → 6759.64] i I find the launch issues to be funny just because it's such a blizzard thing um every launch they're
[6759.64 → 6770.60] like what we got dossed like every other time no way in fairness that's probably a huge DDoS
[6770.60 → 6779.16] because oh it's probably really hate blizzard yeah with good reason, so yeah there's that yep okay
[6779.16 → 6785.08] yeah playing games on launch as fun as it sounds uh if you're not ready for this type of issue in
[6785.08 → 6791.48] the modern day you just it's going to happen with like basically everybody it's pretty crazy I do find it
[6791.48 → 6799.08] interesting um that old school game launches went a lot better in a lot of cases because it was a lot
[6799.08 → 6804.04] more common for old school games to have dedicated servers yeah so its like wasn't really much of an
[6804.04 → 6811.88] issue so if there was a problem people could just spin up another server, and it would be some nobody
[6811.88 → 6816.68] spinning up the server, so nobody would think to attack them they're like yeah yeah either your
[6816.68 → 6822.44] individual server gets DDoS or if there are too many players I mean well your server just filled up
[6822.44 → 6826.68] and you as an individual if you're the server host you probably have reserve slot so you don't care
[6826.68 → 6833.72] yeah no big deal yeah I don't know it's interesting can 403 in float plane chat goes how did I not notice
[6833.72 → 6841.24] the move from six to five players I don't know i yeah maybe it just didn't matter
[6843.64 → 6854.68] uh oh in other news I completely forgot to uh put this in the doc, but we did a review of the star forge
[6854.68 → 6862.60] systems creator pc or whatever that thing was called and one of the video isn't the
[6862.60 → 6869.80] number one yeah well I searched for oh okay, okay okay uh one of the creators who is actually behind
[6869.80 → 6877.88] star forge pc uh Mongol I think that's how I pronounce that yep did a reaction stream watching
[6877.88 → 6884.20] the review just it appeared uh he's either an excellent actor or it appeared that he was doing
[6884.20 → 6892.76] it live raw hadn't seen it before um and discussed sort of the criticisms that I had as well as
[6893.32 → 6900.92] the praises that I gave to the system so it's funny to me that actually has more views than the
[6900.92 → 6907.24] original review um that's that's a little different I think that's what he sometimes does
[6907.24 → 6913.24] yeah so that's uh that's a thing that happened this week I'd say that it is probably worth a watch
[6913.96 → 6921.80] um I think that yeah yeah yeah I've I've watched it I think that I don't I wouldn't have done it any
[6921.80 → 6930.20] differently from him, but he was very quick to declare victory when I said anything
[6930.20 → 6936.68] remotely positive I think that makes it fun though it is and what he's trying to do is make an
[6936.68 → 6942.84] engaging stream right so like if if you say something positive he's going to try to cut you off
[6942.84 → 6948.20] before you potentially make it negative celebrate and then if you trash on something it is you know it
[6948.20 → 6956.44] makes the story more interesting sure it makes sense um and I think that uh but I will also say
[6957.00 → 6965.80] that he seems to be taking the criticism very seriously so to his credit and I don't know
[6965.80 → 6969.64] much about the rest of the ownership group in fact I don't know much about him either i it's just not
[6969.64 → 6975.32] really a space that I participate in um to his credit and hopefully the rest of the ownership group
[6975.32 → 6980.92] they seem to be taking the issues that we had very seriously, and you know hopefully they're
[6980.92 → 6986.76] hopefully they're in this for the long run I'm you know still I still believe what I said at the end
[6986.76 → 6994.52] of that video um there's there are risks associated with buying from any you know brand-new company that
[6994.52 → 6999.40] is still kind of trying to figure out what they're doing sometimes it can go very right sometimes it can go
[6999.40 → 7006.20] very wrong so wish them the best of luck uh I also stand behind everything I said about how
[7006.20 → 7013.08] challenging this business model is it's really tough it's really tough there 's's just not
[7013.72 → 7019.00] there's not that much money in it and there are costs that will be cumulative there are costs that will pile up
[7019.00 → 7025.16] over time as soon as you've got a hundred systems out there someone is going to call support every
[7025.16 → 7030.28] day and that's not something you're making money on once you've got a thousand systems out there
[7030.28 → 7035.80] 10 someone's are going to be calling every day and that's not something you're making money on and so
[7035.80 → 7040.12] these are just costs that all of a sudden you're kind of sitting here going well yeah that really
[7040.12 → 7045.96] wasn't part of our calculation when we were selling these things, but now we're just carrying these on
[7045.96 → 7050.68] an ongoing basis and I know that there are a lot of other boutiques that will that will
[7050.68 → 7056.04] will talk to these people, and we did a did a tech support hmm that video hasn't gone up yet
[7056.04 → 7061.96] okay we shot another tech support stream, and you know the kinds of things people will call in about
[7061.96 → 7067.72] can be simple but very time-consuming in some cases you know multiple reboots, or you know reformatting
[7067.72 → 7071.56] something and if you're trying to provide good customer service you can't just abandon them right
[7071.56 → 7077.96] yeah it's its tough it can be time-consuming it can be expensive um i I wish them the most luck
[7077.96 → 7087.80] and my final word on the subject is that the logo is 100 a balls there's simply no doubt I mean it
[7087.80 → 7095.56] even has had you seen the logo oh yeah it he is even has like an asterisk kind of behind the balls
[7097.24 → 7105.56] which is your know here I'll mime it out for you what that probably is uh wow yeah wow
[7105.56 → 7109.48] wow yeah wow so
[7112.44 → 7119.56] I don't uh I don't make the rules yeah I don't decide what is or isn't a one of those, and it was
[7119.56 → 7126.44] obviously done with intention but I do find the trying to play it off as if it wasn't entertaining
[7126.44 → 7134.28] which is it is I am certain the whole point but yeah I mean we can hope here for those of you who are
[7134.28 → 7137.64] not familiar with what the logo looks like for star forge systems
[7139.80 → 7147.64] hammer really oh totally yeah it's just you know it's like Thor's hammer so the handles kind of
[7147.64 → 7152.20] you know proportionate to the size of the hand, and you've got the block down there, and it's called star
[7152.20 → 7161.56] forge, so there's a star in the middle of the flat side of the hammer uh yeah yeah it's a
[7161.56 → 7166.92] premise rocket yep okay cool I'm glad we settled that once and for all
[7172.20 → 7178.52] uh what's next uh we should do some merch messages yeah stop Dan yeah
[7179.80 → 7186.84] are you typing away you're up typing away uh let me just cancel this one you can be responded to later
[7186.84 → 7192.12] yeah we got quite a few here today uh this one's from Nathan any chance of getting float plane app for
[7192.12 → 7198.04] android TV NVIDIA shield uh so far those are the only ways I'm able to enjoy most long-form content
[7198.84 → 7204.68] uh sort of i kind of just want to leave it at that to be completely honest
[7205.80 → 7212.36] we have a bit of a plan for fixing some of those types of things but I haven't actually really started
[7212.36 → 7217.08] working on it yet so I don't want to talk about it too much because the second you talk about those
[7217.08 → 7223.88] types of things people expect it's coming out next week um and that's definitely not how anything works
[7223.88 → 7232.76] so yeah is there a chance yes soon probably not uh this is a good question from john s sorry this one
[7232.76 → 7238.68] just came in so Dan hasn't had a chance to curate it yet but do you guys see big tech using peer-to-peer to
[7238.68 → 7241.96] alleviate the cost of bandwidth in the future for higher quality video
[7245.80 → 7255.40] it technically makes a lot of sense but people don't want that and there's an analytics issue
[7255.40 → 7263.08] you lose control over knowing exactly what is happening on your network on your network uh which
[7263.08 → 7271.32] is why the what's it what's it called hub and spoke or whatever model is uh remains dominant
[7272.04 → 7276.84] there are a lot of reasons why when a lot of those types of yeah quality of service with that is hard
[7276.84 → 7282.68] yeah there 's's a lot of very significant hurdles doesn't make a lot of sense bandwidth wise
[7282.68 → 7290.76] sure absolutely, but it's been thought about for a very long time and I think if it was genuinely the
[7290.76 → 7298.44] right thing to do it would have been done okay you want some more uh last week Luke mentioned how you
[7298.44 → 7303.96] built out a CDN for float plane usually I associate this with type of development with companies the size
[7303.96 → 7310.12] of Google and cloud fair how did a company your size go about it proprietary don't talk to me anymore
[7310.12 → 7321.72] it's much difficulty very hard yeah um we started running into i I had some guidance from some
[7321.72 → 7327.96] people that used to work at twitch that's as far in as I'll go as with that um about some things that
[7327.96 → 7334.28] we might run into and yeah sure we definitely ran into them um and they suggested at the time that
[7334.28 → 7341.40] we don't pursue doing that at all because of the issues that they ran into and yep those are
[7341.40 → 7346.28] definitely issues that we ran into is all really say uh, but our whole idea from the beginning was
[7346.28 → 7354.20] that we didn't want to be beholden to one thing so we had to have an internally set up CDN that would at
[7354.20 → 7359.48] least technically work so that we would always have a fallback was it the best now could it even was it
[7359.48 → 7365.56] even the most cost-effective no, no, but it worked and if we really have to we can go back to it
[7365.56 → 7371.96] um right now it's not so we don't use it so much uh we use it for some things but not for everything
[7371.96 → 7377.48] but honestly the entire float plane project as a whole um could have a giant question mark on it of
[7377.48 → 7383.72] how did you ever think you could do this with a team um that isn't 10 to 100 times bigger uh 10 would
[7383.72 → 7394.20] honestly be relatively small um, and it's we've been trying really hard uh the team's really
[7394.20 → 7400.36] good uh I strongly believe in each person on the team uh I think they do a fantastic job I think they
[7400.36 → 7408.84] are often harder on themselves than I am uh sometimes to the point where it's a problem um, but they try
[7408.84 → 7415.16] really, really hard all the time I don't know the effort is really high because you heard it here
[7415.16 → 7423.56] first the float plane team is a bunch of orchards yeah pretty much uh because I think the personal
[7423.56 → 7428.84] care and investment from the members of the team is really high um I mean is it worth sort of
[7428.84 → 7433.32] explaining to people who don't fully understand what the difference is between just having a server
[7433.32 → 7442.60] and having a CDN a lot of the problems behind CDNs we talked about this earlier in the show is ISPS
[7443.16 → 7449.00] so if you plonk, and we ran into this like immediately if you just plonk a server in Europe
[7449.00 → 7455.88] and you're like we have a server in Europe that's enough right all the Europeans can connect to that
[7455.88 → 7460.44] server yeah it's close that's great it has a big fat pipe it's not that far yeah it's the internet
[7460.44 → 7466.68] it's fast its fibre you know whatever yeah well except what if one of the people that is trying
[7466.68 → 7473.48] to access data off that server also known as watch a video is on an ISP and the route between that
[7473.48 → 7479.56] person all the way through their ISP onto whatever lines eventually lead them to your server what if
[7479.56 → 7487.88] that route is junk what if somewhere in there is a problem and uh okay so we're trying to set up our
[7487.88 → 7491.80] own CDN, but we don't have our own data centres because we're nowhere near that big, and we have
[7491.80 → 7495.64] nowhere near that amount of money so we're going to plonk into other people's well what if that data
[7495.64 → 7500.12] centre isn't super interested in fixing the problem what if that ISP isn't super interested in fixing
[7500.12 → 7505.88] that problem AG just mentioned congestion there are tons of issues along the way and a lot of them are
[7505.88 → 7512.92] fairly out of our hands um without doing immense amount of further investment in some situations
[7512.92 → 7518.20] even with immense amount of further uh investment without partnerships with these different ISPS
[7518.20 → 7527.24] without uh partnerships on a lot of different levels it's really hard um and basically only works
[7527.24 → 7534.44] at immense scale another big difference is that a CDN is going to have more than just origin servers
[7535.00 → 7540.76] right so it's its operating with a greater degree of complexity you are intelligently caching the content
[7540.76 → 7546.76] that people are most likely to need as close to them as possible uh while keeping the main repository
[7546.76 → 7556.84] of your content in a consolidated central or location or locations so it's more complex essentially there's
[7556.84 → 7563.00] a big problem yeah so one of the early projects that we made um was like a multi CDN system
[7563.00 → 7569.24] so that we can switch which one we use uh because one of the very important parts from the beginning
[7569.24 → 7576.12] was that we wanted to be able to you know maybe we have some downtime if this has to happen but
[7576.12 → 7581.48] there's a path every time if is someone cuts us off for whatever reason there's a path we know what
[7581.48 → 7586.52] we have to do if our CDN cuts us off we know what we have to do to get going again if our server
[7586.52 → 7590.76] host cuts us off we know what we have to do to get going again there might be complications there
[7591.48 → 7597.40] um but I think that's fairly reasonable, and it's never actually been a problem which is great it's very
[7597.40 → 7609.08] cool yeah okay moving on let's see got another one from Adam here hi Linus and Luke Linus from your
[7609.08 → 7614.44] experience at NCAA do you have any advice for someone early in their career as a spend category manager
[7614.44 → 7618.68] specifically for someone working in the electronics slash electro mechanical space
[7618.68 → 7623.96] I don't know don't f**k up
[7627.00 → 7634.52] good advice don't order too much don't order too little if you order too much or too little uh
[7634.52 → 7642.04] cover your butt I don't know like right it's just it's your typical like corporate desk job politicking
[7642.04 → 7647.48] right like it's uh if you're is you're decent right if you're is you're pretty good at what you do
[7647.48 → 7654.44] then yeah it shouldn't be an it shouldn't be a major problem to get the hang of whatever it is that you're
[7654.44 → 7659.16] that you're buying and buying the right amount of stuff uh be organized you know that's something that i
[7660.04 → 7666.28] wasn't always good at, but it was something that I strove to do I think that's the best I can really offer you
[7666.28 → 7673.16] sorry okay uh this one's from Daniel love the show and all you guys do with labs rolling out how do you
[7673.16 → 7677.72] think you guys will move away from using direct links to products in video descriptions and instead
[7677.72 → 7683.72] link to lab pages that show up-to-date recommendations for that type of product I think that is a good idea
[7684.84 → 7692.92] I didn't think of it personally yet um but I think it's an it's a most wonderful super perfect
[7692.92 → 7699.24] idea like links to labs and then labs to the actual products yeah with that said I know that YouTube is
[7699.24 → 7707.16] working on more features where you can shop directly on the video like from within the video player and so
[7707.16 → 7712.92] it might not always make sense to link back to a labs page that could end up being an overwhelming
[7712.92 → 7718.36] information dump on people so depending on the product yeah it might not be the most sensible thing
[7718.36 → 7724.04] like if we do a roundup, and we're like this is the best one that's all the information you might
[7724.04 → 7731.96] need at that point so maybe we just link to that product, and it's, and it's all done with hard to say
[7731.96 → 7741.72] but that's a good idea okay got another one here from Alan uh what do you think about having VR headsets
[7741.72 → 7746.76] that offload as much as the weight of possible to hang around the neck and on the shoulder like some
[7746.76 → 7756.04] Bluetooth headsets uh, uh p.src fire engine merch when okay well no promises for any fire oh dang it Dan
[7757.56 → 7764.20] no promises for any fire engine merch uh I think that that would really restrict the mobility yeah I think
[7764.20 → 7769.32] there are a lot of issues with that actually uh also I think they would move more
[7769.32 → 7776.28] yeah I could see that they'd have a higher potential to slide around and move more I think
[7776.28 → 7781.96] we just need them to get lighter plain and simple I don't think there's any way around it guys
[7788.68 → 7794.04] okay uh this is from an anonymous we've got it sorry we've got a bit of uh Dan's really far away
[7794.04 → 7799.72] so there's a bit of a line delay um you know when we're talking its kind of like on the news
[7799.72 → 7803.48] you know when the one-person finishes talking and the other person is like absolutely yeah
[7804.92 → 7807.24] thanks Dan it's been great having you on the show uh
[7809.16 → 7811.16] okay sorry go ahead yeah it's nice to be here
[7813.80 → 7820.04] okay this one's from anonymous uh what are you most afraid of in the coming decade nuclear war
[7820.04 → 7824.52] no, no no, no not uh not like three months like decade
[7827.08 → 7831.72] nuclear fallout nuclear winter other more different nuclear war um
[7833.48 → 7841.08] my children's generation um having no idea what to do with themselves in a world that is full of
[7841.08 → 7848.12] automation it's going to be really difficult I know there's this whole thing where like oh the older
[7848.12 → 7851.48] generations always look down at the younger generations and think they're weak or whatever
[7852.36 → 7859.48] I'm looking down and being like you guys are going to have a hard time like yikes yeah yeah
[7860.20 → 7867.40] it feels like we're trending in the other direction so yeah okay this is an interesting one this is by
[7867.40 → 7875.72] peter uh hi Ellen l I wonder how differently leg and MHD operate leg with 80 plus workers and multiple
[7875.72 → 7883.80] sponsored videos a day MHD with a small team irregular videos and hardly uh hardly ads uh why
[7883.80 → 7888.92] the difference okay well there are a couple of things uh first we do not have multiple sponsored
[7888.92 → 7893.96] videos a day boy would that ever be profitable oh I think I see what you mean okay so I was drawing
[7893.96 → 7900.68] a distinction between a fully sponsored video and a video with a sponsor like message in it uh so yeah
[7900.68 → 7906.12] I guess yeah I guess we have multiple videos a day uh Marquez has a relatively small team not as small
[7906.12 → 7915.88] as it used to be like oh boys hiring they're hiring over there you guys um but yes uh a much more
[7915.88 → 7925.16] irregular schedule um fewer sponsorships I mean they're just they're just different models right like
[7925.16 → 7934.36] the mark Robert model right is very different from either of us every single video that dude is
[7934.36 → 7943.08] swinging for the fences like if he doesn't get 30 40 50 million views I suspect his sponsors and
[7943.08 → 7950.44] partners are going to be are going to feel short-changed you know what I mean whereas we're built
[7950.44 → 7955.64] more along the lines of like hey we are going to up we upload you can't set your you can't set
[7955.64 → 7961.24] your watch to LTT, but you can certainly set your calendar we upload every day on a schedule there's
[7961.24 → 7966.12] no shortage of ideas if anything we don't have enough time to make all the videos that we want
[7966.12 → 7971.96] to make so you can count on us to have videos coming you can count on the quality to be consistent
[7971.96 → 7977.64] but you know what whether it's due to the sheer volume or whether it's due to the more niche nature of
[7977.64 → 7982.84] our subject it's not going to get 30 40 50 million views you'll expect somewhere in the
[7982.84 → 7989.08] neighbourhood of one to four million views something along those lines and you can adjust your
[7989.08 → 7995.80] expectations accordingly by the way because we know what our inventory is going to be a year in advance
[7996.44 → 8001.88] you can set up a retainer and you can kind of schedule out what you're going to want your quarterly
[8001.88 → 8006.36] spend to be coordinated that with your launches and whatever else it is that you need to do and
[8006.36 → 8012.12] that's the way that we kind of roll it as for Marquez I mean I don't have any insider information
[8012.12 → 8019.00] into how they're structured um obviously we sponsored a video with him recently and the process was
[8019.64 → 8025.48] really not that dissimilar to what it's like for a sponsor to sponsor a video with us so I think they
[8025.48 → 8031.96] are just you know maybe not swinging for the fences like a mark Robert it's still a more niche kind of
[8031.96 → 8039.08] subject than what mark does but I think that Marquez does tend to stay a little more on the
[8039.08 → 8047.64] mainstream side of tech and I think that um you know they're just they're doing what works for them
[8047.64 → 8055.40] right I don't know i not everyone aspires to do what we're doing here even if they could there's
[8055.40 → 8061.40] advantages and there are disadvantages to doing things different ways like I think the grass is always greener on
[8061.40 → 8069.00] the other side at creator summit I ran into a lot of you know one person bands um you know and i
[8069.00 → 8074.44] would look at them kind of enviously sometimes right like here they are they don't know one's calling them
[8075.32 → 8081.96] you know there's no one's asking them for direction um their their their monthly overhead is basically
[8081.96 → 8088.04] nothing if they decide to take two weeks off they just are not working for two weeks and there's no
[8088.04 → 8095.00] there's no cost associated with that other than an opportunity cost um but then you know they look
[8095.00 → 8101.24] at me and they go wait you posted a video five minutes ago we were talking five minutes ago I'm
[8101.24 → 8107.16] like well yeah I mean we've got like the team still in the office they're doing that you know and that to
[8107.16 → 8114.28] them is like mind-blowing right like wow that would be amazing but something I learned very early on is that
[8115.00 → 8123.96] the worst way to double your output is to hire twice as many people it just does not work like
[8123.96 → 8131.08] that there's just something inherent about building out a business that adds bloat and adds inefficiencies
[8131.08 → 8137.80] and adds communication problems hr issues especially as you scale and every time you kind of reach a new
[8137.80 → 8147.00] milestone of growth uh these problems compound right like there are I've had so many conversations
[8147.00 → 8154.52] that I would never in a thousand years have expected myself to have um I'm not I'm not going to get into
[8154.52 → 8162.20] any of them right now because I think people will know you'll know who you are but yeah it's its it's very
[8162.20 → 8169.24] challenging there's no it's kind of the beauty of YouTube I know I've talked a lot of negativity
[8169.24 → 8176.36] about YouTube over the years but you can kind of do it any way you want the only thing that matters
[8176.36 → 8182.76] is the result that you are creating content that people want to watch and I think that we have a
[8182.76 → 8187.72] very different audience from someone like a Marquez I think we have a smaller audience that is accustomed to
[8188.28 → 8195.40] tuning in daily whereas I think he has a broader audience that may or may not tune into every
[8195.40 → 8202.60] single video, and you can see that in the variations and viewership from one video to the next um
[8205.16 → 8210.60] and either way works right like seems he seems to be doing all right I'm definitely doing all right
[8210.60 → 8221.88] yeah that's your cue Dan I thought you were doing the camera well we don't really think the camera is
[8221.88 → 8229.56] the cue okay whatever then uh this one's uh anonymous I work as a engineer full-time and have thought
[8229.56 → 8235.32] of starting a side gig and slowly transitioning into that full-time if it is fruitful what practical
[8235.32 → 8240.04] gotchas would you keep an eye out for uh what would indicate the side gig is mature enough for a
[8240.04 → 8246.44] full-time transition money yeah is it enough money to support yourself it doesn't have to be the
[8246.44 → 8252.04] same amount of money you're making now, but you have to look for that trend line is it heading toward
[8252.76 → 8258.92] where what you're making now will what you're making now scale more and move out of reach does it make
[8258.92 → 8265.96] you happier right does it give you more time at home with your family for example um and most importantly
[8265.96 → 8274.36] is it enough to support yourself I would add in proof of concept first don't try to whatever it is that
[8274.36 → 8280.68] you're doing don't try to make the final thing first and then after having done all of that investment
[8281.72 → 8288.44] see if it's viable that's a perfect point you should do something just something anything just to
[8288.44 → 8293.32] find out if maybe you're the kind of person who just you might not even want to get motivated yep
[8293.32 → 8297.64] like if is you don't have an office to go to and people to talk to yeah you know what I mean like
[8297.64 → 8303.40] maybe you just won't feel like getting out of bed even though there might be some waste involved
[8303.40 → 8308.60] it is worth putting your toe in the water first instead of just diving in yeah
[8310.92 → 8316.68] okay got another one here from ELI hey guys first time merch buyer here with dlss3 technology on
[8316.68 → 8321.08] the horizon what do you think that AI enhanced technology could take gaming in terms of
[8321.08 → 8328.36] performance visuals etc I think it would be fascinating to see uh like procedurally generated
[8328.36 → 8334.68] assets in a game through AI like you know how I talked about before the idea of game development
[8334.68 → 8341.32] where you just make a brown cube and then say this is wood yeah and all of a sudden you've got like
[8341.32 → 8346.84] uh like a like a wooden crate box, or you know right or something like that um yeah you could
[8346.84 → 8352.20] add more to it, you could say like wooden chest yeah yeah i I think it would be fascinating
[8352.20 → 8356.28] because you know one of the things that's really immersion breaking for me in particular and to be
[8356.28 → 8365.00] clear I'm not I'm not saying that this is a big problem and I am so bothered by it but it does
[8365.00 → 8371.40] break the immersion for me when I notice duplicated assets if I walk into a grand ballroom and I notice
[8371.40 → 8376.28] that every single candle is exactly the same asset it can be a little immersion breaking dungeons and
[8376.28 → 8383.32] video games are a classic version of this yeah like oh they made four models for stone bricks like
[8383.32 → 8388.12] every Skyrim or not every Skyrim dungeon but like a huge portion of Skyrim dungeons are the same
[8388.12 → 8394.04] path but different like textures and stuff yeah so I think it would be super cool if instead of actually
[8394.04 → 8400.84] building out the individual models uh there was a game developer or game developers or an engine
[8400.84 → 8411.08] developer that made AI of an integral part of the game itself so when you when I say procedurally
[8411.08 → 8418.84] generated I don't mean like the layout of a dungeon I mean the look of it yeah so the developer like
[8418.84 → 8428.52] damp or yeah the developer would say it's its damp it transitions this way it's its uh it's gloomy
[8428.52 → 8435.88] it's granite it's its this it's that and you would just kind of you could go into each
[8435.88 → 8442.92] one I think it would be cool because you could make like enormous games and I really do i
[8442.92 → 8450.12] really do enjoy games that have uh like a sense of a vastness a sense of scale and exploration i
[8450.12 → 8455.16] think that's something that is going to continue to work better as we get technologies like direct
[8455.16 → 8462.52] storage in our games uh you know on pcs and stuff like that um you know being able to seamlessly roam
[8462.52 → 8469.88] from one environment to the next with no loading times and just you know go out in front of a verdant
[8469.88 → 8476.28] field I think it might be it could be kind of cool yeah like if every rock in a field was a bit
[8476.28 → 8484.52] different you know so that I think that deduplication of assets would be super cool yeah there
[8484.52 → 8492.12] that's one that's one idea has anyone done that like guys let me know there's been forms of it you
[8492.12 → 8499.16] could do it through procedural textures yeah but I think that I think that AI could probably do it better
[8499.16 → 8505.96] like if you really just put down white spheres, and we're like these are all skulls
[8507.32 → 8516.36] i I think it could be done like high resolution skull models totally should be like with current
[8516.36 → 8521.48] technology I think it'll just it would take a while for that to become main streamable yeah
[8522.68 → 8527.64] people keep on saying no man's sky I don't think it's quite that no, no no, no I think what you're
[8527.64 → 8533.00] talking about is like asset mutation almost like a developer would do one skull, and then you would
[8533.00 → 8538.04] say this skull is longer, and it has more teeth, or it could just modify it in different ways you're
[8538.04 → 8542.60] talking about like the input stuff that's happening to recently exactly, but you only have to do
[8542.60 → 8550.76] one um which would be kind of interesting uh yeah okay moving on um hi Linus and Luke been watching since
[8550.76 → 8557.88] the NCI act days uh what non-triple-a hidden gem game that you would recommend everybody play or
[8557.88 → 8563.88] at least try it's hard to recommend games to everyone yeah uh I feel like especially these days
[8563.88 → 8569.64] to be completely honest um unless it's like a Mario platformer it's you know usually they're a little
[8569.64 → 8573.80] bit more specific one of the ones that i I enjoy throwing out there is golf story I've done it a bunch of
[8573.80 → 8579.40] times though it's very fun uh if you are not interested in golf games it will still be fun
[8579.40 → 8582.92] it's not exactly a hidden gem game but I'm really enjoying battle block theatre with my son
[8583.72 → 8585.48] that's cool yeah it's fun nice
[8587.88 → 8588.68] oh minecraft
[8588.68 → 8596.60] risk is good
[8605.88 → 8609.56] man this is going to be one of those things that doesn't age well but I don't know that anything
[8609.56 → 8616.68] will ever go x86 mainstream yeah this is asking about uh if risk five is ever going to go mainstream
[8616.68 → 8622.76] it could go mainstream oh Dan was muted sorry guys uh the question is um how long do you think it will
[8622.76 → 8630.68] take risk five hardware to go x86 level mainstream I don't know that it will, I think it will go mainstream
[8630.68 → 8635.08] I think there being other things that exist will limit it from being able to go to the same level of
[8635.08 → 8642.52] mainstream but in a different way i I could see risk five being more of a competitor to arm like we
[8642.52 → 8651.08] could see risk five uh you know dominate low cost IOT devices we could see risk five moves into the data
[8651.08 → 8660.60] centre um I don't know that arm is going to make it in well I mean apple's making it work but like it's
[8660.60 → 8661.24] still niche
[8664.68 → 8672.36] I don't want to say never but given how long it's taken arm right, and we could we could think that
[8672.36 → 8679.24] maybe the life cycle would happen faster but i you know I think we're we're a long way away
[8682.52 → 8686.12] hey Linus and Luke what piece of media or technology from your childhood
[8686.84 → 8690.68] were you nostalgic for until you went back to it and realized it sucked
[8692.52 → 8700.20] pilot wings is not as good a game as I thought it's good it's very basic there's I think it's not that
[8700.20 → 8708.76] things were sucked, but they were definitely more basic than I realized like I was turns out pretty
[8708.76 → 8710.36] easy to amuse as a kid
[8712.76 → 8718.28] I think the scale for things has changed a lot like you can even see that with movies yeah like
[8718.28 → 8723.24] an explosion that was like huge and crazy back in the day is like nothing compared to what they're
[8723.24 → 8729.48] throwing in modern marvel stuff um I don't know I feel like I've been pretty realistic with things
[8729.48 → 8731.96] like even with borrowing I was going to say borrowing
[8733.40 → 8738.68] even with borrowing I've told people to not go back and play it yeah because like but did you ever
[8738.68 → 8744.28] have a moment when you went back and realized it sucked no, no okay so you always knew it I did go back
[8744.28 → 8749.40] yeah I would go back to it and be like yup these are all the reasons why this game aged really poorly
[8749.40 → 8754.52] um, and it's just like I still love it because I played it back then but I think it's really hard
[8754.52 → 8760.36] for people to get into now because it has a lot of these uh rough points uh battle block
[8760.36 → 8764.84] theatre was the title of the game I was talking about no I think everything that I enjoyed as a kid
[8764.84 → 8772.36] is exactly as awesome as I thought it was even the album aquarium by aqua yep
[8772.36 → 8780.12] I've um I mean that is just a good album it is a good album I will support you on that it's
[8780.12 → 8785.80] actually an excellent album yeah okay moving on from Egypt uh thank you for the quality content
[8785.80 → 8792.60] have you ever thought on trying to somehow get your hands on an AWS's graviton processor I think
[8792.60 → 8798.04] it'd be interesting to see what the cloud vendors custom processor has to offer the thing is that unless
[8798.04 → 8803.56] we went out and wrote software for it yeah we wouldn't be able to do anything with it like
[8803.56 → 8810.60] yeah it would definitely be cool to just like to take apart a graviton server, but that would be that
[8810.60 → 8814.92] would be kind of it we wouldn't be able to talk about much more than the hardware and why it's really
[8814.92 → 8817.56] cool and interesting that Amazon is building their own hardware
[8820.20 → 8825.48] yeah I don't know you want to build the float plane for graviton like no yeah me neither okay from
[8825.48 → 8829.96] anonymous starting from the tiny production that you did would you say that there was a point where
[8829.96 → 8834.28] you looked around, and it felt like things were going to be okay I still don't know if things are going
[8834.28 → 8840.20] to be okay yeah uh was there an increase in daily happiness comfort that came with the stability
[8840.20 → 8845.56] it sounds like it's just been sad for years well not sad but stressed yeah I don't think that stopped
[8845.56 → 8853.16] there the the the more stability we have at the base of this organization the more things we
[8853.16 → 8859.24] continue to pile on top of it right, and then you know if we think of it like uh you know if we think
[8859.24 → 8866.36] pyramid like uh like a corporate structure right at the top of that pile swaying in the slightest breeze
[8867.00 → 8874.76] is me if anything goes catastrophically wrong you know it all comes tumbling down
[8876.84 → 8883.00] probably not, but the stability is constantly increasing, but that doesn't stop me from you
[8883.00 → 8889.08] know seeing a day of uh viewership being down or store sales being down and going this could be
[8889.08 → 8894.44] it this could be the death spiral I feel like I feel like pretty much any business leader is going to
[8894.44 → 8903.16] feel that way um because that type of thinking is probably what got you to where you are um but there
[8903.16 → 8909.96] there I there is objectively very significantly more stability these days than there was at the beginning
[8909.96 → 8917.64] I don't know yeah definitely yeah okay this one's more of a demand than a question uh from Oliver
[8917.64 → 8923.32] pick an upcoming tech you are both most excited for we both have to be excited for it, I think it's
[8923.32 → 8930.36] individual, but we will let's make it is has to be one you have to collaborate for yeah AR I mean yeah but
[8930.36 → 8936.52] that's such an easy answer because we both have the memory of a sieve yes so I just need it to tell me
[8936.52 → 8941.24] who I'm highly important for both of us yeah like what their birthday is what their interests are
[8942.04 → 8952.20] yeah yep um more RGB I think no yeah I mean yeah better like I think I'm kind of over it RGB yeah
[8953.80 → 8957.72] I'm not going to lie I think I'm kind of done I don't know the land room that we set up recently it was
[8957.72 → 8965.00] pretty it's pretty cool yeah like the kids like it like I set up RGB strips um along the outside of the
[8965.00 → 8968.92] the girls bunk bed on each level so instead of having like a reading light instead of like a
[8968.92 → 8973.88] nightlight yeah they just have a RGB strip that shines out against the wall and like they love it
[8973.88 → 8977.80] it was fun to set that up for them that's cool I don't know like it's its one of those things where
[8977.80 → 8986.68] it totally has its uses for sure, but it can definitely be overdone yeah you're both excited
[8986.68 → 8992.76] about more RGB I think we dodged the question we can move on well I think AR realistically yeah but I do
[8992.76 → 8997.48] agree that it's a bit it's a bit easy for us because we both yeah for the same reason sure
[8998.04 → 9003.00] uh this is from Cosmo hey Linus uh you mentioned that you won't review the pi max VR headset because
[9003.00 → 9006.92] it doesn't fit you I'm wondering if you would consider giving it to another member of your team
[9006.92 → 9011.88] to review I have a pi max 5k and I'm absolutely loving it and want more people to know about it
[9012.60 → 9020.84] um yeah I mean I guess nothing would prevent anyone else from reviewing a VR headset I have been the one
[9020.84 → 9026.44] who has done our VR reviews in the past so no one else really has any experience reviewing a VR headset
[9026.44 → 9033.64] you need a lot of context to review VR devices um I don't know I could just take another crack at it
[9033.64 → 9043.56] maybe just suck it up princess and wear if it's fine it's yeah it was fine other than being horribly
[9043.56 → 9052.92] uncomfortable sounds for me for my kingly nose here grand deluxe, deluxe size special edition
[9056.44 → 9062.84] okay review is done uh we've got one from Quinton for Linus what technologies if any do you use as
[9062.84 → 9070.68] parenting tools um like 360 network level parental controls yeah I use Google's family link and then i
[9070.68 → 9078.76] use Microsoft's vastly inferior windows parental controls mostly our systems in the house are
[9078.76 → 9082.92] unlocked, and the kids can use them they're pretty good kids we haven't really had any problems with
[9082.92 → 9091.32] that yet I think that's about it okay I got one here from Adam what's the coolest concept you've
[9091.32 → 9098.28] tried and failed to figure out how to make into a video oh I mean man I've wanted to do a redux of like
[9098.28 → 9107.24] whole room water cooling for a long time, and it just has not materialized I'm actually bringing up the
[9107.24 → 9115.32] the dock right now the ideas dock yeah I'm sure I can find some stuff I wonder if that's one of the
[9115.32 → 9122.92] like oldest still consistently used Google Docs I think so yeah of like anyone because that's like
[9122.92 → 9129.56] very early Google Docs, and it's still being used uh the longest cable conversion is one that i
[9129.56 → 9135.16] want to do like convert a signal as many times as you can so you start with like a display port on
[9135.16 → 9139.80] a computer, and then you go to like HDMI, and you convert that to VGA, and you convert that to like
[9139.80 → 9145.00] composite convert that to component convert it back to HDMI convert it back to display port and then like
[9145.00 → 9151.88] plug into a monitor it's just it's like utterly pointless you know it's just because we can
[9151.88 → 9158.84] it sounds fun but yeah but like does anyone really need to know um oh yeah this is kind of a cool one
[9158.84 → 9163.80] just like owning an EV kind of sucks, and it was inspired by some difficulties that Brandon had
[9163.80 → 9169.16] with tesla that my in-laws had had with tesla that some of the other EV owners here had with their
[9169.16 → 9173.56] electric cars and just sort of talking about the challenges I think everyone talks about how amazing it is but
[9173.56 → 9180.92] there are downsides I don't know there 's's so much stuff in here man it's like it's literally
[9180.92 → 9188.12] hundreds and hundreds of line items I had the idea of a series called I can't believe they made this
[9188.92 → 9193.16] and it was just going to be just like wild stuff and there 's's a few kind of ideas that are in
[9193.16 → 9198.20] here for this i oh that was like kick farting I want to do a replacement on of like a motherboard socket
[9198.20 → 9203.16] show oh you know why it costs a hundred dollars even with all the appropriate tools if you bend the
[9203.16 → 9208.28] pins in your motherboard socket like to get it replaced there 's's just so much stuff in
[9208.28 → 9217.24] there okay from Eric given how far leg has come and all the milestones you didn't think it would reach
[9217.24 → 9226.12] has it made you predict and plan for the future in new ways um I don't actually for all my doomsday
[9226.12 → 9233.80] prophesying uh I don't actually think it's just going to disappear tomorrow anymore so I do plan for
[9233.80 → 9238.84] the future that's a big difference like I think in the early days I was afraid to make multi-year
[9238.84 → 9243.24] investments because I didn't believe that the company would necessarily still be there
[9243.24 → 9252.44] uh I think i I think I put on a brave face but I think we probably knew yeah it's pretty yeah
[9253.88 → 9259.40] um remember that job offer I got from I think uh Western Digital like shortly after we started up
[9259.40 → 9267.48] and I was like hmm this might have been a good thing to just take I'm glad I didn't have this worked out
[9267.48 → 9271.96] great yeah, but it was not a guarantee at that point in time yeah at least now you're not naming drive
[9271.96 → 9279.48] killers but um I still remember when and we're still using it i i I'm not going to name the
[9279.48 → 9285.00] service, but there's a service that I bought a bunch of credit for because it was on like some crazy like
[9285.00 → 9291.32] we're we're our company exists now and I was confident they were going to exist due to the
[9291.32 → 9297.96] people that were behind it and I bunch of bought a bunch of credit in it for float plane, and we're still
[9297.96 → 9303.08] riding on that credit because it was such a ridiculous discount oh seriously um and I was
[9303.08 → 9307.72] so confident that we were going to like to exist for a long time and I remember thinking that and being
[9307.72 → 9308.60] like this is different
[9311.64 → 9317.00] especially because float planes chances were a lot lower oh yeah the discount was crazy though
[9317.00 → 9321.80] right I've told you about this like way in the past yeah I just don't want to go into specifics okay
[9321.80 → 9328.76] oh this is cool oh yeah no go ahead oh yeah uh Luke I've still got my word 97 you signed for me at
[9328.76 → 9335.16] pax east years ago yes my question what's the weirdest coolest thing either one of you have signed for a
[9335.16 → 9342.04] fan uh PS beyond excited for labs and future engineering content I've had people have me sign body parts
[9342.04 → 9349.80] yeah but not like the ones you'd think oh like you know very few people ask tech bros to sign their
[9349.80 → 9356.68] breasts for example you know like you're stereotypical I have okay well that's that's the
[9356.68 → 9369.16] difference between us, I guess um yeah I'd say i I signed a fair number of sandals surprising number of
[9369.16 → 9376.20] sandals that's interesting yeah that makes sense yeah um I'm trying to think there's been a lot of
[9376.20 → 9383.40] like cool things like people would bring in like apart from their computer I've always thought
[9383.40 → 9388.28] the GPU backplate was pretty sweet people would just bring in the backplate, and they'd collect some
[9388.28 → 9395.88] signatures on it, I thought that was pretty cool um the word 97 like i literally the second I read
[9395.88 → 9401.32] I've still got my word 97 I knew exactly who it was when it was from everything because that was
[9401.32 → 9409.88] pretty cool um I like stuff like that but yeah oh this one's terrifying uh Daryl what do you think
[9409.88 → 9417.80] of Google matter the new Google home connection standard I hope it succeeds as a single unified standard
[9417.80 → 9427.56] I have my notes maybe it doesn't even make it to the end of this year I don't know look up uh xkcd's
[9427.56 → 9435.00] standards no for real though this may not be that oh okay yeah all right it might be good
[9436.20 → 9442.52] okay and last one here is from uh Alejandro with Ea confirming plans to create intrusive anti-treat
[9442.52 → 9448.20] rootkits akin to riots Valorant uh what are your thoughts on companies expanding rootkit development
[9448.20 → 9453.96] and potentially testing gaming performance seems like a perfect time to start getting into the
[9453.96 → 9458.36] idea of partitions for gaming oh, oh interesting yeah
[9461.32 → 9466.12] VMS create a lot of issues um yeah they do especially with things like cheat detection
[9466.12 → 9472.28] um, so yeah partitions for gaming get that boot speed down and start switching
[9474.76 → 9479.40] I like it, we've actually got like 11 incoming merch messages so maybe I'll blitz through these
[9479.40 → 9483.96] real quick yeah have a look see if any of those are interesting to you there's actually one I think
[9483.96 → 9489.64] I'll read out here uh with the labs creating custom software and even hardware for testing
[9489.64 → 9494.60] is there any plans to make those tools public or open source we've actually got a video coming
[9494.60 → 9502.68] about this uh very soon we're going to be showing off our uh our benchmarking tool named mark
[9503.96 → 9510.60] mark bench that's pretty great mark bench the benchmark, and it's an automated tool for benchmarking
[9510.60 → 9516.76] games we're also going to add compatibility for productivity tools and right now it's fairly rudimentary
[9516.76 → 9524.04] it just is kind of just an automation tool with us with a simple GUI that logs the data
[9524.60 → 9531.48] uh logs data like frame times um thermals power consumption that sort of thing but over time we
[9531.48 → 9538.12] do want to make it significantly more robust and I would like to make it available to the community
[9538.12 → 9542.76] for personal use, and maybe we have commercial licensing available for other outlets I don't
[9542.76 → 9547.56] know what that would look like there's a lot of questions to be answered but yes it is my desire to
[9547.56 → 9553.32] make it broadly available there's a lot of confusion about my partitions comment uh I did not foresee
[9553.32 → 9560.76] this, but there is I don't mean like installing your games on another partition uh I mean booting into
[9560.76 → 9566.76] like another operating system uh like have if you just use windows have another one installed
[9567.80 → 9575.24] is what I'm saying the only motorcycle I've ever owned is a sv650s Levi it's a 2003 and my dream
[9575.24 → 9582.52] motorcycle is that one painted pink to be clear I mean an additional window so you could have if you're
[9582.52 → 9589.00] Windows 11 person you could have two windows 11s one installed on another drive or partition is
[9589.00 → 9592.92] another way that I should have said it so you could have two boot drives, or you could have uh two boot
[9592.92 → 9598.68] partitions and you separate things you separate uh all your personal stuff all your important things
[9598.68 → 9604.20] etc and then games uh we do seem to be trending in that direction and I actually do genuinely think
[9604.20 → 9610.36] that's going to be an uh decently good way to do it okay
[9614.12 → 9620.44] uh well the problem is um I still don't actually know if they time out will they show if we click
[9620.44 → 9625.08] show Luke if they time out yeah because you know they have the 180-second timer or whatever
[9626.60 → 9630.60] uh what then they would go into the queue so they would show yeah they would show
[9630.60 → 9636.04] so if they're in the queue yeah okay so you can put them in the queue after they time out that's
[9636.04 → 9642.12] fine what's the purpose of the time-out any more than uh you know the timer right the 180 second
[9642.12 → 9647.00] timer when they start coming I think it's supposed to automatically show if that happens that doesn't
[9647.00 → 9649.08] seem good because then stuff could slip through
[9649.08 → 9657.88] they will Conrad says they will okay it should be in the dock it should be in the dock about them
[9657.88 → 9663.72] about the messages dirt face Larry no I did not see uh rubies garage's video about towing with the
[9663.72 → 9668.04] f-150 lighting I saw that it existed I didn't actually watch the video, but it's a perfect
[9668.04 → 9675.32] question uh can EVS overcome their dependence on aerodynamics or get higher efficiency batteries to compensate um
[9675.32 → 9685.00] um, so there's a whole thing right about the with the energy density like of hydrocarbons like
[9685.00 → 9695.32] gasoline right it's really really really really high like it's actually amazing how much
[9695.32 → 9702.76] energy is stored in those bonds such that we can so inefficiently extract it by literally just burning it
[9702.76 → 9710.28] and it is we're still able to accomplish so much with so little I don't know that EV batteries will
[9710.28 → 9718.20] ever be able to achieve that kind of power to weight ratio, and it may always be a challenge
[9719.24 → 9726.76] um with that said I think that for a lot of people what they do with something like a pickup truck
[9726.76 → 9734.52] can probably be handled by an EV pickup and for those who need to actually haul a lot there will
[9734.52 → 9740.60] be larger commercial vehicles that will be designed for that like tesla semi which hopefully is really
[9740.60 → 9748.20] good, but you know who knows right yeah um yeah i I have my doubts it's possible that we will be reliant
[9748.20 → 9753.96] on fossil fuels for quite a long time I just hope that we can reduce our use of them as much as possible
[9757.56 → 9766.04] um okay sorry Matthew s no we haven't really thought about working with a local high school on the
[9766.04 → 9773.08] video or tech side I don't know what we would do with them exactly uh well I mean there was that time
[9773.08 → 9778.36] that we talked to my kids school about like upgrading their computer lab, and they were basically like yeah
[9778.36 → 9784.52] they have to be max and I was like okay well I don't really have any hookups for that yeah so I guess
[9784.52 → 9792.44] you guys can just keep whatever you have now so that was something um are they all max right now
[9793.24 → 9799.88] uh it's a that was a different school that my son was at before uh David Andre asks what does Ltd do
[9799.88 → 9805.72] to cover the energy usage of all the equipment that you use carbon credits solar power for HQ and lab
[9805.72 → 9813.40] curious after your home solar videos um nothing I mean carbon credits are like pretty debatable
[9813.40 → 9819.56] whether they are actually helpful what even are they basically you just buy like
[9821.32 → 9830.36] uh an ease like an uh a feel better thing yeah pretty much so if you pollute you like
[9830.36 → 9837.24] by feeling better by giving money to companies that are working on like green initiatives or
[9837.24 → 9842.52] something like that okay um yeah we're all hydropower here though yeah it's honestly something
[9842.52 → 9848.76] that I sleep pretty well knowing yeah to be clear hydropower is not perfect it has other issues but once
[9848.76 → 9860.12] the dam is there yeah the milk is sort of spilled to a degree yeah um yeah uh let's just get through these last few
[9860.36 → 9866.44] Brandon r says peace and love guys you mentioned a music producer pc wild oh good gravy uh yes we
[9866.44 → 9873.24] will do it eventually I'm so sorry oh Sam h labs take a long time I got a new desk and was wondering when
[9873.24 → 9880.68] the cable management things would be out uh sometime next year and Frankie f do you plan on hiring anyone
[9880.68 → 9889.32] interested in the USA uh or expanding to the USA no I don't have any plans of expanding to the USA
[9889.32 → 9898.60] as a not American expanding to the USA is a non-trivial task we'd have to like incorporate
[9898.60 → 9904.52] in America and there are all kinds of legal implications with all of that and I don't want to
[9905.40 → 9914.20] anonymous bit off-topic uh what are what are the items maybe tech that you must have in your car
[9915.00 → 9921.72] I'm new to driving and want to be prepared what are your must-haves got your emergency blankets got your
[9921.72 → 9934.52] first aid kit got your tire pump um I've got a lighter to uh 120 volt and USB adapter inverter do dad
[9934.52 → 9945.08] um I like go for it, I hoard napkins always have a napkin hoard and uh some ketchup in my glove box
[9945.88 → 9955.24] um in bc I think it's a decent idea to have those like strap-on cleat things for your shoes um they're
[9955.24 → 9959.16] they're not very expensive, and you can just throw them in your trunk and forget about them until you
[9959.16 → 9967.32] need them, and they'll be fine um some amount of uh stable food and water it might not be for you
[9967.32 → 9970.76] like that's something to think about with all of this stuff is it might not be for you
[9972.28 → 9976.36] yeah those jumper battery banks I have one of those in the van I don't have one in the volt
[9977.32 → 9983.64] uh flashlights yeah sunglasses lots of good suggestions tons of this stuff is you don't you don't
[9983.64 → 9988.68] even if you're like oh I just like drive to work and back like this is never going to be applicable
[9988.68 → 9994.12] again it might not be for you maybe uh you need to help someone find their dog so having a flashlight
[9994.12 → 9999.80] so you can look around would be cool I don't know its just things that would be uh nice and helpful
[9999.80 → 10006.60] to have crampons is that what it's called finally Travis asks what are your favourite games to play with
[10006.60 → 10013.16] your so um Von and I picked up overcooked again recently it's been pretty fun whatever she wants to
[10013.16 → 10019.96] play is really what I'll take yeah I'll accept that yeah all right I think that's it for the show
[10020.52 → 10025.64] thank you guys so much for watching we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[10025.64 → 10030.28] oh my don't do the thing okay, okay you can, I mean you can do it but not through there just do it through
[10030.28 → 10034.52] here I don't know how to do that I already pushed it oh it's not doing if it's not doing it
[10035.24 → 10039.56] do you have the server run I push it again let's make sure I'm working the server is working properly
[10039.56 → 10060.12] uh-oh I think this is did you set it up before the show I think so there we go and the button hey
[10060.12 → 10076.28] uh are you turning this off is my mic is it still live oh Geez the cursor oh
