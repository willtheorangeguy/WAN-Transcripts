[67.84 --> 80.64]  podcast is
[84.56 --> 91.12]  the show is brought to you today by mechanicalkeyboards.com freshbooks and see sonic
[91.12 --> 99.12]  all right why don't we jump right into the big topic luke and i were gaming last night and we were
[99.12 --> 105.92]  both some of us made a more earnest effort than others we were both trying to not talk about this
[105.92 --> 113.28]  because we wanted to save it for the show so we are fresh we are fresh coming out of learning about
[113.28 --> 123.92]  the news of microsoft 68.7 billion dollar acquisition of activision blizzard luke pro or
[124.88 --> 130.72]  actually i think i already know the answer because i saw the thumbnail and james came and independently
[130.72 --> 136.48]  talked to both of us about how we feel about it how could you possibly support this move i'm excited
[136.48 --> 141.92]  i was excited i was so hoping that you were going to be against it so that we could fight about it because
[141.92 --> 147.60]  i was like this this will be such a boring show if we're both on the same side let's go let's go
[147.60 --> 153.60]  let's go indeed let's go let's go take luke out back let's pokemon go to the polls put him down
[154.16 --> 159.52]  because clearly he's gone senile he's speaking about putting down i have to get the joke out now
[159.52 --> 162.88]  someone in flow plane chat i don't remember exactly how they worded it which is why i have to say it now
[162.88 --> 168.16]  but they say 68.7 billion i don't know about you but i 68.7 with my girlfriend
[168.16 --> 175.12]  okay i mean that's the one i want to say before the show it rounds up
[177.44 --> 183.76]  nice it's almost there it's almost nice okay okay so uh yeah they they bought activision blizzard at
[183.76 --> 192.08]  95 per share after the announcement the shares went up to 84 so it's still a premium on that uh okay
[192.08 --> 198.40]  this would bring microsoft's total number of studios to 32. yeah wow that's quite a few that's kind of
[198.40 --> 207.36]  crazy here's a little here's a little screen cap of uh there it is that's that's microsoft's xbox
[207.36 --> 220.24]  first party studios wow mojang obsidian bethesda zenimax 343 sledgehammer i don't think this really
[220.24 --> 226.24]  even has no this doesn't this isn't even everything yeah it's like it just says blizzard here like
[227.04 --> 233.76]  yeah okay how many teams are there at blizzard like this this quantity does not fully represent
[233.76 --> 241.52]  um microsoft's well it's still a studio right yeah it is one studio sure they made the font a little
[241.52 --> 246.24]  bigger but still a lot a lot of other companies would have it under multiple studios so yeah it's
[246.24 --> 250.88]  it's not very representative of everything everything there's also some studios in here like toys for bob
[251.28 --> 255.76]  um that as far as my understanding goes over the last little while have been mostly relegated to just
[255.76 --> 262.56]  like a call of duty support studio um that theoretically under microsoft will go back to making games
[262.56 --> 268.08]  yeah okay which is which is cool well carry on you still haven't really given me a super compelling
[268.08 --> 274.40]  so core fundamentals of my side i guess because the whole idea is pretty simple right microsoft
[274.40 --> 279.44]  buys activision blizzard that includes king obviously a lot of people are calling it abk these days because
[279.44 --> 283.76]  king makes so much freaking money that they should probably be included in the name crush um
[283.76 --> 294.00]  um someone had to buy them is kind of my stance almost every thing that they have has been declining
[294.80 --> 299.84]  there's sexual harassment stuff like crazy i'm really pissed that bobby kodak is a part of the deal
[299.84 --> 306.00]  and he's actually coming i wish they were just getting rid of him um it sounds like he is maybe either
[306.00 --> 312.96]  planning an out within i this is entirely rumor to be very clear there are informed people whatever the
[312.96 --> 318.40]  heck that means um saying that he could be planning it out within two years unless he's pivoting to
[318.40 --> 325.44]  like their like uh consultancy advisory person for microsoft's push into the metaverse whatever the
[325.44 --> 331.68]  heck that even means okay so one of those uh ceremonial symbolic types of yes who knows though
[331.68 --> 336.80]  what what's going to happen there i just hope that they get rid of them um because that would be
[336.80 --> 342.16]  awesome there's there's a big clash that is i think inevitably going to happen um
[344.40 --> 350.72]  microsoft has consumed a lot of studios recently we thought we saw the bethesda zenimax id mojang
[350.72 --> 354.72]  before that mojang before that traditionally they don't fire people when they do that
[355.60 --> 360.24]  they bring people on and they bring studios on and they let them just sit there and keep doing their
[360.24 --> 365.12]  thing and everything's okay they've been very nice and clean that way i almost hope that they are not
[365.12 --> 371.52]  this time um activision blizzard has been going through this thing lately where they are kind of
[371.52 --> 377.84]  cutting out some rot there's been all this like sexual harassment and just bad play general toxicity
[377.84 --> 383.60]  bad toxicity all this bad things and i don't think they're done and i don't necessarily know that they
[383.60 --> 391.52]  will be done by the time this deal is closed and microsoft has a very open inclusive just better work
[391.52 --> 398.88]  environment and culture and i hope that those clash and activision blizzard gets cleaned up by this
[398.88 --> 406.16]  acquisition um i i do not hope that the good people working there get axed obviously but i hope the bad
[406.16 --> 412.24]  people that are working there get axed um but yeah i think it was somewhat inevitable that there was going
[412.24 --> 419.92]  to be either um a falling out of the studios or someone was going to buy them or something and when you
[419.92 --> 424.56]  look at the list of alternatives i think that microsoft was good okay who has the list of
[424.56 --> 435.12]  alternatives hit me uh potentially uh what are they even called the chinese tencent okay who already i
[435.12 --> 440.40]  believe owned a decently significant part of the company i mean with the way that china's cracking
[440.40 --> 446.40]  down on gaming i i don't know if that would have been in the cards but you know yeah i mean yeah they
[446.40 --> 452.08]  might be looking you know long long long term and and tencent owns studios that very very much folk
[452.08 --> 457.28]  like i don't think activision blizzard counts as this necessarily but tencent owns at least part of
[457.28 --> 464.64]  certain studios that very much focus on just the western market not china so they're an investment
[464.64 --> 470.40]  thing they're not necessarily um hey i mean there really isn't many because there isn't that many
[470.40 --> 476.32]  places they're gonna have 70 billion dollars um of just like free money that they can pay in cash for
[476.32 --> 487.04]  some company um so it i mean it's like tencent i i don't know if they have the money um but ea i don't
[487.04 --> 491.12]  think they'd have the money no that'd be more of a merger yeah uh and then there's there's other
[491.12 --> 498.56]  potential companies talking about like google netflix actually amazon uh because all those companies are
[498.56 --> 504.48]  trying to get into like subscription gaming models sure but google in particular has demonstrated that
[504.48 --> 510.56]  they don't seem to have the the commit level to spend that kind of money on an acquisition amazon
[510.56 --> 515.04]  seems to want to kind of go it's funny it's almost like a grassroots approach where they're trying to
[515.04 --> 520.40]  start they're trying to start their own new ips and stuff yeah their own yeah um and no other company
[521.04 --> 525.04]  netflix is sort of on the struggle bus right now i don't think they're looking to spend
[525.04 --> 532.32]  they're not gonna have something the only real option was microsoft um okay so basically you're
[532.32 --> 541.04]  saying i think the properties it's a poo sandwich yes but we had to eat it yeah and this was the right
[541.60 --> 548.24]  member of the team to take that bite uh no i don't mean that i don't mean activision blizzard is the
[548.24 --> 554.96]  poo sandwich i mean i in my personal opinion more consolidation in the gaming industry is a poo sandwich
[554.96 --> 562.80]  i think this is terrible for gamers so on the one hand yeah game pass is great microsoft's generally
[562.80 --> 568.72]  more open approach to gaming this generation things like uh intergenerational controller compatibility
[568.72 --> 575.12]  um i think has sent a pretty good message microsoft has started to engage with the right to repair
[575.12 --> 580.24]  movement for example yeah sure it's only on the surf that cheap surface laptop for students so far
[580.24 --> 585.52]  more things but hopefully that will that will become a cultural shift at microsoft so yeah yeah
[585.52 --> 590.00]  there's a lot of things that microsoft is doing really well but if there's anything that history
[590.00 --> 598.16]  has ever taught us it's that once a monopoly exists it always always always screws you oh yeah so
[599.20 --> 606.56]  think about it you guys microsoft is running out spending literally tens of billions of dollars on game
[606.56 --> 613.92]  studio and ip acquisitions right now in order to build out their their games as a service product
[613.92 --> 619.20]  right yeah they said specifically that they're going to bring as many of these games as possible to game
[619.20 --> 624.48]  pass as soon as possible right that is clearly the goal and then the other side of the goal like yes they
[624.48 --> 631.20]  said oh we want to keep call of duty on playstation blah blah blah we want inter opera sort of yeah they
[631.20 --> 636.96]  didn't really say it that way right they said they will honor current contracts so that's a big problem
[636.96 --> 643.84]  because all of a sudden now we're taking what was becoming kind of a positive thing we we have a lot of
[643.84 --> 651.28]  cross play these days um the gaming community is as big as it has ever been and it feels like we are opening
[651.28 --> 660.80]  up a door to go backwards here where it's pretty much xbox and windows or gtfo and you got to give
[660.80 --> 666.08]  credit to valve you got to give credit to gabe newell and his team for seeing the writing on the
[666.08 --> 672.96]  wall here like how long ago did they start working on steam os yeah five six seven we don't even know
[672.96 --> 678.88]  when valve started working on what would be eventually become the steam deck because steam
[678.88 --> 684.88]  machines was what like five years ago and obviously that didn't just start up overnight yeah um very
[684.88 --> 690.48]  likely around that time frame like seeing that that that looming specter of microsoft monopoly
[690.48 --> 697.36]  coming that long ago kind of incredible someone brought up uh where did it go no someone said
[697.36 --> 700.80]  there after this acquisition i don't remember exactly where it is but they said after this
[700.80 --> 707.44]  acquisition microsoft will still be third uh will be third still behind sony it's like yes and the
[707.44 --> 713.76]  reason why you know that is because microsoft has told you that multiple times um because they don't
[713.76 --> 717.20]  want to get slapped with antitrust so they're trying to be like guys guys guys we're still not the biggest
[717.20 --> 722.40]  we're still not the biggest it's not a monopoly but they're they're microsoft has always been very
[722.40 --> 727.20]  happy to consume things around them i'm not saying like oh microsoft is amazing i'm so happy that they're
[727.20 --> 735.60]  buying this i think this is um out of a list of bad endings probably one of the least bad in the midterm
[735.60 --> 744.24]  but in the long term i think this is terrible for gamers in the long term microsoft is absolutely a
[744.24 --> 751.20]  cloud first company going forward yeah and we've had experiences with that i mean just last night we
[751.20 --> 754.72]  couldn't get into a halo infinite multiplayer game why because we couldn't connect to the microsoft
[754.72 --> 761.04]  server oh yeah i'm highly concerned about multiplayer gaming gaming had a solution to that 20 years ago it
[761.04 --> 768.40]  was called community servers and they didn't all go down at the same time this is not worse blizzard's
[768.40 --> 778.48]  current goal with diablo on xbox what one is it uh i don't remember which diablo it is but if it if
[778.48 --> 784.96]  it didn't call home for a certain amount of time you wouldn't be able to play it anymore yeah so like
[784.96 --> 792.40]  it's it's not blizzard was already just as evil or more evil in all of these ways so like i don't
[792.40 --> 797.60]  i don't think it's becoming a lesser of those evils by becoming part of microsoft okay that's fair
[797.60 --> 802.88]  blizzard was already horrible blizzard yes and that's why i'm more okay with this i think they
[802.88 --> 808.08]  actually become less horrible because of this i would rather they were under someone else no one else
[808.08 --> 813.44]  that would be better has 70 billion dollars in cash to spend on something like this and probably because
[813.44 --> 816.40]  they're not as horrible which is why they don't have that much money in the bank
[819.36 --> 827.12]  ah all right i feel like you've i feel like you've come around to me a little bit okay dark jackie says
[827.12 --> 832.24]  uh blizzard servers go down regularly so what's the difference the point is not an outage the point is
[832.24 --> 836.56]  the single point of failure the point is that the whole thing's going to be running on azure or
[836.56 --> 842.40]  whatever it is that microsoft's running it on in the back end it's gonna be really bad and that it's when
[842.40 --> 846.56]  it's down it's down for everyone with community servers with the old way that we used to do
[846.56 --> 851.84]  multiplayer it was almost like i kind of feel like in another five or ten years someone's going to
[851.84 --> 857.04]  come around and they're going to reinvent the concept of multiplayer server hosting and it's
[857.04 --> 863.04]  good it's going to be basically huge it's going to be huge no way this is crazy it'll never go down and
[863.04 --> 869.12]  it's like peer-to-peer and it's distributed and it's super resilient it's defy networking
[872.16 --> 879.28]  i uh yeah i don't know someone someone i've talked on this show about how rough multiplayer is with
[879.28 --> 884.48]  microsoft right now you know like multiplayer and forza is like basically not even a thing because it's
[884.48 --> 891.28]  so brutal yeah um it's a it's a problem someone tweeted out i meant to bring it onto the show but
[891.28 --> 896.32]  i forgot i don't know if i screen did i screenshot i might have screenshot it um but they they said like
[896.32 --> 900.32]  the editing software that they were using wouldn't work because the windows store was down it couldn't
[900.32 --> 906.56]  call home through the windows store um like there's there's definitely negative things i'm i'm very
[906.56 --> 911.76]  concerned about uh what is going to become the state of multiplayer for a lot of these games if they try to
[911.76 --> 921.60]  run it through microsoft um microsoft on pc i should say um it's because it's just it's it's really bad
[921.60 --> 925.68]  it's really really bad i like christopher m's topic here this is actually something i was thinking and
[925.68 --> 929.76]  then totally forgot about because you put me under your spell with your blonde hair and blue eyes
[930.32 --> 934.40]  uh hate that activision gets bought out when they're in the decline why can't we just let them
[934.40 --> 940.56]  sink or swim like just fine fine if they if they suck and this wasn't sustainable anymore
[940.56 --> 945.12]  uh yeah you're probably right they're not going to sink it's not going to happen they have king
[946.08 --> 953.12]  they have cod and yeah blizzard's dying but they have like the king and cod by themselves are just
[953.12 --> 957.84]  massive they're not going to sink yes they were doing worse yes their share prices went down but
[957.84 --> 963.60]  their share price was no longer going down and like all their games are in decline but they're they're too
[963.60 --> 969.44]  big they're not going to sink they have so much money uh but yeah it was it was moore's law is dead
[969.44 --> 973.36]  a youtube channel and he tweeted i'm sorry to report that today's video will be delayed due to
[973.36 --> 981.84]  microsoft store going down and my editing apps license being tied to the store like what that's
[981.84 --> 988.00]  so brutal um things i am excited about there are very negative things right like i'm very concerned
[988.00 --> 993.04]  about the state of multiplayer moving forward yeah i'm very concerned about uh the pc side of things
[993.04 --> 999.60]  with uh uh uh being tied into the microsoft store being tied into xbox multiplayer features being
[999.60 --> 1005.04]  tied into anything like that that is all a massive concern because they are they are worst in class in
[1005.04 --> 1012.48]  all of those things i think ubisoft i think origin uh or ea whatever i think steam all of those platforms
[1012.48 --> 1019.60]  epic games all of those platforms do multiplayer friends lists invites lobbies they do all of that stuff
[1019.60 --> 1023.60]  massively massively massively better than microsoft does yeah and it's actually like it's kind of
[1023.60 --> 1028.88]  embarrassing pathetic it's very embarrassing very pathetic the state that microsoft's uh multiplayer
[1028.88 --> 1035.28]  stuff is at i mean we had me you and your brother and between the three of us it took like a solid two
[1035.28 --> 1042.24]  minutes to figure out how to get rich into the multiplayer lobby yep that's um yeah it's embarrassing
[1042.24 --> 1048.64]  it's it's embarrassing and like okay so lots of negatives massive consolidation in the game industry
[1048.64 --> 1054.80]  that's really bad multiplayer stuff really bad lots of very glaring negatives one potential positive
[1054.80 --> 1065.20]  side of things is microsoft's multi-faceted um expertise operating systems manufacturing sure etc
[1065.20 --> 1073.28]  um could bring back old old ips that are under this gaming studio that have just been rotting
[1073.28 --> 1078.08]  like guitar hero and a bunch of other games that could be interesting that could be cool
[1079.20 --> 1086.32]  exclusive to xbox probably or at least exclusive to game pass i'm sure microsoft would would be
[1086.32 --> 1093.04]  would be wetting themselves is game pass on playstation no not now but i'm sure that's i'm pretty sure
[1093.04 --> 1096.56]  they've even talked about that being an ultimate goal at some point in the future
[1096.56 --> 1104.16]  and once you once you do that the playstation is essentially an xbox essentially well they've
[1104.16 --> 1108.00]  they've been trending towards computers we've been talking about that for years yep consoles
[1108.00 --> 1115.76]  becoming just more and more like just computers you put on your tv i i i still hate it for all the
[1115.76 --> 1121.36]  reasons that i already said i think that a duopoly is all right i guess we at least have a triopoly although
[1121.36 --> 1128.24]  nintendo it's like you got their own ship yeah you've got microsoft and sony kind of duking it out
[1128.24 --> 1135.76]  in the ring right you know like if we use a boxing match analogy and then nintendo is just like kind of
[1136.56 --> 1143.04]  they're outside of the arena they're like in a park and they're playing with little like trucks and
[1143.04 --> 1148.80]  they're like you know when you go to a hockey game and they're like a like a kid's hockey game sure and
[1148.80 --> 1151.76]  there's always like the kids on the ice that are playing and being serious and all that kind of
[1151.76 --> 1155.60]  stuff and then there's like the brothers of a few kids on the ice that are just like messing around
[1155.60 --> 1160.32]  behind the behind the seats playing hockey in the back that's nintendo yeah they're just they they're
[1160.32 --> 1169.44]  playing with themselves yeah in all the right ways so a duopoly then is better than a monopoly and
[1169.44 --> 1178.08]  right now i i mean i i didn't believe it even a year ago uh but sony is on the ropes i don't see
[1178.08 --> 1185.36]  how they come back from this they literally cannot afford they cannot afford to build a competitor
[1185.36 --> 1190.16]  to game pass in a reasonable amount of time especially if microsoft is running out buying
[1190.16 --> 1197.92]  every game studio that matters now the real nail that microsoft could put in the coffin of any
[1197.92 --> 1204.56]  potential competition is if they start to give game developers some kind of reasonable work-life
[1204.56 --> 1210.40]  balance if microsoft could actually change the culture of the gaming industry through the
[1210.40 --> 1216.24]  subscription model right through that that constant recurring revenue model if they could actually shift
[1216.24 --> 1224.96]  that it would be impossible to recruit talent away from microsoft at that point yeah um how many people
[1224.96 --> 1232.80]  are subscribed to game xbox game pass i don't know if they've listed numbers 25 million have they okay
[1232.80 --> 1238.24]  there you go well they announced at this acquisition point so this this post is from three days ago
[1238.24 --> 1242.88]  because i remember phil spencer said and i didn't remember the exact number but i thought it was 24 25
[1242.88 --> 1247.20]  he said we have 25 million subscribers which gives you some idea of what a long game they're playing
[1247.20 --> 1253.20]  because that like 10 to 15 a month or whatever that's sure it's a lot of money it's you know 30
[1253.20 --> 1259.04]  something million dollars a month but think about trying to pay off 70 but yeah think about paying off a 70
[1259.04 --> 1266.96]  billion dollar debt at that point you're not making a sensible business transaction from an investment
[1266.96 --> 1274.64]  standpoint um you'd be better off putting that 70 billion dollars in a gic you know like in terms of
[1274.64 --> 1283.04]  when you're going to get a return on it what you're buying is no competition essentially so that's
[1283.52 --> 1288.72]  terrifying you know when you when you look at a deal like this and you go yeah there's no there's no
[1288.72 --> 1294.08]  obvious um there's no obvious roi on this now obviously blizzard is going to games passes game
[1294.08 --> 1297.92]  pass is not the the be all and end all of the revenue that they'll get through the activision
[1297.92 --> 1302.88]  blizzard deal they make they make their own money through the play store through the app store uh with
[1302.88 --> 1313.36]  king and obviously on blizzard's own ips and all that good stuff but this is a long long return no matter
[1313.36 --> 1323.04]  how you slice it uh invisible ray says oh go ahead i do think if they if they move titles like um
[1324.48 --> 1329.36]  like call of duty and stuff if they start allowing that those types of things on game pass i think
[1329.36 --> 1334.32]  that's massive subscriber numbers that will come in because of that yeah that's fair if they move
[1335.20 --> 1341.76]  already subscription model games which i think the only one activision blizzard has is wow but if they
[1341.76 --> 1347.20]  move things like that to game pass that's an audit like if you just moved like four million people
[1347.20 --> 1352.08]  or how many people still pay for wow yep which i don't think we know i don't think they've published
[1352.08 --> 1361.84]  numbers in a long time um subscribers but you'd have to think that if they're the latest wow subscriber
[1361.84 --> 1374.24]  count for 2021 shows 4.74 bill uh sorry wait what i have no idea for yeah 4.74 million um so that would
[1374.24 --> 1379.52]  be automatically tacked on so that just wow would bring them to 30 million game pass subscribers
[1379.52 --> 1382.64]  if they added it to game pass which you don't necessarily know that they will but that also
[1382.64 --> 1387.52]  assumes that all of those people do not already have game pass true which they might fair so then you
[1387.52 --> 1393.04]  might be just giving away revenue there's definitely gonna be a lot of that especially i think with the
[1393.04 --> 1397.36]  console focused games like cod i think you're gonna have a lot of people that already have game pass
[1397.36 --> 1404.00]  yep so i think we've kind of exhausted what we have to say about that um invisible ray did say they
[1404.00 --> 1408.64]  are linus sony's releasing this year apparently it's called project sparticus uh yeah so sony will have
[1408.64 --> 1414.56]  a game pass competitor the problem is that with what games on it yeah compared to all the studios that
[1414.56 --> 1420.72]  microsoft is snapping up i mean as crazy as it sounds nintendo may be the only one who's positioned
[1420.72 --> 1426.16]  to compete and their cloud gaming services are is even worse than microsoft's are awful worse than
[1426.16 --> 1431.28]  everyone is there anyone who does it worse than nintendo no i i mean i just i don't know if i can
[1431.28 --> 1437.04]  think of a company that is more hostile towards its users than nintendo i don't even i don't even
[1437.60 --> 1442.24]  think i always forget that they have an online service to be honest yeah like the whole thing where
[1442.24 --> 1448.72]  you can't uh you can't back up your save files unless you pay them a monthly fee there's an sd card
[1448.72 --> 1454.32]  sitting in the unit and they will not allow you to put your save files on it so that you will pay for
[1454.32 --> 1462.88]  nintendo online are you kidding me so if you're through no fault of your own if your switch dies and
[1462.88 --> 1471.92]  you didn't happen to have nintendo's backup service that's it just gone isn't that unbelievable just
[1471.92 --> 1478.08]  gone it's because they hate you that's the only explanation that i can come up with for it because
[1478.08 --> 1486.88]  there's no other reason just brutal yeah jaden said microsoft made uh original xbox out of fear of sony
[1486.88 --> 1490.56]  dominating the living room their monopolistic tendencies are present in everything they do
[1491.92 --> 1496.80]  sure yeah fair enough but one monopoly is not better than another more different monopoly
[1497.76 --> 1505.44]  come on because microsoft has such a as a warm and cuddly history right oh no i think he was saying
[1505.44 --> 1512.48]  oh the other way yeah oh sorry sorry sorry what was what was this uh just i i think jaden was just
[1512.48 --> 1517.84]  saying microsoft shows their monopolistic hand in everything that they do oh oh i thought you said uh
[1517.84 --> 1523.20]  microsoft was responding to sony having i'm sorry i must have just that's that's why they made the original
[1523.20 --> 1529.92]  xbox oh i see what he's saying yeah yeah okay sure yeah microsoft riding in on a white horse to
[1529.92 --> 1535.28]  save us i'm saving the living room now the whole living room is mine isn't everyone happy big scary
[1535.28 --> 1541.68]  monopoly i mean to be clear sony's awful remember memory stick like hey there's these others these flash
[1541.68 --> 1548.32]  memory standards that work in everything compact flash secure digital what's that memory stick it costs way
[1548.32 --> 1556.48]  more for no reason enjoy yeah yeah go to go to hell sony uh i mean to be clear it's not like sony is
[1556.48 --> 1561.92]  winning oh it's hard to say when literally everything is sold out but sony's winning this console generation
[1561.92 --> 1570.40]  aren't they they are winning in terms of actual console sales if i recall correctly i think the xbox series
[1570.40 --> 1577.52]  s has been sort of tepid and the series x doing great but supply constrained yeah uh they're still
[1577.52 --> 1584.56]  selling ps4s faster than they can make enough consoles like it's that's kind of crazy but i think
[1584.56 --> 1590.24]  if the supply was there though because before the supply problems sony was already winning so i think
[1590.24 --> 1594.40]  if the supply was there sony would be winning this current console generation yeah that's fair enough and
[1594.40 --> 1599.60]  at least they actually do have you know some exclusives i mean that's one way that they won't
[1599.60 --> 1607.76]  go completely irrelevant you know but i just i i in the long term i just don't see how it's gonna
[1607.76 --> 1615.36]  i don't see how it's gonna be even a duopoly anymore yeah pretty real why don't we jump into our next big
[1615.36 --> 1619.44]  topic of the day we have a non-zipper hoodie
[1623.60 --> 1628.00]  ltt logo oh here i should go on your screen if you wanna if you wanna go to the thing the best
[1628.00 --> 1637.76]  part about it though is of course the graphic on the back oh yeah it's a blown up cpu cool right
[1638.64 --> 1645.20]  i got it excuse me uh lloyd did this one up and i think that he did a great job of
[1645.20 --> 1654.32]  it the hoodie is the same french terry sorry what is that i don't know i think it's playing
[1654.32 --> 1659.36]  through though what speakers oh it's my screen i'm watching it oh that's hilarious okay there
[1659.36 --> 1664.64]  we got it uh the best part is the design on the back i think lloyd did an absolutely bang up job
[1664.64 --> 1670.88]  of that now something to note about this hoodie is if you order it um we it's going to take anywhere
[1670.88 --> 1676.16]  between one to two weeks for us to take all the orders we're doing it kind of as a drop so we need
[1676.16 --> 1680.32]  to take all the orders and print them to order which means that i don't know if it's going to be
[1680.32 --> 1686.24]  a continuing skew because these blanks are based on the same french terry material as our wan hoodie
[1686.96 --> 1691.20]  they're super comfortable as long as you don't mind the french terry texture by the way if you bought
[1691.20 --> 1696.80]  one of these before and you don't like the texture definitely wash it a few times because it softens up a
[1696.80 --> 1701.92]  lot and what i like about it is that it's really breathable compared to fuzzy interiors and it
[1701.92 --> 1707.68]  doesn't pill so like two years down the line it'll still be exactly the same feel on the inside and
[1707.68 --> 1714.08]  you won't get that uh that pilling so it's our blank hoodie which means it has like um our own orange
[1714.08 --> 1721.52]  ltt label on the inside but other than that it has no um like no just pre-done branding on it
[1721.52 --> 1726.56]  whatsoever so it's all just the printing which is done at the same local canadian shop that does our
[1726.56 --> 1733.36]  t-shirts we're really excited about them so you guys can can go check those out anytime you want
[1733.36 --> 1737.84]  ltdstore.com i would do it quickly though because like i said i don't know if this is going to be an
[1737.84 --> 1743.44]  ongoing design uh or if this is just going to be a one and done we haven't decided yet i guess it kind
[1743.44 --> 1749.92]  of depends how it goes all right why don't we jump into our actual next big topic lenovo vendor
[1749.92 --> 1756.40]  locking ryzen chips in think center pcs lenovo is taking fire after news broke that their think
[1756.40 --> 1764.40]  center m75q tiny gen 2 is locking the cpus installed in the machine this is being done through
[1764.40 --> 1770.80]  amd's platform secure boot an optional enterprise level feature that seeks to improve security so
[1771.44 --> 1779.04]  basically what happens is that the cpu gets locked to that pc's firmware key by fuses that are set
[1779.04 --> 1787.28]  at the factory if that key changes like firmware modification psb will trip disabling the pc this
[1787.28 --> 1793.12]  prevents remote firmware attacks or tampering between the factory and the customer um firmware
[1793.12 --> 1798.64]  keys are common across given model pcs and motherboards so cpus tend to be interchangeable as
[1798.64 --> 1804.16]  long as that firmware doesn't change so this is to make sure that a mobile swap doesn't also require a
[1804.16 --> 1809.92]  new cpu which could be very costly in the data center the problem that the process is destructive
[1810.72 --> 1820.80]  as psb works today the cpu will never work again once the fuse is blown that is insane especially
[1820.80 --> 1828.96]  during a chip shortage the bigger problem it's enabled by default on lenovo's entire amd pro line
[1828.96 --> 1837.04]  including desktops effectively making them lenovo only cpus so if a pc recycler or a tinkerer down the
[1837.04 --> 1844.16]  road tries to reuse or resell or salvage in some way that cpu put it in some other system it will never
[1844.16 --> 1852.08]  work again that's right it is bound to that crap tastic lenovo motherboard for life what do they mean
[1852.08 --> 1858.00]  enabled by default can you disable it that i don't know that this sounded like a hardware thing i didn't
[1858.00 --> 1863.28]  think it was something that would be enabled or disabled uh replacing the cpu on one will pop up
[1863.28 --> 1871.04]  a scary warning on boot asking if you want to lock the cpu to the machine wow that's crazy
[1872.64 --> 1878.40]  so intel does have a similar functionality in the management engine but it's in the chipset not the cpu
[1879.20 --> 1885.20]  amd cpus are able to run a standalone soc so there's a zondai instead so processors with psb
[1885.20 --> 1890.72]  include ryzen pro threadripper pro and epic so consumer ryzen is incompatible with this feature
[1890.72 --> 1898.16]  and therefore unaffected but um i guess the question becomes is amd's because honestly you can't just
[1898.16 --> 1904.48]  blame lenovo for this it's horrible that they're enabling it by default and that needs to not be a
[1904.48 --> 1913.20]  thing so that it is not bound there but i mean why is amd building a feature that just bricks cpus like
[1913.20 --> 1920.32]  this in the first place that's horrible that is uh that is pretty is this anti-consumer or is it just
[1920.32 --> 1926.72]  half-baked did they just screw up i mean it wouldn't be the first time amd just like kind of had an idea
[1926.72 --> 1932.88]  and then just completely didn't execute properly yeah like flummoxed the i mean that's not the right
[1932.88 --> 1937.84]  use of that word but just completely screwed up the implementation i think it's that um
[1937.84 --> 1944.80]  i think they saw like a security intention and then just didn't think about it properly and were
[1944.80 --> 1951.76]  like yo just blow it up just make it go boom during a chip shortage let's just destroy things for fun
[1952.64 --> 1957.52]  they they can't reuse it don't let them do that don't let them tinker it's like the opposite of
[1957.52 --> 1966.48]  right to repair yeah it's really awful a little tone deaf amd wrong time yeah really bad timing
[1967.28 --> 1973.52]  okay uh how much e-waste is this going to generate is another one of our discussion questions for this
[1973.52 --> 1980.48]  one honestly hopefully not that much the issue is just that a lot of the ways to get a deal right
[1980.48 --> 1986.72]  like picking up an old optiplex on ebay uh swapping out the power supply swapping out the gpu turning
[1986.72 --> 1994.96]  it into a budget gaming rig or uh and particularly zeons like getting old zeons overclocking them
[1994.96 --> 2001.92]  turning them into capable little gaming systems as more and more of these kinds of tools and
[2001.92 --> 2010.32]  functionalities get built into these products those those kinds of accessible ways for people with
[2010.32 --> 2016.00]  out a lot of money to get their hands on some kind of gaming experience are going to disappear
[2016.00 --> 2020.72]  and that really sucks because i'm at a stage in my life where i can afford to buy a brand new gaming
[2020.72 --> 2028.56]  computer if i really feel like it but i wasn't always and you gotta learn and a lot of people aren't and so
[2030.00 --> 2036.40]  taking away the ways that people who don't have a lot of money have to get their hands on
[2036.40 --> 2042.08]  something like it already wasn't the fastest thing you can sell the new fast thing by it just being
[2042.08 --> 2048.80]  newer and faster why do you have to why do you have to cripple the old stuff can we all just stop
[2048.80 --> 2056.24]  i guess is what i'm trying to say yeah that'd be great the use market has been rough it's been it's been
[2057.68 --> 2062.16]  the worst time in in either of our lives to buy computer components at all
[2062.16 --> 2069.84]  um and making it so that some of them go boom if you try to mess with it uh is not good don't do that
[2069.84 --> 2074.96]  uh gremlin injector says do you really think the product managers fly by the seat of their pants
[2074.96 --> 2079.76]  there are too many controls in the product management process to prove uh i think to allow
[2079.76 --> 2083.76]  gaffes like this i'm a pm at a fortune 500 can't imagine something like this happening
[2083.76 --> 2091.20]  uh i mean not every company is smoothly run even if it's really big and does a lot of revenue is all i
[2091.20 --> 2095.44]  really have to say about that i think yeah your fortune 500 isn't necessarily the same as all the
[2095.44 --> 2101.92]  other ones yep i mean we we hear about some of the just utterly bananas stuff that was happening at
[2101.92 --> 2108.72]  activision blizzard like they were an enormous company yeah yeah that's a fantastic example there's
[2108.72 --> 2114.00]  some crazy stuff if you want to go back to that wanshow people oh man yeah you want to talk about
[2114.72 --> 2120.88]  ill-managed things and like intense levels of of uh oversight like trigger alert didn't they have a
[2120.88 --> 2127.68]  room called like the um i don't remember what the room was called what's his name was awful comedian
[2128.72 --> 2136.64]  uh oh cosby yeah cosby suite yeah sorry yeah like what there was a continuing the trigger alert i guess
[2136.64 --> 2145.44]  there was a uh lady who was almost driven to suicide because she was getting harassed about a picture of
[2145.44 --> 2154.80]  her private parts um on a trip with a co-worker and that co-worker brought like if i remember correctly
[2154.80 --> 2160.88]  like condoms and lube and all this kind of stuff i wasn't the co-worker also like you about it yeah
[2160.88 --> 2165.68]  yeah and there was like power issues there with that and like it was just all apparently she did commit
[2165.68 --> 2173.20]  suicide oh great oh that doesn't make it better yeah so uh hey yeah not everything squeaky clean
[2173.92 --> 2177.92]  even if there's a lot of money going especially activision blizzard yeah in fact especially
[2177.92 --> 2182.48]  sometimes if there's a lot of money going through it yep uh speaking of money uh the show is brought

[2330.48 --> 2335.12]  blow up processor thing and they're like i don't understand how they missed this but in high security
[2335.12 --> 2342.08]  environments like i would want something like that i don't think we're necessarily upset that it can
[2342.08 --> 2348.48]  potentially exist at all no they're running it on the entire line of of pro products we're talking you know
[2348.48 --> 2357.12]  jeff in accounting or nancy in you know receiving or whatever just having a workstation right like we're
[2357.12 --> 2365.20]  talking ryzen pro not not necessarily threadripper i mean even even enough even you know joe c in the in the
[2365.20 --> 2371.76]  animation department right like there is no reason that those stations should have the cpu and motherboard
[2371.76 --> 2380.16]  effectively fused to each other right we we don't like soldered cpus so we shouldn't like cpus that are
[2380.16 --> 2383.92]  digitally soldered it's this it's effectively the same thing
[2387.36 --> 2392.56]  yes jordan i will check out the remastered version of final fantasy 6 when it releases on pc i'm excited
[2392.56 --> 2398.40]  but i also love the what what's what's the name of the the guy that did the original translation i think
[2398.40 --> 2403.28]  it has a lot of character and i i don't know it's hard for me to revisit games from my childhood and
[2403.28 --> 2408.56]  see things just sort of change that feel arbitrary it might be more true to the original intent but
[2409.12 --> 2414.24]  that was my childhood don't mess with my childhood yeah i honestly haven't been that interested in
[2414.24 --> 2418.16]  remasters the only remasters that i'm interested are for games that i have never played before
[2419.20 --> 2422.96]  yeah i've already played it like i know it's not going to look the greatest and i know the controls are
[2422.96 --> 2426.16]  going to be kind of weird and that's what i'm used to because that's what i remember so it's fine
[2426.16 --> 2432.80]  it's a it's a great way to introduce like my kids to things that i loved yeah um because they
[2432.80 --> 2439.12]  they just they just can't handle the crappy graphics on on some things but for me to go back and re-enjoy
[2439.12 --> 2446.24]  them like i'm i'm replaying final fantasy tactics because i fired it up as part of my uh ian neo uh 2021
[2446.24 --> 2450.96]  pro review because i was like you know firing up emulators on it i want to see what kind of battery life
[2450.96 --> 2459.92]  you might get out of um like a relatively low powered game anyway i wanted to play like to a
[2459.92 --> 2464.00]  battle where i could actually have control of all the characters so if we wanted to get b-roll showing
[2464.00 --> 2465.12]  i am now 11 hours in
[2467.36 --> 2475.20]  that game is so good if you haven't played final fantasy tactics um i actually haven't you've never
[2475.20 --> 2480.96]  played tactics no you should stream it yeah you'll you'll need help from the stream on pc yeah
[2482.16 --> 2487.04]  how does he take it i mean everything's on pc oh oh
[2489.68 --> 2501.04]  okay okay yeah anyway so uh right anyway that's a game that has just like atrocious translation because it
[2501.04 --> 2507.76]  was at a time that the rpg rpg genre in general had not taken off in north america to nearly the
[2507.76 --> 2515.84]  same degree that it has now and in particular tactics games had not taken off basically at all
[2515.84 --> 2521.60]  in north america so i feel like it didn't really get the same degree of polish that even a title from
[2521.60 --> 2528.16]  that time would normally so there's this character agrius who has a has uh like this this move that she
[2528.16 --> 2534.56]  does with her sword or whatever it's called stasis sword so it does damage in a cross uh pattern and
[2534.56 --> 2543.20]  it has a chance to cast stop on any of the targets yeah effectively and so she goes life is short bury
[2543.92 --> 2550.08]  like b-u-r-y it's like clear i don't know how this happens obviously supposed to be life is short very
[2550.88 --> 2557.04]  as she like kills you some of some of the old school translators for games used to take so many
[2557.04 --> 2563.76]  liberties too like i don't remember what game it is but he just snuck in like uh like uh names of
[2563.76 --> 2570.32]  band members of different bands that he liked and like different lyrics from their songs into this game
[2570.32 --> 2575.68]  it was so epic there's a whole video on like how this guy like really didn't follow the original
[2575.68 --> 2579.60]  trend like what the translation should have been like at all and was just co-opping the whole thing
[2579.60 --> 2585.76]  to basically be about this band that he liked and it got published and no one really noticed because
[2585.76 --> 2592.64]  like i don't know why would you wow what game is this i don't remember it was uh there was a series
[2592.64 --> 2596.40]  on youtube that i watched a long time ago i wouldn't know how to find it again but it was about
[2596.40 --> 2601.44]  just like funny old video game translations and that one came up uh oh this is great trick
[2601.44 --> 2607.52]  man 01 son of a submariner yeah that's a that's a great line from a submarine for a bill something i
[2607.52 --> 2612.64]  forget his name but he was the translator for final fantasy 6 the original release on super nintendo
[2612.64 --> 2619.28]  okay so good uh what are we supposed to even be talking about right now should we do a merch
[2619.28 --> 2623.76]  messages break um and then go back to topics after just do like 10 of them and then go yeah let's do
[2623.76 --> 2628.80]  let's do a handful that are not just about do you guys have more stock of things coming to the store
[2628.80 --> 2635.52]  or whatever like yeah discussion topics do that at the end uh there's a question about gpu sag uh justin h
[2635.52 --> 2641.44]  says i have an msi gaming x trio 3070 ti and i would like to know the best way to stop gpu sag the bracket that
[2641.44 --> 2648.56]  comes that is awful and doesn't work um a new bracket or arm man yeah the only thing you can
[2648.56 --> 2653.76]  really do to stop gpu sag outright is some cases have adapters so you can vertically mount them
[2654.32 --> 2659.92]  they won't sag if you do that um you can also 3d print i think you can buy them but 3d printing it
[2659.92 --> 2664.24]  might make more sense if you know anyone with a 3d printer but you could just 3d print a thing to hold
[2664.24 --> 2669.76]  it up i'm sure you'd find something on thingiverse for like an adjustable little you know retention arm thing
[2669.76 --> 2673.76]  you could just screw a thing in there and hold it in place it won't be the prettiest thing ever but
[2673.76 --> 2679.12]  it's a lot better than having strain on the card which frankly is not it's not going to break it
[2679.12 --> 2685.04]  it's just ugly so if you're fixing it for aesthetics with a solution that is not aesthetically pleasing
[2685.04 --> 2690.80]  it could be that the cure is worse than the disease so it's kind of up to you another one that just came
[2690.80 --> 2697.12]  in from tony d is i bought this just to ask does linus know sign language looked like he was uh signing
[2697.12 --> 2703.76]  on the old stream about getting the vault and destroying the lambo uh so i have a family member
[2703.76 --> 2710.80]  who is hard of hearing and uh was a teacher of the deaf growing up and so a lot of the time we actually
[2710.80 --> 2722.08]  had a foster kid as well who was deaf so i am functional in american sign language which is to say
[2722.08 --> 2731.60]  that uh if i was dropped into uh a a deaf convention for example i would be able to order food and i'd be
[2731.60 --> 2738.80]  able to find a bathroom and i'd be able to carry on uh basic conversations with people type of conversations
[2738.80 --> 2746.40]  but i'm i'm far from far from fluent i'm really out of practice at my peak i translated this
[2746.40 --> 2752.40]  conference for my mom it was like some kind of teaching conference and my brain i don't think
[2752.40 --> 2758.32]  i've ever been that mentally exhausted before i i only before or since i don't think i've ever experienced
[2758.32 --> 2764.08]  that kind of mental exhaustion i have a ton of respect for interpreters by the way and and that's i
[2764.08 --> 2769.12]  i imagine listening and talking would actually be more difficult in a sense because as long as you're
[2769.12 --> 2774.32]  speaking manually you can kind of focus on what they're saying maybe more than if you're talking
[2774.32 --> 2780.64]  i don't know anyway tons of tons of respect for interpreters um yes canadians use asl uh signed
[2780.64 --> 2787.92]  english is stupid there i said it uh asl is is the way to go it's like an actual language so there's that
[2787.92 --> 2793.36]  signed english is dumb because you just it has exactly the same grammatical structure as english
[2793.36 --> 2800.56]  oh no um so you just sign a lot of unnecessary words so in signed english you might say i and i
[2800.56 --> 2805.52]  don't know the signs for these things because they're stupid but you might say i am so you would
[2805.52 --> 2817.76]  sign again for that going to the store in asl you should just say you would just say um
[2817.76 --> 2822.16]  you know i'm going to the store going store that's it like it's very directional so they have they
[2822.16 --> 2826.72]  have like they have slang right too so uh this is an old one i don't know if anyone says this anymore
[2826.72 --> 2831.60]  but normally the sign for understand would be understand that's kind of like a light bulb going
[2831.60 --> 2836.80]  off in your head but you got stuff like understand because it's a super it's a super directional language
[2836.80 --> 2845.36]  like it's really different when you're talking about a car you don't just say the car turned left
[2845.92 --> 2851.76]  you would just say the car went left okay yeah that makes sense and then it crashed and that was bad
[2852.64 --> 2857.44]  you know like it just it has its own grammatical structure so it's sure uh it's way more legit it's
[2857.44 --> 2864.96]  way more efficient that makes sense okay i just curated that one because i didn't catch it in time
[2864.96 --> 2872.64]  so yeah i'm i'm functional but i i don't i wouldn't say that i speak it and yes you would say speak sign
[2872.64 --> 2882.16]  language by the way fun fact that's interesting yeah i don't know i feel like that's an english
[2882.16 --> 2889.68]  problem but i don't know uh what else we got there's probably some more questions uh hey linus and jake i
[2889.68 --> 2895.68]  have a living room set up and need a wireless keyboard but tend to like the wired ones is it possible to
[2895.68 --> 2901.92]  mod a wired keyboard into a wireless one uh yes yeah anything is possible if you believe in yourself enough
[2901.92 --> 2907.36]  it's a bit of a project but definitely oh my goodness these are coming in too fast
[2909.20 --> 2915.12]  uh alexander l you guys have inspired me to pursue my hobby as a political scientist i have to ask what
[2915.12 --> 2920.24]  reforms do you believe governments should implement in the tech space thank you for the amazing content that you guys provide
[2920.24 --> 2926.32]  so net neutrality is an obvious one right right to repair is an obvious one the fact that those things
[2926.32 --> 2931.04]  are so obvious and yet there is so much opposition to them tells you about the power of lobbying
[2931.04 --> 2938.32]  so this isn't a tech thing but absolutely lobbying needs reform yeah yeah um i mean i'd start there
[2938.32 --> 2942.64]  that's a lot of work yeah yeah like your whole career there you go yeah you if you achieve that in
[2942.64 --> 2950.00]  your lifetime you will actually have a wikipedia page we'll know your name yeah good luck go for it i wish
[2950.00 --> 2956.56]  you nothing but the best me too what else we got uh do you think zen 4 chips will be worth upgrading to
[2956.56 --> 2963.44]  later this year oh man how could they how could they not be i mean amd has been absolutely firing
[2963.44 --> 2968.24]  in all cylinders i've been i've been so excited to see what they're doing over the last four years
[2968.88 --> 2977.92]  uh on the gpu side okay maybe they've had some misfires like the 6500 xt very recently but on the cpu
[2977.92 --> 2982.40]  side i think they've shown time and time again they have a really good road map and i'm i'm
[2982.40 --> 2987.52]  absolutely jazzed uh someone said this is this is not really a question but it says dear luke this is
[2987.52 --> 2992.32]  more troubleshooting for merch messages uh you can leave merch messages uh if you're signed in but you
[2992.32 --> 3000.24]  cannot leave them if you use the quick pay option by typing in the shop pay verification code that is a
[3000.24 --> 3007.12]  limitation of shop pay um unfortunately okay we're we have some i have an idea of how to potentially
[3007.12 --> 3010.48]  get around that in the future but this has been a problem with with shop pay the entire time
[3010.96 --> 3017.92]  um conclusion is that merch messages aren't isn't available at quick checkout yeah yeah um we want
[3017.92 --> 3025.28]  to eventually have a notification that shows not just on the effectively checkout pages that says like
[3025.28 --> 3029.60]  hey they're live you can leave merchant messages right and part of the idea is that maybe we can
[3029.60 --> 3034.08]  have it so that people add a merch message elsewhere on the site other than checkout or something i don't
[3034.08 --> 3039.60]  know but yeah right now that is a limitation with shop pay nathan does ltd have its own help desk
[3040.32 --> 3047.44]  uh oh where'd it go help desk uh its own proper it help desk uh or is it uh outsourced to a third party
[3047.44 --> 3052.80]  or is it just done by someone there who's knowledgeable but does other duties uh it's just done by someone here
[3052.80 --> 3059.20]  who's knowledgeable and has a different job we are getting to the scale though where we're not
[3059.20 --> 3065.52]  that need one we're not that far off of needing someone whose entire job is to make sure everyone's
[3065.52 --> 3071.84]  workstation has their antivirus and upgrade people's ram when they need it and all that kind of stuff
[3071.84 --> 3077.92]  because not everyone here is like a tech nerd anymore so people might have other expertise that matters a
[3077.92 --> 3083.84]  lot more than their tech nerdiness yeah yeah it's some i just never thought we'd get there but i guess
[3083.84 --> 3091.92]  we are it's kind of interesting that'll be a weird day that'll be there will be a lot of expectations on
[3091.92 --> 3101.52]  that it person yeah i think so i think so that might be a pretty uh nerve-wracking job to apply for yeah
[3101.52 --> 3106.88]  imagine imagine having to come to my office and upgrade my computer yeah while i'm watching
[3111.36 --> 3113.52]  oh my goodness you know you could have used that keyboard shortcut
[3115.28 --> 3119.76]  it might have saved you some time i mean i am paying for this right i would totally i would
[3119.76 --> 3124.24]  totally behave like that just to mess with them on their first day if they take too long doing
[3124.24 --> 3128.80]  something or seem like they don't know something suggesting a video that you have on that topic right
[3131.52 --> 3133.92]  did you even watch any of our videos before you applied here
[3136.08 --> 3139.68]  that's actually one of my favorites i have pulled that line on people and
[3139.68 --> 3142.72]  man the deer in headlights look that i got i'm just i'm just messing with you welcome to home
[3142.72 --> 3142.88]  to you
[3146.24 --> 3154.48]  oh my goodness that's funny all right sorry sorry yeah i know i know i'm a bad bad person uh lucas can
[3154.48 --> 3161.12]  you do a video about signal degradation when running pc slash monitor power cables alongside other data
[3161.12 --> 3166.48]  cables just did some wire management and i swear one of my monitors is behaving weirdly also tell luke
[3166.48 --> 3170.64]  he has good taste in names i don't know if luke has good taste in names his mom i guess you might
[3170.64 --> 3176.16]  agree with the person's name is lucas um that's an interesting i think that was my dad that's actually
[3176.16 --> 3186.32]  an interesting video concept how much power would we have to run alongside say an unshielded hdmi cable
[3186.32 --> 3192.88]  until we drop the signal i wonder if there's different quality and shielding as well if
[3192.88 --> 3197.60]  there's some like cheap poorly shielded cables that you could get through that really sounds like
[3197.60 --> 3203.60]  something that i would like the lab folks to figure out absolutely oh this is the lttlabs.com
[3204.40 --> 3209.28]  doc a lot of that stuff i'm not ready to talk about yet you could just slap it on the bottom so you can
[3209.28 --> 3215.60]  grab it later yeah if you don't have time if i can find it quickly i would rather put it in here
[3215.60 --> 3218.88]  yeah for sure do you want to do one more yeah let me go find one
[3222.88 --> 3226.72]  this is a question for you technically but i'm sure you can answer it uh hey hi linus any word on
[3226.72 --> 3234.56]  the tel aviv videos coming soon or shelved or what i know one of them i just approved a thumbnail for
[3234.56 --> 3238.96]  usually by the time i get sent a thumbnail for approval it's pretty close to release but i haven't
[3238.96 --> 3246.40]  seen it on the calendar yet uh this got curated uh thoughts on bill gates buying up so much land
[3247.04 --> 3251.76]  yeah have you seen that have we talked about that i don't think so i've definitely seen it i think
[3251.76 --> 3257.60]  i've talked to you about it before even yeah um uh honestly from an investment standpoint it's a smart
[3257.60 --> 3265.36]  play from a uh pr standpoint it seems to run uh contrary to a lot of the the image that he's trying
[3265.36 --> 3271.84]  to craft for himself i think his his word on the subject is well that's like the investment fund
[3271.84 --> 3279.60]  that's managed by like those guys i don't know okay yeah sure it's it's sure mostly as far as my
[3279.60 --> 3285.20]  understanding goes specifically farmland as well and a lot of is being bought expecting a food shortage
[3285.20 --> 3291.36]  and he wants to be able to own everything that can produce in the case of a food shortage uh yeah
[3291.36 --> 3295.52]  basically the thing about land is they're not making more of it is sort of the the expression
[3298.24 --> 3304.96]  very cool yeah i mean there's a company working on extracting minerals from the moon so okay so they
[3304.96 --> 3308.88]  could maybe make a little bit trying to get to more land a little bit more land fair enough
[3310.24 --> 3319.28]  measuring resistance to interference for shielded cables versus unshielded with like high my son took my
[3319.28 --> 3324.80]  ltt water bottle so i need a new one question with the gpu shortage do you think new game design will
[3324.80 --> 3329.84]  be less hardware demanding in short term i don't think game design has been very hardware demanding i
[3329.84 --> 3335.04]  think the honestly the main hardware demand that games have had for quite a while now is hard drives
[3335.04 --> 3343.04]  um the the whole idea of people having pure ssd systems uh went i think slightly up in flames when cod
[3343.04 --> 3349.76]  started getting to 200 gigs um and other other games started following suit yeah um but a lot of
[3349.76 --> 3354.80]  games have been really easy to run for a long time i saw a post from somebody not long ago saying like
[3354.80 --> 3359.60]  oh i'm still running a i think it was like a 1060 and they're like i can play basically every modern game
[3359.60 --> 3363.92]  you probably can't play halo yeah but you can probably play a ton of other stuff and honestly halo's biggest
[3363.92 --> 3369.84]  problem is that it's just really poorly optimized um but it is pretty though it is it is a pretty game
[3369.84 --> 3375.84]  but it's also it could it could run a lot better and i just want every game to run like doom eternal
[3377.20 --> 3383.12]  if every game forever looks like doom eternal and ran like doom eternal pretty solid i think that's
[3383.12 --> 3389.04]  good enough yeah it's an amazingly well-running game yeah and like and there's there's i i don't know
[3389.04 --> 3397.04]  like i'm sure like valorant isn't exactly that hard to run a lot of modern launch games are not hard to
[3397.04 --> 3404.56]  run um gaming companies have been aiming for attainable levels of performance for a very long
[3404.56 --> 3409.92]  time because they want to be able to sell to the most people most amount of people possible um so
[3409.92 --> 3414.64]  as fun as it is to to see things like star citizen that is not the norm and i don't think that's going
[3414.64 --> 3422.56]  to change all right should we jump into one of our other main topics amd buries the lack of vram
[3422.56 --> 3431.76]  performance issues under the rug during the rx 6500 so funny xt launch so funny so funny we okay we talk
[3431.76 --> 3438.96]  all the time and we've been talking uh about this mostly i think since amd did their like uh what was
[3438.96 --> 3444.96]  that advertising campaign like rebel against the big man i don't remember do you remember what that was
[3444.96 --> 3452.24]  all the branding was like a riot they had like people like at pax they had uh paid actors essentially
[3453.04 --> 3458.00]  they weren't hiding it like it was it was known but they were walking around with protest signs
[3458.00 --> 3462.48]  like protesting against the big tech companies and stuff they've been trying to position themselves as
[3462.48 --> 3468.88]  like on your side underdog underdog this whole time and then they post they make a post essentially
[3468.88 --> 3474.16]  marketing that four gigs of vram was not enough for gaming however long ago i don't remember when and then
[3474.16 --> 3484.40]  they release a card with four gigs of vram and they delete the post they're not on your side
[3485.28 --> 3493.20]  they're just not okay come on radeon 5500 xt 1080p gaming performance uh what does it say
[3494.16 --> 3500.56]  yeah four gigs is great the gray bar eight gigs is the red bar available with eight gigs red
[3500.56 --> 3506.72]  yeah that's the way to go nudist there's insufficient video memory for selected settings that's bad
[3508.16 --> 3515.36]  oh man ah amd new card four gigs of ram don't worry about that it's it's totally fine it's totally fine
[3515.36 --> 3521.36]  i mean realistically yeah it is totally fine they probably shouldn't have talked about it like that
[3521.36 --> 3529.76]  before and by totally fine i mean functional yeah i mean it's not going to explode is it ideal like their
[3529.76 --> 3538.56]  processor no no it's not ideal it's not even cheap like how am i supposed to defend this i don't know
[3539.36 --> 3540.16]  the issue is
[3543.28 --> 3551.12]  the value of anything right is determined by what your other choices are so if your other choices are
[3551.84 --> 3556.00]  nothing then it's valuable then i guess it's a good deal
[3556.00 --> 3565.60]  yeah so that's where we're at on this it's in stock at yeah it's over msrp so the one that is at the 199
[3565.60 --> 3574.32]  msrp is out of stock but there are three variants at 269. it is a graphics card that you can buy for a
[3574.32 --> 3585.68]  little over 250 that is capable of 1080p gaming is it a great value no will you get texture pop-in issues
[3586.32 --> 3594.80]  yes will you experience stutter almost definitely it's got a narrow 64-bit memory interface i mean
[3594.80 --> 3603.76]  going back to like the radeon 9000 series i am talking almost 20 years ago right even then like
[3603.76 --> 3609.84]  the the oh man what was that what how far down did you have to go to find a 64-bit memory pause it's like
[3610.40 --> 3622.32]  so bad oh yeah so the specs are 4 gigs gdr6 uh 16 rdna2 cu's at 2.8 to 2.9 gigahertz at least it's
[3622.32 --> 3628.24]  like clocked high uh it's the first gpu on tsmc's n6 node so this is fresh production capacity which
[3628.24 --> 3634.64]  might explain why it's actually still in stock 16 megs of megs of infinity cache one of the bigger issues
[3634.64 --> 3641.76]  is the gen 4x4 pci express interface do you know about this so if you plug this thing into a pcie gen
[3641.76 --> 3647.36]  3 or heaven forbid pcie gen 2 system because you've got an older system and you just want freaking
[3647.36 --> 3656.56]  basic cards you can play some freaking games right it could be running at literally one quarter the pcie
[3656.56 --> 3661.60]  bandwidth that it is that that system is expecting because it's expecting a 16x interface and
[3662.24 --> 3668.08]  three quarters of the fingers are just not wired up yeah essentially yeah um now one of the articles
[3668.08 --> 3674.88]  that i read recently suggested that this gpu was not intended for the desktop it was intended for
[3674.88 --> 3682.96]  notebooks like mid-spec notebooks where the uh the issues around their um its video encoding and
[3682.96 --> 3687.36]  decoding capabilities weren't going to be a problem because they'd be paired with apus that could take
[3687.36 --> 3694.80]  over that functionality um it was also going to be beneficial to have a narrow uh by four interface to
[3694.80 --> 3699.04]  the cpu because it's more power efficient so i i heard i heard actually what i thought was a pretty
[3699.04 --> 3704.72]  strong argument for that the reason this thing is stupid on the desktop it was never meant to be
[3704.72 --> 3711.52]  a desktop gpu which was uh i thought a pretty good take on it but it doesn't change the fact that amd
[3711.52 --> 3719.92]  did release it um and hide their own po their own old post and hid their own blog post so funny so the
[3719.92 --> 3724.64]  performance tanks by as much as half in our testing while others reported that it performed
[3724.64 --> 3732.08]  substantially worse than its predecessor the rx 5500 xt um when it was stuck with those four lanes
[3732.08 --> 3739.52]  running at gen 3 speeds in some games uh even in gen 4 mode it was worse than its predecessor and same
[3739.52 --> 3747.84]  with the six-year-old rx 570 and the rx 570 was like a 200 and change gpu max the everything 7 on
[3747.84 --> 3753.52]  flow plane said i think the biggest reason for four gigabytes of vram was to prevent ethereum mining
[3753.52 --> 3760.00]  since that currently requires 4.6 gigabytes um i don't think that's the case i don't know i don't
[3760.00 --> 3765.92]  know if i buy it if that was the case i think they would have said something they did they did say they
[3765.92 --> 3772.40]  did say that yes but i just don't know if i buy it i think that i think that it's just as happy to
[3772.40 --> 3777.76]  sell the miners as anyone else yeah i'm not convinced that amd cares at all i'm not convinced
[3777.76 --> 3784.80]  that you can give us this is not entirely fair i guess because i'm the one saying it but did did uh
[3784.80 --> 3790.56]  did amd give us any cards for the verified actual gamer program uh amd did did they yep amd did work
[3790.56 --> 3796.08]  with us yes they did okay yeah nvidia did not yeah i knew that part i didn't think any vendor did i thought
[3796.08 --> 3801.28]  it was all through third parties asus and msi did amd worked with us directly that's through a board
[3801.28 --> 3806.64]  partner so i believe they were asus cards but amd secured the allocation for us yes okay cool that's
[3806.64 --> 3816.08]  cool um so here's a discussion question did amd take down the vram article on purpose absolutely
[3816.08 --> 3819.92]  there's no way that wasn't on purpose it was like the night before the launch or something stupid like
[3819.92 --> 3824.00]  that definitely they should have taken it down like six months ago probably someone realized
[3824.00 --> 3829.12]  they were like going through the the collateral taking it down i just owned it from the last launch
[3829.12 --> 3835.12]  right going through it in preparation for the new one hey what can we copy paste oh crap probably
[3835.12 --> 3840.48]  something like that removing it is just so obvious though and i'm sure they've gotten more bad press
[3840.48 --> 3844.32]  about removing it than they would have gotten if they just left it up but here's the thing
[3846.40 --> 3852.88]  is there a place for the rx6500 xt does it suck yes is it cut down in ways that would have been
[3852.88 --> 3861.28]  inexcusable two years ago a year ago even uh yeah is there a place for it though this is my this is my
[3861.28 --> 3871.20]  hot take yes it's a card that you can actually buy and the more people buy this card the the less
[3871.20 --> 3875.20]  demand there is going to be for everything else because once you've got a card once you're actually
[3875.20 --> 3879.68]  playing games for most people i realize i'm talking to my fellow enthusiasts right now you guys go what
[3879.68 --> 3883.20]  are you talking about as soon as there's something new i'm like i'm looking at it i can smell the
[3883.20 --> 3887.60]  hardware i can smell the hardware in the air right like but most people are not like that they get a
[3887.60 --> 3893.52]  new computer and that's it they that's their computer so the more people pick up 6500 xts the more cards
[3893.52 --> 3896.88]  we get in the hands of gamers and i was talking about something similar when we were discussing arc
[3896.88 --> 3901.68]  alchemist yeah i don't care if it's the most power efficient i don't care if it has the best performance
[3901.68 --> 3910.16]  i don't care i want cards in the systems of gamers so that the demand this pent-up demand that is
[3910.16 --> 3916.00]  driving scalper prices higher and higher can be alleviated that's what we need does it have a place
[3916.00 --> 3924.80]  yes it's places in gamer systems and if the performance sucks and it won't sell for 350 or
[3924.80 --> 3929.52]  whatever scalpers are trying to get for it because you can still buy it new for 270 if it makes its way
[3929.52 --> 3935.76]  back down close to msrp that will put pressure on the next card above it which will put pressure on
[3935.76 --> 3940.56]  the card above that which will put pressure on the card above that that's competition baby we want it
[3941.12 --> 3949.04]  so having anything anything that people can actually buy is good i wonder if there's been a measurable
[3949.04 --> 3955.60]  change in monitor buying habits since the chip shortage monitor buying habits i mean i've seen
[3955.60 --> 3961.68]  them be just like out of stock our monitors out of stock too i mean lg um had a whole had a whole
[3961.68 --> 3966.16]  thing where with their with that one millisecond ips panel they like just couldn't get enough of them
[3966.16 --> 3970.24]  or something i don't know if they're still they were out of stock everywhere i don't know if that's
[3970.24 --> 3975.76]  still the case but um i know samsung seems to be pretty stoked with the pre-orders on that like weird
[3975.76 --> 3981.84]  monitor that they have so walking around best buy just before christmas you like couldn't even move
[3981.84 --> 3986.64]  because the whole floor was just filled with tvs and the whole warehouse in the back was filled
[3986.64 --> 3990.40]  with tvs so they had like overflow storage on the floor and you could literally like it was actually
[3990.40 --> 3996.40]  hard to navigate around the store because they had so many darn tvs um i haven't seen the the shortage hit
[3997.04 --> 4001.20]  display as much as i have hit other things but i'm not surprised it's hit it somewhat but i just
[4001.20 --> 4006.00]  wonder like if you're looking forward knowing like there's a giant question mark next to when you're
[4006.00 --> 4010.24]  going to be able to get your next gpu upgrade reasonably like are you really trying to push like
[4010.24 --> 4014.08]  super high refresh rate displays super high resolution displays well that's the thing is
[4014.08 --> 4020.48]  they're making lots of gpus it's just that you're just not getting them yeah the demand is not the
[4020.48 --> 4026.88]  demand is has been high yeah i i mean i do think that as many people as ever are putting gpus in their
[4026.88 --> 4031.68]  gaming systems like they have ramped production in order to accommodate miners and miners have been buying
[4031.68 --> 4039.84]  cards since before the this big run up here yeah so i i think it's both i think it's a combination of
[4039.84 --> 4045.04]  more demand from the crypto scene and a combination of more demand from gamers more people have picked
[4045.04 --> 4052.00]  up the hobby yeah um speaking of crypto have you been following the uh the crash that's been
[4052.56 --> 4056.96]  taking place over the last little bit here not thoroughly i know it exists i know it's happening
[4057.52 --> 4064.32]  but i don't know like very notable details about it uh well it's going down and this is this is
[4064.32 --> 4072.16]  something really interesting so enter a search term um oh dang gosh darn it hold on a second no prob
[4072.16 --> 4083.84]  no prob okay and then i want to compare uh to check this out somebody showed this to me and i was like
[4083.84 --> 4095.84]  oh holy crap is this it oh no nfts have overtaken crypto i think nfts are overtaking crypto because
[4095.84 --> 4101.44]  memes in google trends i think i think people are memeing on it yeah but here's the thing is everybody
[4101.44 --> 4106.24]  in on the joke no okay yeah fair enough
[4109.04 --> 4114.56]  have you seen crypto land or crypto landia or whatever it's called no uh what's crypto landia
[4115.52 --> 4121.12]  yeah crypto land yeah this is it it's not crypto landia i feel like that would have been a better
[4121.12 --> 4130.48]  name screen um oh there's that email that's fine um what am i looking at this audio right now it's it's a
[4130.48 --> 4138.00]  video promoting crypto land crypto land is a place where you can buy oh there is audio let's uh let's
[4138.00 --> 4145.20]  stop that um you can buy property there's like clubhouses and stuff they have different names for
[4145.20 --> 4150.00]  the different areas like uh i i don't remember something something hills is where you can actually
[4150.00 --> 4156.00]  like buy your property um and it's all exclusive and all that kind of stuff but it's all digital
[4156.00 --> 4164.96]  it's obviously not real property my brain hurts it's um it's an amazing it's an amazing video
[4164.96 --> 4171.20]  they're they're having some pr problems you know because like someone tweeted at them asking what the
[4171.76 --> 4178.24]  um what the age of consent was and they tweeted back a reply saying mental matured mental matured
[4178.24 --> 4184.40]  mental maturity should be more than enough uh so that was awesome that was really uh wow classy that
[4184.40 --> 4190.96]  was very classy to be fair i don't necessarily know there might have been a language barrier they might
[4190.96 --> 4200.08]  not have known what that person meant etc um but yeah very fantastic so people like memeing on things like
[4200.08 --> 4207.44]  that and nfts are like as far as i can tell twitter's favorite pastime right now is just making fun of nfts
[4208.24 --> 4216.00]  um well okay except that in other news this week twitter has announced nft profile pictures on ios
[4216.00 --> 4223.84]  which uh as far as i can tell uh is is like what do you call it bully baiting like it's if you if you
[4223.84 --> 4229.28]  actually set your thing to one of these nft profile pictures which has a different shape around it
[4229.28 --> 4234.88]  because no one would know if it's just a bad drawing or an nft right so it's really really hard to tell the
[4234.88 --> 4240.80]  difference so they have to make it a different shape uh so it's kind of a giveaway um something
[4240.80 --> 4248.16]  that people have been doing is making it so the the background for twitter that they they color match
[4248.16 --> 4253.28]  as part of their profile picture so they can make the shape yeah if they don't have an nft
[4255.60 --> 4260.32]  which is pretty funny and couldn't you just mint your own nft anyway oh no that like costs money i'm not
[4260.32 --> 4267.12]  i'm not spending money you could do it though oh yeah some some guy tweeted out um frustrated that
[4267.12 --> 4273.20]  people could just screenshot and then mint copies of the nft and then somebody retweeted it with their
[4273.20 --> 4279.28]  own profile picture changed to his nft yeah so funny i thought that was genuinely hilarious
[4280.24 --> 4285.04]  but yeah on thursday twitter launched a new feature for owners of non-fungible tokens nfts to
[4285.04 --> 4289.84]  use them as profile pictures um how is that different from using it as your profile picture already
[4289.84 --> 4296.72]  well it's a hexagon neato it was a matter of time until twitter capitalized on the enthusiasm of
[4296.72 --> 4303.68]  its users with stoned ape avatar avatars there's also other nfts um the social media platform added
[4303.68 --> 4307.28]  crypto wallet support back in september but there's a gotcha you need to be paying three dollars a month
[4307.28 --> 4312.40]  for twitter blue nice that's smart if they're gonna buy nfts they'll probably buy twitter blue
[4312.40 --> 4319.44]  um the new feature also announced nft to show off their stats if you click on a hexagon nft profile
[4319.44 --> 4326.56]  picture it brings up the details of what makes the nft unique wow so cool you know what luke
[4327.76 --> 4333.52]  what's up this is just in-game cosmetics we were sitting there sticks in the mud going this is stupid
[4333.52 --> 4341.12]  no one will do this it's horse armor who needs it and now horse armor is like i mean we've been we've
[4341.12 --> 4347.28]  been playing halo infinite right yeah and one of the things that luke and i like to do when we play halo
[4347.28 --> 4356.56]  infinite is talk about the people that we see uh you know that that cringy uh cinematic that it runs
[4356.56 --> 4366.24]  every time you enter a match that exists only to show up only to show off people's armor the skins that
[4366.24 --> 4374.08]  they've purchased yeah so one of our one of our pastimes is just uh talking smack about everyone who spent
[4374.08 --> 4384.00]  actual real freaking money on digital uh digital armor but it's a lot of people it's a lot it's like
[4384.00 --> 4391.52]  almost every pug that we get it's it's really extensive yeah and so as much as we're sitting here
[4391.52 --> 4399.36]  going this is stupid and if t's are stupid it's not any different it's the same thing
[4399.36 --> 4407.84]  people already paid money for just pictures not this might make it worse but in-game cosmetics are
[4407.84 --> 4415.44]  not exclusive usually unless they're also nfts there's there's pushes by companies to make in-game
[4415.44 --> 4427.12]  cosmetics nfts so that's the thing i think the concept of what nft is is fine interesting yeah it's
[4427.12 --> 4433.20]  very interesting but it is just i think right for abuse the application that is being used of this
[4433.20 --> 4440.48]  concept almost exclusively is trash um i i think it could be used for very interesting things um just
[4440.48 --> 4444.48]  like with a lot of crypto stuff and a lot of blockchain stuff it's it's an incredibly powerful
[4444.48 --> 4451.68]  very interesting system yeah and i think it's most often used for just like trash yeah i mean it's not
[4451.68 --> 4455.92]  it's true of a lot of things to be fair it's just that it's not any dumber than what we already had
[4455.92 --> 4460.88]  it's not any dumber than your stupid gem certificate for your stupid rock that is not rare
[4464.08 --> 4470.40]  uh buying uh buying a star or whatever yeah it's it's no dumber than your than your stupid
[4470.40 --> 4477.28]  acre of land that you own on the moon or or or whatever right like i i just don't see the i don't
[4477.28 --> 4484.08]  see the difference and so if people have demonstrated time and time and time and time again that they will
[4484.08 --> 4491.12]  accept this then we can meme all we want but in the mainstream you can clearly see it in google trends
[4492.00 --> 4499.36]  nft officially has more interest in it than crypto as a search term i think it being so i should just
[4499.36 --> 4504.40]  do it it's fine i should just mint nfts no why don't i just mint nfts of like my face and sell them
[4504.40 --> 4509.12]  fun of people with in-game cosmetics and you make fun of nfts so why not just why not just be
[4509.12 --> 4515.12]  hypocritical why not just do both why not just sell them and then make fun of the people who buy them
[4515.12 --> 4521.04]  i did tell you you should make a computer nft can i can i can i just do that can i can i make it
[4521.04 --> 4525.92]  and then just like trash on you for buying it there's people that do that for sure yeah that's definitely
[4525.92 --> 4531.84]  like look at look at this look at this crap look at this crap apparently some youtubers made like 23
[4531.84 --> 4537.76]  million dollars selling nfts in 10 minutes i don't know who these people are but apparently they're
[4537.76 --> 4546.08]  awful so i'm not going to shout them out but um i'm just sitting here going i well well if it's free money
[4546.08 --> 4557.20]  fine fine shower me with it i don't know man oh make fun of the nfts with the nft but that's the
[4557.20 --> 4563.76]  thing that's the thing as soon as you get that meta are you really joking anymore right like as soon
[4563.76 --> 4571.52]  as i buy a car with my nft profits is it a joke anymore or am i seriously an nft peddler we know it's
[4571.52 --> 4582.32]  a link not an image it's fine yeah i um i i think it's totally fine and valid make gpu nfts it's the
[4582.32 --> 4585.92]  only thing people will be able to afford and then make fun of the people that buy it as long as you
[4585.92 --> 4591.52]  are super open about it the whole time i mean i was pretty open about the expensive edition cpu pillow
[4591.52 --> 4596.96]  yeah i was like look this is this pillow cost too much yeah it's a it's a dumb product that we didn't
[4596.96 --> 4600.96]  make in the first place because it didn't make any sense but you guys asked us to make it so we did
[4600.96 --> 4607.60]  yeah we've sold like almost half of them yeah it's crazy in a week yeah i don't know it's fine
[4607.60 --> 4612.40]  to me we're not bringing back more by the way guys that's it that's all it's going when it's gone
[4613.20 --> 4618.72]  sell nfts and donate the money this is the mentality of everyone looking at crypto and nfts right now oh
[4618.72 --> 4626.32]  well if it's easy money then why not i i i don't know guys i tell me tell me why not to mint have have
[4626.32 --> 4632.72]  sarah whip up a cool little gpu icon that you can use as your twitter profile picture
[4633.68 --> 4639.20]  convince me not to i mean you know what the funny thing is is that when we talked about doing like a
[4639.20 --> 4644.88]  linus coin or or whatever like doing like a cryptocurrency back in the day we were trying
[4644.88 --> 4648.64]  to remember we like actually talked we seriously talked about doing we were like we're gonna do it
[4648.64 --> 4652.88]  because we were trying to come up with ways that it would actually be useful and that's the problem
[4652.88 --> 4657.12]  you don't do that we shouldn't have done that yeah you just do it we should have just not bothered
[4657.12 --> 4666.72]  we should have just released it not cared at all unbelievable all right one thing that i found kind
[4666.72 --> 4672.00]  of interesting is a lot of the i looked into a bunch of crypto projects because i was like are there
[4673.44 --> 4679.04]  i was basically trying to think like like boink and folding sure like why don't they pay out a coin
[4680.00 --> 4685.28]  and then i was like oh maybe they do and then i found projects that effectively pay you out for
[4686.32 --> 4690.32]  work done on boink or folding and i was like oh that's cool and then i figured out that the coins
[4690.32 --> 4697.44]  are worth basically nothing because no one actually cares they just want money it's like oh okay i thought
[4697.44 --> 4702.16]  like if we could if we could make it so that you're you might not even break even but if we can make it
[4702.16 --> 4706.80]  so that there's some benefit towards using that computing power for something that's actually helpful for
[4706.80 --> 4712.56]  anything in the world that would probably be kind of cool instead of just burning stuff for like no
[4712.56 --> 4717.12]  reason um but yeah no one cares so that sucks
[4719.76 --> 4727.92]  oh i had no you know what i was talking about think geek today oliver because i i ran into that human body
[4727.92 --> 4734.80]  organ like lunchbox thing we had that was part of our i just wanted some stuff to like put on set that
[4734.80 --> 4740.24]  was kind of nerd culture but not just computer hardware and so i tasked everyone with like
[4740.24 --> 4744.96]  spending 150 on think geek so that we'd have like kind of some cool stuff kicking around anyway that's
[4744.96 --> 4749.36]  one of the ones that has made it all the way from seven eight years ago or whenever we bought that
[4749.36 --> 4754.24]  stuff to now and i was like oh yeah thinking is thinking still a thing apparently they're not they
[4754.24 --> 4759.76]  got bought by gamestop and they suck and oliver asked have you considered carrying a curated selection
[4759.76 --> 4764.88]  of third-party products in ltt store i don't know i guess we could uh it hasn't really occurred to us
[4764.88 --> 4773.68]  before though to be perfectly blunt with you i uh a while ago like during covet it was asked if if
[4773.68 --> 4777.92]  people could just like deconstruct my desk basically because i hadn't been there for like a year or
[4777.92 --> 4782.64]  something and i said yeah sure and they were like you have a bunch of like stuff what do you want us to
[4782.64 --> 4787.60]  do with this and i was like okay well i mean if there's anything neat you guys can just like have
[4787.60 --> 4792.88]  it right like whatever it's fine and there's a bunch of stuff from back in the think geek days
[4792.88 --> 4796.40]  and then there was another one that you did later i think when we first moved in here i think you did
[4796.40 --> 4800.32]  like a hundred bucks to like decorate your work area yeah there was a bunch of stuff from the think
[4800.32 --> 4806.72]  geek days and that that i still had around my desk nice like a map of mordor nice like a nuka
[4806.72 --> 4812.40]  cola sign all this kind of stuff and i noticed if you walk through the logistics section they're all like
[4812.40 --> 4818.56]  around so they're still existing i thought that's kind of cool i went into the bathroom upstairs and
[4818.56 --> 4822.80]  one of them's on the wall in there and i'm like hey they actually like they did it they didn't just
[4822.80 --> 4826.80]  throw it away they like just redeployed it i thought that was actually pretty cool that's awesome yeah
[4828.08 --> 4837.04]  uh what else we got here is oh man this i know it's still covered right now uh samsung their new soc
[4837.04 --> 4842.16]  features rdna2 graphics and ray tracing the ray tracing probably won't amount to anything but the rdna2
[4842.16 --> 4849.28]  graphics sound amazing the exynos 2200 was built on four nanometer euv eight cores and a tri-cluster
[4849.28 --> 4855.92]  configuration so a high-powered cortex x2 flagship core three cortex a710s and four efficient a510s
[4856.64 --> 4861.68]  oh this thing sounds amazing some more support for camera sensors up to 200 megapixels
[4862.64 --> 4868.96]  oh okay and rdna2 features like variable rate shading and ray tracing for what samsung claims will be
[4868.96 --> 4875.28]  console like graphics pretty impressive gpu performance has been a weak point in the past
[4875.28 --> 4881.36]  for exynos chips so this could be a huge step forward but samsung's announcement was surprisingly
[4881.36 --> 4885.84]  light on details which some are taking as a bad sign they could also be holding their cards close to
[4885.84 --> 4891.84]  their chest so we might have to wait for the s22 lineup of phones to find out what is shaken here
[4891.84 --> 4898.72]  you know in our final news valve has been validating titles for the steam deck that's right you can find
[4898.72 --> 4906.96]  titles that are verified as working perfectly uh working playably and unsupported so so much for
[4906.96 --> 4913.04]  that whole every game on steam will work but i don't think anyone sensible was ever going to
[4913.04 --> 4923.92]  believe that anyway yeah um i'm really happy this is happening um i was not entirely sure how in they
[4923.92 --> 4929.68]  were going to go with uh like making this rating system an official valve thing yeah um because they
[4929.68 --> 4933.12]  had those verified titles we talked about this when we were trying to write the script they had that
[4933.12 --> 4937.52]  initial list of verified titles but then they never really expanded on it in like two months and i was
[4937.52 --> 4942.00]  like is this actually going to be a thing yeah are they just going to leave it up to to proton db
[4942.00 --> 4947.84]  um i'm happy that it's actually becoming a thing um i i think that's actually going to mean a lot
[4948.32 --> 4952.72]  uh for the community and for for for linux developers and everything else in general it's
[4952.72 --> 4957.92]  also going to be a way to incentivize developers to bother to work with valve to get it to
[4957.92 --> 4963.52]  work properly because if you can be promoted under that tab you know valve's going to be pushing
[4963.52 --> 4967.28]  it hard oh yeah it's going to be a way to sell your game yeah so let's go
[4967.52 --> 4971.76]  that is a direct incentive for for linux development and support and that is big and
[4971.76 --> 4976.32]  people on steam decks and there are going to be a lot of them are going to be hungry for games to
[4976.32 --> 4981.04]  play that run great on steam deck yeah like it's going to be this is really cool this is really good
[4981.04 --> 4984.96]  for linux this is really good for gamers this is just this is good this is good good good
[4985.84 --> 4991.20]  hopefully there's going to be more than 38 of them oh it'll happen they'll come they'll come
[4991.20 --> 4996.56]  give it give them time yes give gabe time he doesn't run so fast anymore oh oh
[4997.52 --> 5005.52]  oh all right now it's time to dig into the merch messages just got my new water bottle lanyard lab
[5005.52 --> 5009.44]  absolutely love them have you considered doing different sticker designs on the included stickers
[5009.44 --> 5015.04]  i have about five packs of the same stickers okay we are working on other free items yeah should i
[5015.76 --> 5021.60]  talk about that yeah sure so we're working on a thing uh where on checkout essentially there will be
[5021.60 --> 5027.60]  like a shelf i don't we have very uh non-final names for it right now but there will essentially
[5027.60 --> 5031.84]  be like a free shelf of things and you get to pick one and there will be like the current things that
[5031.84 --> 5034.80]  we have that are free that can go along with your order and you can pick from them
[5035.76 --> 5041.12]  one of the things we're working on is a coloring card of the gpu wasteland
[5041.12 --> 5048.32]  um desk pad design so that was a suggestion that we got and we loved it and then we took it one step
[5048.32 --> 5053.60]  further and creator warehouse is moving into new space so what we're going to do is we are actually
[5053.60 --> 5060.08]  going to make the back side of it a postcard so what people can do is they can color it send it to us
[5060.08 --> 5065.12]  so it'll be a pre-addressed postcard so they'll color it send it to us and then we're going to make a
[5065.12 --> 5072.56]  wall in the new creator warehouse space that is going to be covered in these colored uh gpu wasteland
[5073.44 --> 5078.56]  postcards so we thought that was kind of a cool idea just to just to make it more real right for
[5078.56 --> 5084.48]  the team over there like hey everything that we make is actually going into the hands of a real actual
[5084.48 --> 5091.04]  person who and some of them anyway cared enough to fill out this thing and send it back to us so that
[5091.04 --> 5094.56]  we could see a representation of them on the wall i don't know i just thought it was kind of a cool idea
[5095.12 --> 5099.04]  yeah uh dominic asks might be a bit out of scope for the channel but any interest in some data
[5099.04 --> 5105.60]  science content um it's something that is hard to make a visually interesting video about like that's
[5105.60 --> 5111.04]  the challenge is we have to deal with the limitations of the media it's video it has to be visual i think
[5111.04 --> 5115.84]  i think there is potential we are hiring a data scientist obviously so maybe they can help us with
[5115.84 --> 5121.92]  some direction there i think it would mostly be uh like sidebar things within another greater video
[5121.92 --> 5127.04]  um like better benchmarks for data science stuff because we happen to have a data science person
[5127.04 --> 5132.32]  on staff that can help advise us on those things that would be great um and also i mean you saw that
[5132.32 --> 5138.96]  video but this was more ai um but the video of those little the the seekers and the hiders oh that
[5140.00 --> 5144.00]  that was fascinating if we could drive stuff like that like that could be interesting content but i think
[5144.00 --> 5148.80]  that's few and far between yeah and that's like a team of scientists working on a project like that
[5148.80 --> 5152.64]  that's not the kind of thing that we could so recreate i kind of doubt it but maybe sidebar
[5152.64 --> 5157.44]  things within other videos uh this is from james throughout your career have you regretted making
[5157.44 --> 5162.32]  or not making a decision perhaps a decision that you didn't make fast enough and missed an opportunity
[5164.08 --> 5168.00]  yeah we both almost went really hard into bitcoin mining in 2010.
[5168.56 --> 5173.60]  mm-hmm we were really close to doing it and then we were like uh we had all these cards and all these
[5173.60 --> 5177.60]  benches just sitting around and i don't even fully remember the reason why we didn't do it i think we just
[5177.60 --> 5183.28]  we were just lazy we were really busy at the time to be fair yeah but yeah well no because i had it all
[5183.28 --> 5186.48]  set up on some benches and i just like turned it off i was like i don't know they're kind of loud
[5187.12 --> 5192.96]  like it was it was something that i could literally just power up when i left the studio and then like
[5192.96 --> 5199.60]  turn off when i needed to film and i just couldn't be bothered yeah i mean someone sent me a a moment from
[5199.60 --> 5207.12]  the wan show from like 2013 that aged like fine milk someone bought a house with crypto or something like
[5207.12 --> 5212.08]  that or sold the house for crypto yeah and i watched i watched it and i was just like oh boy
[5212.08 --> 5216.56]  i was like yeah bitcoin's not going anywhere blah blah blah i'll eat my hat like oh okay i didn't end
[5216.56 --> 5221.36]  up watching it was i was i with you on that one i didn't watch i couldn't watch any more than my
[5221.36 --> 5228.32]  initial hot take yeah i was like quote me on this oh no way to go it's like oh no i got quoted darn way to
[5228.32 --> 5233.68]  go line is right there's definitely i mean there's regrets and stuff but you just gotta move on yep um no the
[5233.68 --> 5238.64]  pink and green beanie is never coming back to the store sorry it was a limited edition thing linus
[5238.64 --> 5244.32]  what's the right to repair laws like in canada uh truthfully i don't know we get more american news
[5244.32 --> 5249.68]  up here than we get canadian news honestly a lot of a lot of canadian stuff like that they just we
[5249.68 --> 5257.68]  just follow the americans yeah because it's in some ways um kind of detrimental to us to have different
[5257.68 --> 5264.00]  policies because all of a sudden manufacturers are disincentivized to support the canadian market
[5264.00 --> 5269.52]  because we're creating a bunch of extra work for them so and you know you should just follow them
[5269.52 --> 5273.92]  yeah please just put bilingual you know french on the package and then we're good hey
[5275.52 --> 5283.92]  je ne sais pas um soda mousse costa what do you think about the 42 inch lg oled for desk use
[5283.92 --> 5289.52]  uh i think that as long as you don't fear burnin so you're willing to turn the you're willing to
[5289.52 --> 5294.08]  turn the brightness down you might do it all right i'm looking to build a computer that will be good
[5294.08 --> 5299.28]  for computational fluid dynamics what components should i spend more on to get the best bang for
[5299.28 --> 5304.48]  my buck well you should try to figure out if computational fluid dynamics are cpu bound or
[5304.48 --> 5310.80]  gpu bound and then go hard in that direction uh frosty kygor asks got my expensive edition cpu pillow
[5310.80 --> 5315.44]  today it has a smell to it kind of a mix of dirt and acetone anything like this come up with the
[5315.44 --> 5324.08]  samples um the it goes away but it's stuffed with alpaca fur it's not like a synthetic thing so it
[5324.08 --> 5328.72]  actually yeah it does it does have a bit of a scent to it i mean that makes sense there's a freaking lot
[5328.72 --> 5332.24]  of it in there it's like half an alpaca worth of fibers
[5332.24 --> 5340.24]  um chrono trigger had a bunch of rock band references uh including characters named flea
[5340.24 --> 5347.20]  slash and ozzy and uh related to hiring a tech oh at least you wouldn't have to create training
[5347.20 --> 5351.28]  materials just a curated playlist from your youtube channel yeah there's more to it i'd want them to do
[5351.28 --> 5355.52]  better than yeah but they just learned watching our videos because a lot of the time we leave a lot out
[5355.52 --> 5362.08]  yeah have you ever ever considered picking up game devs for labs videos being a game artist myself i
[5362.08 --> 5365.92]  always find myself watching ltt and having my own wisdom i wish were included or explored in other
[5365.92 --> 5371.44]  vids at a surface level um it would we'd be interested in it but it couldn't be someone's
[5371.44 --> 5377.44]  primary skill set yeah they'd have to be a testing person yeah yeah so that'd be pretty tough hey mr
[5377.44 --> 5382.24]  skywalker i guess this one's for you okay is there any way to watch live streams on ios right now
[5382.24 --> 5387.92]  uh like in flow plane i guess if they miss the notification apparently it's just gone and they
[5387.92 --> 5394.24]  have to wait for the vod weird that shouldn't be the case i jaden's in the chat we'll figure that out
[5395.44 --> 5400.32]  mark a asks we've been essentially blocked for ios development for a long time we are not currently
[5400.32 --> 5406.88]  blocked so there has been a few recent updates uh and things are being fixed and and brought up to
[5407.60 --> 5412.08]  where it should be as fast as we can uh yeah jaden in flow plane chat just said that doesn't
[5412.08 --> 5417.12]  sound right i feel like there might be a flow problem here um but we'll we'll look into it
[5417.12 --> 5421.36]  maybe message full plane support so that we can actually respond to you can you hit a cpu or gpu
[5421.36 --> 5426.56]  with a controlled load so that it stays at a specific temperature i want to use a pc to heat an
[5426.56 --> 5434.40]  insulated water bath and cook a steak sous vide style could be awesome okay that sounds like the pizza
[5434.40 --> 5440.72]  heater computer you'd be far better off just hitting it with a sous vide uh uh uh uh uh um
[5441.92 --> 5448.56]  like a maximum a full load and then uh when the temperature gets to the right point backing off the
[5448.56 --> 5456.80]  load and just controlling it pwm style rather than dc style if you kind of catch my drift yeah also use a
[5457.68 --> 5462.64]  would you be interested in hiring someone just for the workshop i did machining apprenticeship in germany
[5462.64 --> 5468.00]  at mercedes have been working there for two years now i'm a canadian citizen yeah it would be tough
[5468.00 --> 5474.48]  because everything we do in the shop has a purpose other than just like doing things in the shop i i
[5474.48 --> 5479.04]  don't think we're at that scale yet basically what do you think it would take for right to repair to
[5479.04 --> 5484.16]  really take off and make a big impact i mean it takes consumers demanding it eric uh there's a lot
[5484.16 --> 5488.32]  of people in flow plane chat right now saying that it works just fine on ios okay there's someone who's
[5488.32 --> 5492.08]  watching on desktop and they opened their app without the notification and opened the stream
[5492.08 --> 5496.56]  on ios by clicking the live button so i think it works i think there's just maybe a flow problem
[5496.56 --> 5500.64]  matthew asks looking for a good dual monitor stand with one monitor on top of the other not side by
[5500.64 --> 5504.96]  side any suggestions i've been happy with my vivo stuff it's cheap and cheerful not the best not the
[5504.96 --> 5512.32]  worst i haven't tried their top oh wait i have i did a video where i upgraded to two of lg's super mega
[5512.32 --> 5517.04]  ultra wides a while back and i believe i used a stand from vivo it's fine
[5519.44 --> 5523.60]  any thoughts on a boot cut sock i'd love to have something to wear during work yeah we're going to
[5523.60 --> 5527.76]  do socks eventually give us time do you think it makes what when do you think it will make more
[5527.76 --> 5532.88]  sense for a pc gamer to buy a 4k tv instead of a monitor i mean i'm already running a 4k tv instead
[5532.88 --> 5539.76]  of a monitor so i would say the time the time is now the screwdriver will have a black cap and there
[5539.76 --> 5544.32]  will also be an orange cap version there are going to be two different versions and for influencers
[5544.32 --> 5549.20]  we're going to do special versions in their own colors which i'm super excited about we found a
[5549.20 --> 5556.72]  place that'll do super low volume injection molding and we managed to get colors for like ijustine
[5557.28 --> 5563.84]  like a blue for gamers nexus we've got uh oh what's uh jerry rig everything's color i can't remember but
[5563.84 --> 5569.20]  yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be super cool william asks how much performance am i losing
[5569.20 --> 5580.32]  vr 9900k d390 pcie gen 3 evga ftw 3090 should i upgrade to 12th gen i mean most vr games are really
[5580.32 --> 5586.56]  designed for lowest common denominator anyway yeah so i would say you're probably getting as much
[5586.56 --> 5593.12]  meaningful performance as you can it's also gonna super depend on your application there's a huge range
[5593.12 --> 5598.72]  in vr um i would i would check how your game is performing and if you need more performance go for
[5598.72 --> 5605.36]  it question for luke usually with rolling up long sleeve shirts ends up with the sleeves sleeve collars
[5605.36 --> 5609.52]  getting stretched out for me so wearing the sleeves all the way out feels weird have you experienced any
[5609.52 --> 5616.00]  permanent stretching with the short circuit shirt the it might look big um but no there's no stretching
[5616.00 --> 5622.72]  here oh and i i like exclusively wear it rolled up okay i have had the same problem with other shirts
[5622.72 --> 5627.36]  i've had shirts become like kind of weird i've actually had shirts make it so that i have to roll
[5627.36 --> 5632.96]  it in a different way because it gets so loose but so far i mean i'm not guaranteeing anything but so far
[5632.96 --> 5639.36]  i've had no issues here zach excited for the hoodie do you have any thoughts on the state of twitch og staff
[5639.36 --> 5645.92]  leaving coo left dmca not profitable most importantly we still don't know why dr disrespect got banned
[5645.92 --> 5650.64]  keep up the great work uh not profitable is it's almost certainly going to stay that way streaming
[5650.64 --> 5656.00]  is extremely expensive video online video is just extremely expensive as is and then you add streaming
[5656.00 --> 5661.36]  to it and it becomes more expensive uh by a lot yeah and then you you put twitch prime in there so
[5661.36 --> 5667.92]  they're just throwing free money all over the place and it's just crazy um in terms of everyone leaving
[5667.92 --> 5674.16]  uh yeah i'm not surprised um i mean there's a video from like forever ago
[5675.04 --> 5679.60]  uh where i say something about bleeding purple because i thought twitch was just so cool because
[5679.60 --> 5684.08]  twitch was just awesome back in the day and it's just not anymore and that's just a fact i also just
[5684.08 --> 5690.00]  wonder how much of it was not awesome but rather just hadn't come to light yet that's probably true
[5690.00 --> 5694.32]  uh i think the main thing that i thought was awesome back then was just streaming video was so new
[5694.32 --> 5698.80]  and i thought the technology was just super cool right that's fair i'm talking this is a long time
[5698.80 --> 5705.20]  ago like a very long time we're talking when justin.tv still existed yeah like it's yeah i think this
[5705.20 --> 5711.68]  was this video would have been like 2011 2012 right which was interviewing people at pax talking about
[5711.68 --> 5719.92]  like twitch it was a very long time ago um it was they were recording vods about twitch at pax because irl
[5719.92 --> 5725.68]  streaming was not a thing right this is a long time um i i think the platform has also become very
[5725.68 --> 5732.88]  different than it was back then um it's now a streaming for everything platform yep um i think
[5732.88 --> 5738.24]  what is it a talk show or irl or whatever i don't watch that much twitch um being the top category on
[5738.24 --> 5743.44]  twitch all the time is a big example of that sure um where back in the day a lot of the top creators
[5743.44 --> 5748.32]  were just like these really good gamers that would barely even say anything and people were just there to
[5748.32 --> 5755.44]  watch their gameplay yeah and now it's very much like uh culture streams and stuff like that so yeah i don't
[5755.44 --> 5758.00]  know that's so weird taking the headphones off and actually hearing you
[5761.68 --> 5768.32]  my hat here i never shouted out this new design yeah it went up on the store i think a couple of
[5768.32 --> 5776.00]  weeks ago oh um man what's it called again like rgb or um rgb diode t-shirt rgb diode that's right so
[5776.00 --> 5783.44]  it's inspired by sub pixels okay that's the idea by like sub pixel patterns and then i you know it's one
[5783.44 --> 5789.84]  of those ones that's like stealth nerdy like unless you know unless you recognize that you'd have no
[5789.84 --> 5794.72]  idea you'd just think oh like that's a cool that's a cool design i thought it was supposed to be like a
[5794.72 --> 5799.76]  interesting take on like an rgb tech linked logo yeah so i told nick i'd talk about this one because
[5799.76 --> 5803.84]  i forgot to talk about it the week that we launched it and it's always nice to give the designers a
[5803.84 --> 5808.56]  shout out on the show yeah rather than just like having it go live and it's been selling really well
[5808.56 --> 5814.00]  like people are super into it uh but i i never i never did shout it out properly uh no we don't
[5814.00 --> 5820.32]  have any plans for formal pants brandon unfortunately i love the server content you guys do says logan in
[5820.32 --> 5824.32]  the future any more plans to server related content absolutely we experienced some data loss recently
[5824.32 --> 5831.52]  so you're gonna see some vlogs about that um yeah i'd say it's normal for joy cons to feel like
[5831.52 --> 5837.44]  they're kind of low quality and here this brings on the triggers john yep i may have asked this before
[5837.44 --> 5841.76]  but what are the estimated launch times for screwdriver and backpack i don't know we get that question
[5841.76 --> 5848.08]  literally every week yeah i yeah i don't know what to tell you always enjoy the show serious props to
[5848.08 --> 5853.92]  built to you for everything quick question about labs ideas plans and thoughts about testing anything
[5853.92 --> 5863.20]  in the audio space uh we are uh we are definitely currently working on uh the interview process for
[5863.20 --> 5871.76]  someone who was formerly at a very well-known audio publication uh we would we would like very much to
[5872.56 --> 5879.52]  um to add someone with that kind of expertise to our team so stay tuned nothing is set in stone yet i
[5879.52 --> 5885.36]  actually have a call that's labs related when i'm driving home from wanshow today uh that will maybe be a
[5885.36 --> 5892.00]  team lead for the lab oh nice yeah so we're chatting that's cool we're chatting that's really cool
[5892.00 --> 5898.24]  is this the first chat this is my first chat so i've texted like we've been in touch this is someone
[5898.24 --> 5904.80]  i know and then james and kyle have interviewed and they they agree with me because uh they had well
[5904.80 --> 5909.44]  they hadn't met surprising they hadn't met them though yeah okay yeah but they they're like okay
[5910.40 --> 5917.12]  we see why you want this person yeah i went yep yep that makes sense so i'm i'm excited we're going
[5917.12 --> 5920.56]  to chat about it we're going to talk about some of the more nitty-gritty details like uh
[5923.20 --> 5931.68]  yep yeah yeah whoo uh labs is going to be a big investment dude yeah but that's okay because
[5931.68 --> 5936.08]  luke has seen the road map for some of the site features we have oh it's actually really cool
[5936.08 --> 5940.48]  yeah that's really cool i'm pretty excited i'm gonna have to hire more people for that
[5940.48 --> 5946.00]  this is why the scope is increasing okay i may just be an idea man as they're called he's got some
[5946.00 --> 5953.52]  good ideas but i got some good ideas okay um i i shared it with the team by the way what they think
[5953.52 --> 5959.12]  it's cool okay i did tell them like if this group of people that i'm currently talking to is working on
[5959.12 --> 5965.28]  it it's only this little section at the top so don't freak out because like when i first showed it
[5965.28 --> 5970.00]  mvp you just hear yeah you just hear silence for a little bit and i'm like it's okay it's okay
[5971.76 --> 5978.48]  everyone's like oh no um oh no speaking of uh good things though you want to share my screen i'd love
[5978.48 --> 5985.28]  to uh we launched the desk pad configurator jaden or sorry conrad just reminded me about it in the
[5985.28 --> 5990.64]  float plane yeah i should have brought this up earlier this is super cool um now when you are
[5990.64 --> 5996.56]  my resolution here is a little low so the the the menu is large but uh now if you're if you're
[5996.56 --> 6001.68]  shopping for a desk pad they're all the same price very cool but there's tons of different sizes
[6001.68 --> 6006.80]  and if you don't have a measuring there's so many it could be confusing yeah so you you could put in
[6006.80 --> 6012.08]  the theoretical aspect size of a desk or you could even plan a size of a desktop that you're cutting and
[6012.08 --> 6018.64]  making yourself or whatever or that you're based on uh uh how this ends up looking like so you can see
[6018.64 --> 6024.88]  different sizes of desk pads um and you can see what they would look like uh on your desk you can
[6024.88 --> 6029.92]  show your peripherals uh you can add different amounts of monitors so if you want to have like
[6029.92 --> 6035.76]  three monitors you can do that you can move them all independently you can enable rotation so you can like
[6035.76 --> 6042.16]  actually set up your desk how your desk is set up at home which is like actually pretty sweet i'm just
[6042.16 --> 6048.48]  gonna do some stuff here you can you can get different peripherals so if you're like hey the
[6048.48 --> 6053.92]  desk pad has has a huge variety of colors on it i want my peripherals to be rgb so that they match you
[6053.92 --> 6058.96]  can do that apparently that moves the monitors don't worry about it um there's also a variety of desk
[6059.52 --> 6065.28]  styles so different woods and then there's also an rgb option so you can change it to
[6065.28 --> 6071.44]  whatever the heck color you want and then whenever you're happy with whatever desk pad size you want
[6071.44 --> 6080.80]  you can add it to cart very cool um someone pointed out that capital m capital m it would be mega
[6080.80 --> 6086.72]  somethings not millimeters oh wow mega miles i don't know what it would be yeah let's fix that
[6088.24 --> 6093.28]  that's pretty minor that's pretty minor yes it means millimeters you guys it might be a font thing so
[6093.28 --> 6099.20]  it's easier than ever to get an awesome desk pad for your desk it's also kind of fun to just kind of
[6099.76 --> 6104.72]  play with it to give you some idea of how popular the northern lights desk pad has been we have 35
[6104.72 --> 6112.48]  082 reviews 35 or 3500 sorry 3582 reviews and we didn't even turn on reviews because we didn't have
[6112.48 --> 6119.12]  them yet until well into the life cycle of that product it's been crazy and now we've made it even
[6119.12 --> 6122.80]  easier to kind of figure out which one's right because that's been the big thing for people is
[6122.80 --> 6130.32]  like hey it actually fits the when you add more options um which option you should choose becomes
[6130.32 --> 6135.04]  less clear yeah so making it really easy like yes obviously people can figure it out they have tape
[6135.04 --> 6140.16]  measures they have spatial reasoning stuff like that but being able to be very sure is cool and also
[6140.16 --> 6146.40]  being able to conceptualize that way oh i forgot this size of a desk what size of desk pad could i have how
[6146.40 --> 6153.04]  could i set up my peripherals etc it's just it's an interesting tool jacob w if i had a 1050 ti today
[6153.04 --> 6161.76]  i would game on that and i would watch this crypto crash real close it could maybe be happening
[6162.64 --> 6169.44]  because we we need crypto to crash as long as it keeps going up gpu prices will just go up because
[6169.44 --> 6174.96]  it's a completely different calculus for someone who's deciding to buy a gpu based on a profitability
[6174.96 --> 6180.64]  calculation yeah as long as there's gpu mineable crypto that people care about yes yeah what about
[6180.64 --> 6186.88]  a diy channel the problem with diy channels is that they tend to be more niche and be better than diy
[6186.88 --> 6193.12]  perks we have to be well it's not even just that like no one's better than diy perks that was my yeah so
[6193.84 --> 6204.88]  like the roi from a business standpoint is not great the vision for labs is a lot bigger than a youtube
[6204.88 --> 6211.84]  channel and that's how we can justify something that is so much work and so much cost we could
[6211.84 --> 6219.36]  spend money like that starting a diy channel and realistically as far as i can see we'd only ever
[6219.36 --> 6223.52]  really be able to monetize it in the same way that we could something like short circuit which frankly
[6223.52 --> 6229.68]  costs us next to nothing um and so why are we reaching for this extremely high fruit when we can
[6229.68 --> 6235.44]  take a low hanging one or we could or we could do something that's much much bigger than either of
[6235.44 --> 6241.04]  those things i only have so much capital i only have so much time i only have so much space and staff
[6241.04 --> 6246.16]  so we have to pick our battles and i've chosen labs as the battle that we're going to fight this year
[6247.28 --> 6252.88]  so you know what never say never but it's not in the cards for the time being also i don't think
[6252.88 --> 6256.80]  there's any plans for different colors of the crew neck sweater and watch diy perks because he's awesome
[6256.80 --> 6262.16]  um finally able to catch live from malaysia what's the price of the screwdriver hopefully in the
[6262.16 --> 6270.56]  neighborhood of 69 69 is uh is the goal i've been watching since internet in cuba wasn't available
[6270.56 --> 6277.28]  had to pay for usb drives with videos on them i've actually wanted to i think i pitched years ago
[6277.28 --> 6283.36]  talking about sneaker net in cuba yep and i basically said look i i can't fly to cuba to make this video but
[6283.36 --> 6289.84]  that's super cool yeah yeah which is fair but it's so i it's kind of cool knowing that there was
[6289.84 --> 6296.80]  ltd videos on flash drives being handed around in cuba that's that's interesting that's amazing um
[6297.76 --> 6307.84]  getting into 3d modeling ryzen 7 2700x or threadripper 1920x what was the 1920x is that the 16 no no was
[6307.84 --> 6314.00]  that an 8 core uh i would say there's not going to be much difference between those two was the 2700x
[6314.00 --> 6319.92]  and 8 core if i recall correctly it was i i would i would get whatever you can get a cheaper motherboard
[6319.92 --> 6328.16]  for at this point which is probably going to be the 2700x any chance of ltd jeans no uh no we are not
[6328.16 --> 6332.32]  redesigning the backpack to accommodate the new larger water bottle size because it would have to
[6332.32 --> 6337.60]  have a holder like this big enormous yeah it's ridiculous it's not yeah it's not happening uh
[6337.60 --> 6343.28]  thoughts on bioimplant rfid chips and humans i the only reason i don't have one yet is because we were
[6343.28 --> 6349.28]  planning to a bunch of us go down to seattle where there's a place that does it on a field trip i'll get
[6349.28 --> 6354.56]  them and then come back and make a video about it but then covet happened i'd go with you yeah i know yeah
[6354.56 --> 6360.80]  yep heck yeah heck yeah yeah i mean if i could like yeah if i could open a door by just like touching a
[6360.80 --> 6369.04]  thing so cool so bring it on what i could get a little gangrene from the thing no problem
[6371.60 --> 6380.48]  in all seriousness ltd stealth gloves when gloves they have the same response to that sorry is anyone
[6380.48 --> 6385.76]  asking for this what is this stealth glove i don't really i saw someone ask for fingerless gloves like
[6385.76 --> 6393.68]  for what though i don't know i i don't know what we have to contribute to the glove market yeah yeah
[6393.68 --> 6398.64]  there's some pretty good gloves out there the wife likes the beard that's why it's staying love
[6398.64 --> 6403.36]  the desk configure i could love the desk configurator i've been wondering which one to get paul h there
[6403.36 --> 6409.12]  nice first confirmed desk configurator user perfect hey i want to build my first computer my macbook
[6409.12 --> 6414.00]  grow slowing down i want to get off a console for gaming what cpu should i start with ryzen 5 or ryzen
[6414.00 --> 6420.08]  7 get a ryzen 5 we should have added tracking so we could tell how many people clicked add to cart
[6420.08 --> 6425.60]  through the configurator versus through the page that seems like the kind of thing that um developers
[6425.60 --> 6430.00]  would want to spend extra cycles doing so they can justify their existence but don't worry
[6430.64 --> 6436.64]  you guys are great don't bother i believe in it okay i mean it would potentially drive development
[6436.64 --> 6440.80]  for future tools in the later on because if no one used it then we shouldn't make anything like
[6440.80 --> 6444.88]  that in the future that's true people love it then we should if people don't use it though then it's
[6444.88 --> 6449.76]  an accessibility issue because it's great okay i don't need data to tell me it's great it's great
[6449.76 --> 6453.36]  so we're gonna make more things like that sounds good yeah you know i don't i don't need that tool
[6454.24 --> 6459.52]  someone's gonna build it anyway i don't control that team i don't even know who's in well i know who's in
[6459.52 --> 6465.84]  charge of it but like yeah sometimes he's not even in charge we won't make it now okay sure yeah uh
[6465.84 --> 6471.76]  ever thought of doing gym gear yes unless unless someone does it on creative day but i think he has
[6471.76 --> 6476.56]  more interesting things to do on creative day i think it's fine um we are working on swim shorts
[6476.56 --> 6481.60]  we're working on long exercise pants we're working on an exercise t-shirt other than that i can't promise
[6481.60 --> 6489.20]  anything would the banana be okay as a dog toy no not recommended don't mind me just hoping when hoodies get
[6489.20 --> 6494.64]  back in stock soon yeah heck yeah jeremy me too your show has helped my wife feel more confident
[6494.64 --> 6500.24]  approaching tech she recently built her first computer uh recently received the underwear and my
[6501.76 --> 6509.28]  my and my scrotum has never known such comfort uh my wife would like to know how close uh the
[6509.28 --> 6518.16]  women's underwear is um not that close we have designs we're at the design stage probably we will work
[6518.16 --> 6525.12]  with um the same or similar manufacturer to our men's underwear but we just don't i don't like
[6525.12 --> 6530.56]  giving eta's for things because as soon as i give an eta then i'm a liar because it ends up being wrong
[6531.60 --> 6538.40]  so why be a liar if you don't have to soon to him oakley says for a nas would you recommend 5900 or 7200
[6538.40 --> 6544.32]  rpm drives if you need performance 7200 rpm if you care more about power efficiency then 5900 is fine just
[6544.32 --> 6551.20]  fine for long-term storage uh will there be new base colors for t-shirts yes they're all on that wall
[6551.20 --> 6555.84]  over there but i have no easy way of getting i do fine don't want to get it no it's fine i'll get them
[6556.88 --> 6558.16]  rakim making me get up
[6562.00 --> 6567.76]  do you think the screwdriver will be a defendable tool purchase to submit for reimbursement from my company
[6567.76 --> 6575.60]  to say it in another way will it be more likely a best in class tool or a nice tool but still merch
[6579.68 --> 6580.80]  i think best in class tool
[6582.72 --> 6587.60]  is kind of the goal we worked with like a super legit company i don't really name them off the top of my
[6587.60 --> 6593.84]  hand um what company did we work with for the screwdriver again uh we worked with mega pro yeah so mega pro
[6593.84 --> 6600.08]  very well known like automotive grade screwdrivers um we're using their patented design for the bit
[6600.08 --> 6605.36]  loader we're using their patented design for the ratchet we've worked very closely with them on the
[6605.36 --> 6614.00]  development of it really our contribution is the um i mean the tooling costs to make it because it's got a way
[6614.56 --> 6620.96]  slimmer handle and our custom length bits so that it can fit 12 bits in a really low profile
[6620.96 --> 6627.20]  um like driver handle and the ergonomics it's just no offense to mega pro we love you guys we want to
[6627.20 --> 6631.84]  work with you for a long time but uh we don't like the ergonomics of your drivers yeah so i definitely
[6631.84 --> 6637.28]  wouldn't say it's just like a merge thing it's a it's a very serious tool yep thoughts on a pick your
[6637.28 --> 6642.16]  poison mentality for mobile manufacturers uh it feels like a game of chance since every manufacturer
[6642.16 --> 6645.28]  and model seems to have their own problems yeah i don't know what to tell you other than
[6645.28 --> 6650.56]  i think you kind of nailed it uh there's no motherboard manufacturer that goes scandal free
[6650.56 --> 6656.40]  for longer than you're also so rough right now like my my brother's building a new computer and
[6656.40 --> 6660.24]  he was shopping for a motherboard and i was trying to help him shop for a motherboard and the price that
[6660.24 --> 6668.16]  you have to pay for motherboards with like four usb ports is nuts i know right it's so crazy and like
[6668.16 --> 6676.48]  it's not like oh they filled it with other like uh io options nope it's just giant gaps in the shield
[6676.48 --> 6684.56]  like oh my goodness these are like 350 dollar motherboards i hear you what the heck put some usbs
[6684.56 --> 6689.12]  on it it's like them one of the main thing people are shopping for right now come on your motherboard
[6689.12 --> 6694.88]  it's boring it's okay embrace it i've been watching since cat tips i have been wondering if you have any
[6694.88 --> 6702.08]  plans for engineering uh work shop wear specifically pants we do have a shop jacket coming uh no pants
[6702.08 --> 6706.24]  for the time being and i don't think we have any electronics engineering technologist positions open
[6706.24 --> 6710.96]  but you can always check the linusmediagroup.com website where we advertise all positions for float
[6710.96 --> 6716.56]  plane linus media group as well as creator warehouse any chance on getting a video on setting up a home
[6716.56 --> 6723.20]  network like what equipment you need basic security etc it's not a bad idea but realistically unless you
[6723.20 --> 6730.48]  know you need it you're probably fine with your isp provided modem like really um if your wi-fi doesn't
[6730.48 --> 6737.84]  suck then it's fine and if your wi-fi sucks then get something new and that has better range and
[6737.84 --> 6742.40]  performance like i i don't know it's one of those things that's become so commoditized at this point
[6742.40 --> 6748.96]  that commoditized commoditized which one is it i don't know commoditized i think that i i just i don't
[6748.96 --> 6754.48]  think that most people really need anything special for it i i'm sure there's going to be
[6754.48 --> 6758.88]  people that are really upset about me saying that yeah they're horrible sure fine but my parents don't
[6758.88 --> 6764.96]  need anything other than their isp modem so i left it there yeah yeah i was wondering why you didn't
[6764.96 --> 6770.80]  review the odyssey mobius i thought we did do something on it on short circuit easily the best
[6770.80 --> 6776.72]  jacket that one went away no question cool um have you thought about opening a u.s based distribution
[6776.72 --> 6783.44]  facility to make the u.s shipping and customs process easier so it might make your life easier
[6783.44 --> 6788.80]  but it makes mine a lot harder in terms of taxes as soon as you have a physical presence in a state
[6788.80 --> 6795.92]  you um have to file with that state and it's like way more complicated so we're gonna stay canadian for
[6795.92 --> 6803.68]  a bit um no there are no more bananas coming um anytime soon or fruit or other objects william ben b
[6803.68 --> 6809.60]  do you know about anything about getting variable refresh rate on a sony tv working on windows 11
[6810.32 --> 6814.72]  the 6900 xt says variable refresh rate but their radeon settings only has free sync and says it's
[6814.72 --> 6820.16]  not supported as far as i know sony doesn't have free sync support i i guys correct me if i'm wrong
[6820.16 --> 6825.60]  here but i think sony is kind of dragging butt on that no idea long time fan of the show says james
[6825.60 --> 6829.36]  have you ever considered working with a streaming service to produce an animated comedy show based on
[6829.36 --> 6833.36]  the staff of linus media group and the captains around the office no i can't say i've done that
[6834.64 --> 6840.40]  i don't think it'd be that funny no probably not i'm not planning a galaxy watch for review nobody
[6840.40 --> 6848.80]  watches smartwatch reviews so yeah i don't know i i honestly pretty much just use it to tell the time
[6849.68 --> 6855.84]  i i don't even really know how it works i've gone full boomer on my watch mike r says howdy possible to
[6855.84 --> 6860.72]  get an apple flavored channel in whoa it's flying all over the place uh apple flavored channel in
[6860.72 --> 6864.32]  discord windows people make fun of us linux people make fun of us we need a safe space
[6865.68 --> 6872.24]  i don't know um yeah that sounds like if you tweet that at jake maybe he could do it for you yeah
[6872.96 --> 6879.76]  hey yo i got rfid tags in my hands for text syndicates video okay one of mine stopped working
[6879.76 --> 6885.44]  after seven months word of warning have a plan to get it out and swapped ahead of time oh wow
[6886.24 --> 6890.80]  fair enough yeah seems like it yes i did order seven shirts okay blake
[6893.36 --> 6902.96]  they're not all for me is this a good idea gamer bed v2 with this monitor arm the dw 63 63dw and
[6902.96 --> 6906.64]  you're set up for a computer in another room with the corning thunderbolt cable was nice to see the
[6906.64 --> 6912.64]  team at ltx just walking by and saying hi yeah i wish ltx could ever be a thing again yeah we did the
[6912.64 --> 6919.36]  official we did the official cancellation notification recently oh really yeah 2022 is
[6919.36 --> 6923.52]  officially not happening that is pretty cool though having it come from above you so you got your screen
[6923.52 --> 6932.64]  there it's 545 for that monitor arm though yikes uh kyle looking into mid-range soundbars wondering if
[6932.64 --> 6938.16]  there would really be much of a difference between e-arc and arc at the 400 to 500 price range so e-arc versus
[6938.16 --> 6946.08]  arc is going to be a lesser concern than getting a good quality sound bar that makes good quality
[6946.08 --> 6954.64]  noises out of the front of it uh obviously e-arc allows for higher bandwidth communication between
[6954.64 --> 6961.36]  the sound bar and the tv but that's going to be wasted if it doesn't have like good speakers in it
[6961.36 --> 6968.40]  so i i wouldn't let that be the um the decision maker for me i i would aim for just better sound
[6968.40 --> 6975.12]  quality at that kind of a price point thanks for the amazing content um work only allows me to wear
[6975.12 --> 6980.32]  all black hats and shirts do you guys have any plans to do more gray or black stuff in the future yes
[6980.32 --> 6987.12]  yes yes more uh one of the things that we'd like to do is actually make our blanks available as just
[6987.12 --> 6995.76]  completely unlogoed unprinted garments so it's going to be part of creator warehouses expansion into
[6995.76 --> 7003.36]  providing merch for other creators as well as just a way to offer a slightly lower cost way to get just
[7003.36 --> 7008.40]  like comfortable quality shirt yeah so we're pretty excited about that please give us an update on storage
[7008.40 --> 7015.44]  containers storage containers no idea yeah i i'm sorry i have no idea what you're talking about okay
[7016.08 --> 7020.72]  i bought my first parts for my first pc waiting to buy a gpu like everyone else i'm wondering if i
[7020.72 --> 7026.64]  should be hopeful for intel alchemist or wait for 40 series and hope i can get one i don't have a crystal
[7026.64 --> 7032.24]  ball all i can say is uh be rooting for the crypto crash if you want a gpu to be affordable anytime soon
[7032.24 --> 7040.48]  all right uh are there new desk pad designs coming yes a while ago right before covet i believe you
[7040.48 --> 7044.32]  mentioned a big ltt store project you were excited for said you were planning on even sponsoring other
[7044.32 --> 7049.76]  youtube channels uh yeah that was intended to be the screwdriver i think that based on how much money
[7049.76 --> 7055.36]  i just lost on having to i mean we're going to chase them for it the deposit but we could be out as much
[7055.36 --> 7062.32]  as 140 grand on our deposit to the um the taiwan-based manufacturer that got acquired oh what they were
[7062.32 --> 7069.36]  acquired by a major tool manufacturer so they just like deprioritized our order and just i'm getting
[7069.36 --> 7074.72]  flashbacks to front-end design for float plane dragged their butts dragged their butts i don't know how many
[7074.72 --> 7081.52]  people know that story but yeah so we've been really frustrated and we found a uh a factory in china
[7081.52 --> 7087.04]  that quite frankly the quality of the work is better anyway so i think we're just gonna take the
[7087.04 --> 7093.04]  order there because the the taiwan factory clearly doesn't want our business so uh and it's like an
[7093.04 --> 7097.12]  obvious conflict of interest that they're owned by a competitor at this point oh yeah definitely
[7098.72 --> 7107.84]  i have a 32 inch 1440p1 44 hertz va panel i want to upgrade where would you go i have a 1080ti that sounds
[7107.84 --> 7114.88]  like a pretty good place to be quite honestly yeah chill there yeah relax hang back yeah don't uh
[7114.88 --> 7120.40]  don't overdo it yeah oh boy i get to install linux for my it class wish me luck also any plans for ltt
[7120.40 --> 7127.04]  gloves or fingerless gloves okay here's another one maybe it's the same person i can't imagine we've
[7127.04 --> 7131.92]  never heard that request ever before yeah what what would be the value of ltt gloves there's some meme
[7131.92 --> 7140.00]  is there a meme going on i don't know uh okay uh yeah i don't think so though i don't think so
[7140.00 --> 7144.72]  also opera apparently overrides the checkout with a shopify checkout so people can't see merch messages
[7144.72 --> 7150.00]  on there oh it's okay no one uses opera anyway cool feature opera uh just got my indoor hoodie this
[7150.00 --> 7154.56]  week liked it so much i ordered another any plans to do more basic style clothing not a huge fan of the
[7154.56 --> 7158.64]  patterns but if you did more stuff like the indoor hoodie i would absolutely buy it yes we absolutely
[7158.64 --> 7164.72]  will that's uh that's totally a plan i should go get the waffle shirt okay yeah yeah do merch message
[7164.72 --> 7170.32]  do it okay they're gone so chat talk to float point talk to me dudes or uh or merch messages if they
[7170.32 --> 7175.60]  come in i'm gonna bring the waffle shirt ltd gloves for airsoft you know i've been trying to get linus to
[7175.60 --> 7184.88]  do airsoft but he always wants to do paintball yeah he always wants to do paintball um so yeah i don't know
[7184.88 --> 7190.48]  um i i mean there's no way we're gonna end up making paintball merch but um linus and i go
[7191.04 --> 7197.12]  snowboarding as well i don't think we'd end up doing any snowboarding stuff hi jaden uh people are
[7197.12 --> 7204.08]  asking about the i i alluded to a story of front-end development on float plane so when float plane
[7204.72 --> 7211.44]  i hope he's not watching because it's not his fault but when float plane was very young uh we worked with
[7211.44 --> 7219.84]  a fan who had a design studio in a different country um and he did very good work i wanted to
[7219.84 --> 7227.28]  work with him um he was fantastic super nice dude have met very few people in my life that are nicer
[7227.28 --> 7235.44]  than this guy i'm actually he's very cool i hope we're still very cool um he was really really good
[7235.44 --> 7239.92]  he had done some somewhat pro bono work for us in the past i wanted to work with him in a professional
[7239.92 --> 7247.52]  capacity in order to do that i had to work with his company his company was also pretty neat i negotiated
[7247.52 --> 7253.52]  a price with them which was still reasonably expensive but i guess they did a lot of work with
[7253.52 --> 7259.52]  companies that paid a lot more a lot of the design work that they did were for more like single image
[7259.52 --> 7265.68]  advertisements so they were much smaller jobs than like an entire website um but they they agreed to
[7265.68 --> 7271.36]  this price and then they were acquired and the company that acquired them had a lot of other
[7271.36 --> 7276.88]  really highly valuable work so because the price was low they incredibly devalued it to the point of
[7276.88 --> 7281.76]  essentially not working on it at all for many many months and we were stuck with no design and it was
[7281.76 --> 7286.16]  really really really frustrating to the point where i eventually just flew to sweden sat in their office
[7286.16 --> 7291.84]  and was like do it now and then we got it done um and then we didn't work with them after that so
[7291.84 --> 7302.48]  that's how it worked hi hi so this is cool what is it hold on i gotta not show my nips so is that still
[7302.48 --> 7307.28]  a rule i don't know i don't know either i don't know i genuinely have no idea i don't know what twitch
[7307.28 --> 7316.08]  is ruled by hold on urban fervor said i miss your streams you pretty much over that for the time being
[7316.08 --> 7325.28]  no i streamed this week actually the waffle shirt that actually looks really sharp yeah yeah it's just
[7325.28 --> 7335.92]  like uh what it's got the like tag and stuff yeah yeah yeah but oh come on yeah it's just like a kind
[7335.92 --> 7345.20]  of a little bit warm not too warm like long sleeve just kind of presentable thing um people apparently
[7345.20 --> 7351.84]  saw it oh whatever i'm over it so yeah this is this is gonna be like i guess it's merch but
[7351.84 --> 7356.32]  the only thing that makes it merch is this tiny little ltt tag at the bottom here and other than
[7356.32 --> 7360.16]  that it's just a shirt like a thing on the back even no i don't think so i shouldn't have leaned
[7360.16 --> 7363.44]  away i was asking if there's a thing on the back and no there's nothing on the back nope nothing on the
[7363.44 --> 7371.52]  back cool right yeah it looks good looks sharp um no plans to do a follow-up on the van life pc chrisy
[7371.52 --> 7376.32]  please give an update on the storage containers you mentioned a couple weeks back oh oh that our
[7376.32 --> 7382.72]  merch keeps getting stuck in uh no it oh it just takes as long as it takes we have yeah it just
[7382.72 --> 7388.32]  happens exactly updating us on those yeah it's ridiculous uh so frustrating
[7390.64 --> 7395.76]  that looks really comfy yeah yeah it is comfy it's like it's a waffle shirt i don't know we maybe that's
[7395.76 --> 7400.72]  not what it's supposed to be called but it has like kind of a waffle uh texture to the fabric this
[7400.72 --> 7404.80]  was one of those projects where we found the fabric first and then tried to create a garment
[7404.80 --> 7408.72]  with it because we were like oh that's really cool that's really nice fabric it's got it's not like
[7408.72 --> 7413.44]  the softest thing it's kind of it's kind of like the french terry feeling in terms of yeah yeah for
[7413.44 --> 7418.40]  sure yeah yeah but it's like uh i like that type of it's light it's breathable yeah which i really like
[7418.40 --> 7425.04]  because i get so warm like i always get too warm so i need stuff that that breathes a little bit um
[7425.04 --> 7430.64]  you know how the other shirt's called the party shirt uh yeah like the lounger shirt or something yeah i don't know
[7430.64 --> 7436.48]  know i think we're just gonna call it waffle shirt you're actually gonna call it that probably yeah
[7436.48 --> 7443.60]  cool the waffle shirt yeah why not yeah we're done though i think that's it yeah thank you guys
[7443.60 --> 7450.08]  so much for tuning into the wan show we will see you again next week same bad terrible time same bad
[7450.08 --> 7463.92]  terrible channel it's bad channel bad channel shouldn't watch it bye
[7463.92 --> 7482.72]  cool i'm gonna call it a waffle right brought to you by mechanical keyboards fresh books and see
[7482.72 --> 7489.04]  sonic by the way fun fact um it's good that we haven't waited around for youtube to fix super
[7489.04 --> 7496.56]  chats because look at this they are still not fixed here is my viewer activity tab here is clear
[7496.56 --> 7502.24]  evidence of a super chat that i have no record of because i didn't previously click the viewer activity
[7502.24 --> 7510.56]  tab thank you so much youtube this is worthless yeah so that's why you should instead of sending
[7510.56 --> 7515.84]  a super chat which you should never ever send anymore you should buy something on ltdstore.com and
[7515.84 --> 7520.56]  even if you didn't need it you can give it as a gift the water bottles are a great gift and then
[7520.56 --> 7526.64]  you can send your chat that way yeah and instead of the money going to google it will go to our
[7526.64 --> 7532.56]  warehouse manager patrick and his team and the creator warehouse team and minus media group and and
[7532.56 --> 7538.88]  the factories that we work with and that'll be good yeah and and if google wants your money then they
[7538.88 --> 7543.84]  can build a feature that works and then we'll probably still use merch messages because it's getting
[7543.84 --> 7551.84]  constantly better so get wrecked yeah pretty much and scene
