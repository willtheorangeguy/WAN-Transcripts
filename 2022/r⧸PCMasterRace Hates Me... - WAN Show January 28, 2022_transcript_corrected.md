[0.00 → 4.80] is up ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wan show we've got a fantastic show for you guys today
[4.80 → 12.48] the big topics are of course that r slash pc master race has had it up to here with me oh yeah
[12.48 → 19.04] I'm dead to them oh yeah officially dead to them deceased because of a hot take that frankly i
[19.04 → 24.16] didn't think was that hot I thought if anything it was kind of a lukewarm take left the
[24.16 → 30.48] toed a little too long actually not that warm he's smoking hot, but you know yeah you're cold
[31.20 → 36.00] I'm so cold well I told you I got my booster the other day and I'm just like I'm kind of all over
[36.00 → 45.92] the place right now um in other news the NVIDIA and arm wedding could be called off yeah oh who saw
[45.92 → 50.40] this one coming I'm pretty sure we called this did we call this I think so I don't know if we called
[50.40 → 55.76] that it actually wouldn't happen, but we definitely called that NVIDIA are there might be a problem
[55.76 → 62.56] there yeah are generally not beloved by the rest of the tech industry and that there might be
[62.56 → 68.00] some pushback what else we got today speaking of tech industry legal stuff intel is feeling fine
[68.00 → 78.00] after dodging a 1.06 billion euro fine I'd be feeling pretty fine too man from like 2009 by the way also
[78.00 → 86.00] uh I really don't understand this at all but somehow NFTs are coming to YouTube i literally
[86.00 → 91.52] don't know what that means that's another apparently super hot take that I had last week when I was just
[91.52 → 106.08] like yeah whatever bucket NFTs who cares and people were like probably on both sides right hey um okay
[108.00 → 112.32] I'm sorry about your monkey jay you know what here let me roll the intro why don't we actually talk a
[112.32 → 116.08] little bit yeah no we'll save it for later I'll talk about that later we have to roll the intro let's
[116.08 → 125.68] roll that intro boom the beep apparently didn't work ah well see you later monetization yeah who needs it
[125.68 → 137.28] anyway can we NFT the beep what would that even mean who knows okay I mean if you can uh and
[137.28 → 145.04] the show is brought to you by corsair Nosepass and vulture that's right ladies and gentlemen we are
[145.04 → 153.44] going to jump right into our first topic of the day the one and only linus media group that's right
[153.44 → 162.80] that's his real last name posted an inadvertent super red-hot take on Twitter last night uh so I'm
[162.80 → 171.12] going to go ahead and share my screen here let's start with the tweet that began it all which was a look
[171.12 → 180.00] at the 2021 revenue makeup for Linus media group we're not planning to do a full update this year we're
[180.00 → 186.00] not going to do a video about it, we did one just last year uh but I did want to keep you guys abreast
[186.00 → 192.32] to what's going on so basically I said hey you know I want to make sure we're staying transparent with
[192.32 → 200.00] you all so uh YouTube AdSense is 18 percent other affiliates and ads is five percent uh Facebook ads
[200.00 → 207.44] is two percent sponsored projects and in video sponsor spots combined for 35 percent merch is 32 percent
[207.44 → 214.40] floatplanes four percent yeah Amazon associates is three percent with other revenue being one
[214.40 → 223.52] percent and in response to this tweet uh one uh astute viewer said hold on a second let me see if I can
[224.16 → 231.68] find the thread here because it's super yeah it's really difficult to find stuff on Twitter uh one kirk LAU
[231.68 → 237.28] said wow I didn't imagine that AdSense would be a fifth of your income I feel like a jerk for being lazy
[237.44 → 246.48] not customizing my ad blocker I responded I said online websites and creators are supported by ads
[246.48 → 252.96] I thought that was pretty common knowledge question mark ad blocking is the exact same thing as piracy
[252.96 → 259.68] literally the exact same thing people will still do it and I've been guilty of it at times but we just
[259.68 → 270.16] need to be aware of the impact that was what I said now tell me Luke please tell me how spicy is that take
[270.88 → 274.56] give it to me out of ghost peppers how many ghost peppers
[276.96 → 285.68] I mean if I read it I would not have cared at all okay but no people are super mad like twitch
[285.68 → 291.60] chat which is based on which is awful people yeah love you float plane chat love you YouTube chat
[292.64 → 295.20] twitch chat just the worst sorry you're the worst
[299.60 → 306.72] uh did they agree with you because it's twitch chat no it was opposite no, no no, no no, no
[306.72 → 315.60] so help me out here i uh i I would not have been able to expect this reaction at all I'm genuinely
[315.60 → 322.16] very surprised by it because most people that I know just wouldn't care if that makes sense okay like
[322.16 → 331.60] yeah but I made it but I made it worse okay I did post some follow-up tweets on the subject okay, okay
[331.60 → 339.92] uh here I was replying to Thompson rem um yep our company would be less than one-fifth the size if
[339.92 → 343.76] we were like oh no that was a different that was a different comment I was replying to
[346.72 → 351.68] something don't want to plaster the form with ads something former sponsor was
[351.68 → 356.96] trying to pressure us we didn't notice that was a hilarious one uh okay, okay so here 's's where
[356.96 → 362.72] here's where things get kind of uh get kind of spicy conflating blocking ads with piracy is silly
[363.60 → 369.20] why not encourage everyone to block ads but buy some merch at least your merch segues are amusing and
[369.20 → 374.16] the desk pads are awesome to which I replied why not encourage everyone to torrent stranger things
[374.16 → 378.88] rather than subscribing to Netflix and then buy a stranger things themed Lego set and t-shirt
[378.88 → 389.28] I said you see now it's literally the exact same thing the payment for the content in this case is ads
[391.28 → 399.92] you're not watching them you are not paying for it because that's what the payment is um I followed
[399.92 → 405.52] that tweet up and Twitter is terrible so it's really hard to find this so we're going to go back to
[405.52 → 411.68] all of my things uh, so there's another reply here basically I was told going to have to agree to
[411.68 → 416.24] disagree love watching your content on YouTube I'll still continue to block ads and buy merch instead
[416.24 → 420.64] said go sneak into Cirque du Soleil without a ticket when they try to kick you out try the
[420.64 → 426.24] but I bought a soda and a hoodie defence you're just objectively wrong the price is set by the seller not
[426.24 → 434.80] the buyer you can steal slash pirate it but then just admit it to yourself and then I followed up to be
[434.80 → 440.24] clear I have publicly said that a single merch purchase is worth more than a year of AdSense for
[440.24 → 446.64] a viewer from a business standpoint I don't even care just don't make the argument it's not piracy
[446.64 → 459.28] ethical piracy is still piracy that was all I said on the subject I said that not paying for a thing is
[459.28 → 460.72] piracy
[463.44 → 471.12] so it shall, I begin bringing up the atrocious takes that I would like to publicly i I want to
[471.12 → 476.24] do a very short discussion before we do that, but there's a lot of those so we do got to get to that
[476.24 → 484.48] eventually sure um but when you're saying piracy sure would you back this up in a legal sense okay i
[484.48 → 491.12] think that's something that people are having problems with sure but when I say piracy I mean
[491.12 → 499.20] YAR yeah I get it I mean which is I think one of the reasons why like I was literally singing that
[499.20 → 507.20] before you got here oh really nice um i i i I think other people aren't interpreting it necessarily the same way
[507.20 → 513.76] um and I think that might be part of the problem but let us continue sure because I think that's the
[513.76 → 521.12] reason why when I read it I'm like yeah okay and I just don't care but then I think people are like
[521.12 → 526.56] oh you're saying I'm like breaking the law blah, and it's like okay no you can control what
[526.56 → 531.28] your browser do we've talked on Sancho about how you need to be able to do that that's like
[531.28 → 536.16] absolutely that should be very important, and you can do that and that's fine but yeah you're not paying
[536.16 → 542.24] for it, you're not uh there isn't an exchange that is intended to happen, and you are the one
[542.24 → 548.16] avoiding that so yeah I don't know go for it slam all right here we go ladies and gentlemen your screen
[548.72 → 555.52] ad blocking is not the exact same thing as piracy to conflate the two is laughable at best and dangerous
[556.08 → 562.32] at worst if ad blocking were illegal you would have companies launching lawsuits against ad blockers and
[562.32 → 567.36] their users so this yeah we're going that is some psychopathic dystopic garbage
[570.40 → 579.04] dang yeah we're going with the legal one straight away yeah so again maybe I mean maybe that's where
[579.04 → 584.56] the miscommunication took place ladies and gentlemen because I never said that it was illegal
[584.56 → 595.52] I said it's piracy not everything that's piracy is necessarily strictly speaking illegal also here's
[595.52 → 602.64] another perfect take no not in 2015 not in 2022, and it's a link from torrent freak uh ad blocking does
[602.64 → 608.96] not constitute copyright infringement never said it was copyright infringement I said it's piracy which is
[608.96 → 613.92] just taking what you please and not paying for it sorry i have to i have to address this merch message
[613.92 → 621.20] sure which I'm gonna share on screen as well but uh Michael c uh got a tech scarf a crew neck sweater
[621.20 → 628.72] two spout lids and an um a flannel um and said in his merch message I'm buying this so I can block ads
[628.72 → 643.28] sourcer says, but you literally compared it to pirating Netflix yes I did on Netflix you have a video
[643.28 → 650.40] right to watch wait do we all follow along here you're with me so far yeah yeah there's a video I got
[650.40 → 656.96] you are okay what's the deal how do you get the video do you pay for a subscription to Netflix okay
[656.96 → 663.68] what if you for whatever reason do not wish to pay, but you still wish to consume the video what is
[663.68 → 669.68] that piracy okay, okay okay hold on stick with me, you would have to actually do the thing
[669.68 → 676.56] okay stick with me here on YouTube what do we have a video okay we got a video yeah okay what's the deal
[676.56 → 682.32] to watch the video you have to watch an ad okay but if you want to watch the video, and you don't want
[682.32 → 690.16] the ad this is uh something else well again there has to be an action but piracy no, no uh they're
[690.16 → 697.04] totally different Luke uh self-liberation because Francesco free sailors I'm going to have to disagree
[697.04 → 702.96] the content itself is freely available the way internet works I could just print the raw stream on
[702.96 → 711.60] paper nice ads are more like if you were so kind please watch this you could print the stream on
[711.60 → 718.08] paper raw I like it do you understand what they mean by this because I actually have no idea uh there's
[718.08 → 722.96] actually a few different interpretations and Francesco actually goes on to completely understand
[722.96 → 727.60] the issue which is really confusing to me taking your example of the Cirque du Soleil ticket that is a
[727.60 → 732.32] transaction to watch the show you have to have a ticket well not if you sneak in that was my point
[733.04 → 740.96] um freely available content as the name suggests is free ads are fundamental to sustain it, but they are
[740.96 → 748.64] not a given it's not a tip you're not you're not like tipping your server by watching an ad that's not
[748.64 → 755.44] that's not how that works it's its actually the deal like that's the deal so um maybe part of the
[755.44 → 761.60] problem is that most people don't have the context of what it takes to run a video hosting platform
[761.60 → 768.00] um of the people in this room a half of them do so why don't you talk about that a little bit is
[768.64 → 773.28] is hosting an I don't know how much it costs oh I actually don't it's expensive is hosting
[774.16 → 783.12] I wanted to ask I wanted to ask I just pirated the um sorry i uh yeah no it's its
[783.12 → 786.96] really expensive it's genuinely really expensive that's one of the reasons why like we figured
[786.96 → 792.96] out that that twitch runs at a loss, and we've known for forever's ease that YouTube runs at a loss
[792.96 → 801.20] there are other gains from those platforms they want all your good juicy data um, and you know watch time
[801.20 → 807.36] and all that fun stuff but uh yeah it's really I love this great this is great Joshua Laura posts
[807.36 → 815.12] it hurt itself in its confusion uh saying online websites and creators are supported by ads I thought
[815.12 → 818.40] that was pretty common knowledge ad blocking is the exact same thing as piracy literally the exact same
[818.40 → 822.00] thing people will still do it and I've been guilty of it at times, but we need to be aware of the impact
[822.64 → 829.28] next to the video where I talked about YouTube advanced this is this one I actually linked because
[829.28 → 834.64] it's followed by a great take from Thadeus judge go no idea how to pronounce that where's the
[834.64 → 840.16] contradiction he said it here he said it in the video people will still do it and I've been guilty
[840.16 → 846.80] of it times, but we just need to be aware of the impact yeah I'm not I'm not saying you know go throw
[846.80 → 854.08] yourself off a bridge you disgraceful shell of a human being I didn't say that, and we've even suggested
[854.08 → 858.32] I don't know if it's been in a mainline video, but it's definitely been in wan i because I know I've done it
[858.32 → 865.28] um, but we've suggested running ad blocker uh just in general on the internet because there's a lot of
[866.00 → 872.24] bad things that ads can do so it's its kind of a safety net nothing I said contradicted anything
[872.24 → 878.32] else I've ever said I said that I have ad blocker I said ad blocking happens I personally do not use it
[878.32 → 883.52] yeah I don't use it because that's not within because of my position I just think it would be
[883.52 → 888.24] pretty hypocritical for me to use it, but that doesn't mean that I haven't posted tutorials on
[888.24 → 896.32] how to install pinhole for example but none of that contradicts I said this is piracy because it
[896.32 → 904.08] costs x you've decided to pay x minus infinity and consume the content anyway so just understand that
[904.64 → 910.00] yeah just get it yeah I run an ad blocker but I also have YouTube premium um well then you're not a
[910.00 → 914.88] pirate because there would be no ad I have no idea what you're talking about well no I'm not saying
[914.88 → 921.52] I am oh I'm not saying I am oh, oh okay that was one of the takes I actually linked oh they're like
[921.52 → 926.40] how dare you I have YouTube premium and I'm like well then what are you talking about what ads would
[926.40 → 932.24] you be I was saying for my setup like i I watch a lot of YouTube I don't want to watch all the ads
[932.24 → 937.84] so I have YouTube premium so that my watch time kicks back to creators that sweet that's like a way
[937.84 → 943.04] better exchange for the creator so that's cool that works um and then when I'm browsing the internet i
[943.04 → 949.04] don't want ads to do bad things to my computer so I run ad box so obvious lobster on float plane says
[949.04 → 954.72] exactly it's not piracy to ignore an ad that is served to me, you're right no you just ignore it
[954.72 → 960.00] you just ignore it nice good job but here's the thing that way the platform still gets paid and the
[960.00 → 966.88] creator still gets paid sure do so you have actually participated in the transaction at that point but
[966.88 → 972.72] we're not talking about ignoring it we're talking about it never actually getting served it's a
[972.72 → 979.84] completely different thing so let's go ahead let's go a little bit further this is the dumbest thing
[979.84 → 984.48] I've read today blocking ads is not the same as piracy nobody wants to watch invasive ads like the
[984.48 → 988.96] ones that pop up in the middle of a video on YouTube, so people just install ad blocks to be able to avoid
[988.96 → 998.72] those invasive ads blocking ads is not piracy I don't want to pay so I won't pay
[1002.48 → 1011.60] I didn't say that you like ads I never said that so the real key here is to not get is to not get
[1011.60 → 1018.88] caught up in I don't know it's its honestly hard to analyze something like this without going a little
[1018.88 → 1026.08] bit sort of pop psychology on it is just feels like there's a lot of projection like if you
[1026.08 → 1032.64] feel guilty about it yeah because you don't like the word piracy, or you don't like the idea that you are
[1033.28 → 1040.40] that you are not paying for something for some good or some service that you are that you are taking
[1041.52 → 1048.16] well then you have your own soul-searching to do right because I never talked about that all I said was
[1049.04 → 1056.16] if you are not upholding your end of the bargain which is that you watch the ad or at the very
[1056.16 → 1061.20] the least watch the first five seconds of the ad before you click skip which does by the way count for the
[1061.20 → 1067.12] creator um if you're not upholding your end of the bargain then it's piracy and if that bothers you
[1067.84 → 1074.32] then you've kind of got your own reflection to do right if it doesn't bother you which lots of people it
[1074.32 → 1081.76] didn't but then fine but why are you arguing with me about it is doesn't change what it is it's still
[1081.76 → 1087.28] just not I think a lot of people paying for it yeah I think a lot of people just don't want to think of
[1087.28 → 1092.00] the activity that they're doing in that way, but they're avoiding compensating someone for their work
[1092.88 → 1098.48] so I don't know so again I find it ironic you say this not only does it not compare but like it does
[1098.48 → 1103.28] compare compares very, very favourite not favourably compares very well three years ago you posted a
[1103.28 → 1107.04] video about how to block all ads with pie hole on a Raspberry Pi it feels like the longer and bigger
[1107.04 → 1112.80] a channel gets the greedier it gets what did anything i actually literally have this take on
[1112.80 → 1118.16] AdBlock by the way I think i I'm pretty sure the first time we talked about it yeah on wan show was in
[1118.16 → 1125.92] the garage oh probably, and we said this same stuff we were a very small channel at that time and honestly
[1125.92 → 1134.24] speaking guys like I posted our income like I actually posted our income breakdown it's not Linus
[1134.24 → 1141.52] tech tips that is going to suffer from this kind of thing you're right you're right it is a way better
[1141.52 → 1149.52] business move to create other revenue streams, and we've got over 60 people here now so we can create
[1150.08 → 1154.48] those revenue streams there has's been a lot of merch messages that have come in with like
[1154.48 → 1158.88] different pirate flags and stuff like that like people are down, and we have said publicly
[1158.88 → 1170.00] before we're cool with that so like yeah whatever um okay so here's one online websites and creators
[1170.00 → 1173.92] are also supported by interactions and views no they aren't
[1176.48 → 1183.60] i i I need to I need to clear this up for you Cory they're not Luke how much do I get paid for a view
[1183.60 → 1193.28] on YouTube zero dollars uh what about in cents zero cents lira nope rubles get owned zero are you sure
[1193.28 → 1199.68] yeah zero of them yep that's correct could someone make an argument
[1200.00 → 1206.40] sure that you get paid for the sponsor spots that you bake into the video i do get paid for
[1206.40 → 1212.56] those however the way that those typically work uh it used to be a lot more wild west five six seven
[1212.56 → 1219.68] eight years ago uh but nowadays basically the way that your rates get negotiated are based on some kind
[1219.68 → 1226.88] of a conversion how many conversions like how many dollars they're paying per conversion so
[1226.88 → 1233.84] ultimately it becomes sort of an uh it becomes sort of a numbers game where the more conversions you get
[1233.84 → 1241.60] the higher the sponsorship rates you might get from exactly the same sponsor so at the end of the day if
[1241.60 → 1248.64] you are also not engaging with any of the sponsors than your contribution to those sponsorship rates
[1248.64 → 1256.00] is effectively zero no sponsor is going to pay you based on just views at least not one that you work
[1256.00 → 1261.92] with on an ongoing basis and the way that we typically engage with our sponsors is as a longer term
[1261.92 → 1267.36] relationship versus just trying to jack up our rates as high as possible and one and done it so
[1267.36 → 1273.52] someone in flow plane chat dark force said with alternating case uh you get paid in exposure
[1273.52 → 1280.40] in exposure yeah exactly this is uh this is college this is college football um obvious lobster says
[1280.40 → 1287.20] redefining piracy in this way is super anti-consumer blocking ads is not piracy i i still don't
[1287.20 → 1295.12] really understand what there is to argue against here if it is its you basically saying I don't like the
[1295.12 → 1303.84] price of this thing I'm going to take it anyway and I'm not going to pay for it there's a specific reason
[1303.84 → 1310.24] that I said piracy rather than stealing because it's it's the whole classic you wouldn't download a car
[1310.24 → 1316.00] it's not stealing you haven't actually relocated the video off of YouTube server and onto yours
[1316.00 → 1321.36] but what it is piracy you've decided you don't like the price so you're just not going to pay it
[1321.36 → 1330.56] and fine i never actually said go rot in hell I don't feel that way about it, he's just defining
[1330.56 → 1338.08] I've talked about Vance I've talked about pinhole I've talked in those videos in during those topics
[1338.08 → 1344.72] about how ultimately those things hurt my business I've been extremely consistent
[1344.72 → 1353.76] on this topic extremely consistent so what exactly do you guys what exactly do you guys expect from me
[1355.60 → 1360.80] uh legit sue says that's not the legal definition of piracy I mean it's its a pirate code it's more
[1360.80 → 1368.40] like guidelines okay um all right i got one more real classic one here, and then we'll, we'll
[1368.40 → 1379.44] leave this alone we're going to move we're going to move on from this um okay actually this one is just
[1380.24 → 1384.88] oh man you know what I'm not even gonna I'm not even going to bother this one goes so far around in
[1384.88 → 1389.84] circles uh that's not the one that I thought I was clicking on it something oh this is
[1389.84 → 1395.44] hilarious uh people have started deleting their tweets I'm clicking on ones I link before the show
[1395.44 → 1408.64] people like it's deleting them rough oh man okay so tell you what we'll call it here um no I don't
[1408.64 → 1413.20] mean it so in summary I don't mean in a legal sense it's piracy it doesn't mean you should be able to get
[1413.20 → 1420.56] sued for it nope it just means that you've decided unilaterally that you don't like the price so you just
[1420.56 → 1427.28] take it and don't pay for it if that's not call it whatever you want to call it whatever you want i
[1427.28 → 1434.88] guess it doesn't it doesn't ultimately matter what word we decide on um should we come up with a new
[1434.88 → 1444.32] word for it, we could try to come up with a new word piracy light um piracy light
[1444.32 → 1456.96] okay I don't think that was going to fly either I like it though okay uh come on guys give me something
[1456.96 → 1466.80] better free booting uh oh my goodness YAR had cheap skating I can't sing this out I'm sorry I'm too bad but
[1466.80 → 1474.32] um cheap skating somebody uh merch messaged YAR had fiddle DD banana for scale and a processor tea
[1477.12 → 1480.96] when sweatpants and a new flannel for me, I am a pirate
[1483.44 → 1489.60] free loading's not bad i actually kind of like free loading um
[1489.60 → 1497.76] oh I wish I'd uh did I ever talk to talk about the one where I talked compared like talked about
[1497.76 → 1504.72] ethical piracy I guess I didn't oh I'm so disappointed I know you mentioned ethical
[1504.72 → 1508.24] piracy but I don't know if you meant I don't know if you talked about like that tweet or something
[1508.24 → 1513.52] yeah I don't I don't remember leeching I like leeching's not bad
[1513.52 → 1520.80] all right, so anyway guys love you all and like I said in my original tweets okay
[1522.48 → 1529.28] blah blah blah hold on where is if it's piracy be aware of the impact sorry it's freeloading
[1529.28 → 1534.96] leeching sure it's not a light piracy light it's whatever let's substitute the word you guys
[1534.96 → 1541.92] don't like the word okay fine um it is definitely not paying in the way that the service
[1541.92 → 1547.84] decides it's supposed to be paid you have decided not to pay, and it's its actually really amusing
[1547.84 → 1551.84] I didn't get to any of them but how many people compared it to like Netflix and steam and how those
[1551.84 → 1557.44] ultimately uh decreased piracy significantly because they offered this and Spotify this all
[1557.44 → 1563.28] you can eat version of paying for content as though they don't know that YouTube premium exists as
[1563.28 → 1570.64] though there 's's no alternative other than using an ad blocker on YouTube um so you've
[1570.64 → 1575.20] decided you neither want to pay for it nor do you want to view an ad, and you're going to take it
[1575.20 → 1584.16] anyway call it whatever you want all I said was that understand we do need to here I'm going to use my
[1584.16 → 1590.56] exact words you need to be aware of the impact okay the payment for the content is ads or premium
[1590.56 → 1599.52] if you don't do that you didn't pay for it, you didn't have that's it you didn't pay for it um
[1602.40 → 1608.48] okay yeah nice and if you're chill with that then you're chill with that I'm chill too let's all be
[1608.48 → 1615.44] chilled together all right we're going to chill i actually kind of have chills today it's cold in here yeah
[1616.16 → 1621.28] you know what there's a solution to that we might have a solution to that it's an extremely Canadian
[1621.28 → 1627.68] solution there's like just about the most Canadian solution ever to that I love it
[1632.00 → 1642.08] Luke are you getting yours yes we just launched the Linus tech tips a full adult shirt we got the world's
[1642.08 → 1649.84] most beautiful front page model for it by the way check this out the one the only Anthony young
[1650.48 → 1658.16] this is a completely custom garment ladies and gentlemen this is not some rebranded nonsense this
[1658.16 → 1666.40] was designed by the creator warehouse team from the ground freaking up the one and only Sarah butt also
[1666.40 → 1674.96] modelling it the one and only titan also modelling it this is one of those products that uh ed actually
[1674.96 → 1678.72] asked me he's like are you going to wear the flannel shirt on the Sancho are you going to wear it
[1678.72 → 1683.92] I don't think I've ever seen you wear flannel in your life like no I've owned a flannel I have never
[1683.92 → 1690.24] I have never owned a flannel I'm not a proper Canadian real I've never owned a flannel but my best
[1690.24 → 1698.72] friend growing up his dad had like flannel jackets like thicker flannels uh and Colin brought an axe
[1700.72 → 1707.52] that's awesome I used to wear his kind of all the time yeah but I never owned one myself uh please
[1707.52 → 1714.32] tell me Alex modelled it he was so involved in the development process for this one how did Alex not
[1714.32 → 1721.92] model it oh I'm disappointed honestly everyone's done a great job though good job everyone i actually
[1721.92 → 1728.96] love how down the team is to model the gear like no one gets like an extra bonus for oh I think
[1728.96 → 1734.56] I think you get to keep it after oh, so okay never mind that's pretty good it's a little bit easier to
[1734.56 → 1740.64] explain pretty good um so it's got the like the gray holdback thing it's got nice pockets on it
[1740.64 → 1745.92] because we're all about those pockets um oh we finally did it people have been asking for this
[1745.92 → 1751.28] for ages um okay this is not a perfect way to do this because if people don't happen to know who
[1751.28 → 1757.04] Anthony Sarah Tynan and Colin are then it won't help them much but Sarah modelled our small Tynan
[1757.04 → 1762.72] modelled the media medium Colin did the large and Anthony did the triple XL so there you go guys we
[1762.72 → 1766.24] we've finally done it we've added the names of the models on the product page
[1766.24 → 1776.32] all right, so guys go check it out 59.99 it's on the site, and we're probably going to have a handful
[1776.32 → 1782.48] of merch messages let's talk about the NVIDIA and arm wedding looks like it could be called off
[1782.48 → 1787.52] Bloomberg has reported that NVIDIA was letting business partners and associates know that they
[1787.52 → 1794.08] don't expect the deal with arm to close in December the FTC filed a lawsuit to block the deal alleging that
[1794.08 → 1802.64] the proposed deal would distort arms incentives to uh in chip markets since the appointment of
[1802.64 → 1808.08] Lena khan as chair the regulator is starting to scrutinize more deals the UK's competition market
[1808.08 → 1813.12] authority and the EU are also scrutinizing the merger I mean this is one of those things where
[1813.12 → 1822.32] pretty much everyone and their dog was calling on this going like uh yeah uh plus no yeah yeah and
[1822.32 → 1827.92] NVIDIA even came out and said look we're not gonna we're not gonna um you know it's not going to be
[1827.92 → 1834.40] bad it's going to be good don't worry it's going to be excellent but NVIDIA has a long and proud history of
[1834.40 → 1838.96] being extraordinarily difficult to work with when's the last time you saw an NVIDIA chip in an apple
[1838.96 → 1847.20] laptop for example yeah, yeah now I'm not going to say I'm not going to say that NVIDIA owned all the blame for
[1847.20 → 1854.40] that but I will say that I think apple's upset is at least somewhat justified yeah has apple necessarily
[1854.40 → 1859.68] been the easiest to work with either no, no no those two companies were probably just that
[1859.68 → 1868.32] was not going to survive destined to never work with each other um SoftBank which currently owns arm
[1868.32 → 1875.44] plans to instead list the company on the stock market in an IPO 70 of the 40 billion dollar deal was
[1875.44 → 1879.84] going to be paid in NVIDIA shares those have gone up 90 percent since the original announcement in
[1879.84 → 1886.16] september 2020. Meaning at this point the deal would actually cost NVIDIA about 25 billion dollars
[1886.16 → 1892.96] more um if it doesn't go through though NVIDIA will lose their 1.25 billion dollar down payment
[1893.84 → 1902.40] wow discussion topic here what are the odds the FTC wins the trial in August to block the deal um honestly
[1902.40 → 1909.60] I feel pretty high I feel like it would be pretty easy to demonstrate that NVIDIA owning arm would put
[1909.60 → 1917.44] them in a position to unfairly influence their direct competitors pretty much across the entire industry
[1918.40 → 1924.24] um what are some dystopian fanfics about the future of the chip market if this deal were to go through
[1924.24 → 1932.24] honestly okay here 's's a legitimately hot take one that is in my opinion um you know not as
[1932.24 → 1937.52] open and shut as the previous one we talked about uh I actually don't think it would be that big of a
[1937.52 → 1944.32] deal I think it would be a big deal I don't think it would be a necessarily dystopian fanfic in the in
[1944.32 → 1950.40] the short term to midterm I think it would in the short term I think it wouldn't matter because most of
[1950.40 → 1956.40] the licensees of arms technology have pretty bulletproof deals like I think apple has a literal
[1956.40 → 1962.80] perpetual license so that would only really start to affect apple who has kind of in a way kind of
[1962.80 → 1970.88] forked the technology in a big way uh so that would only really affect them uh in maybe the medium to
[1970.88 → 1979.28] very long term as NVIDIA changes arms development and arms r d to uh to benefit themselves and not
[1979.28 → 1985.84] really giving two hoots about anyone else yeah um I mean yeah anyone with just a complete license like
[1985.84 → 1990.80] IP license like apple I guess it just probably wouldn't for long term is your argument based on
[1990.80 → 1995.68] risk yeah yeah I thought so yeah yeah so in the short term I don't think it would matter because pretty
[1995.68 → 2001.04] much everyone who's using arm is going to have a pretty long license term for whatever it is that they
[2001.04 → 2006.16] need in the medium term NVIDIA could steer arms development in a way that benefits their own
[2006.16 → 2013.28] super computing ambitions and nobody else's and in the long term i really think that arm has
[2013.28 → 2020.24] kind of peaked in a way and honestly that was why I thought SoftBank was trying to get rid of it yeah
[2020.24 → 2032.32] I mean opening it up to uh an IPO is similar yeah the IPO one i um I just have a hard time I just have a
[2032.32 → 2038.80] hard time figuring out how arm is going to continue to grow and deliver shareholder value I don't think
[2038.80 → 2048.72] I would buy that IPO in modern era okay everything's just sort of based on feelings um as far as I can
[2048.72 → 2054.48] tell all those markets are just like whimsical things what was the the what is this good
[2055.04 → 2060.72] what's the big short guy's name Michael bury or whatever yeah didn't he have some quote about like
[2061.28 → 2066.48] how markets over the last like three or four years aren't based on anything, and he's like concerned
[2066.48 → 2074.56] about it moving forward it's interesting things are crazy um but yeah I don't know i think
[2074.56 → 2079.44] NVIDIA is going to lose, but we'll see what actually happens they do have a lot of money to throw behind it
[2080.24 → 2088.96] I think it I think it would have been overall bad for the industry for NVIDIA to own arm is such a
[2088.96 → 2099.20] critical there's such a critical player especially for low-cost devices and NVIDIA is um not I guess
[2100.64 → 2105.68] there's a there's a comment on flow plane that says look into ampere computing arm servers wiping AMD's
[2105.68 → 2111.28] epic and intel Leon's yeah and the super computing space arm has been really strong uh we're not saying
[2111.28 → 2118.08] arm isn't super strong um we were saying that that compared to the intensity of the statement of
[2118.08 → 2123.68] dystopian fanfic of the future of chip market I don't think it just ends the entire game um
[2129.04 → 2132.88] but it wouldn't be a good thing as we said I cannot keep up with the merch messages they're
[2132.88 → 2138.48] actually coming too fast today Jayden says also in general market consolidation equals bad yeah which
[2138.48 → 2144.72] is a big part of the reason why on the last show we were saying that the core bad component of
[2144.72 → 2150.88] Microsoft buying uh blizzard was that it was a huge amount of marketing consolidation into a
[2150.88 → 2156.48] group that already had a large amount of studios under it and once the market has been consolidated it
[2156.48 → 2164.16] doesn't spread back out yeah it won't, it can't yeah how is anyone else supposed to compete with game pass
[2164.16 → 2170.08] the best budgets being thrown at game development by Microsoft especially when the marketing and
[2170.08 → 2176.00] the style of modern games is very, very much about like dopamine overload and flashy things and micro
[2176.00 → 2183.44] transactions and instead of like good story good gameplay um that makes it a lot harder for small
[2183.44 → 2189.20] groups to get into it yep absolutely and never mind small groups I'm having a hard time figuring out
[2189.20 → 2195.60] out figuring how Sony is going to compete yeah you know that tiny that small group son yum
[2196.80 → 2201.52] like Nintendo I feel like I feel like they'll just sort of always have their little space in the
[2201.52 → 2207.04] corner yeah described, and sometimes it's a real big corner I mean this switch coming up on
[2207.04 → 2212.00] the biggest selling console ever like I think it's number two right now behind the DS or something like
[2212.00 → 2218.56] that huge i I don't remember the numbers I'm sorry, but it passed uh it passed whatever was number
[2218.56 → 2225.20] three a little while ago if I recall correctly just absolutely crazy I'm going to look it up really
[2225.20 → 2227.52] quick I mean I'm responsible for two of them at this point
[2230.32 → 2234.24] you know what I shouldn't have I I gave away my original switch at the Christmas party
[2234.24 → 2244.80] and I realized I'm an idiot it was an OG one it was movable yeah oh that's a yikes that's okay I've
[2244.80 → 2249.44] got the OLED now and realistically I pay for all my switch games anyway so it's one of those things
[2249.44 → 2255.12] where like oh man I hate to oh I hate to come back to like the piracy conversation again um it's one
[2255.12 → 2260.32] of those things where you know from my point of view I'm at a stage in my life where it's its kind of
[2260.32 → 2267.20] not worth the hassle if that makes sense like even if I had some kind of strong moral objection
[2267.20 → 2273.28] like what here you know what wow okay this is a hot take I'm going to give you guys an example of
[2273.28 → 2277.44] something that I would consider to be ethical piracy all right there's a rumour that Nintendo's
[2277.44 → 2285.84] working on a new Mario party that will come out for the switch okay, okay when that came out if i
[2285.84 → 2293.68] discovered that Nintendo had fixed the cutscene skip issue in the new one when they've continued to
[2293.68 → 2301.12] refuse to patch it in the old one I would just pirate the new one oh right okay because to me, it makes the
[2301.12 → 2306.72] game, but he's saying pirate utterly unplayable yeah utterly unplayable Mario party whatever the
[2306.72 → 2312.24] one on switch is to play the actual board game have you tried it they make you sit through the
[2312.24 → 2318.00] instructions every single time I think I tried it once and I remember it being super tedious and i
[2318.00 → 2323.76] think that was the reason why I didn't try it again super tedious yeah and every time you play
[2323.76 → 2330.24] you have to hear all the instructions all the general game instructions, and it even asks you it asks you
[2330.24 → 2338.32] at the beginning have you played before, and you say yes, and it tells you how to play usually the
[2338.32 → 2343.20] games are incredibly simple too like you don't even necessarily need instructions ever and I'm not even
[2343.20 → 2349.04] talking about the mini-games I'm talking about it tells you all the rules of the board game oh no okay
[2349.04 → 2356.32] so what should be a 25-minute game full of mini-games takes an hour it literally doubles how long it
[2356.32 → 2363.20] takes to play the game it's really frustrating and so basically what I'm saying is if Nintendo
[2363.20 → 2369.36] knowing about this issue which is simple to patch skippable cut scenes skippable cut scenes are basic
[2369.36 → 2376.80] and if they patched it in the new version I would consider that to be ethically ethical piracy sorry I paid
[2376.80 → 2382.80] you guys for a game I paid the full price it's basically unplayable I haven't I haven't touched it
[2382.80 → 2389.68] since the first like two weeks because that issue just makes it, it makes it a complete waste of time
[2389.68 → 2394.48] for me yeah and all they have to do is make the cut scene skippable if I could press a button and skip
[2394.48 → 2403.68] it no problem um and so it's just that kind of it's that kind of just completely man it's not even it's not
[2403.68 → 2413.92] even it's not even apathy it's like actual malice towards your users like why are you doing there's a lot
[2413.92 → 2419.92] it's weird because Nintendo is seen as the like friendly you know friendly happy company and then
[2419.92 → 2425.36] yeah they have a lot of things that are like just so intensely anti-consumer it's very interesting I'm
[2425.36 → 2430.56] a fan of Nintendo products i basically auto buy any console that they release I'll pretty much auto buy
[2430.56 → 2435.60] any like Mario platformer they have a release but like yeah there's some there's some really brutal
[2435.60 → 2440.24] things uh whiskey nerd 88 says so what Linus is saying is I should pirate borderlands for pc since
[2440.24 → 2445.52] Xbox will not let me play it on their pc launcher um I'm not saying you should, I have actually talked
[2445.52 → 2450.64] about that before I've talked about that specific use case where you have purchased a license for a
[2450.64 → 2459.20] particular piece of content and for whatever reason whether it's a region lock which personally I find pretty
[2459.20 → 2466.80] ridiculous and anti-consumer um whether it's a region lock or whether it's a platform lock um not a big
[2466.80 → 2474.56] fan now there are cases where I think that you get into very, very shaky ethical ground for that like for
[2474.56 → 2483.04] example if we finally got a pc port of say a game that will never come to pc like god of war okay we
[2483.04 → 2492.16] finally got a pc port for it and you kind of go you know oh well I'm mad about something so I'm not
[2492.16 → 2496.40] going to give them any money for this I can tell you right now that we're probably not going to get
[2496.40 → 2502.00] another pc port I loved that they did it immediately bought one because like I was stoked about it so
[2502.00 → 2508.96] basically you have to kind of consider them the message that you are the message that you are sending
[2508.96 → 2513.92] um so in the case of the borderlands one you know honestly yeah I find it pretty I find it pretty
[2513.92 → 2521.52] offensive that I can buy a copy of a game that runs on my Xbox and doesn't run on my pc um I'm calling
[2521.52 → 2527.28] on you to make your own decision all I said all I said in my tweet is you got to be aware of the impact
[2528.24 → 2534.08] and that's what I'm saying right now you've got to consider the impact if we don't support your indie
[2534.08 → 2540.40] developers or we don't support the change that we want to see in the world like getting pc ports of
[2540.40 → 2545.84] formerly exclusive titles then you are definitely part of the problem and part of the reason that
[2545.84 → 2552.72] will keep going now if you decide oh you know what the port was bad then the answer is don't play it
[2552.72 → 2559.84] right or request a refund yeah so those are those are sort of the those are all the
[2559.84 → 2566.56] decisions that you've got away for yourself that's all I said be aware uh mechanical eve oh man I guess
[2566.56 → 2572.96] what we're talking about this more thoughts on abandonware isn't that like I think that's seen
[2572.96 → 2577.84] this is where we're running into that problem where like there's an actual thing that is abandoned
[2577.84 → 2586.48] where right and once something becomes technical abandonware then no it is legally not piracy anymore
[2586.48 → 2592.72] I believe once it is technically abandoned where but do they mean technical abandonware or do they
[2592.72 → 2600.88] mean like it's been abandoned, but it's not technically abandoned where yet yeah I am not sure like
[2600.88 → 2607.04] something like golden I double 07 you know where it's in its in rights holder hell yeah um should you
[2607.04 → 2611.28] just pirate that game because you will never be able to buy it on virtual console the only way you're
[2611.28 → 2616.40] actually going to go buy it is buying it from a secondhand situation anyway yeah where there is's
[2616.40 → 2621.84] not literally no money the creator is not getting money from that anyway yeah um that's a tough
[2621.84 → 2630.80] one guys that's tough one um personally i would without any guilt just play that game or use
[2630.80 → 2635.60] that software if there's no legal way to acquire it but you have to make your own choices it's hard to
[2635.60 → 2640.72] give like suggestions for this type of stuff you just have to understand the impact that you're
[2640.72 → 2644.88] having yeah and make the decision for yourself yeah micro seven says Linus you didn't say beware of
[2644.88 → 2648.48] the impact you defined ad blocking as piracy regardless of what the website's terms are but
[2648.48 → 2653.44] the website's terms don't enter into it, I said consider the impact of not paying for
[2653.44 → 2657.52] something is that you pirated it that's the impact you just have to decide whether you're comfortable
[2657.52 → 2667.12] with that I eat cool um mechanical EV says yeah I mean old vintage games you literally can't buy on any
[2667.12 → 2674.00] platform yeah so that's uh that's that's that's one of those that's one of those topics that could be
[2674.00 → 2681.28] an entire show honestly because there's so many weird edge cases right like what if it's okay what
[2681.28 → 2686.56] if it's uh Final Fantasy tactics right the PlayStation one version what if I don't want to play the
[2686.56 → 2692.08] remastered version what if I don't want a bunch of the names of the items and stuff to have changed i
[2692.08 → 2695.68] want to have exactly the same experience that I had when I was a kid and I will accept nothing else
[2695.68 → 2699.44] I don't want to buy the mobile version because I don't want to play on mobile controls or whatever
[2699.44 → 2703.52] the case may be I mean that's where you get into like I don't know whatever you want to tell yourself
[2703.52 → 2708.24] man, so there's weird ways that you can justify that and again sure these aren't suggestions but
[2708.24 → 2714.24] something that you could do is buy the remastered version don't even like to install it and then just
[2714.24 → 2720.00] pirate the OG version and play it that way if you think that's a justification, and you're okay with
[2720.00 → 2725.12] that, and you're okay with the variety of things that come with that then great if not then don't
[2725.12 → 2730.64] do it you just need to understand uh like you said understand the impact and then do what you're gonna
[2730.64 → 2735.92] do yep make a decision for yourself uh and the decision I'm going to make for myself is to tell you

[2869.76 → 2880.40] vulture when we're going to have that linked down below all right what shall we talk about next intel feeling
[2880.40 → 2892.08] fine after dodging a 1.06 billion euro fine that's pretty cool they won their appeal against the uh 1.06 billion
[2892.08 → 2899.28] euro EU antitrust fine from 2009 now this is an interesting one because this has been sitting in the
[2899.28 → 2905.84] court system for over a decade the original case found that intel was guilty of blocking AMD from the
[2905.84 → 2913.52] market by providing rebates to dell hp and Lenovo if they sourced 95 of their chips through intel well
[2913.52 → 2920.08] that sounds like a pretty open shut antitrust violation but let's go on shall we intel was also
[2920.08 → 2927.68] found to have paid a manufacturer to delay shipment of AMD desktops to enterprise customers
[2927.68 → 2942.08] well that seems perfectly legit one OEM apparently turned down an offer of one million free CPUs from AMD
[2942.96 → 2951.12] so that it could continue receiving rebates from intel now okay both of those behaviours seem kind of
[2951.12 → 2960.00] problematic yeah yeah what the heck I'm going to be honest here we have often said neither side of
[2960.00 → 2966.24] the table has clean hands but like wow that's uh I wonder what manufacturer that was because
[2967.12 → 2973.68] both sides really want their business it's probably like dell or something hp um the EU's second highest
[2973.68 → 2980.00] court overturned the 12-year-old ruling that fined intel for four percent of their 37.6 billion in sales
[2980.00 → 2987.68] in 2008 finding that the original analysis was got this incomplete and does not make it possible to
[2987.68 → 2992.72] establish the requisite legal standard that the rebates have anti-competitive effects
[2994.88 → 3001.52] you know what i want the highest court in the land to be the court of common sense oh
[3003.04 → 3008.64] that's what I want the court of common sense would be able to get through these cases like real fast
[3008.64 → 3017.52] be like oh okay hold on a second you are actually offering rebates to your customers to incentivize
[3017.52 → 3025.20] them to not buy a competing product I don't actually I don't actually need your requisite legal standard
[3026.40 → 3033.52] that that that proves that establishes the anti-competitive effects because that's just basic
[3033.52 → 3039.44] it's quite literally anti-competitive, and it's also just like i
[3041.44 → 3041.76] oh
[3045.92 → 3050.08] so someone sorry this is for a previous topic, but there was a merch message that just came in that said
[3050.08 → 3057.44] the alternative phrase for piracy you're looking for should be privateering because of the
[3057.44 → 3064.96] ad blocking because the privacy privateering it fits okay in both in terms both of same thing
[3064.96 → 3072.72] maybe less severe context and potentially your view of it as well uh like the yeah sure um as well as the
[3074.48 → 3081.36] potentially your view of it is as well like the English crown not great but potentially just fine interesting
[3081.36 → 3090.40] okay I like it privateering privateer okay it's amazing how many people are still arguing
[3090.40 → 3096.96] about it and still mad oh flow plane chat's just on fire yeah I love it yeah I love it oh it's great
[3097.84 → 3102.48] um all right what else we got yeah the battle's been ongoing for years and included a rejection of
[3102.48 → 3109.04] intel's initial appeal by the very same court back in 2014. During this initial appeal intel claimed that the
[3109.04 → 3115.44] fine violated its human rights why do corporations have human rights the appeal was not successful
[3116.00 → 3122.00] because apparently that was the court of common sense back then uh these kinds of rebates are
[3122.00 → 3126.32] generally concerning for regulators especially when they are issued by a dominant competitor uh yeah
[3126.32 → 3132.32] concerning I think is a mild word this could be a good sign for alphabet who recently lost their appeal
[3132.32 → 3137.36] of a 2.4 billion euro fine for unlawfully combining google shopping with Google search
[3139.04 → 3142.56] okay which actually
[3144.64 → 3152.40] kind of i I don't know that might be a good thing but i I liked that when that existed because
[3153.36 → 3159.68] now I find that a lot of people default to Amazon because it's too hard to find what you want to buy
[3159.68 → 3165.28] elsewhere and I try to avoid Amazon as much as I possibly can but sometimes at this point you don't
[3165.28 → 3169.60] really have a choice if there's a specific product that you do want or need or whatever because it
[3169.60 → 3174.56] might just not be available anywhere other than Amazon which is a problem that we're running into now
[3175.12 → 3181.20] um, but sometimes it's hard to find because the front page of Google or whatever will just be
[3181.20 → 3186.72] Shrek I mean these days sometimes there's like five or six uh ad links before you get to any of the
[3186.72 → 3192.96] actual real ones which can be really frustrating but I've uh I've heard this sentiment elsewhere and
[3192.96 → 3196.72] I've been thinking about switching to it um, but some people have been saying that they've started
[3196.72 → 3202.00] using duck go not because they're trying to get away from like activity tracking or anything like
[3202.00 → 3209.84] that but because the results uh are actually getting perfect right and part of that being because of
[3209.84 → 3216.64] the amount of like sponsored or purchased ad spots at the top of Google searches and like how
[3216.64 → 3221.44] many there will be sometimes like I just mentioned five or six okay well now you have to scroll through
[3221.44 → 3225.36] to find what you're looking for now it's like below the fold yeah and a decent search because it'll
[3225.36 → 3230.32] be all these ad spots, and then it'll be like picture links or whatever like it's often very buried
[3230.32 → 3233.92] so they're like yeah I go to duck.go because it's often the first link because a lot of things that
[3233.92 → 3238.88] I'm looking for it's its easy to find I don't remember the URL and the like you know the slashes
[3238.88 → 3243.92] afterwards to find it so I'm going to google it but for those types of things or duck.go it but
[3243.92 → 3248.72] for those types of things duck.go is becoming literally more efficient not just not tracking
[3248.72 → 3252.88] you and the other benefits that it has but literally more efficient which is fascinating
[3253.44 → 3260.24] i that's uh I hope it's duck.go's day because that would be really cool uh I love uh this is a
[3260.24 → 3266.40] really great question knock 23 over on float plane says if I play is I pay for float plane can I block ads
[3266.40 → 3270.88] on YouTube I'm paying you directly for the content and can already access it without ads okay so here's
[3270.88 → 3276.88] the challenge again this comes down to your own personal ethics because as we've discussed before
[3276.88 → 3285.36] ad blocking is not illegal strictly speaking right so it's up to you but the thing to consider is that
[3286.16 → 3294.72] google is paying for that bandwidth they are paying for that video hosting now you might say well Susan's
[3294.72 → 3301.20] going to get her paycheck either way which is I think one of the responses on float plane to you and so
[3301.20 → 3307.68] yeah if is you sleep perfectly fine at night knowing that google has literally billions upon billions and
[3307.68 → 3312.88] billions of dollars in the bank, and you feel like they're probably not going to miss it then that's
[3312.88 → 3317.12] your own personal decision he's not telling you what to do at no point in time has he told you what to
[3317.12 → 3326.00] do I actually didn't I didn't yeah I think that's a big part that's being missed as well um there's
[3326.00 → 3330.72] no skin off my back that's for sure there's a merch message from Joshua h who says if i AdBlock
[3330.72 → 3336.16] creators who aren't eligible for AdSense is it piracy in the exact same thing that Linus just said
[3337.92 → 3343.04] YouTube is still paying YouTube is still paying for the servers YouTube is still delivering you that video
[3343.04 → 3351.60] those data centres ain't free big money huge money I mean YouTube was run at a loss for so long
[3352.32 → 3361.36] like so long and yeah they're I think they're squeezing us a little now honestly I mean I pay for
[3361.36 → 3368.08] YouTube premium because I can't stand ads on a lot of ads there are a lot of double unskippable ads that
[3368.08 → 3373.28] breaks me I've seen a triple I didn't even know that's possible yeah it might have been one
[3373.28 → 3378.88] skippable and two unskippable or something but I was just like i was not because i I have like
[3378.88 → 3383.20] 18 google accounts right because one for every yeah so you're sometimes logged into the wrong one
[3383.20 → 3388.96] it plays ads so yeah, and so I'm like ah triggered and I need to I need to switch over to the thing um
[3390.88 → 3397.20] listen to these fools literally pandering for Google are you kidding me no, no we're not telling you what
[3397.20 → 3402.96] to do we're just we're just telling you that things cost money in the actual real world things cost
[3402.96 → 3409.36] money oh man and knock 23 says thanks for saying my name properly I pirate everything but I want to
[3409.36 → 3413.52] make daddy Linus happy you actually do not pirate everything you pay for float plane you're on float
[3413.52 → 3421.52] plane you do not pirate that so that is one thing you didn't pirate or privateer ah yes I love that
[3421.52 → 3429.44] we are switching to privateer from now on I like I'm I'm super I'm super happy um I privateered some
[3429.44 → 3434.64] games that I emulate there's so many good ethical conversations that have come up from this Tim SP on
[3434.64 → 3438.96] float plane says they ran at a loss for so long because they wanted to kill the competition what if
[3438.96 → 3442.80] I don't want to reward google for killing all the competition then don't do it then that's not telling
[3442.80 → 3461.52] you what to do yeah stop come on do your thing oh man figure it out bud oh man yeah you guys
[3461.52 → 3468.32] are you guys are you guys are great you know I really do think that our audience is such a cut above
[3468.32 → 3474.48] the typical YouTube audience like you go into our comments section versus some I'm not gonna I'm not
[3474.48 → 3481.68] going to single out some other vertical but I could there's some really toxic comment sections on YouTube
[3481.68 → 3488.96] and not just toxic like man oh I'm full of hot takes today like really stupid like there's just like
[3488.96 → 3496.16] just low IQ comment sections and i just I thank my lucky stars every day because a big part of my job
[3496.16 → 3503.52] is reading comments, and it is so infrequent that I have to wade into a comment section
[3503.52 → 3515.44] on one of our videos that I'm just like ah no I think probably the last time it happened to that degree
[3515.44 → 3523.12] was when we did the video on whether uh whether water cooling your CPU cools down the room your pc is in
[3523.12 → 3531.36] oh no yeah so I know this is confirmation bias talking shut up
[3535.04 → 3542.88] I know this is I know that this is confirmation bias speaking but it felt like okay
[3542.88 → 3553.04] it felt like every single freaking comment was one of two things it was either this video doesn't need
[3553.04 → 3581.04] to exist because obviously if your CPU is running 20 degrees cooler the room is cooler or this video doesn't need to exist because obviously the thermal energy that is being output is identical therefore the room is an identical temperature, and it was like 50 50 and I'm sitting here going if freaking either of you had read the other comment you would know this video needs to exist
[3581.04 → 3583.04] needs to exist
[3586.72 → 3599.04] oh my goodness I remember that oh man i just about died i it was one of the moments that i actually just went I don't know if this career is worth it
[3599.04 → 3610.88] oh man uh merch message from anonymous uh, uh devil's advocate I think you're just advocating for your own position, but that's okay
[3610.88 → 3618.72] um how does LTT feel about the fact that I pay for speaking that it's literally i the devil's advocate anyway
[3618.72 → 3623.52] I am the devil I am my own advocate how does it hear me mortals and tremble
[3625.68 → 3631.20] how does Lt feel about the fact that I pay for premium to avoid ads again we're not talking about
[3631.20 → 3637.68] what we feel like anyway um that we pay I pay for premium to avoid ads but every Lt video and everyone
[3637.68 → 3646.16] else skirts that and serves me a 30 plus second ad read we are both in the wrong okay statement at the end
[3646.16 → 3655.28] yeah so YouTube premium does not entitle you to not viewing embedded sponsor callouts in the content
[3655.28 → 3663.84] also one of the things that again comes down to just personal ethics is that we intentionally make our
[3663.84 → 3672.08] sponsor reads on LTT highly skippable so to speak so the reason that we do our first sponsor read
[3672.08 → 3677.12] right before the animated intro which is about eight seconds long you can scrub it so that it is
[3677.12 → 3684.72] basically impossible to accidentally right arrow and miss any content because you should land somewhere in
[3684.72 → 3691.68] the intro unless you manage to really bung it up right and then the reason that we do the second one
[3691.68 → 3700.96] right at the very end is so that it's at the end, and it's over the video that like sometimes we'll do
[3700.96 → 3706.00] fun little Easter eggs and stuff at the end, or we'll, we'll throw on another little thing or whatever the case may be
[3706.00 → 3710.32] I mean obviously we want you guys to hear the message from our sponsor so that they like will pay us
[3711.12 → 3719.04] so there's stuff like that, but we actually do go out of our way to make those reads as palatable as possible
[3719.04 → 3724.56] we try to have fun with them, we try to add the segues we try to we try to make it a non-intrusive
[3724.56 → 3730.96] aspect of the content and that was a very intentional decision because I don't like having ads and
[3730.96 → 3738.88] sponsorships shoved down my face um that's also the reason that we don't run YouTube mid-roll unskippable
[3738.88 → 3744.64] ads we simply do not run them it used to drive me absolutely crazy this was another like bash my head
[3744.64 → 3749.28] through the wall kind of thing when people would accuse us of making a video 10 minutes and one
[3749.28 → 3755.44] second long so that we could get more money when there was no mid-roll ad on it that was so epic
[3755.44 → 3762.72] that happened so much it was so painful it just it hurt my brain every single time I read it
[3762.72 → 3767.76] it's like you know we don't get paid for uploading a 10 minute and one-second video right we don't get
[3767.76 → 3772.80] paid extra I'd see that on other channels to that that was definitely a YouTube-wide thing because
[3772.80 → 3777.92] enough people just talked about making more money from 10-minute videos that enough people just
[3777.92 → 3782.08] didn't understand like a lot of the audience was just like okay they make more money I don't need
[3782.08 → 3786.88] to know any more than this yeah it's like no it's its the ability to put a mid-roll in that's what's
[3786.88 → 3795.76] going on yeah so if we didn't do it then hey there you go so, so yeah from your point of view maybe
[3795.76 → 3800.56] you don't like it from my point of view I feel like we've met in the middle we've we've tried to
[3800.56 → 3807.68] compromise we've tried to make it as reasonable as possible um but as you can see 35 of our
[3807.68 → 3812.48] income is from those spots so they ain't going away anytime soon because if we just stopped doing
[3812.48 → 3817.76] them outright then um that would be that would be a rough yeah that'd be pretty that'd be
[3817.76 → 3824.00] pretty rough uh all right what do we I mean honestly I don't know I don't know how
[3824.00 → 3830.88] much conversation there is to have about the intel uh fine getting I don't think there's a ton
[3830.88 → 3836.48] I think it's I think it's kind of ridiculous it's just it's just it's a lot of money uh okay so here's
[3836.48 → 3842.48] a discussion question from um one of our new writers who's not off probation yet do you feel like this
[3842.48 → 3847.12] sets a dangerous precedent for other dominant companies oh yeah um now that AMD has clawed
[3847.12 → 3851.12] background in the CPU market could we start seeing the same behaviour from them no I don't think so AMD's
[3851.12 → 3858.40] still not in a dominant position in anything they are absolutely still an underdog in every
[3858.40 → 3863.52] market they participate they have a really strong foothold now they do which they didn't before
[3863.52 → 3869.84] correct yeah uh but even in the data centre space where AMD from a competitive standpoint is
[3869.84 → 3877.76] is slaying I'm just not convinced they can make enough chips to to to be in a dominant position right
[3877.76 → 3883.20] like intel has their own fabs and then this is an interesting one do you think the EU backed
[3883.20 → 3891.04] off on intel because of the announced big honking fab hmm gee that's actually that's a pretty smart
[3891.04 → 3895.84] take so I don't know I don't know if you read that somewhere else or if that's your idea but if it's
[3895.84 → 3904.16] your idea it's a pretty uh that's pretty that seems pretty um NFTs might come to YouTube
[3904.16 → 3912.40] dislike button yeah I don't get it dislike button still dead I don't understand i uh CEO Susan
[3912.40 → 3918.56] wiki oh hold on I got one I got a good one hold on 603 on float plane says I don't
[3918.56 → 3924.32] understand how do YouTube's competitors make money that's how YouTube should do it YouTube's competitors
[3924.32 → 3928.40] don't make money okay carry on YouTube's competitors don't exist
[3928.40 → 3932.00] okay what's YouTube's competitor
[3934.88 → 3940.72] nice Facebook all right Facebook yeah Facebook makes money Facebook does make money, and they do
[3940.72 → 3945.84] it is the same way yeah collecting all your data and selling it nice okay go ahead speaking of more
[3945.84 → 3951.44] things that I don't understand NFTs might come to YouTube what is this me I still don't get it
[3951.44 → 3958.56] uh CEO Susan Wojcicki I think that's how you pronounce it okay uh stated on January 25th you
[3958.56 → 3965.36] put the thing right that they're I'm sorry I'm reading along with you there's an update on our key
[3965.36 → 3971.28] priorities the state of the creator economy innovation supporting the work of creators and protecting the
[3971.28 → 3976.56] YouTube community um so all of that sounds great she lists a bunch of great stuff like growth jobs
[3976.56 → 3985.44] economy and then says NFTs and days they have uh highlighted a previously unimaginable opportunity
[3985.44 → 3991.04] to grow the connection between creators and their fans have they they don't specify how they
[3991.04 → 4000.72] will use NFTs or uh now it says does but uh, but they like them cool I literally have no clue what this
[4000.72 → 4007.84] means maybe that has something to do with like creator avatars or banners are they just doing
[4007.84 → 4012.96] pictures do they have some other implementation for it because NFTs which a lot of people don't
[4012.96 → 4020.24] understand it's not just some pictures like you can NFT more things than just links to pictures
[4020.24 → 4027.36] so could I like sell my video, but also there's no legal transfer of copyright ownership so
[4027.36 → 4034.80] I like I don't get it I have no idea i I literally have no clue how this makes any sense um
[4037.20 → 4044.24] I don't know um you can right-click save a picture, and you can also uh save YouTube videos
[4044.24 → 4049.60] you sure can the same thing will happen if that's what happens I literally have no clue what this even
[4049.60 → 4056.88] means but NFTs might come to YouTube whatever that means it's just I read this and was just like what
[4057.36 → 4066.32] what's going on um so I think I feel like we should talk a little bit about the take last week
[4066.32 → 4073.36] on NFTs because that was my other really excellent um hot take that I didn't think was that
[4073.36 → 4078.00] hot of a take okay yeah so who was even against you was it both sides so here's why people were mostly
[4078.00 → 4083.28] mad okay I think they were mad because I wasn't highlighting the environmental impact of NFTs and i
[4083.28 → 4088.32] gotta confess that there was some ignorance there on my part did we not okay I didn't realize how
[4088.32 → 4095.28] bad it was it's bad it's real bad so I didn't realize how bad it doesn't have to be bad no it
[4095.28 → 4100.56] could be not bad in fact there are ways to mint NFTs today that are not that bad okay, but you mint an
[4100.56 → 4108.64] NFT on the Ethereum blockchain it's like oh real bad mega bad okay so that's my bad i I actually didn't
[4108.64 → 4114.40] realize that we're talking like a cross-continental flight worth of carbon emissions
[4114.40 → 4122.16] or something like that for to mint a NFT so, so okay fair enough but most is that seriously is that
[4122.16 → 4127.28] for like one person's portion of it or are you saying the whole thing apparently to mint if it's
[4127.28 → 4132.56] like way up there but don't take that as fact so I just know it's a lot I don't know what you
[4132.56 → 4138.64] it's somewhere in between what I thought it was which was like non-inconsequential but like not
[4138.64 → 4146.56] huge yeah and huge yeah somewhere in there it's huge um the point and and and the other thing
[4146.56 → 4153.04] is that so the other thing people were mad about was just the sort of the um uh like just I don't
[4153.04 → 4160.40] know what would it be ass in an entity like this is just they're just they're just kind of stupid right
[4160.40 → 4167.28] yeah they don't transfer any kind of rights to you or any kind of actual legal ownership they're
[4167.28 → 4176.56] just um it's its kind of the equivalent of you know having a man I don't even I don't even know
[4176.56 → 4184.08] there's almost nothing equally dumb um and so a lot of people were upset that I wasn't upset at how
[4184.08 → 4188.88] dumb it is but I guess the thing it's a certificate of authentication, but it's a certificate of
[4188.88 → 4193.76] authentication that could have come from anyone and is utterly meaningless yes because it could
[4193.76 → 4202.64] have come from anyone but here's the thing all I was saying last week all I was saying last week was
[4202.64 → 4208.80] that it doesn't surprise me that was my point, and maybe I didn't do a good job of getting that across
[4208.80 → 4218.00] but my point was just clearly this ship has sailed clearly we were headed here because what is the
[4218.00 → 4226.80] difference between some skin on your gun or some hat that your character wears people and this I don't
[4226.80 → 4231.44] see the difference for some reason really like having things and knowing that other people don't have it
[4232.48 → 4239.20] um well yeah that applies to like a lot of stuff so it's a flex yeah it's not the dumbest flex I've
[4239.20 → 4244.56] ever seen to be perfectly blunt there are somewhat's a dumber flex do you have an example trump's gold toilet
[4248.40 → 4256.08] I mean you could melt that down that's that's true um and the value of gold generally goes up
[4256.08 → 4262.08] honestly i personally investment personally i it's really smart I think just about any
[4262.80 → 4269.36] depreciating asset like uh like luxury brand pretty much anything okay here here here
[4269.36 → 4275.28] here you and I are both on the same dumber flex Louis Vuitton luggage oh okay luggage
[4275.28 → 4281.12] because it gets beat up because it is going to get kicked around in the back of a plane I've always
[4281.12 → 4286.88] like the same piece of luggage that I've had literally forever that i uh what do we call
[4286.88 → 4297.92] it privateered from my mom um, um it's its fabric right, and it's held up really well in my opinion
[4297.92 → 4302.88] because it's fabric right so it's been able to like if it takes an impact it just it doesn't care
[4302.88 → 4307.04] it just bends um and I've I've known people that have had luggage just straight up break
[4307.76 → 4313.92] in a way shorter period of time because they have hard shells so they actually kind of counterintuitively
[4313.92 → 4318.96] take more damage but i only ever put like clothes and soft stuff in that luggage anyway so why do I care
[4318.96 → 4325.44] yeah um I don't know yeah sweet okay flow plane is all about the gold controller apparently
[4325.44 → 4330.72] so like the gold toilet I think you could make a very similar argument the gold
[4330.72 → 4334.96] controller could be melted down technically appreciate, and we have a potential buyer
[4334.96 → 4339.20] but the problem is that they want to fly here to pick it up and right now it's just and right now is
[4339.20 → 4344.24] just like not a great time yeah also we need to fix something about it because the shoulder buttons
[4344.24 → 4349.36] suck the triggers are okay, but the shoulders don't flex properly because it's one solid piece
[4349.36 → 4354.24] across and plastic bends and gold doesn't well it does, but it doesn't uh so what we want to do is we
[4354.24 → 4359.52] want to we're going to give them that cast piece of gold, but we want to replace it with a plastic one
[4359.52 → 4365.28] and then we're also hoping to reposition the antenna so that it can go through the plastic so that the
[4365.28 → 4370.72] reception is a little bit better because it's mostly only usable more usable yeah so that's that's what
[4370.72 → 4373.92] that's what we kind of still need to sort out but yeah no i think we're going to be able to
[4373.92 → 4378.80] sell it for about what we paid this is another one where like there's a bunch of people in float
[4378.80 → 4383.60] plane chat trying to point out like purchases that you have made that like don't necessarily make a ton
[4383.60 → 4390.96] of sense he's not saying he has never made a purchase that's a little odd like you bought a
[4391.52 → 4396.40] I don't think anyone even mentioned this but the MSI dragon that thing's so cool I didn't buy it i only
[4396.40 → 4400.24] had to pay for shipping oh okay it was a not inconsequential you still had to pay a lot for
[4400.24 → 4405.76] shipping I feel like i I got my money's worth out of it yeah sweet and if you get your money's worth
[4405.76 → 4411.76] out of whatever like i I turned it into content boys you got to understand what my business is
[4411.76 → 4416.32] right like when I okay, okay okay here's something that was the idea behind the gold
[4416.32 → 4424.72] controller actually as well yes so um the solar panels sorry Luke ouch sorry that's my favourite
[4424.72 → 4430.16] big red dragon right there oh there we go um so when we picked out the solar panels for our roof
[4430.16 → 4436.00] i I wanted solar panels because like that's cool uh yeah, but we ended up going with these super
[4436.00 → 4443.36] fancy solar panels because I figured it would be a video and so if it's content that's like that's
[4443.36 → 4448.00] great because it's one more video idea I don't have to come up with which actually does have a cost i
[4448.00 → 4453.12] literally hire people whose job it is to come up with ideas so the solar panels we got they're here now
[4453.12 → 4458.56] and I'm super excited they're super cool they're from this company called dual sun I think and what they
[4458.56 → 4465.76] are is their combination solar panels to generate energy and water heaters, and then we're going to pump
[4465.76 → 4473.44] that water into the pool so we're actually going to heat our pool with just by cooling our solar panels
[4473.44 → 4478.40] which makes the solar panels more efficient and makes the pool cost less to heat that's just awesome
[4478.40 → 4483.28] that's just awesome yeah that's sweet, and it's content yeah, and it's probably going to take forever
[4483.28 → 4487.60] to pay for itself because they were like more expensive or something I actually don't know if we
[4487.60 → 4491.60] bought them, or they were discounted or anything, but theoretically they were more expensive and I was
[4491.60 → 4495.36] committed to them either way because I really wanted to make a video about it because it's super cool
[4495.36 → 4501.76] yeah so was it more expensive than having as inefficient as this would be due to like
[4502.32 → 4508.16] the premium areas for having uh solar panels and that etc but would it be more expensive than having
[4508.16 → 4513.12] two separate sets like water heating solar panels well the problem is that you've only got so much roof
[4513.12 → 4518.08] area especially in Vancouver to actually put solar panels on where they're going to get a decent amount
[4518.08 → 4521.92] of sunlight, and they can do this whole like simulation thing there 's's a big amount of value though is
[4521.92 → 4528.00] what I'm saying by having it do both in one area yeah, and it might literally save money compared to
[4528.00 → 4532.88] buying two sets yes which would be stupid anyway and cooling the panels makes them like I forget what
[4532.88 → 4536.88] it is it's like every however many degrees it gets however much percent more efficient like it's actually
[4536.88 → 4547.28] really, really cool yeah um fiery servers what are I doingn't know I didn't think you'd know either so i
[4547.28 → 4557.36] just fired it off okay cool got it um neat do we have any other topics lined up oh we didn't even talk
[4557.36 → 4562.56] about no we didn't talk about the other thing holy crap I hope people notice this there's another launch
[4562.56 → 4569.76] today the tote bag people have noticed that by the way the tote bag is here ladies and gentlemen
[4570.64 → 4577.68] it's available in two different colours if you like the if you like the fiery exciting
[4577.68 → 4582.80] multicoloured one you can go with that if you prefer the monochrome you can go with that
[4583.36 → 4589.44] it's available in two different sizes 35 by 42 centimetre and 42 by 42 centimetres so you can see
[4589.44 → 4594.24] the two different sizes here next to each other uh super high quality just like you know everything
[4594.24 → 4601.92] we do because like that's what we do um 100 polyester canvas really, really nice printing super vibrant
[4602.56 → 4606.96] pictures are not juiced up at all you guys can see like here on wan show this is what it looks
[4606.96 → 4615.68] like uh but yeah this was uh this was one of Lloyd's little brainchild projects um he did the design for
[4615.68 → 4623.68] it and his um I think I'm actually not sure who saw this one through the whole uh manufacturing
[4623.68 → 4628.88] process but just lots of little lots of little touches like we made sure to use uh box stitches
[4628.88 → 4633.60] in additional in addition to what they originally had which was just these two if I recall correctly i
[4633.60 → 4640.32] was like uh no I don't want the handles coming off so we need to make sure that we're serious business
[4640.32 → 4645.84] making sure they stay on I mean what's the point of a reusable bag that you have to throw away stupid
[4647.60 → 4652.72] Jaden said canvas Bethesda couldn't even afford that that's a fantastic reference Jaden gotta love
[4652.72 → 4660.16] if it's an old it's an older meme, but it checks out yeah that's good uh oh I guess we hadn't really
[4660.16 → 4666.88] finished our discussion on NFTs on YouTube we just kind of talked about how NFTs were stupid
[4666.88 → 4672.24] in the movie but like do you have any ideas of what they could possibly even be talking I mean
[4672.24 → 4677.04] they could just copy what twitter did and make it for avatars people yeah, so people can NFT their
[4677.04 → 4683.92] avatars um I wouldn't be surprised if they allow users if they make it like a YouTube premium feature
[4683.92 → 4689.04] or something like that, so people could have like maybe their user if you buy NFT you probably got that
[4689.04 → 4694.16] money their user profile pictures like bigger or something like that I could totally see people paying for
[4694.16 → 4702.64] that kind of thing I think that make allowing creators to sell NFTs to their audiences
[4702.64 → 4709.76] through the platform could absolutely be a thing that they would do um oh apparently they actually
[4709.76 → 4715.20] made a statement I didn't realize this I thought the dislikes dislike button still dead was just uh
[4715.20 → 4720.24] proof being funny in the title they apparently addressed it again dislikes are still dead despite
[4720.24 → 4725.68] hearing the valid complaints they go on to cite the original reasons like dislike attacks on smaller
[4725.68 → 4731.76] creators and that would no that was it uh we did not see a meaningful difference in viewership regardless
[4731.76 → 4736.80] of whether there was a public dislike count, and importantly it reduced dislike attacks okay
[4737.76 → 4744.96] sure cool um the discussion question is so videos are still getting the same amount of views but now you
[4744.96 → 4750.48] don't know if the information is good or bad how is this better proof the horse is so dead the horse is
[4750.48 → 4755.20] so dead uh there's just there's nothing else to say about it anymore I don't think
[4758.08 → 4761.92] there's a merch message talking about us talking about YouTube premium again to be clear we're not
[4761.92 → 4768.00] trying to shill YouTube premium we just both have it and that is technically the alternative I have its lots
[4768.00 → 4774.64] of times yeah I own YouTube premium on my personal account on my work account on the
[4774.64 → 4780.48] LTT account on the tech quickie account that was a Terran specific request uh on the I believe i we
[4780.48 → 4785.84] own it on the channel super fun account I have to buy YouTube premium for because the editors often go
[4785.84 → 4790.96] in and pull stuff out of our old videos even if it's not even if they're going to go back and get the
[4790.96 → 4795.52] original footage anyway they'll go easier to browse through YouTube than it is going through an archive of
[4795.52 → 4803.36] really is footage so we actually use YouTube in the course of our work a lot, and it was requested many
[4803.36 → 4809.44] times to me that I buy premium for all the work accounts so I did and if I haven't then I'm sorry
[4809.44 → 4812.80] we'll get premium added to that one if any of our editors are watching going no I still have to sit
[4812.80 → 4819.44] and watch ads whenever I'm working on Mac address or whatever the case may be um so yeah no we're not
[4819.44 → 4823.68] we're not shilling for it, we're just telling you that that's that that's how it works that's you either
[4823.68 → 4831.44] you either consume the ads or you pay for premium that's, or you privateer it ah privateer it yes
[4831.44 → 4838.16] okay I'm a flanker says people in tech that dislike NFTs is because of the terrible implementation
[4838.16 → 4842.00] and most could be done without the massive energy use and massively distributed ledger yeah I mean
[4842.00 → 4847.12] that's yeah that's fair enough I mean there's also just the laughable stuff like if the uh is the host
[4847.84 → 4852.72] of that particular NFT minting service goes away doesn't the link just dead and then it just
[4852.72 → 4858.72] depends where the link goes to yeah sometimes it's not the the the site that sold it sometimes the
[4858.72 → 4867.12] link is elsewhere but yeah yeah hi hilarious ganja gremlin I literally said it's
[4867.12 → 4874.08] easier to browse we're gonna still grab the original footage come on Linus you can add multiple
[4874.08 → 4882.00] users to a premium account uh yes I don't remember I don't remember what the issues were with having all
[4882.00 → 4888.08] those accounts be a family i I think there was a reason i I don't know it's probably it's honestly
[4888.72 → 4894.32] outside my pay grade to go investigate the difference in of eleven dollars between one
[4894.32 → 4905.92] implementation versus another i just I'm sure somebody um could look into that uh yeah cool uh people are
[4905.92 → 4910.32] asking how many flannels are left I mean yeah we've moved a lot of them but I think we ordered a lot
[4910.32 → 4918.88] so it's probably fine uh oh, oh shoot I should probably mention we did not do much in the way
[4918.88 → 4924.96] of a public announcement but anyone who signed up for a wan hoodie restock notification we got it we
[4924.96 → 4930.72] sent the notifications we moved through over a quarter of our restocking already so I'm letting wan show
[4930.72 → 4935.28] know next and then if we have enough left then we'll do an in video call out or something for it
[4935.28 → 4940.56] but uh we're we're kind of trying to we're kind of trying to go easy on that so we didn't even put
[4940.56 → 4945.36] it back on the home page and stuff just because we wanted to give you guys a crack at it, I tried to
[4945.36 → 4953.68] privateer the undies but oh, oh you pushed it okay it wasn't like a question or anything um we'll show on
[4953.68 → 4962.32] screen okay how about we go ahead, and we demand an alpaca wool moose plushier I don't think that's coming
[4962.32 → 4974.00] anytime soon rip hyperscale really so uh did you know what this was I had never even heard of
[4974.00 → 4979.44] hyperscale yeah so I feel like I'm pretty tuned in to you know the gaming scene and stuff yeah never
[4979.44 → 4985.36] once in my life have I ever heard of hyperscale maybe that's part of the problem yeah so it's a
[4985.36 → 4990.32] free-to-play battle Royal from Ubisoft, and it's shutting down on April 28th after less than two years
[4990.32 → 4995.60] of production apparently it had a strong start never heard of it not so sure if I agree with
[4995.60 → 5001.44] that am I an idiot like am I just I don't know I've literally never heard of this they announced
[5001.44 → 5006.08] another battle Royal ghost Brecon frontline that is now delayed indefinitely now they announced that
[5006.08 → 5012.00] in 2021 good you've you've beaten damaged the ghost Brecon name too much already maybe the battle Royal
[5012.00 → 5017.12] craze is over now that we have Fortnite PUBG apex and war zone feels kind of similar to the mobile
[5017.12 → 5022.48] craze yeah that's actually pretty uh that that's pretty spot on proof yeah it does remember when
[5022.48 → 5027.92] there was like a new mob every freaking month Conrad and float plane chat is just like hyperscale
[5027.92 → 5033.68] question mark what like tons of people in flow plane chat are going like I've never heard of this
[5033.68 → 5039.76] hyper what question mark like no one knows what this game is twitch chat knows they're like yeah
[5039.76 → 5043.12] there were a ton of sponsored streams and stuff it was part of the twitch drop beta craze
[5043.12 → 5047.76] okay so outside there's a bunch of sponsored streams, and then it was so they didn't market
[5047.76 → 5053.44] it outside it's almost like sponsored streamers who stop playing your game immediately
[5053.44 → 5058.64] after they're not getting sponsored by it is actually just a zero impact marketing activity yeah
[5058.64 → 5063.20] Conrad said it lost apparently something like 90 of its player base in a week
[5064.72 → 5072.72] wow yikes that's crazy general 97 I think I played it once and immediately
[5072.72 → 5079.44] forgot only just remembered now maybe that's why maybe we have heard of it and its name is just so
[5079.44 → 5086.48] generic, and it was just so impactful that we just immediately forgot man oh man, so there was the no
[5086.48 → 5092.32] craze then there was the mob craze then the battle Royal I wonder what the next big craze is going to be
[5092.32 → 5096.88] I don't think there's anything kind of like rolling right now i kind of thought that you know after
[5096.88 → 5102.64] among us and then um oh man what was that social games that was a thing for a little bit because
[5102.64 → 5107.28] there was um among us popped off then there was that like winter one that I don't remember the name
[5107.28 → 5115.12] of um but what was that uh what's that like game show one that was super fun oh that's
[5115.12 → 5120.56] kind of still pretty good jack box no, no no, no no the uh the one where you have to go through the
[5120.56 → 5124.32] challenges and at each stage a bunch of people get eliminated I actually played it a bunch why can I
[5124.32 → 5129.52] remember the name oh fall guys yeah fall guys i kind of thought after that went like
[5129.52 → 5134.64] mega viral that we were going to see a bunch of copycats on of that format but it kind of didn't
[5134.64 → 5138.64] materialize but I guess it also hasn't really been long enough the game development takes a long
[5138.64 → 5146.88] freaking time battle Royal copying a game that is already out bad play yeah bad play you got to have
[5146.88 → 5153.76] better espionage than that uh Markov extraction type modes yeah that's fair I don't think that's going to
[5153.76 → 5162.48] be like a huge thing has been in development since I think it's 2016 and this whole time it's been
[5162.48 → 5169.52] this like really poorly made but really cool game and no one has copied it, and it's been very confusing
[5169.52 → 5177.04] to me um I don't know i I have said before that if a big triple a developer tried to copy Markov they
[5177.04 → 5183.60] would fail they would horribly fail because they would try to attach some gross microtransaction
[5183.60 → 5190.40] crap on top of it, and it just would not work in that type of game at all so like it's just it's
[5190.40 → 5194.00] not gonna I think that's one of the reasons why no one's copying it is they're looking at it seeing
[5194.00 → 5199.28] that and then just going nope we'll just leave it to PSG, and they'll just do what they do with it yep
[5199.28 → 5206.64] okay yeah i uh man it was funny going to shows like pax like during those eras do you remember what
[5206.64 → 5212.96] was it called wild star that MMO that was just like dude the most ball was massive booth for so many
[5212.96 → 5219.04] years how long did that game even stay online I don't think it was very long two years three they
[5219.04 → 5223.36] they had I remember exactly where to i could walk there if the convention was open right now
[5223.36 → 5228.96] they had in the exact same spot for so many years like just the announcement they had this massive
[5228.96 → 5233.28] amazing booth then they had like the I think alpha then they had the beta just like year after year
[5233.28 → 5238.00] after year this massive incredible booth so much marketing money behind it, and then it just died
[5238.00 → 5243.76] because that came you mentioned the MMO craze that came kind of a little bit past the end yep
[5243.76 → 5248.80] so just no one really cared any more they weren't into it and then like the next year it was just
[5248.80 → 5256.16] every booth was a mob yeah just every booth yeah so here it is uh released 2014 mid 2014 with a
[5256.16 → 5265.76] subscription free to play only a year later that's just over a year later um and then blah blah blah
[5265.76 → 5271.44] on september 2018 three years later they announced the immediate closure of carbine studios and that
[5271.44 → 5275.84] wild star would begin the process of winding down, and they wound down two months later two and a half
[5275.84 → 5284.48] months later ouch the death of MMO servers is a fascinating thing to witness yeah everyone
[5284.48 → 5287.52] that's one that I've been a part of I've tried to make local recordings of it so that I could like
[5288.24 → 5291.28] because that's one of the things we've talked about on Sancho before and there are some videos
[5291.28 → 5299.12] on it online you can't preserve MMOs no you can't do it you can't even if you spin up another version
[5299.12 → 5303.92] of it you're not going to capture the same culture you're not going to capture the same type
[5303.92 → 5309.04] of player base nope like the way that people played games in the past is actually different
[5309.04 → 5313.84] than the way that people approach playing games now there 's was I brought this up the other day
[5313.84 → 5318.48] there used to be this thing where like if you're playing a RPG MMO or not it doesn't matter
[5318.48 → 5322.56] um there used to be a thing where people would generally just wear the armour or weapons or
[5322.56 → 5329.68] whatever that looked the coolest it's not a thing anymore everyone wants to min max stuff
[5329.68 → 5333.92] they don't care as much about aesthetics they want to they want to be the best it's its an it's a very
[5333.92 → 5339.36] different no one ever was oh yeah heck yeah there's a there's a very different way of uh of approaching
[5339.36 → 5344.16] games these days so you can't just spin up an old MMO and imagine it's going to be the same
[5344.16 → 5349.60] so it's uh yeah it's and I mean even just the way that we interact online is so different like it used
[5349.60 → 5359.20] to be that you had to have you had to have a crew you had to have kind of like a tech-savvy um anchor
[5359.20 → 5364.48] to your crew because someone had to set up the vent or mumble server and like maintain it yeah whereas
[5364.48 → 5368.16] nowadays everybody just kind of like jumps in discord so it's its a different dynamic, and it's
[5368.16 → 5375.12] a lot of communities have their own forums yeah oh wow yeah I remember that so you had to have like
[5375.12 → 5381.12] someone who could do basic web admin stuff like it was really it was fascinating and just none
[5381.12 → 5387.60] of those things you can't, you can't emulate that stuff any more um I remember this is pretty
[5387.60 → 5393.76] off-topic but I remember back in the day uh I used to run to I figured out that you could change
[5393.76 → 5400.56] something in the like commands that were run when the program was opened wow I haven't done
[5400.56 → 5406.56] this in forever um to make it so that you could actually open a second version of vent ventral
[5406.56 → 5412.08] because if you didn't do that and you opened it again it would just uh it would just pull forward
[5412.08 → 5416.08] the currently running application so I'd run two different versions of vent and I'd have different
[5416.08 → 5421.52] hotkeys for both so I could like trash talk people that were there with my buddies while we were all
[5421.52 → 5428.80] like playing together that was uh we were jerks but uh I don't know its just everything's just so
[5428.80 → 5435.12] different now um people are going to twitch stream whatever you do there will if you're in a big group
[5435.12 → 5439.36] of people playing someone's probably streaming it that's a very different experience like it's just
[5439.36 → 5446.32] I don't know it's very weird obvious lobster says it's okay we enjoyed it well existed that's what's
[5446.32 → 5452.08] important, but the thing is that nobody else will ever get to enjoy if it's kind of its kind of lost
[5452.08 → 5460.08] yeah uh Matthias says VR MMOs are the future embrace it I don't know if I could spend MMO amounts of time
[5460.64 → 5468.00] in VR I think that'd be pretty tough for me, it'll be an interesting thing to see transition over time I think
[5468.00 → 5473.04] they would need something like this is like way future, but they would need something like uh
[5475.44 → 5483.04] like neural link style to make that a thing I think yeah that's that's pretty tough that's pretty tough
[5483.04 → 5492.32] yeah um all right is it merch messages time it might be merch messages time um might be a few of them
[5492.32 → 5497.76] Anthony threw in a topic about how NVIDIA launched the RTX 3050, and it's obviously already
[5497.76 → 5505.68] sold out it's gone so what are we going to do this week we're just going to have to buy that crappy AMD
[5505.68 → 5513.68] card the 6500 XT yep yeah so hey at least that's let's actually I don't even know if that's in stock
[5513.68 → 5518.24] it's actually like I wonder if it was like big brain move from AMD to actually just make it
[5518.24 → 5522.72] intentionally suck or if it just sucks because they suck it's really hard to tell with them
[5524.24 → 5527.76] sometimes like i to be clear I love AMD but like
[5530.24 → 5539.92] yeah you guys are just sort of dumb sometimes yeah um yeah even 6500 its are not in stock on new
[5539.92 → 5547.28] egg under 270 us dollars that's that's the cheapest and only as rock and power colour are in stock which
[5547.28 → 5552.32] are like as rock I can't speak for because as rock wasn't making GPUs back when I was in product
[5552.32 → 5559.20] management, but power colour was like basement tier in terms of what AMD card buyers wanted when we brought
[5559.20 → 5566.40] in like a bunch of power colour cards they better be cheap because AMD buyers wanted SFX uh you know like
[5566.40 → 5572.40] your tier one motherboard brands like MSI gigabyte Asus um sapphire people like for some reason I had
[5572.40 → 5577.36] a terrible customer experience uh customer service experience with sapphire back in like
[5577.36 → 5582.08] the early 2000s so I basically swore off them for life, but some people swear by them, I don't get it
[5582.08 → 5586.16] they must have just like better service in other regions or something like that because maybe mine was
[5586.16 → 5591.92] awful as far as my understanding goes they are more popular elsewhere yeah yeah it must be just one of
[5591.92 → 5596.08] those that might actually be a thing yeah, but yeah power colour is like basement uh
[5596.08 → 5599.68] I don't I don't know if that's changed to be clear I'm not not not talking smack about power
[5599.68 → 5603.36] colour now I know they've got some really cool cards that they've done over the years uh like
[5603.36 → 5608.80] that devil series that they've done and stuff like that also this one happens to be an it card which
[5608.80 → 5614.32] appears to be the only one out of what's available right now which is at least gives that GPU a reason
[5614.32 → 5621.28] to exist if you're putting it in a super compact build uh GG unholy says Linus power colour makes the
[5621.28 → 5626.00] best AMD cards you can buy now okay well there you go shows you what I know uh demon fox 69
[5626.00 → 5631.28] says sapphire gets gold AMD chips for sure yeah I'm not convinced uh that's always been like the
[5631.28 → 5637.20] rumour I have no idea who started it I have no idea who keeps perpetuating it but I sincerely doubt it
[5637.20 → 5642.64] uh someone sent in a merch message uh that didn't have a question, but they said please email me
[5642.64 → 5650.96] when the backpack gets released um I don't know so we might set up pre-launch pages at some point
[5650.96 → 5661.20] talked to nick about that yesterday actually and uh what we discussed was um that I still do not
[5661.20 → 5667.60] want to take prepayment i i have a serious discomfort with taking your money before I have a
[5667.60 → 5672.72] product uh that I can imminently ship you and there are cases where we take the money
[5672.72 → 5680.48] before we're ready to ship like with the CPU hoodie which by the way I believe this is uh pretty much
[5680.48 → 5685.84] going to be your last chance to get your hands on the first run of that let me just see if I can
[5686.56 → 5694.00] find it is might actually be pulled already oh no here it is yep so you can still order the first
[5694.00 → 5700.56] production run of these should ship by February 11th super cool hoodie this is the first but we
[5700.56 → 5705.68] already have the blanks we have the blanks uh our shop is local that's going to print them up for us
[5705.68 → 5710.80] so it's its all good we've done the test prints and everything already but in terms of items that have
[5710.80 → 5715.84] not yet arrived in our warehouse i I really don't like taking money for them because what if they don't
[5715.84 → 5723.76] what if the ship sinks you know, and it's another four six months before I can get them am I
[5723.76 → 5727.36] am I going to pay you interest on that like i just i I don't like it I think it's a bad time
[5727.36 → 5732.88] yeah but for stuff like the backpack stuff like the screwdriver where we're where these are long-term
[5732.88 → 5739.68] projects we put a lot of resources into they will not flop they will come um I feel like just
[5740.24 → 5744.56] having somewhere to point you guys where you can register your interest would really help us with
[5744.56 → 5748.96] uh with product planning as well with you know hey do we actually need to order more backpacks like
[5748.96 → 5754.40] should I be taking out a loan to order more backpacks for example stuff like that so uh yes
[5754.40 → 5760.16] i I think it is our intention to do that but I'm not sure exactly when if that makes sense
[5761.84 → 5767.84] okay I think it's time for us to do some merch messages now we got to do this do you want to
[5767.84 → 5771.36] sort through the incomings while I start making my way through some of the curated ones you guys
[5771.36 → 5776.64] actually sent too many I've literally been trying to do that like the whole show yeah we cannot
[5776.64 → 5781.44] do them all but I'm going to do my best to go through uh some cool ones we're at well over 200.
[5782.00 → 5786.00] Justin w says when labs are up and running would you consider testing the mouse pad again improve
[5786.00 → 5790.96] device to improve testing device different mice wear and tear etc yeah absolutely, so mouse pads is
[5790.96 → 5796.96] something that I think we can contribute scientific testing to that is not done outside the
[5796.96 → 5802.40] manufacturer space and I don't think it's a secret we're working on some kind of mouse concept for
[5802.40 → 5806.56] ourselves so it's all stuff that we would have to figure out how to do anyway so if we're going to do
[5806.56 → 5810.56] it we might as well use it to evaluate other products first time buyer looking forward to it
[5810.56 → 5816.80] my mom gets noise complaints when movies have loud parts I want to get her an audio compressor or limited
[5816.80 → 5823.28] but all I can find is expensive audiophile stuff so cheap recommendations yeah that's that's an
[5823.28 → 5827.36] interesting one other than turning down your subwoofer I don't really know what to tell you
[5827.36 → 5835.76] like I know that I know that some receivers for example have like a nighttime mode where they will
[5835.76 → 5843.04] intentionally yeah yeah they'll intentionally um flatten it out a little bit but in terms of like
[5843.04 → 5849.12] an add-on device for that I'm I'm honestly not really I have never researched that never even occurred to me
[5850.32 → 5855.76] it's an interesting idea yeah I just was in the same boat so I was like I don't know um good evening
[5855.76 → 5859.36] guys I'm going car shopping tomorrow wanted to see if you thought that the current plug-in hybrids
[5859.36 → 5864.08] were worth taking a look at are you still happy with the volt or do you have a wandering eye
[5864.08 → 5871.36] I love that I love that phrasing do you have a wandering eye you know the meme right so suave oh
[5871.68 → 5879.92] holding hands and yeah yeah um honestly I think the volt was one of my most practical purchases
[5879.92 → 5888.72] ever I burn about a tank of gas every three months two to three months which is kind of incredible
[5888.72 → 5897.28] given that it's like a 30 litter tank I pay practically nothing for gas and what I like about the plug-in hybrid
[5897.28 → 5904.72] concept is that compared to an all-electric vehicle the amount of lithium required to manufacture it is
[5904.72 → 5910.64] fractional so it's kind of the best of both worlds that's a really nice having the fallback but
[5911.20 → 5917.28] as we acknowledged in my review of it is also comes with additional complexity right two drive
[5917.28 → 5924.32] trains two you've got a full electric well it's only sort of, so technically the volt is an EV
[5924.96 → 5932.00] with a gasoline generator attached to it okay right yeah but well there are ones that are the other way
[5932.00 → 5938.00] and mechanically but the point is that mechanically it is more complex than all one
[5938.00 → 5944.64] or all of the other there's there are trucks and actually a lot of other applications right now
[5944.64 → 5949.44] that are looking into I don't there's a specific name for it and someone in the chat is going to get
[5949.44 → 5954.16] upset because I'm going to say it wrong uh, but it's some type of like extremely highly efficient
[5954.72 → 5961.60] diesel generator powered electric vehicle setup that is supposed to just be like amazing the bee's knees
[5961.60 → 5966.08] hey yeah but i I don't I don't know enough about it, but it's its interesting so I've been super happy
[5966.08 → 5972.64] with it, I've gotten in my mind all the benefits of an electric vehicle I get to drive in the HOV lane
[5972.64 → 5979.44] by myself I never change my brake pads because I just use regenerative braking yeah all the time i
[5979.44 → 5986.72] hardly pay for fuel um I have but I get all the benefits of ice I have no range anxiety I didn't pay the
[5986.72 → 5993.92] the pro the cost of a full eve specially because I didn't buy it brand new um I get that I get that
[5993.92 → 5999.68] um that pep off the line, but it's not a powerful vehicle it's not a performance vehicle so like sure
[5999.68 → 6004.88] that's compared to my old civic right but um yeah I'm I'm really happy with it, but the thing is you
[6004.88 → 6011.20] can't buy them brand new, so my other candidate was the clarity and honestly my in-laws are super happy with
[6011.20 → 6016.80] the model y which is just like a giant model 3. I think it's kind of hard to go wrong with full
[6016.80 → 6022.56] electric or with a plug-in hybrid but what I would say about a plug-in hybrid is make sure you find one
[6022.56 → 6028.80] that has enough range so really think about how you're using it where do you live where do you come
[6028.80 → 6037.28] from where do you go where do you sorry I is that do people still know that song I don't think so okay
[6037.28 → 6042.40] I was wondering about that the other day because i i I made a cotton-eyed Joe joke and i I got a
[6042.40 → 6048.80] extremely flat response and I was like okay oh maybe this isn't sung at every school dance ever anymore
[6048.80 → 6054.16] yeah yeah I don't know maybe that's not a thing I just did the shirts right like yeah yeah yeah anyway
[6056.08 → 6062.80] i i i really yeah make sure you consider where you're going uh and how where you're going to be
[6062.80 → 6072.72] able to charge right I do want to upgrade I've talked to Luke he thinks I'm an idiot um well you
[6072.72 → 6083.76] just I just am not Luke thinks the optics are bad and that I'm an idiot okay is that fair it's its it's
[6083.76 → 6089.60] an overly it's an overly simplified version of what I'm saying but essentially have we distilled it down
[6089.60 → 6099.68] to the essence essentially yeah I just okay how much was it I mean there's a range boys okay, okay
[6099.68 → 6105.68] the main the most recent one I've heard of I strongly agree with everything you just said
[6107.92 → 6115.76] I'll put it that way uh my volt is a 20 is it 2018. I don't think like you have to go as practical as
[6115.76 → 6122.00] you did with the vault okay fine, fine okay you know what let's just lay it out let's lay it all
[6122.00 → 6126.08] out on the table i want to buy a Tynan i want to park it in my fancy new garage that wasn't even
[6126.08 → 6131.60] the one I'm talking oh which one are you talking the Tynan's like pretty rough but like oh you mean
[6131.60 → 6138.88] the um whatever i don't know its name oh crap what's that stupid thing called i actually went as far as
[6138.88 → 6149.20] emailing a dealer and finding out too far um hold on what's it called a never remark never remark
[6149.20 → 6156.24] never yeah that that's to that no that's ridiculous um yeah so how much is this thing Tynan
[6156.24 → 6162.48] starts at around 100k Canadian and goes as high as like 300 if you're yeah that's ridiculous nuts but
[6162.48 → 6169.20] sure how much is a never uh one point something million euro yeah two point something a million
[6169.20 → 6175.12] euro yeah sure neat yeah that's cool hold on let me check let me check let me check let me check
[6176.00 → 6183.44] oh that makes me want to puke hold on let me find out how much it is uh i definitely still want to go
[6183.44 → 6190.00] for a ride if you got one but i would uh two million euro yeah yeah that's uh
[6190.00 → 6198.08] uh okay so yeah that's that that's not happening so yeah i okay so fine where's the middle
[6198.08 → 6203.60] ground what am what may i what may i have without you judging me i don't know and i feel
[6203.60 → 6209.44] like whatever i come up with is going to be vague and not based on enough stuff to be fair but I've
[6209.44 → 6217.44] I've just spending over a hundred grand on a car seems nuts to me so Jake had a pretty good take on
[6217.44 → 6223.60] this he kind of goes well you know what the smart play is whether you lease it through the business
[6223.60 → 6229.28] or not because i think i could make a pretty solid argument that as long as i post enough pictures on
[6229.28 → 6233.52] Instagram, or it's included in the videos enough that it's which you'll probably make a review of
[6233.52 → 6239.44] it or whatever yeah sure so fine it's if it's for the business right and that will help it a lot he goes
[6240.08 → 6245.68] whether it's through the business or not you should lease it because some of the battery technology that
[6245.68 → 6250.80] is coming around the corner here yeah is going to make our current battery tech look absolutely
[6250.80 → 6257.20] and that's legitimately a big part of my argument too cars are becoming like computers where we i am
[6257.20 → 6262.16] expecting like honestly teslas because of the shortages and because of the scarcity in general
[6262.16 → 6266.16] like early teslas actually on like Facebook marketplace Craigslist and stuff they hold their
[6266.16 → 6273.44] value retaining value shockingly well that will change we are going to see some real leaps forward in the
[6273.44 → 6280.24] technology that are going to make the older EV stuff look like kind of dumb like uh you can think of
[6280.24 → 6287.36] it kind of like spending like 300 grand on that to look kind of dumb in uh x which is a not large number
[6287.36 → 6293.92] amount of years yeah it's just i don't know I'm not into it so the new Tynan has android auto which was a
[6293.92 → 6299.12] big part of the reason that i ultimately was like forget it with the old one because their in-car entertainment
[6299.12 → 6307.20] system was so bad and android auto was not included that i just felt i was just offended i was offended
[6307.84 → 6315.20] yeah that knock 23 says cyber truck or go home uh well i guess I'm going to go home because I'm so far
[6315.20 → 6322.96] not convinced the cyber truck will ever launch so we'll see we'll see that was a rough one before there
[6322.96 → 6331.36] was a chip shortage uh apparently the Tynan has battery issues uh like what i actually
[6331.36 → 6336.00] do not i do not know about that so I'm going to have to I'm going to have to figure that out someone in chat
[6336.00 → 6340.56] said i think I'll use my 2011 Toyota RAV4 with 120 000 miles on it until it literally can't move
[6340.56 → 6344.96] anymore I'm kind of feeling that way about my car but I'm honestly only feeling that way just because
[6344.96 → 6351.68] i like it, i know for a fact that i like my car that something cool would be kind of fun for you
[6352.72 → 6358.96] yeah yeah i think you should get something cool i bet Jake would be happy to help you find something
[6358.96 → 6366.00] cool he is i know Jake has forbidden me to spec out a Tynan without consulting him first i yeah i don't
[6366.00 → 6372.08] think i don't think i think it would be mean if i bought a car without talking to Jake yeah probably
[6372.08 → 6376.24] i think it would actually just be mean if i didn't consult both him and Alex i think I'd be
[6376.24 → 6383.36] getting the like stink eye when i came into the office yeah i tweet like i did it they'd be like
[6388.72 → 6395.28] like really dude there's definitely cars that would be fun to own i don't think uh
[6396.24 → 6401.84] i would necessarily go for it at least not now but yeah i think a big part of that
[6401.84 → 6406.08] again is that i just genuinely really like my car and for some reason the fit
[6408.16 → 6413.20] a lot of other cars just feel kind of odd and i remember the first time i sat in my car i was
[6413.20 → 6417.60] like yeah this feels great yeah your car is also probably fast enough for you
[6419.84 → 6423.76] I've been in Luke's car when he drives it he doesn't need anything faster
[6423.76 → 6431.68] are you talking about when we had to catch the fairy
[6437.36 → 6438.24] hey we got there
[6440.32 → 6447.68] and we lived which is good yeah Brandon t says any plans for a panel uh plaid flannel in a wider
[6447.68 → 6452.80] colour gamut uh it is possible we're going to see how this one goes love the wan show what are your thoughts
[6452.80 → 6456.48] on pc power consumption is it something you think about when building your home server do you power
[6456.48 → 6462.08] down your computer when you're not using it or let it go to sleep i remote into my computer far
[6462.08 → 6466.64] too often for that to be convenient and remote wake is just not reliable enough for me, i would like
[6466.64 → 6472.40] to be able to power it down or asleep it rather i would never power it down sleep is good enough for
[6472.40 → 6478.56] me, but that's kind of my take on that all right exactly identical and the exact same reasons if remote
[6478.56 → 6484.48] wake worked better i would sleep my computer all the time but i don't because it just isn't better
[6485.44 → 6490.72] sleep just has so many problems and has always had so many problems um hey Linus it's been claimed
[6490.72 → 6495.44] that you have ADHD if this is true or even if it's not what has worked for you to be successful while
[6495.44 → 6498.32] doing something you love honestly i don't know if i even want to finish college so
[6499.36 → 6505.28] I'm getting into real dangerous territory i ain't uh i ain't a certified life coach and I'm not sure anybody is
[6505.28 → 6511.20] there's no certification for that if there is it's probably a scam yeah i have been diagnosed with
[6511.20 → 6516.96] ADHD when i was a kid i don't know if the hyperactivity is still applicable I've I'm definitely
[6516.96 → 6524.56] older don't move around as much as i used to um but i i i definitely do i mean I'm sure anyone who's
[6524.56 → 6528.88] ever worked with me for a prolonged period of time can attest to the fact that i will just
[6530.48 → 6535.12] drift off in the middle of a conversation and be thinking about completely something else it's
[6535.12 → 6540.40] not something that i do to be disrespectful it's just something that is um for better for worse
[6541.04 → 6548.40] not the only one here that does that what you get um and what worked for me, but it is not advice
[6548.40 → 6554.48] to be successful while doing something i love is doing something i love that was the only way that
[6554.48 → 6562.40] i was able to be successful i flunked out of school i did not i didn't make it um and i I'm not gonna
[6562.40 → 6566.96] I'm not going to say that it was anyone's fault other than my own i just didn't have the stuff to complete
[6566.96 → 6574.32] my science program and when i switched over to an arts program i just didn't feel like that piece of
[6574.32 → 6579.28] paper was going to end up being worth anything and i ultimately made the decision to withdraw but
[6579.28 → 6584.80] only because i didn't I are sorry i started taking more arts courses with the intention of switching to
[6584.80 → 6592.00] an arts program but i never did so i was just in the science faculty taking arts courses and either i was
[6592.00 → 6596.48] going to have to transfer which was going to be a problem with how bad my science grades were or they
[6596.48 → 6601.52] were going to kick me out of the university outright or i would leave, so those were really my three
[6601.52 → 6609.92] options so you can't fire me i quit like so i left but essentially i flunked out and i have
[6610.80 → 6618.88] managed to do something that i love by just doing something that i love that's where we're at on that
[6618.88 → 6623.28] have you made a final decision on what type of television you're getting at the new place yeah
[6623.28 → 6628.72] we're going to go projector we're going to go projector until micro lead becomes a thing although that new
[6628.72 → 6634.80] OLED with its like 90 something inches or something like that from LG and Samsung's new stuff but
[6634.80 → 6639.76] they're not huge they're new quantum dot OLED jams said they're just fire yeah it's like
[6639.76 → 6645.76] incredible that's actually pretty exciting yeah so i think I'm going to go with something really nice but not
[6645.76 → 6651.44] insane seeing how fast display technology is moving right now do you think we'll see a transition
[6651.44 → 6656.64] away from x86 on the desktop in the coming years i don't see it happening anytime soon i just don't
[6657.60 → 6667.76] um not on the desktop uh happy birthday I'm probably b-e-n-o-i-t how would you pronounce that b-e-n-o-i-t
[6667.76 → 6674.56] benoit okay i thought so i wasn't sure happy birthday Benoit hi from New Zealand boys been watching
[6674.56 → 6680.24] since whole room water cooling I'm planning an unpaid build for my Plex storage do i buy more
[6680.24 → 6686.16] smaller capacity drives like six eight terabytes for cheaper or fewer of the larger drives and spend
[6686.16 → 6692.40] more personally okay so unpaid gives you a lot of flexibility uh you're ignoring the option of getting
[6692.40 → 6699.60] one larger capacity drive and a bunch of smaller ones and then adding higher capacity ones later as
[6699.60 → 6705.20] they get cheaper as long as they don't exceed the capacity of your parity drive so that's an option
[6705.92 → 6713.52] um it basically comes down to balancing the cost per bay of your server and the cost per drive don't
[6713.52 → 6717.36] forget to factor that in so i can't, I can't do the math for you, you're going to have to go through you're
[6717.36 → 6722.08] going to have to look at the chassis you want how much it costs per bay in the front and calculate what
[6722.08 → 6729.76] it costs per populated bay not just looking at raw drive prices if that makes sense speaking of YouTube
[6729.76 → 6734.32] vents what does your guys take on the sponsor block extension which is available in advanced and as a
[6734.32 → 6740.48] browser extension so i have intentionally never talked about the sponsor block extension because
[6740.48 → 6747.36] sponsor block is in my opinion taking something that i feel like we do a reasonably good job of like
[6747.36 → 6755.36] you can skip our sponsor spots with four taps on your phone or with like two arrow keys i think it's
[6755.36 → 6760.32] not a lot to not a lot to ask for you guys to at least give us a chance to tell you about something
[6760.32 → 6768.08] interesting um sponsor block in my opinion is not something that i would condone the use of i don't
[6768.08 → 6773.44] use it there i don't use it i have made the personal decision to not use it I'm not going to tell you
[6773.44 → 6778.56] guys what to do uh any plans for having guests or different hosts on the land show honestly I've
[6778.56 → 6785.44] really enjoyed it just being like mine and Luke's hangout opportunity yeah yeah we used to do that but
[6786.24 → 6791.92] um it actually took quite a bit of work yeah to be honest it really did coordinate with creators is
[6791.92 → 6799.60] hard, and it's its not like their fault, but it's just hard people have really varied schedules you got
[6799.60 → 6805.20] to get content out especially if you have a content schedule which a lot of i would say most uh big
[6805.20 → 6811.04] creators probably do uh you have to get that content out for that schedule that's what matters most
[6811.04 → 6817.76] um not like joining some random dudes wearing flannels uh internet talk show yeah people are busy
[6817.76 → 6822.00] any thoughts on the new fan testing setup at gamers nexus looks absolutely sweet i have wanted one of those
[6822.00 → 6827.92] things for like 10 years ever since i saw it at course i was like OMG one day I'd love to get one
[6827.92 → 6834.08] myself, and then it would be super cool if we could sort of uh corroborate each other's results and uh
[6835.04 → 6840.16] but otherwise i think uh over there they do they just do amazing work over at gamers nexus tons of
[6840.16 → 6847.28] respect for them so that it is relatively low on our priority list compared to things that they are
[6847.28 → 6851.36] not covering in as much depth it is something that we will add at some point just because we want to be
[6851.36 → 6857.76] able to test everything in house, but it'll, it'll come later any plans for more home smart content
[6857.76 → 6864.16] yes there's actually a we managed to catch the house the day before they started boarding
[6864.16 → 6869.60] everything up so with all the walls exposed, but everything installed so i was able to walk through
[6870.40 → 6875.60] the plan yeah that's sweet and my ulterior motive for shooting that video was that if i ever need to
[6875.60 → 6880.64] find something behind the wall later I'll be able to go watch that video and remember where that was
[6880.64 → 6885.84] buried that's cool uh what monitor would you recommend for a 3080 ti that wouldn't break the
[6885.84 → 6892.24] bank looking for 1440p with HDR, but there's way too many options I've been running 150 1080p for a while
[6892.24 → 6898.88] it's honestly painful so one thing I'll say is that if you're after HDR don't settle for anything less
[6898.88 → 6906.00] than VESA HDR 1000 because you're not really getting a HDR experience if you go like VESA HDR 400
[6906.00 → 6913.28] it's its not it's not HDR um and you might not want to hear that but that that's just the truth
[6913.28 → 6922.72] because the dynamic range right is not high so it's the fact that they call it we call it HDR INT
[6922.72 → 6929.36] jams coined it can't take credit for that that's pretty good HDR int is what we'll call really
[6929.36 → 6937.84] anything they say HDR 400 600 i would say 600 is better than nothing HD VESA HDR 400 is basically
[6937.84 → 6943.04] like yeah it's inputting a HDR signal but the only benefit you're getting out of it is if the game or
[6943.04 → 6948.96] the piece of content was mastered better in the HDR version it might look better, but that comes down
[6948.96 → 6954.48] to mastery not the capabilities of the display so that's what i have to say about that that's the
[6954.48 → 6957.76] main thing you're going to want to you're going to want to watch out for because then that sounds like
[6957.76 → 6961.68] you've kind of nailed down what you want there's a question here asking if you're ever going to react
[6961.68 → 6966.24] to the uh Ethan and Dennis sneaking around your house video apparently on a previous one show you
[6966.24 → 6972.32] said oh yeah i think we kind of i think we just kind of all forgot about it and moved on so are
[6972.32 → 6977.44] you messaging them now or should I follow up no, no that's um yeah we'll probably do it as like a
[6977.44 → 6983.20] float plane exclusive or something like that uh but i live in Ohio where intel is committed to
[6983.20 → 6987.60] investing in a large facility adding 3 000 jobs i have experience in auto manufacturing and wondering
[6987.60 → 6992.80] if you would know what kind of crews they look for fab jobs i have no idea I'm so sorry but no i
[6992.80 → 6997.92] have no idea when do you think you could tease any of the people that will be working in the lab
[6997.92 → 7004.32] when we have employment letters signed, and we don't yet, but we have one going we i think we are
[7004.32 → 7009.60] going to reach an agreement on the big one that i'm after yeah there's a there's a big fish
[7009.60 → 7018.00] that I've been trying to reel in and uh i think it's going to be a go um all right plan for the win
[7018.00 → 7022.80] yeah indeed hey Linus and Luke love the show it's my go-to for the drive to work first time catching it
[7022.80 → 7030.32] live what mics are you using uh i don't remember what these are re20s from electro voice yep i believe they
[7030.32 → 7037.28] provided them so if they did thank electro voice and if they didn't then hey still a good product
[7037.28 → 7041.92] yeah i was going to say you made it made a good mic oh no Tyler o asks what do you think of the whole
[7041.92 → 7053.28] Neil Young Joe Rogan Spotify debacle i didn't curate that one oh did I apparently uh i think that
[7053.28 → 7060.80] i know nothing about it, i think that Neil Young wants his music pulled from Spotify over what he
[7060.80 → 7070.96] perceived to be Joe Rogan's uh vaccine misinformation nice next one uh yeah i just don't I just don't want
[7070.96 → 7077.12] to touch it yeah started my job as it in the school department so i need a Canute for my ID question
[7077.12 → 7081.28] what thunderbolt hub do you use for your personal rig at home I'm using the razor one but don't consider
[7081.28 → 7087.12] this an endorsement i hate that the input is at the front it really drives me crazy for desktop use
[7087.12 → 7092.56] it sucks for a laptop it would be great where I'm constantly plugging and unplugging except wait i
[7092.56 → 7096.48] would just have the cable plugged in constantly and i would plug it into my laptop why did they put
[7096.48 → 7105.04] the input at the front i don't know that's I'm sorry I'm sorry that wasn't more helpful can you guys
[7105.04 → 7110.72] um make a breakaway lanyard i work in an environment where it's required uh yeah we probably should
[7111.28 → 7116.24] um okay do you want to do a couple while i send a note please uh i have to scroll down to there but
[7116.24 → 7122.00] yes i can so you're still going through the incoming so you would think I'm an idiot if i bought an
[7122.00 → 7128.88] avert yeah okay that's fair that's fair i mean okay no that's right i said it's fair i said it's fair
[7128.88 → 7135.84] there's always the argument of how much can you recoup from making videos around it yes i made the same
[7135.84 → 7140.64] argument with the TV not that much the TV i could have milked i made the same argument with the TV i
[7140.64 → 7145.60] could if there was a way and i don't know but if there was a way to i wouldn't have been able to
[7145.60 → 7152.40] make it if you're going to like to start a car channel, and you want like a hero thing to start the channel
[7152.40 → 7157.92] to race every car against sure yeah so if there's some type of argument i think it could be figured
[7157.92 → 7164.24] out if you're just like i want a really expensive car, and you're just going to buy a Novara like yeah
[7164.24 → 7169.60] I'm going to think that's stupid i don't know yeah it's honestly just way better use of the money is
[7169.60 → 7176.88] buying backpacks and screwdrivers, and you could just like to find some way to go drive one for
[7176.88 → 7183.52] like a weekend or something yes i could, and it's going to lose its novelty, and you're probably not going
[7183.52 → 7188.40] to want to daily drive if it's only two seats and like all this yeah so like it's just not it's so
[7189.04 → 7193.12] i don't just my thing is if you're going to spend
[7195.44 → 7200.72] unless you're so into cars that you're like a collector yeah buying a car like that like you're
[7200.72 → 7205.76] not gonna daily drive i bet it would appreciate they're only doing 150 a lot of supercars do a lot
[7205.76 → 7212.24] of them so that but that's the other thing if that's your like reason okay sure, but that's not it
[7212.24 → 7221.12] no it's not i just i honestly i was just like wow look cool yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not I'm not
[7221.12 → 7226.00] i honestly I've even been talking about the Tynan for like two years like you remember this right yeah
[7227.12 → 7233.84] i know i managed to test drive it like at a dealership other than the video so i test drove one
[7233.84 → 7239.20] before we did the video and i got as far as looking at all the different options and i got overwhelmed and
[7239.20 → 7246.64] i left because it was just like some of them were just offensive like it was like hundreds of dollars
[7246.64 → 7253.92] for a little clock on the dash and i was like what a lot of a lot of car options are kind of like i just
[7253.92 → 7258.80] i don't know it's one of those things where it's like in theory I'm like yeah i want to be like a cool
[7258.80 → 7264.00] guy and drive a cool car but then i actually get there and I'm like I'm sorry how much for a little
[7264.00 → 7271.44] light that shines your logo onto the pavement that's your logo not mine oh my goodness
[7272.08 → 7277.52] someone full of playing chat said Luke is such a utilitarian sometimes yeah i just people are so
[7277.52 → 7282.96] much money people are trying to come up with uh rules for me how about you spend three times the money
[7282.96 → 7289.20] you can pull in over a wan show and buy whatever the best car is at that price do i get to count merch
[7289.20 → 7294.72] messages oh man right when they said that i was like oh no
[7298.32 → 7302.80] you guys have seen how many of those are coming through right like they're right there you all
[7306.08 → 7313.52] oh man i mean we don't always have like a hot launch like today right yeah i just have to time it
[7313.52 → 7320.16] if i pick the right three like we launch the screwdriver you tie you somehow convinced
[7320.16 → 7324.32] nick to make it so that you launch the screwdriver in the backpack on the same day as back to back
[7324.32 → 7331.76] yeah give me one wan show yeah because man those are gonna they're going big i have to believe that
[7331.76 → 7337.52] they're going to kill because if i don't believe it I'm actually in serious trouble you know that right yeah
[7337.52 → 7343.44] okay cool yeah like i cannot afford that car when i was talking to you about that was before we had
[7343.44 → 7348.32] placed the order for either of those things yeah it would have been just like, and it would have been
[7348.32 → 7352.88] dumb it would have been like bye bye bye business cash reserves like it would have actually been
[7352.88 → 7357.92] completely stupid so you're it's its fun to think about stuff sometimes sure it is its fun to dream
[7357.92 → 7363.92] yeah like that was never going to happen yeah yeah um all right I'm planning to do my first build
[7363.92 → 7369.12] soon i got myself a 30 60. Do you have any great first time advice watch a build tutorial and follow
[7369.12 → 7378.40] along don't be in a hurry have fun there do you think banks with physical stores will survive that
[7378.40 → 7384.32] one uh I wasn't entirely sure what they meant I think they were saying like banks with physical like
[7385.36 → 7390.32] physical locations yeah absolutely so much banking still has to be done and i was going to say the
[7390.32 → 7395.28] the same thing a lot of a lot of conversation style stuff still needs to happen in a bank i
[7395.28 → 7400.72] wouldn't be too surprised if they kind of got real rid of the like bank teller type of position
[7401.68 → 7407.36] um and banks are more like you come in to like to negotiate mortgages and business customers will still
[7407.36 → 7412.40] demand it the tellers yeah you still need it there are a lot of things because like you're dealing
[7412.40 → 7417.20] with foreign currencies and stuff like that it's just like we deal with so many different currencies just
[7417.20 → 7422.00] be from out of region Amazon affiliates and stuff like that like it's just you have to interesting
[7422.00 → 7428.96] okay um here we go hold on a second uh there was a question what size are you guys wearing I'm wearing
[7428.96 → 7436.16] a medium and Luke is wearing an Excel yep flannels are awesome but I already have too many do you guys
[7436.16 → 7440.56] think there might be any issues with the upcoming intel GPUs and AMD chips and chipsets no i sincerely
[7440.56 → 7446.08] doubt that I don't think so either been watching since 2014 says Damian anyway what makes the underwear so
[7446.08 → 7452.00] fancy model fabric and such oh, oh you bought a pack well you'll know soon enough let me just put it
[7452.00 → 7461.68] this way your balls they'll thank you nicholas k I love the channel but I only use my laptop for
[7461.68 → 7465.52] coding and YouTube looking for a new ultra-wide monitor are there any features I should make sure
[7465.52 → 7474.16] are missing to make sure I'm not paying for something I won't use okay so I actually like high
[7474.16 → 7480.16] refresh rate displays for everything yeah I want my whole life to be 120 hertz never mind gaming you
[7480.16 → 7485.84] can feel it on the desktop you can absolutely feel it on the desktop I would say that you shouldn't
[7485.84 → 7492.08] bother with a refresh rate above 120, but you should still care I mean really anything that makes a
[7492.08 → 7496.40] monitor good for gaming makes it good for anything else like high contrast is great for gaming its great
[7496.40 → 7502.56] for text um high refresh rate is great for gaming it's great for just feeling responsive and like in the
[7502.56 → 7507.52] zone when you're working like it's um something to consider for anyone that's going like well no
[7507.52 → 7511.92] is that some of the side effects of creating things that are great for gaming is not what
[7511.92 → 7514.88] he's talking about he's just talking about the thing that's great for gaming yes
[7517.60 → 7521.68] went today to get about two thousand dollars in quarters exchange for cash sorry there's just some
[7521.68 → 7527.84] weird stuff being talked about in float plane chat okay um where did the Ltd 2019 lanyard with the
[7527.84 → 7532.80] metal clip come from I love mine and want a backup for when I inevitably stab it with an exact knife
[7533.36 → 7540.00] also I couldn't find merch messages on mobile is that a thing we looked into that uh I'm pretty sure
[7540.00 → 7546.64] it is a thing, but he might be logged in meaning it's doing the shop pay thing interesting uh I'm sure
[7546.64 → 7551.76] Conrad will have some form of feedback for that okay uh not 23 please let me have a paycheck between
[7551.76 → 7556.24] screwdriver and backpack uh-huh can't promise anything but probably yes I don't think they're gonna
[7556.24 → 7563.44] end at the same time uh I have no idea where that lanyard with the metal clip came from I don't think
[7563.44 → 7570.08] we have any plans to bring it back I'm sorry add to laptop and phone reviews minimum screen brightness
[7570.08 → 7574.72] absolutely that's a big thing for me too uh it's one of the things that bothers me about the eye
[7574.72 → 7579.52] and neo that the minimum screen brightness is so much higher than I'm comfortable with at night
[7579.52 → 7583.92] yeah that that's absolutely something we want to talk about I'm not really sure what this means
[7583.92 → 7590.00] Rajiv uh it says I think Linus mentioned that labs is going to be testing data from around the office
[7591.04 → 7598.80] will that be posted and updated as new cables come in with new products what okay yeah yeah so basically
[7598.80 → 7606.48] just um that the lab will have kind of this database of test data yes, yes it will and yes we
[7606.48 → 7611.76] will try to keep it updated um and that's something Luke's uh team will be working on yeah any phone
[7611.76 → 7616.48] recommendations not ready for a fold yet man it's tough right now isn't it honestly the easiest
[7616.48 → 7623.68] thing is just be like go buy an iPhone yeah which is like one plus sucks now the issues that Yvonne
[7623.68 → 7628.08] and my son have had with their one plus phones have been really frustrating my son's phone has been
[7628.08 → 7633.68] broken on Telus, and it's like a known issue caused by one plus for like six months and the workaround is
[7633.68 → 7640.00] super hacky and stupid and I had to do it, and it was like this is ridiculous um they're just not the same
[7640.00 → 7647.76] company that they were before Samsung is always fine um pixels are just kind of hit or miss it feels
[7647.76 → 7653.04] like you get a good one you'll be happy you don't get a good one then you're going to be kind of mad um
[7653.60 → 7659.20] like you've had terrible luck with pixels horrible luck I know people that have had better luck but
[7659.20 → 7666.72] yeah I've I've had I've had really, really bad luck my original pixels were fantastic my like actual OG
[7666.72 → 7673.60] pixel was perfect pixel 2 was perfect lasted for a long time and I've had I've had problems
[7673.60 → 7679.52] ever since not unheard of ones either like ones I've looked up online, and they are very common
[7680.80 → 7685.28] yeah I don't know what to tell you guys some recommendations for the s20 and s21 series fair
[7685.28 → 7692.96] enough like Sony phones still amazing no one talks about them says wizard yeah that's fair enough
[7692.96 → 7697.52] there are's and there's one crucial flaw that makes it so I can't use Sony phones though their
[7697.52 → 7702.48] their launcher doesn't allow you to switch the multitask and the back button i I'm a Samsung
[7702.48 → 7707.84] back button position guy just add the option Sony this is one of those just arrogance things it's like
[7707.84 → 7712.88] an apple moves like we have decided it shall be thusly and no, no you don't decide I decide where the
[7712.88 → 7719.68] button goes so um I just can't, I can't daily drive it I can't reach and I use the back button far more
[7719.68 → 7725.84] often than I use the task switcher button in desperate need of a new mouse pad any news on
[7725.84 → 7732.96] when the stealth one will drop uh no I do not know and I don't want to promise anything because
[7732.96 → 7738.00] shipping is a nightmare right now that AT&T has two gigs and five gig fibre available to the
[7738.00 → 7742.56] public can you do a home networking video for two gig and five gig internet so I'll tell you this you're
[7742.56 → 7747.44] not going to get two and a half gigabit per second or five gigabits per second connections to almost
[7747.44 → 7756.08] anything not in the real world the point of a wide pipe connection like that is multiple users
[7756.72 → 7764.00] it's not for you to put like the wire your whole house and all your machines for five gigabits and
[7764.00 → 7771.60] expect that you're going to like browse Facebook faster because the time to negotiate that connection
[7771.60 → 7776.00] to download the content is already going to be greater than the time it would take to download that
[7776.00 → 7781.60] content on a fibre gigabit connection let alone two and a half gig so I don't think you're going to see
[7781.60 → 7786.80] a meaningful difference in things like web browsing and like okay say for example you torrent
[7787.60 → 7793.04] by the time you're going to saturate a gigabit connection you have saturated your CPU because
[7793.04 → 7799.36] presumably you're using a VPN right like you're not going to touch this two and a half gig or five gig
[7800.16 → 7805.44] fibre connection with a single machine so really what you want is you want a router that has a two and a
[7805.44 → 7810.32] a half or five gig uplink which you could make for yourself with of sense I know Asus has some two
[7810.32 → 7815.28] and a half gig uplink stuff and then everything else will run on gigabit, and you'll just get full
[7815.28 → 7824.08] gigabit from multiple clients at a time that's that's the benefit uh ever thought of doing a semi truck
[7824.08 → 7831.92] gaming setup yes we have it's we'd love to do something cool like that, but it's just a gigantic project and
[7831.92 → 7838.88] we haven't uh yeah we just haven't made it go Luke are there any that you wanted to talk about
[7838.88 → 7844.40] or are you curating right now still curating oh my goodness I'm getting there but like whoa
[7845.52 → 7849.60] Linus you've stated before that when you start selling cables you will make sure they're legit
[7849.60 → 7855.52] do you plan on using third-party validation LTT labs would be a conflict of interest uh no we don't
[7855.52 → 7860.32] plan to use third-party validation we plan to validate them ourselves which yeah fine we're asking you
[7860.32 → 7864.96] guys to trust us that we can validate the cables but hopefully our documentation is good enough
[7864.96 → 7872.00] we're also just going to do it and do good you can do it yourself so brad I'm an aspiring YouTuber
[7872.00 → 7876.88] and want to avoid becoming an external drive hoarder I'd like to go the jellyfish killer route with to
[7876.88 → 7884.24] as physical backup I'm apple direct attach is nice uh big q is can storage a big question is can storage
[7884.24 → 7891.84] servers be powered off and on regularly when needed studio is an off-grid mini barn and I'm only home
[7891.84 → 7901.28] monthly yes you can power them off as long as you power them off correctly uh yes, yes you can that is a
[7901.28 → 7909.12] very, very edge case um it is sup Linus and Luke any chance you can speed run a video on the quantum
[7909.12 → 7914.00] magnetism used to read hard disks by next week so I don't have to look it up for my class week okay I didn't
[7914.00 → 7920.00] actually read the by next week part it could be an interesting tech video eventually yeah yeah
[7921.12 → 7926.24] not next week uh Daniel what do you think about google nerfing its legacy g suite and forcing them
[7926.24 → 7931.28] to get a paid subscription to keep their email with their own domain I think they backtracked on that
[7931.28 → 7937.28] so that was the right thing to do if they did that's where that's where I'm at on that we had to migrate
[7937.28 → 7943.12] from the free version ages ago because we exceeded the user count but leg used to be free g suite
[7943.84 → 7949.12] back in the day yep back in the day I think it was subbed 10 users that they allowed something like
[7949.12 → 7950.32] very generous actually
[7952.64 → 7957.76] uh sayeras13 says it's not really a conflict of interest that's just QA yes that that is correct
[7959.12 → 7963.68] um what are your thoughts on mass adoption of Windows 11 in its current state
[7963.68 → 7969.84] I only use it on one of my machines so far I've been like fine with it but I don't I don't use i
[7969.84 → 7977.04] don't use it that heavily it's my handheld it was nowhere even close to the crazy storm that was windows
[7977.04 → 7984.48] 10 um there there were no news articles this time around about uh i I remember specifically some lady
[7984.48 → 7988.24] had a forced upgrade she is like lost all her data and her computer got bricked or something
[7988.24 → 7992.56] uh that was like we talked about I think that was just a Windows 10 update too I don't even think
[7992.56 → 7999.12] that was going to Windows 10? Maybe uh it was it was rough like the Windows 10
[8000.40 → 8004.08] move over was rough my computer hasn't even bugged me about it at all
[8004.08 → 8012.00] um maybe because it knows it's not compatible but who knows apparently they haven't backtracked as far
[8012.00 → 8017.12] as Latinos on float plane, and you lose your play purchases because you can't transfer them unless you
[8017.12 → 8025.20] pay okay well I'm very sorry to hear that um oh they're letting you migrate to free accounts now
[8025.20 → 8030.32] that's good okay yeah there you go okay so they have backtracked on it uh plat says can you explain
[8030.32 → 8036.16] when it's okay to plug a up into a power strip and vice versa power strip into ups why do ups
[8036.16 → 8041.20] manufacturers get so warranty void about these configurations so first I think ups
[8041.20 → 8046.96] manufacturers get warranty void about things whenever they can oh yes that's if they is you
[8046.96 → 8053.76] have a warranty that protects the equipment attached to something you're looking for every opportunity
[8053.76 → 8060.24] to invalidate that warranty uh in theory there should be nothing that there should be nothing about
[8060.24 → 8067.44] a power strip with a surge protector on it that makes the power protection of the ups not function
[8067.44 → 8073.36] correctly, but the manufacturer would make the argument that well we only validate it with all
[8073.36 → 8077.76] the equipment directly attached so that's what we're covering and that's fair enough so what you
[8077.76 → 8084.08] should really do is you should just use a up that is rated for the capacity that you need it has the
[8084.08 → 8087.92] number of outlets you need, and you should plug directly into it according to the manufacturer's
[8087.92 → 8093.60] instructions because if you want the warranty then that's what you're going to have to do personally
[8093.60 → 8100.08] I plug things into my ups with a power strip but I do it knowing that I'm plugging in extremely low
[8100.08 → 8104.88] draw devices like a phone charger that I just didn't have enough outlets for and that I'm not overloading
[8104.88 → 8108.72] it that could be another concern the manufacturer might have is that you might be overloading it
[8108.72 → 8116.08] why are you plugging in so many devices right so that's where I'm at with that Josiah says have a
[8116.08 → 8120.72] great weekend guys I'm so glad this is back in stock oh man hoodie what's your favourite current
[8120.72 → 8126.96] show that's for either one of you I don't really watch shows current makes it a bit of a problem
[8127.60 → 8132.64] um adventure time was a big one for I think both of us yeah I loved adventure time
[8132.64 → 8138.72] was huge yeah uh I had never watched Bob's burgers until like a few months ago so I like binged
[8138.72 → 8144.56] 10 seasons of if it's like pretty funny cool yeah it's still current so that's that's neat I watch TV
[8144.56 → 8151.76] to not think so don't expect me to come at you with like oh yeah like black mirror really
[8151.76 → 8158.56] changed the way I think about you know the digital age and i just it's a break yeah my girlfriend
[8158.56 → 8164.40] watches TV I sit on the computer so it's on like kind of in the background bob's burgers has been on i
[8164.40 → 8169.68] I thought it was cool there was a recent one uh oh man what was it called it was a Canadian show too
[8170.48 → 8178.16] um let me see letter Kenny no letter Kenny's great, but that's not the one I was talking about
[8178.16 → 8182.48] letter Kenny's fantastic okay why don't you check that I'll do a couple more uh Luke I'm about your
[8182.48 → 8186.88] size and I need a new chair how do you like the chair you're sitting in so disclaimer they are an
[8186.88 → 8191.68] ongoing sponsor of the show, but that doesn't benefit Luke directly in any way so I'm going to let him talk
[8191.68 → 8198.16] about his chair here uh the show I was trying to think of was Kim's convenience um i I don't know
[8198.16 → 8203.68] it's its good it's fine I don't have very strong opinions about chairs um I'm actually
[8205.12 → 8212.16] not really a huge fan of them if I had to be completely honest um I have found you treated
[8212.16 → 8217.52] yourself to like a super fancy one and then didn't even like it or something I returned it yeah yeah um
[8217.52 → 8225.04] um which might not be surprising if you know how i you know modus operandi, but it was really
[8225.04 → 8228.80] expensive it was one of the most expensive purchases I had literally ever made sorry were you saying your
[8228.80 → 8234.96] cheapskate yeah yeah um it was really expensive, and it showed up and just like i just the whole
[8234.96 → 8239.28] process frustrated me it was literally one of the most expensive things I'd ever bought like I just said
[8239.28 → 8245.44] they left it out on the front lawn while I was at work um i I drove up and was like whoa there's a big
[8245.44 → 8251.28] box in the lawn I wonder what that is and then I was like wait my name's on wait this is the wow
[8251.28 → 8257.60] okay it was like I even noted that like I lived in the basement behind the house blah blah blah blah
[8257.60 → 8262.64] I didn't even know it was arriving that day like etc I take it out of the thing it like I don't know
[8262.64 → 8267.92] it just like creaked a lot it felt really cheap yeah I was just very not impressed for how much it cost
[8267.92 → 8276.88] um and ever since then I just haven't been super stoked jay has some steel case chair that he seems
[8276.88 → 8282.40] to be a fan of that I've been kind of interested in um because it's probably getting near time for
[8282.40 → 8288.32] me to get a new chair again but yeah I just haven't been impressed by I don't know if impressed is
[8288.32 → 8293.60] the right term like this is fine I have no issues with this chair I would have no problem saying like
[8293.60 → 8301.20] yeah if you want a gamers style chair this chair is totally solid um but I have never sat in a chair
[8301.20 → 8306.56] where I'm like wow i have to get this now you know I've never had that experience not yet
[8309.12 → 8315.44] Jeff v asks I've saved up enough for a steam deck 512 gig should I go for that one or keep saving and
[8315.44 → 8323.28] hope for an affordable 3070 I'm on a 1080 but I want multi-monitor 1440p goodness man oh that's tough
[8323.60 → 8330.24] comparison my take is man steam deck's going to be really cool it's going to change the way you game
[8331.12 → 8339.36] whereas a 3070 will upgrade your game your current game so that's kind of where I'm at on this yeah
[8339.36 → 8346.48] I'm a big proponent of these handheld pcs I think they're super cool I think they're a lot of fun but
[8346.48 → 8352.16] if you're the kind of person that's going to be like oh small screen don't like this then maybe you should
[8352.16 → 8356.56] stick with the full size setup right like how often are you away from a power plug you got to
[8356.56 → 8360.96] ask yourself that are you really going to use it because if you're going to use it man the steam deck
[8360.96 → 8370.56] is so cool um there 's's so Toby jay is asking how I got into development um I liked games I thought
[8370.56 → 8377.20] computer games were really fascinating i when I was really little how computers worked on the software
[8377.20 → 8386.24] side of things and the hardware side of things felt like magic to me um i kind of my my my one of the
[8386.24 → 8390.88] stories that I've told before is that my dad leaned in to tell my mom on their wedding day while they're
[8390.88 → 8396.48] up at the altar thing he's like I bought a computer this morning so we've always had computers in our
[8396.48 → 8402.80] lives but like i we were both in the age group where like I grew up pre-internet effectively and then
[8402.80 → 8407.76] the internet was connected to the house and that felt like magic too it was just a very interesting
[8407.76 → 8412.24] time because we were like kind of pre all of that stuff, and it was happening at the same time and
[8412.88 → 8417.60] my brain just going like how does this work led me to getting interested in development that was pretty
[8417.60 → 8424.72] much it that's a cool story bro thanks man I mean he literally asked I mean for no for real
[8424.72 → 8433.60] you're my bro and that was a cool story what Derek asks do you have any plans for a printer roundup
[8435.52 → 8443.44] that's going to be a negative i was going to say hopefully not you know what I'm not even making fun like
[8443.44 → 8450.64] it's actually kind of really valid useful like content like maybe that's something maybe that's
[8450.64 → 8457.84] something the labs could sort out or something for us, I don't know yeah like what's we like could we
[8457.84 → 8463.04] get it under the microscope check the printer quality like just literally print pages until
[8463.04 → 8468.08] it's empty like I don't know I'm sure there are ways we could benchmark them right like a harassment scale
[8468.08 → 8472.96] or something would be nice like how much does this printer bother you how much does it yell at you does
[8472.96 → 8478.56] it just works yeah often than the other ones does it complain about ink more often than the other
[8478.56 → 8484.80] ones can you print if it doesn't have cyan can you print a purely black page if it doesn't have cyan
[8485.92 → 8490.80] like those that would actually be pretty interesting to me yeah that would be very interesting uh JP
[8490.80 → 8497.20] papers says what GSM is the shirt material I don't even know what GSM is
[8500.32 → 8500.80] fabric
[8500.80 → 8509.60] uh oh weights fabric weights oh man is a metric measurement meaning grams per square meter I could
[8510.80 → 8516.16] I don't think you guys probably have that information somewhere I don't think Bridget's going to be
[8516.80 → 8523.20] on right now but I'll tell you what I will ask for it to be added to the product page I'm sure she knows
[8523.20 → 8534.64] uh I'm sure she I'm sure she does um can we add GSM fabric weight how costly is it to run float plane
[8534.64 → 8544.32] per month from a business perspective um costly it's costly but the float plane subscribers that um pay for
[8544.32 → 8552.80] float plane make up for it yeah so it is cash flow positive for the entire umbrella organization
[8552.80 → 8559.04] overall yeah so basically you guys are awesome you um thanks yeah you're you're awesome I think
[8559.04 → 8562.24] that's really the whole story bro it's pretty cool
[8565.52 → 8572.72] uh says hey Linus remember those few laptops way back when they had display inputs why don't we do
[8572.72 → 8581.52] see any of that any more there is one uh God did one uh God laptop display input it's super cool because
[8581.52 → 8586.72] you can basically yeah the pocket 3 KVM module demo so this is awesome this is awesome you're
[8586.72 → 8594.96] going to like this you can use the keyboard and trackpad and monitor to control like a server or something
[8595.68 → 8605.52] by using this USB uh input module thing yeah so you can control another device with it it's its
[8605.52 → 8610.00] amazing that's pretty cool yeah it's super useful if you're like a technician or something yeah i actually
[8610.00 → 8615.76] I grabbed it out of inventory to fix the arcade when my kids wanted to play with it because it's
[8615.76 → 8621.20] got a CRT, and so I couldn't, and it's constantly broken, and the bios wasn't displaying properly and
[8621.20 → 8625.36] I needed to like to change something I was like oh I don't want to haul a stupid no i have to get a monitor
[8625.36 → 8629.44] and you keep working no I'll go grab that thing because I had just done the short circuit on it
[8629.44 → 8633.76] it's super uncommon because most people will never use it that's why basically, and it costs money to
[8633.76 → 8638.88] implement Stefan merch messaged please do a sarcastic one and a half hour long printer review video
[8639.52 → 8644.96] April fools for a printer review that'd be kind of fun yeah I'd be into it is could be interesting
[8645.68 → 8652.00] um that's soon is that something framework laptop would be able to do with an add-on port
[8652.00 → 8661.68] not easily embedded display port is like not quite the same thing as probably a HDMI output that you
[8661.68 → 8666.16] would have into whatever your device is I think it would be non-trivial to deal with Gabriel said my
[8666.16 → 8674.32] first internet exposure was in 2018. wow, yeah wow how do you think early internet exposure changed
[8674.32 → 8680.48] your business and life back then the only way to get content was by piracy and then in brackets
[8680.48 → 8688.88] LCD videos on an USB stick oh okay this is probably like Cuba or like sneaker net yeah yeah yeah oh how do
[8688.88 → 8692.96] you think early internet exposure changed your business and your life i mean it completely changed
[8692.96 → 8699.68] my life i spent so much time building relationships with people on MSN messenger like camp buddies and
[8699.68 → 8705.92] and school friends and stuff like that like my first girlfriend we talked almost exclusively online
[8705.92 → 8711.44] because she lived quite far away, and it was long distance remember long distance phone yeah so i
[8711.44 → 8717.68] racked up like a multi-hundred dollar phone bill once talking to her, and it was like uh son this will
[8717.68 → 8727.76] never happen again oh no did you know that you were doing that okay i had no idea it was I knew it was long
[8727.76 → 8733.36] distance because i had to dial the thing but i didn't know it was like oh yeah really expensive i didn't
[8733.36 → 8738.64] realize how long i was talking you hang up no you hang up like that kind of thing right no every time
[8738.64 → 8752.40] you say that it cost me a dollar hang up so um other than to say that i wouldn't even recognize my life
[8752.40 → 8759.52] today without early internet exposure i don't know how to answer that question yeah oh I'm accidentally in
[8759.52 → 8765.44] the wrong section someone's asking if you have any recommendations for a NAS man i think we're
[8765.44 → 8771.92] working on something right now either Jake or someone on the team is working on a follow-up to
[8771.92 → 8777.68] Anthony's video which is converting your old desktop into a NAS which is also a valid approach, but we're
[8777.68 → 8782.72] going to try and do a brand new one so stay tuned is what I'm going to say because i don't want to just
[8782.72 → 8789.52] talk out of my butt um Rafael is uh saying on another note I've been a Linux gamer for almost a decade
[8789.52 → 8793.12] your videos on the project were amazing it would be great to revisit the topic in a few years to see
[8793.12 → 8801.20] how it has evolved um are you is there going to be any uh content looking at steam OS
[8801.20 → 8812.72] um like as a part of the as a part of the for sure okay yeah um perverted angel mark says EDP is
[8812.72 → 8816.96] very trivial saying that it's somebody who has soldered a DP plug to a laptop monitor yes fair
[8816.96 → 8824.08] enough if you're talking about DisplayPort but the reason that i said presumably HDMI is because that
[8824.08 → 8830.48] tends to be what we use on mobile devices like what are you going to output your switch
[8830.96 → 8836.96] via DisplayPort um you'd need an active converter which might need to be powered
[8836.96 → 8841.92] so that that was the reason i said it would be non-trivial you're right DisplayPort and embedded
[8841.92 → 8847.60] DisplayPort are easily intercompatible, but it was HDMI compatibility to this embedded DisplayPort
[8847.60 → 8852.56] display that has no ability to understand HDMI whatsoever that i was concerned about
[8852.56 → 8859.84] sorry i should have I should have clarified that better um thanks Linus and team interested in
[8859.84 → 8864.64] collaborating with an av integrator to showcase more professional av gear that could be kind of
[8864.64 → 8869.20] interesting, but it's like it's almost more it's almost becoming like a cribs' episode at that point
[8869.20 → 8875.20] i don't know what we could or would say about it garland said how would I go about getting
[8875.20 → 8879.92] my channel brought over to float plane there's a there's a creator application form he said we're
[8879.92 → 8886.88] very small but would like to join up um we generally recommend for very small creators uh that you
[8887.52 → 8894.64] actually don't put effort towards an external platform like full plane which is somewhat
[8894.64 → 8899.68] contradictory to things that we have said outside that which is where creators should diversify a lot
[8899.68 → 8904.56] a lot of creators should diversify a lot after they establish themselves in my opinion after they reach
[8904.56 → 8910.24] a certain critical mass yeah and up until that point you should be putting as much effort and as
[8910.24 → 8916.24] much focus as you possibly can every possible minute you can put forward towards it in growing that one
[8916.80 → 8923.04] thing so you can get there, and then you should focus on spreading out so once you hit uh a decent
[8923.04 → 8931.76] solid size um apply, and we'll get you on but up until then like you, i would not recommend joining
[8931.76 → 8935.04] uh you should focus on your YouTube or whatever else you're trying to grow
[8938.48 → 8946.72] um 77 inch OLED 85 inch LCD or 120-inch 4k projector for a living room with no light control well i can
[8946.72 → 8952.56] already tell you the projector ain't happening if you have no light control no light control, but you didn't
[8952.56 → 8965.92] say how much natural light you have um well you think about that I'm going to do another one Daniel
[8965.92 → 8972.96] said um thanks to it, i started working uh thanks to it, i started working in it as a technician
[8972.96 → 8978.56] hmm oh i think he meant Ltd uh what would you recommend expanding my scope of knowledge one thing
[8978.56 → 8984.56] that I've seen some people do is set up a home lab um yeah for sure so i would that would be that's if
[8984.56 → 8989.84] you can afford it i think that would be a perfect way to go if you have a lot of light in your
[8989.84 → 8997.04] living room i still think unless you're going like absolute latest gen OLED that 85 inch LCD man Samsung's
[8997.04 → 9003.84] uh what are they the quantum dot neo or whatever ones Eve can't remember the latest gen ones
[9003.84 → 9010.00] they're they're pretty darn impressive the black levels were really, really good there's also
[9010.00 → 9015.68] that technology from hi sense with the dual cell i think they call it where it's two LCD layers
[9015.68 → 9021.68] one of which is for colour and one of which is for basically light control uh we haven't done our
[9021.68 → 9028.08] review yet because we haven't got a unit of one yet but I'm i saw it at a trade show before like a couple
[9028.08 → 9032.64] years ago, and it was super exciting so that's another LCD option as well i don't know if it's available
[9033.84 → 9040.16] though I'm leaning towards 85 inch LCD if it's going in a living room though but man 77 inch
[9040.16 → 9047.28] OLED that's what i got in my living room and I'm super happy with that the g1 so good random question
[9047.28 → 9052.80] not, so random question have either of you solved a Rubik's Cube no yes is it better to buy a pre-built
[9052.80 → 9058.80] right now possibly, but we also have shown in a recent video that it could be terrible so you have to
[9058.80 → 9063.36] find the right one that's not a bad pre-built if you have to start replacing parts it doesn't work out
[9063.36 → 9069.84] it's not great thanks for the free sound check didn't think Canadians got so loud says j also
[9069.84 → 9075.20] some any chance for reviews of some touchscreen productivity monitors seems all the reviewers I'm
[9075.20 → 9080.88] following aren't even mentioning touch screens it's because on the desktop it's weird it's so much less
[9080.88 → 9084.88] convenient productivity monitor, but it's probably not very productive yeah than just keeping your
[9084.88 → 9088.72] hands on your keyboard and mouse so it's tough yeah
[9091.12 → 9096.00] Lenz can you talk about how YouTube is forcing its users to turn on watch history are they i have no
[9096.00 → 9103.04] idea i did not know that i haven't heard of that um if they are i guess boo earns yeah i don't know i
[9103.04 → 9106.08] i don't have uh i don't really have a hot take on that I've done enough hot takes today
[9109.52 → 9112.56] that's all that's all the hot takes we need in one wand show
[9115.52 → 9121.28] will there be another office vlog once you occupy the new office space uh we did do a tour of the
[9121.28 → 9128.64] new creator warehouse space uh on float plane that was an exclusive nick did it and then for the lab
[9128.64 → 9134.00] uh yes we will definitely be doing a lot sure you'll see a lot of the lab as we kid it out
[9136.00 → 9142.16] uh Aiden i love LTT are you ever going to make a video on a non-mac music workstation yes we are
[9142.16 → 9149.36] we are going to do music uh like DAW digital audio workstation benchmarks at some point
[9150.08 → 9154.80] we've been talking about it for a long time, but we will do it eventually maybe when the lab's up and
[9154.80 → 9158.56] running john you've mentioned potentially cutting back on your video cadence in the past is
[9158.56 → 9162.00] this because you feel it's getting harder to find interesting topics to talk about yeah it can be
[9162.00 → 9169.92] sometimes um, but also it's like a personal thing like I'm just kind of exhausted but i hope that
[9169.92 → 9175.60] bringing the engineers into the lab and having a lot of that um a lot of that sort of digging for
[9175.60 → 9179.76] stories done by just generating our own data is going to take a lot of the pressure off of it i think
[9179.76 → 9185.68] that we can keep up the cadence john says what do you think of retailers charging scalper prices on GPUs
[9185.68 → 9190.40] we've talked about this extensively in the past i mean I'd rather the manufacturer and the retailer
[9190.40 → 9195.04] take the money than a scalper so if that's the price the market will bear i guess it's like better
[9195.04 → 9201.68] than scalpers just buying them all yep but personally if i could build a perfect world i would make it so
[9201.68 → 9208.32] that the MSRP is what the end user ultimately pays so but i can't build that perfect world because nobody
[9208.32 → 9214.64] will sell me GPUs to use the verified actual gamer to make sure that real verified actual gamers get them so
[9214.64 → 9219.20] we could, it's been available this whole time yep that in mind when you think your company that you
[9219.20 → 9223.76] want to support is all cool and stuff uh Linus you should seriously take a look at arm server CPUs
[9223.76 → 9229.20] if you have a hookup or connection at gigabyte ask about the ultra max 198 slash 96 core bare bones
[9229.20 → 9237.84] and server systems company wants publicity can't say more oh okay the problem for us is that right now we
[9237.84 → 9243.60] don't have anyone qualified to test them so it's something we'd love to talk about and love to look
[9243.60 → 9250.00] at, and it's super cool, but we're just not there yet yeah what are your thoughts on elderly how to be
[9250.00 → 9254.40] for every common simple tasks as well as protection super basic and over explained to make it easier to
[9254.40 → 9263.44] understand asks Seth i was reading a merch message sorry uh tutorials aimed at the elderly for like
[9263.44 → 9271.92] basic tasks and like staying protected online what do you think um that could maybe be an interesting
[9271.92 → 9277.92] tech wiki thing uh because the goal of tech wiki has been education essentially this entire time
[9277.92 → 9283.04] i feel like a resource for things i feel like part of the problem is not that that information isn't out
[9283.04 → 9287.84] there but that those people do not seek it out or do not know how to filter the good information from
[9287.84 → 9293.28] the bad information i almost just feel like we would be just kind of just throwing more noodles at the
[9293.28 → 9299.28] wall like pot and all kind of hoping that it'll fix the problem i don't think we have the power to
[9299.28 → 9306.32] fix that problem though David says my friend's GPU died but i managed to get a 3080 ti for the win 3
[9306.32 → 9311.44] with a water block for under MSRP i don't know what case would be good for building a water loop
[9311.44 → 9318.08] size can be anything large but reasonable oh boy i will say this
[9320.24 → 9323.92] picking a case is going to be the easiest part of that journey
[9325.76 → 9331.04] head over like if you're doing a custom loop head over to the forum post under new builds I'm sure
[9331.04 → 9334.96] someone will be happy to help you out that's that's what I'm going to ask you to do because they can
[9334.96 → 9340.00] help you with not just the case but also making sure you pick a nice reliable pump you pick a reservoir
[9340.00 → 9344.32] that's going to fit above your pump so that it's going to be nice and easy to bleed the air bubbles
[9344.32 → 9350.00] out of it and stuff that can help make life easier for a novice builder you can also check out some of
[9350.00 → 9356.24] our water cooling builds as well um that fan text one that we use for everything crap what is it and
[9356.24 → 9363.36] through oh the 600 whatever it is yeah that one's uh that one's pretty good uh Christopher b what do you
[9363.36 → 9370.08] consider the best 2022 content creation laptop for the money i think that's the one um man it's a
[9370.08 → 9376.32] little it's a little early in 2022 to have the best pretty much anything alder lake is absolutely
[9376.32 → 9382.24] killer on mobile it looks like so um that's going to be pretty interesting this year i
[9382.80 → 9387.76] best content creation laptop you know what I'm afraid i simply cannot answer that question until i have an
[9387.76 → 9394.24] entire lab behind it what's the latest that's going to be my go-to a lot it's a pretty good one
[9394.24 → 9399.76] what's the latest on non-Facebook VR headsets uh super excited about LD labs i don't think there is a lot
[9399.76 → 9405.68] really it's been a fairly dead space yeah i mean hopefully because people are just quietly working
[9405.68 → 9412.32] but i got the pi max ones in for review the 5k and the 8k and the problem for me is that they seem to be
[9412.32 → 9422.24] designed for more like um an Asian bone structure, so my generous honker here interferes with the
[9422.24 → 9428.72] like the plastic casing yeah it's extremely uncomfortable yeah like i basically didn't
[9428.72 → 9434.00] use my VR setup for a month while i had it plugged in and then last night i was like this is stupid
[9434.00 → 9438.56] I'm just going to unplug it i like i tried to keep it there to make myself review it, but you just weren't
[9438.56 → 9446.00] doing it yeah but i just it's not a good sing okay when the product is so unusable that i would
[9446.00 → 9456.72] rather not do something i enjoy at all than use this one yeah yeah we're getting there actually jaw do
[9456.72 → 9461.76] you view a difference in blocking an ad versus blocking the various advertisers and analytics
[9461.76 → 9472.64] trackers in your browser so that's getting into way more sort of nuance than really i ever intended
[9472.64 → 9482.88] to dive into with this topic the point was the price is set by the seller your options are pay the price
[9482.88 → 9490.40] and consume the content don't pay the price and don't consume the content or privateering
[9491.76 → 9498.56] privateer, and you make the choice yeah uh Benjamin says do you think NVIDIA will continue to use fab
[9498.56 → 9502.72] capacity for 30 series and continue producing them while moving to a new node for 40 series to help
[9502.72 → 9507.52] with the card shortage absolutely NVIDIA is going to make as many cards as they can conceivably sell
[9507.52 → 9512.16] with that said i think they try to have pretty clean transitions between product generations at least in
[9512.16 → 9520.80] terms of how they name them um they may just try to make ah yeah they kind of yeah, but they roll out
[9520.80 → 9525.44] they roll out the top tier first while you can absolutely still buy last generation lower tier
[9525.44 → 9531.12] hard to say yeah yeah probably I'd say they're going to keep doing their volume um at the lower
[9531.12 → 9535.44] tier of the 30 series even once they've brought out the higher tier 40 series that'd be kind of
[9535.44 → 9541.28] their jam oh we'll do some uh good old fun rebranding and finally is the 6600 XT worth
[9541.28 → 9547.44] the 150 premium over the 6600 in your opinion that doesn't come down to opinion that comes down to
[9548.16 → 9555.04] find the games you want to play look at a review at the resolution you play at, and you decide do you
[9555.04 → 9563.04] need that extra bit of smoothness only you can answer that question car, and only you can end the wan show
[9563.04 → 9571.52] no only you can end the wan show no you no you no you have the thing no you hang up
[9572.56 → 9577.20] no you hang up no you hang up no you hang up no you hang up no you hang up did you ever do that
[9577.20 → 9579.28] oh yeah you had one of those yeah 100 yeah
[9579.28 → 9586.16] bye only you can end the land show
[9586.16 → 9607.36] we're still live by the way but the uh the flannel was a bit of a success
[9607.36 → 9615.44] i saw a lot of purchases for the flannel that were saying that they were buying it for their
[9615.44 → 9619.44] their girlfriend or their wife or whatever else i find that very interesting because it's just
[9620.08 → 9625.04] it's just the little black on black badge oh yeah we didn't even talk about how stealthy the branding
[9625.04 → 9631.04] is yeah yeah we're really we're really trying to like to get away from merch i love stuff like this
[9632.16 → 9636.24] love stuff like this have always loved stuff like this because if someone walks past you and they
[9636.24 → 9641.68] know then they know they're like hey, hey see i know that thing is there i can probably read it
[9641.68 → 9647.84] if i want to yeah but if not it just looks like a flannel with a little black badge yep really cool
[9652.64 → 9653.84] and we're dead
