[0.00 --> 7.68]  what is up ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic man show for you guys today first
[7.68 --> 14.64]  and foremost we are going to be finally revealing the head of ltd labs yeah yes we have actually
[14.64 --> 20.24]  done a test call it went really smoothly luke did such a good job of getting it done in an extremely
[20.24 --> 28.32]  expedient and timely manner in other news apple has launched their self-service repair program
[28.32 --> 33.76]  we're going to be talking about that what else we got uh nothing there is there is no other topics
[33.76 --> 40.00]  on the show at all uh actually no sega is removing old sonic games from the store and in a particularly
[40.00 --> 45.84]  fun uh turn of events apple i can't actually find this topic but apple has decided that if you don't
[45.84 --> 51.36]  update your app for a long enough period of time it's just going to be removed from the store even
[51.36 --> 58.08]  if it works fully with all new phones and all new devices it's gone get rid of it it's getting deleted
[58.32 --> 72.32]  let's get rid of this intro all right this is going to be good
[78.32 --> 81.84]  everyone we were going to update it like every couple weeks the show is brought to you today by
[81.84 --> 89.60]  squarespace xsplit xsplit's back yeah wow hey xsplit how you doing it's been a long time all right
[90.72 --> 97.28]  we are going to get into those topics but first sarah waited until well after work hours remember to
[97.28 --> 102.40]  lock your hours so she was sitting around hanging around getting paid overtime so it's not that bad
[102.40 --> 112.72]  i guess but she's here so that she and i can painstakingly handcraft that's right satin versions
[112.72 --> 118.96]  of the shirt the eggshell shirt okay so they're covered in they're covered in little bits of painters
[118.96 --> 126.08]  tape that is actually silk screened on so that is never coming off and then sarah um there's some
[126.08 --> 130.32]  little cue cards here can you explain what it is that we're doing with these because legitimately i actually
[130.32 --> 135.04]  forget so i think i'm i just need to do it while you explain to me what i'm doing okay so i actually
[135.04 --> 140.24]  never really got confirmation on what you're doing either but you said two hand shows ago that you were
[140.24 --> 145.84]  gonna write notes for these so i guess you're just writing notes for these notes um well i don't know
[145.84 --> 154.08]  how about how about you draw a picture and then i'll write a note is that a deal oh i think i just got
[154.08 --> 160.80]  marker all over you can i draw dinosaurs you could you could draw anything you want you should review
[160.80 --> 167.92]  the dinosaurs oh my god or you should like create a name and a history for the dinosaur okay so sarah
[167.92 --> 172.88]  you're up you're first luke do you want to get us started with uh with a shirt while sarah and i work
[172.88 --> 180.24]  yeah yeah for sure do you want me to dive into that apple one sure yeah i can sure talk about that um
[180.24 --> 184.96]  sarah are you putting tape on the shirts hold on i need drawings to label oh yeah and we're also
[184.96 --> 190.48]  going to add some some hand added little bits of actual painters tape it's going to be great it's
[190.48 --> 196.96]  going to be great uh yeah so the the apple topic if if you don't update your app for a long enough
[196.96 --> 202.48]  period of time apple wants to just remove it from the store um which is great because if an app works
[202.48 --> 212.40]  perfectly fine but you're just like not putting in the work to you know uh smooth the lines okay
[212.40 --> 217.60]  curve the corners and that's i mean this this is an extremely good point because this is my whole
[217.60 --> 225.36]  problem with the whole situation is like if the if the core idea of this program was hey your app has
[225.36 --> 230.96]  been throwing an excessive amount of errors like so they have this they have these statistics right they
[230.96 --> 236.72]  have like your app versus apps that compare to yours and then they have error rates and stuff so
[236.72 --> 241.20]  they can show you like are you relatively industry standard and in terms of your crash rates and error
[241.20 --> 245.20]  rates and stuff and and they'll have like sometimes you'll spike way above that it's like whoa you need
[245.20 --> 251.76]  to fix something if it was like okay your app hasn't been updated in two years and it's just throwing
[251.76 --> 255.76]  errors like crazy and it's crashing all the time and it's just a horrible mess we want to remove from
[255.76 --> 262.08]  the store unless you fix some things that is much more understandable to me um but there's genuinely
[262.08 --> 267.12]  a significant amount of applications that just like work fine and they're like hasn't been updated in a
[267.12 --> 275.36]  while so they want to remove it um i believe a genuinely would make it past them easy way to fix this
[275.36 --> 279.68]  by the way for any developers out there that are potentially listening is literally just a version
[279.68 --> 286.64]  bump i actually don't think you have to change anything um so i would suggest doing that it's
[286.64 --> 292.40]  unfortunate that you have to do that to like preserve things uh i personally have an app on
[292.40 --> 299.20]  the android store that i've had uh that hasn't received an update in i think like four years and
[299.20 --> 304.64]  it still works completely flawlessly and has worked with every single phone i've ever migrated it to
[304.64 --> 309.36]  um so i hope google doesn't go down the same route because i would like to keep using that app and i
[309.76 --> 314.72]  i don't think the company that made it like literally exists anymore so i don't think it will
[314.72 --> 320.24]  be getting an update um but yeah several developers took to twitter last saturday complaining that apple
[320.24 --> 325.76]  was taking their apps down from the store within 30 days because they had not updated in a significant
[325.76 --> 332.00]  amount of time uh apple demanded that the developers uh must submit an update within that 30 days
[332.00 --> 336.56]  in order to keep it on the store this is part of apple's what they're calling app improvement
[337.28 --> 342.48]  system which is a plan to remove abandoned and problematic apps from the app store which was
[342.48 --> 350.48]  launched in 2016. uh again the problem here is when they're not when they're just removing things that
[350.48 --> 355.60]  they are deeming abandoned not when they're removing things that are problematic because an app can
[355.60 --> 361.44]  genuinely especially certain like self-contained games and stuff can get to a point where they are
[361.44 --> 367.52]  completed they don't need further updates they don't have user generated content um they don't have
[368.40 --> 373.04]  future features they just work and it's fine um and i don't think developers should have to keep working
[373.04 --> 380.72]  on that um how many of these are we doing fix okay hold on uh you're on the last one then
[382.72 --> 391.76]  i love this side okay yes luke good job thanks uh it's worth pointing out that apps removed from the
[391.76 --> 397.76]  app store remain available uh for re-download it just won't be listed for sale or free download to
[397.76 --> 405.84]  new users um which is like cool i guess but not great uh this has also raised several concerns um
[405.84 --> 411.44]  which read like questions but are in fact open questions being asked by the community uh for indie
[411.44 --> 416.96]  developers uh so indie developers just appear to be disproportionately targeted that makes sense indie
[416.96 --> 422.88]  developers aren't going to be able to long-term maintain as many apps um and might make something
[422.88 --> 428.40]  that say it's a a purchase game not a subscription game and there's no microtransactions those games
[428.40 --> 434.64]  usually have a shorter tail on them um so if they make something it's great it sells really well for
[434.64 --> 438.88]  a year say and stop selling you want to keep it on the store because maybe you still get sales every
[438.88 --> 441.92]  once in a while you want people that own the game from the past to be able to download it more easily
[441.92 --> 448.40]  even if they switch accounts or something um and doesn't need an update but yeah it makes sense if an app is
[448.40 --> 455.44]  complete and works on modern devices what is uh the reason for an update well there isn't one uh that
[455.44 --> 461.12]  would be my answer to it does this kind of requirement incentivize developers to release rushed slash broken
[461.12 --> 468.32]  apps or respond slowly to bug reports to keep the possibilities for updates open honestly for that
[468.32 --> 474.24]  one no i don't think so uh because again i'm pretty sure you can get by with just a version bump and if
[474.24 --> 478.88]  you can't get by with a version bump you should be able to get by with like changing the color of a
[478.88 --> 485.44]  line and also version bumping um so i would go that route if people really want to keep their stuff up
[485.44 --> 491.68]  there um there is a discussion question from i believe the writer of this was was anthony young
[491.68 --> 497.52]  uh if games are art then does this effectively mean that apple is asking for art to be constantly
[497.52 --> 503.36]  updated whether it needs it or not yes that is specifically what they're doing i definitely agree with that
[503.36 --> 508.16]  uh how would we feel about this standard being applied to tv shows movies famous paintings
[508.16 --> 516.96]  sculptures etc so seinfeld removed if they don't you know add more jokes or remove bad jokes certain
[516.96 --> 521.12]  greek statues just have like progressively longer members over time i love it um
[523.60 --> 529.20]  well we really felt it needed arms this is this is varms.o
[529.20 --> 535.92]  um well the concept of an always changing piece of art itself is arguably art yeah i could think of
[535.92 --> 541.84]  situations like that that could be interesting think of art place okay hold on sabin 1001 says
[541.84 --> 544.40]  seinfeld doesn't have abandoned library dependencies in it
[546.40 --> 551.44]  seinfeld well yeah it's saying that you know if an app has abandoned library dependencies and that could
[551.44 --> 554.08]  actually be a legitimate problem and there could be a reason for apple to do this
[554.08 --> 559.28]  but that would like throw errors and have yeah that would fall under what i was talking about before
[559.28 --> 563.28]  yeah but i wasn't listening because i was busy okay okay okay okay drawing on dinosaur so what i was
[563.28 --> 569.60]  saying was is like i get it if it is like way above it's fine you don't have to catch me up i think
[569.60 --> 574.08]  it's stupid yeah cool nice all right agree now sarah are we ready for you to react to
[574.72 --> 580.48]  my changes or should we just let luke react to them yeah sarah did the sharpie and i added the pen
[580.48 --> 585.84]  so i will i will let you these are the little cards that are going to come with the random
[586.40 --> 593.76]  satin versions of the eggshell shirt one in each size um ready and go
[595.92 --> 600.88]  i like it i dig it yeah that's good that's an improvement on the overall theme that was going
[600.88 --> 610.08]  on there also definitely that's so far my favorite one actually yeah okay okay that's good not i still
[610.08 --> 613.36]  think the second one's my favorite one but that's these are all these are all better
[615.60 --> 617.04]  okay yeah i like that one too
[620.72 --> 623.36]  okay yeah these are good i think you might have got better over time
[624.40 --> 630.56]  also solid yeah yeah yeah all right sarah now you get to see how inappropriate i made your cards
[630.56 --> 637.04]  i think she'll like them okay wait is this like a live reaction or what yeah yeah yeah yeah these are by
[637.04 --> 641.52]  the way the best dinosaur drawings i've ever done uh you can you can describe them you can hold them
[641.52 --> 643.12]  up for the people so they can actually see
[646.64 --> 652.16]  should i do it uh sure yeah zoom in zoom in on sarah she's she's hosting the show now thank you dan
[652.16 --> 657.84]  it says sarah's show now wow so it says uh satin brain actual size
[659.52 --> 665.44]  this will come with a small t-shirt okay small t-shirt great oh so you get to decide who they go to yeah
[665.44 --> 668.72]  okay sarah has that power officially now yes okay
[672.72 --> 676.08]  this one is fantastic satin paint
[679.84 --> 681.36]  it took me a while to find the swear button
[683.52 --> 688.16]  no no i'm just slow usually this one is good i think this is my favorite drawing of all of them
[688.16 --> 695.84]  but here i added horns and uh i just put satan paint yeah i was gonna say just incredible
[695.84 --> 700.32]  i thought that was my weakest actually oh it's so cute though your drawing is very cute well the
[700.32 --> 702.00]  drawing is you i don't don't
[704.32 --> 705.68]  i'm just complimenting myself

[712.80 --> 716.32]  oh no
[720.72 --> 725.52]  this one is my favorite that one's really good what actually killed the dinosaurs yeah
[725.52 --> 727.28]  hit in the head by satin paint
[730.08 --> 732.24]  whoever gets these you're very lucky
[733.52 --> 738.00]  these are one of a kind masterpieces uh i forget what that if you will
[738.00 --> 744.80]  it's like the pterosaur but not actually oh the yeah the um uh the something sarapod

[773.60 --> 777.76]  yeah that's that's perfect and not in the actual script you use to sign things okay she
[777.76 --> 782.56]  she knows she knows all right let's get it framed thank you very much sarah for coming on the show with
[782.56 --> 787.44]  us and and participating in that and thank you for throwing together this t-shirt design in literally an hour and a half
[787.44 --> 795.28]  now that's productivity yeah good good work sarah let's go now every time it takes longer than an
[795.28 --> 799.60]  hour and a half i'm gonna be like well sarah did an hour and a half so that's the standard around here
[799.60 --> 806.72]  now all right why don't we jump into the big topic for the day which is of course the official
[806.72 --> 811.60]  announcement of the head of ltt labs can i get a drum roll please
[811.60 --> 817.44]  i'm the only one drum rolling okay all of you at home
[820.56 --> 825.20]  you guys are doing it i'm sure you're doing it okay here we go are we ready to welcome to the show
[825.20 --> 835.20]  is this actually going to work theoretically the one the only there he is gary key all right hey gary
[835.20 --> 841.52]  you want to hit me with some voice noises please i don't know if you're going to be able to hear him
[841.52 --> 848.40]  i don't think i can hear him we can't hear him okay so i'll tell you what why don't i give you guys
[848.40 --> 856.40]  a brief rundown of exactly who this guy is while we get his voice working gary is one of the people
[856.40 --> 864.72]  who taught me pretty much everything that i um ever learned about technology okay he's one of the
[865.20 --> 870.88]  if i recall correctly one of the original half a dozen or so writers at anontech yeah a lot for me
[870.88 --> 879.20]  too just to throw that in there yep so between between gary uh dr ian cutris anand um i want to
[879.20 --> 886.80]  say i don't remember his full name but rajah gill uh those guys were really in my opinion the team that
[887.44 --> 894.32]  had anontech at its peak and this was back in the early 2000s so uh gary has been on the
[894.32 --> 899.68]  manufacturer side i'll let him give you guys the full details there but he's been on the manufacturer
[899.68 --> 906.72]  side for probably about goodness gracious i guess it's been almost 10 years now um once we get his
[906.72 --> 912.80]  voice working so that i can actually hear him that'll be that'll be that'll be great but it should be
[912.80 --> 919.76]  working it should be working gary hit me no the stream might be able to hear it can they hear him we
[919.76 --> 927.44]  we can't hear it i can't see gary you can't see him oh no guys oh actually his frame isn't letting
[927.44 --> 933.68]  up so the system is not hearing him okay cool so i'm gonna keep stalling yeah keep going good luck
[934.64 --> 941.44]  trying to think of what categories gary handled back in the day i know that he handled motherboards
[941.44 --> 948.40]  uh i don't know what else but uh in his time at asus i can tell you guys that he's made his way up
[948.40 --> 954.32]  to if i recall correct you know what i'm not gonna say is what his title was before uh his he left
[954.32 --> 958.56]  because if i get it wrong then it's going to be really really awkward embarrassing when he when he pops
[958.56 --> 965.52]  on stream says no they can't hear i mean at this point should i just call him and then just to hold
[965.52 --> 974.48]  them up to the mic honestly like oh i just saw i i'm seeing audio yay there we go hey how you doing gary
[978.64 --> 985.52]  i am great so we finally get to announce it all right i did i do okay did i kind of cover what the
[985.52 --> 989.28]  heck it is that you you did at some point oh they still can't hear him
[989.28 --> 997.04]  oh fantastic well then we'll just get a recap but they can't they still can't hear you oh no
[997.04 --> 1002.64]  why does this dream not have him dan they're supposed to yeah no there's nothing gary say something again
[1005.44 --> 1011.52]  i see it i literally is that what i see it in obs yeah they should be able to hear it i'm so confused
[1012.24 --> 1018.56]  is it oh he's super quiet he's super quiet turn him up crank him okay no no no you leave it
[1018.56 --> 1022.24]  leave it on your side yeah gary don't touch anything we'll get dan to crank you up okay
[1022.88 --> 1023.44]  fantastic
[1026.40 --> 1032.96]  okay okay don't you just love it when a plan comes together yeah i do we had a whole test
[1032.96 --> 1037.60]  call but i was doing other stuff is that better i go louder okay go go gary
[1041.28 --> 1047.20]  okay that those levels look good yep okay all right let's hope that they can hear you so why
[1047.20 --> 1052.64]  don't you start with giving us uh giving us a little rundown of what what did you used to do at
[1052.64 --> 1062.48]  anontech i was the uh no they cannot hear him they cannot hear you they say nothing how is that even
[1062.48 --> 1069.44]  possible i am watching the levels right now it shouldn't be possible no you can hear now it's good
[1069.44 --> 1073.92]  oh thank goodness okay gary run us through what you used to do at an on tech and when did you leave i don't
[1073.92 --> 1084.80]  even remember all the details yeah i started there in 2005 uh and left in 2009 and was a senior editor
[1085.84 --> 1096.72]  primarily on motherboards but then dabbled in ssds at the beginning of that video cards and mice and
[1096.72 --> 1105.20]  yeah whatever else anon had now tell me something you went over to the manufacturing side and what
[1105.20 --> 1111.52]  were the what were the factors that caused that to happen because i mean one of the things i talked
[1111.52 --> 1117.44]  about when we first announced the lab was that we were trying to we were trying to stop a perceived
[1117.44 --> 1125.36]  trend in in my eyes of experienced and knowledgeable media personalities heading over to the manufacturing
[1125.36 --> 1132.00]  side when and and becoming essentially effectively disappearing tainted yeah disappeared or tainted
[1132.00 --> 1136.64]  i mean yeah anand is disappeared yeah and then i don't want to name any names but i think there are
[1136.64 --> 1140.40]  some that have gone over to the other side that honestly you just kind of can't take everything
[1140.40 --> 1145.52]  they're saying seriously anymore um so what were the factors that pushed you over to the manufacturer side
[1147.12 --> 1152.24]  i had actually spent so much time uh working with with the various manufacturers
[1152.24 --> 1165.36]  uh almost doing consulting work and testing and um yeah i decided uh if that was the majority of my job
[1165.36 --> 1173.76]  you know why not do it at the manufacturer do you feel like you ended up actually making so wait so your
[1173.76 --> 1180.16]  first gig at uh did you go straight to asus i thought so yes i went straight to asus
[1180.16 --> 1190.72]  okay so then your first gig with them was not marketing then uh no i i i've been in marketing the entire
[1190.72 --> 1200.56]  time oh interesting so i started out in technical marketing uh went to uh pr um and then product
[1200.56 --> 1208.88]  marketing and channel um yeah for the last three years i've been in charge of uh marketing for north america
[1210.16 --> 1214.40]  got it got it got it got it got it yeah that makes sense that you were in technical marketing at the
[1214.40 --> 1218.16]  beginning because i was looking at it going yeah you've been in more of like a strategic like a pr
[1218.16 --> 1223.68]  sort of marketing role as opposed to you know actually being the contact that i get on the phone
[1223.68 --> 1227.60]  with when some voltage won't adjust in the bios or whatever it's been a lot of years since then
[1228.48 --> 1232.40]  yes there's been a lot of years still a lot of phone calls though
[1232.40 --> 1242.00]  so i gotta tell you something um when when i made that video talking about the lab there was
[1242.00 --> 1248.08]  actually only one name that i really had in mind to run it and it was you which actually no now that
[1248.08 --> 1252.64]  i think of it i think i did tell you that which really didn't help my negotiating uh position when i
[1253.20 --> 1258.72]  when we were trying to figure this out um but i i want you to talk to the people like how exciting is
[1258.72 --> 1268.80]  it to come back to the media side and start covering things other than just one brand oh no it it it
[1268.80 --> 1280.64]  it's really hard for me to explain um it's it's very exciting i i'm so pumped uh about doing this uh it's
[1280.64 --> 1292.80]  it's it it's a brilliant opportunity uh to expand what we're doing um on on the manufacturer side but
[1292.80 --> 1298.56]  back on the media side uh there there's so many different products uh that i've wanted to get into
[1299.36 --> 1308.40]  uh as far as testing uh also uh testing uh competing products right um that that that was part of our job
[1308.40 --> 1317.92]  uh in technical marketing um but yeah i i'm really looking forward to this uh being able to truly take
[1317.92 --> 1329.36]  a deep dive uh into what makes the product tick uh and why and then why that's important uh for the consumer so
[1330.72 --> 1337.04]  now you know that um there's gonna be a lot of pressure to execute here right i mean one of the things
[1337.04 --> 1345.28]  with labs is that it's you know i think we've done a great job over the last 12 years uh here at linus
[1345.28 --> 1352.16]  media group of getting lighting sparks you know we run around we light fires and then we kind of like
[1352.16 --> 1357.28]  run away if people want to go deeper a lot of the time our answer is well we can point you to more
[1357.28 --> 1362.56]  technical resources for that but we got to make more videos but the the reality of it is with the breadth
[1362.56 --> 1370.48]  of products that we cover we can't go that deep in any particular category and your job is essentially
[1370.48 --> 1379.28]  to fix that um and there's something that i kind of i kind of popped this on gary uh about i guess two
[1379.28 --> 1385.84]  three hours ago um he didn't know this but remember lab one that i showed all of you guys and including
[1385.84 --> 1392.56]  gary because obviously you saw the video man this guy took so long to apply i had to send so many
[1392.56 --> 1398.72]  texts i was like hey i know you saw that video because i know you watch the videos is your resume
[1400.16 --> 1405.44]  he's like i'll get it to you i'll get it to you i'll get it to you i haven't made one in a long time okay
[1405.44 --> 1418.16]  so lab one is officially dead it's out it's gone uh do you know this yet i well we talked about it
[1418.16 --> 1422.96]  being a potential thing i didn't know it was actually happening um where's that coming from
[1424.16 --> 1431.52]  stop okay lab one is done it's out so what i think we're going to do with that is we're going to turn it
[1431.52 --> 1438.56]  into like uh linked media or something like that so tech linked starts doing more talk links more talk
[1438.56 --> 1443.92]  or more tech longer so we expand the programming for tech links maybe we add like game linked on
[1443.92 --> 1448.16]  tuesdays and thursdays or something like that so we're publishing five days a week we build some
[1448.16 --> 1452.96]  awesome sets in there for whether it's tech longer or whether it's talk links so that we don't have to
[1452.96 --> 1457.76]  move things around all the time which is one of the big reasons that we don't do those longer form
[1457.76 --> 1462.80]  discussion formats uh we add a couple of people maybe on the research side maybe on the writing
[1462.80 --> 1468.56]  side uh have a dedicated editor slash shooter over there so we turn that into kind of a satellite studio
[1468.56 --> 1474.88]  it's no longer going to be a lab uh we have a new space lined up that is going to be approximately
[1474.88 --> 1483.60]  10 times the size and that should give you some idea of what my expectations are in terms of building
[1483.60 --> 1489.04]  up the lab so the way that i framed this for gary a couple of hours ago is that i never want to hear
[1489.68 --> 1498.56]  well linus we could test this if only we had amount of space x or facility y because every time i hear
[1498.56 --> 1505.76]  that i'm gonna say then why haven't you built it yet or like is it on order or whatever so gary are you
[1505.76 --> 1513.76]  ready i'm ready i'm ready i'm really ready i'm sweating right now but i'm ready
[1517.60 --> 1522.24]  man it's been so long since you've been public facing you're always so shy when i tried to get
[1522.24 --> 1530.96]  you in the videos and stuff i know well i kind of suck on video so i'm much better man you'll get used
[1530.96 --> 1536.16]  to it you'll get used to it you'll get used to it this is going to be so much fun so we've actually
[1536.16 --> 1540.88]  got one of your new charges uh gary's been helping us out with the hiring process for some
[1540.88 --> 1546.08]  of our labs candidates as we've made our way even though we didn't have an official even employment
[1546.08 --> 1551.28]  agreement signed with them because he took forever on that too uh gary's been helping us with hiring
[1551.28 --> 1555.44]  making sure that we're going through people's credentials and making sure we're building out a
[1555.44 --> 1560.40]  super qualified team we've got someone really exciting who's starting on i forget if it's monday
[1560.40 --> 1566.64]  or tuesday and then what's your first day gary uh it's in a couple weeks yeah
[1569.04 --> 1573.52]  freaking awesome now i gotta know now now we're past the stuff that gary and i have talked about
[1573.52 --> 1581.68]  already what are you going to do on your first day my first day geez um very good question a little cry
[1581.68 --> 1592.80]  no i'll probably do donuts in the parking lot um wouldn't even surprise me so okay is it a secret
[1592.80 --> 1597.44]  the other media vertical that you have participated in in the past because my understanding is you kind
[1597.44 --> 1603.04]  of have done some ghost writing but i don't know if you've actually disclosed for what and about what
[1603.04 --> 1608.24]  and don't feel pressure to disclose it if you don't want to that's fine no no we'll we'll keep that secret
[1608.24 --> 1616.88]  we're gonna keep that secret okay well i'll say this much gary tech is not gary's only passion okay
[1616.88 --> 1623.28]  right and that could actually be a really good thing for uh linus media group moving forward as well
[1623.28 --> 1629.36]  so man you're gonna have a lot of stuff to do yeah how big do you imagine you really how big is your team
[1629.36 --> 1633.52]  going to be after 18 months like these are important questions have you given this any thought
[1633.52 --> 1641.60]  could you repeat that i'm sorry how big is your team going to be after 18 months
[1642.56 --> 1645.28]  yeah i thought that's what you asked uh
[1647.20 --> 1657.12]  i'm i'm envisioning uh probably 9 to 11. 9 to 11. okay my expectation is somewhere in the neighborhood
[1657.12 --> 1666.24]  of like 14 to 18 so we're sort of talking the same language but the thing is that man as we get deeper
[1666.24 --> 1672.32]  and deeper into all these all these different verticals i'm realizing that you know even something
[1672.32 --> 1679.92]  like okay here's what we were working on here's the reason that the show was late today uh i wanted to mod
[1679.92 --> 1690.88]  my old game gear to put a better screen on it and it turns out that this is a king rabbit hole there
[1690.88 --> 1697.28]  are so many different revisions of the game gear hardware over the years there are so many different
[1697.28 --> 1703.60]  board layouts for the different revisions there are so many interesting little quirks that you might
[1703.60 --> 1709.60]  discover so even though we found out that we had what what what's this one this is a single uh a
[1709.60 --> 1717.68]  single soc whatever dual asic oh no no the original one this one's single asic isn't it oh yeah the va
[1717.68 --> 1723.60]  yeah so we have a yeah so this is uh this is a va5 i thought i have no idea what part of that yeah it
[1723.60 --> 1728.96]  doesn't matter okay so this is a va5 okay it's got a single asic which turned which means that you can't
[1728.96 --> 1734.16]  replace the screen unless oh wait there was a new screen kit that was released six days ago or
[1734.16 --> 1739.44]  something like that oh but even if you get a new screen it actually in sports like 500 colors so what
[1739.44 --> 1747.52]  you really want is an a1 or a2 or something like that so this is a dual asic but then we found out
[1747.52 --> 1752.72]  based on our serial number we think that this may actually be one of the first like several hundred off
[1752.72 --> 1758.88]  the line of the particular factory that made this unit okay also whoever sold it to us appears
[1758.88 --> 1764.08]  to have done at least some mods unless some of the early ones shipped with glass screen covers
[1764.08 --> 1770.00]  because you can see those are clearly oh yeah not the same material at all um there's different
[1770.00 --> 1774.56]  audio boards you can put in different charging boards you can put in to convert it to lithium-ion
[1774.56 --> 1780.48]  and i'm sitting here going like if we don't have if we don't have a couple of dedicated electronics
[1780.48 --> 1787.52]  modding people and someone a person who's just dedicated to retro console content we're not going
[1787.52 --> 1795.20]  to be able to keep up because that's the vision for the labs at the end of the day is that the tide
[1795.20 --> 1801.68]  has been the tide's been turning for quite some time now on youtube you're no longer able to just
[1801.68 --> 1807.92]  be a generalist a jack of all trades a master of none because there's going to be someone or someone's
[1808.48 --> 1813.52]  out there in every single vertical that is going to do it five times better than you because that's
[1813.52 --> 1821.44]  all that they do they eat sleep and breathe nothing but that particular category day in day out so i
[1821.44 --> 1829.28]  think a perfect example of someone like that is um addy from epos vox okay looks at pretty much nothing
[1829.28 --> 1837.04]  but streaming optimization and coding capture all that kind of microphones really focused on streaming
[1837.04 --> 1844.72]  and so unless we have people who just are completely immersed in these categories or in these spaces
[1845.44 --> 1850.24]  i just think we're going to fade into irrelevance and that's what the lab is for so essentially the
[1850.24 --> 1857.52]  way that i see the lab is that it's going to be kind of like tripling to quadrupling our writing staff
[1857.52 --> 1865.76]  without making necessarily more content yeah but also we'll probably do more content yeah vincent from
[1865.76 --> 1871.60]  hgtb test is another great example chats chats pointing out some other just outstanding examples
[1871.60 --> 1876.56]  of people who are super focused on a particular vertical and to be clear the idea is not to compete
[1876.56 --> 1882.16]  these people out of business because the way that i see it the the the rising water is going to lift all
[1882.16 --> 1887.12]  ships however that however that saying goes because the more we educate people about technology the more
[1887.12 --> 1892.80]  appetite there's going to be for deeper content deeper analysis and of course differing opinions
[1892.80 --> 1897.12]  i mean even back in the day when you were doing written there was a non-tech and tom's hardware and
[1897.12 --> 1902.40]  hard ocp and pc per and tech report and all these respected publications and you didn't read a review
[1902.40 --> 1908.08]  from just one we just need to make sure that we are part of that conversation so can you do it
[1909.36 --> 1912.40]  yes i can that would be a hilarious time to say no
[1914.48 --> 1915.04]  just saying
[1917.12 --> 1921.76]  honestly on on second review yeah i think maybe not
[1921.76 --> 1923.28]  no i think i'll get any fun on that plane
[1923.28 --> 1926.24]  yeah
[1930.72 --> 1936.24]  yeah so um so i'm excited i mean one of the one of the great things that i like so much about bringing
[1936.24 --> 1942.40]  gary in is he doesn't only have the technical expertise and really the the hunger to to learn
[1942.40 --> 1948.64]  more and get deeper into this stuff but he has the people management expertise because
[1949.20 --> 1955.12]  the reality of it is that i need to be focused on making the content entertaining on keeping linus
[1955.12 --> 1962.80]  media group running like a well-oiled machine so um he wasn't cheap gary you weren't cheap um so he
[1962.80 --> 1969.52]  wasn't cheap but the idea is that gary's gonna come in and basically i don't have to think about it
[1969.52 --> 1976.56]  when i get numbers or when i get a report from labs or if alex is sitting on set uh for short circuit
[1976.56 --> 1984.32]  working on an unboxing of some laptop whatever is on that page is bulletproof can we do it yeah
[1984.32 --> 1989.04]  our goal is not to be questioned
[1990.96 --> 1991.76]  simple as that
[1994.80 --> 2006.56]  well i'm excited yeah i am too in fact i need to uh i need to get to uh the airport so i can find a place
[2006.56 --> 2015.44]  so yeah yeah so how's that vancouver housing market treating you oh just like it is in san jose
[2017.36 --> 2018.80]  it's uh a bit rough
[2022.00 --> 2028.48]  all right well hey you know what thank you very much for joining us on the show i'm i'm i'm super
[2028.48 --> 2032.64]  glad that we were able to bring you on sorry guys there's a really long delay on the call with gary so
[2032.64 --> 2037.04]  maybe maybe we'll have him come in person once he's here and we'll have a chat maybe after the
[2037.04 --> 2042.80]  first month or so we can talk about what's going well what's going not as well what positions we want
[2042.80 --> 2049.76]  to hire what we can do to make it um to make this whole thing go better i mean really the reality of
[2049.76 --> 2055.52]  it is it shouldn't come down to budget um as long as we're finding the right people we want to make sure
[2055.52 --> 2061.84]  that we are attracting the right talent so guys for those out there who know i know a lot of you no
[2061.84 --> 2066.80]  offense gary are gonna have no idea who gary is because he has spent the last 10 years behind the
[2066.80 --> 2075.28]  scenes yeah um you know he's not a limelight seeker and you know what that's cool but for the people in
[2075.28 --> 2082.48]  the know i think that this sends a message that we are serious about this and if you weren't sure if we
[2082.48 --> 2087.36]  were serious about this and you've held off on applying then it's time to get your resume over here
[2087.36 --> 2093.68]  because whether it's displays whether it's gpus cpus whether it's consumer electronics
[2095.52 --> 2102.48]  we have to do and we're gonna need a lot of experts and if you feel like you can help us take things to
[2102.48 --> 2109.84]  the next level then we really need your paperwork all right thanks gary drive safe thank you take care
[2109.84 --> 2119.28]  see you later all right bye bye bye just as a note for troubleshooting in the future apparently
[2119.28 --> 2126.16]  there was no delay for the stream it was just for our monitoring oh got it interesting yeah okay cool
[2128.32 --> 2134.72]  all right okay back to your regularly scheduled programming yeah are we supposed to do any ltt store
[2134.72 --> 2142.08]  stuff oh whoa no way okay yeah this is big news for ltt store oh uh yeah let's get my let's get my screen
[2142.08 --> 2151.52]  up here it's finally back for over a year we have not been able to get we have not been able to get
[2151.52 --> 2159.76]  heathered aqua blanks from american apparel in the volumes that we need across all sizing that we need
[2159.76 --> 2164.64]  for the constellations t-shirt remember the constellation shirt well guess what ladies and
[2164.64 --> 2172.80]  gentlemen it is finally freaking back and not only is it back but it is back in our own blanks so these
[2172.80 --> 2178.32]  are the new ltt store creator warehouse whatever you want to call them these are our blanks these are the
[2178.32 --> 2184.48]  same ones that went out on the privateer shirt i don't actually know if they went out on the eggshell
[2184.48 --> 2188.72]  one i'm not sure there's still a little bit of overlap on black shirts in terms of
[2189.36 --> 2194.72]  what's american apparel and what's the new ones but constellations will absolutely be new and check
[2194.72 --> 2200.72]  this out there's a long sleeve that's actually so cool i like the long sleeves i've always liked long
[2200.72 --> 2205.44]  sleeve shirts but also constellations in long sleeve just kind of makes sense to me mm-hmm
[2206.88 --> 2214.48]  we are working on a constellations v2 but because constellations v1 has been in such demand and we've had
[2214.48 --> 2220.48]  people message us so many times hey that shirt i love that shirt why can't i buy that shirt we are
[2220.48 --> 2225.44]  doing one more run of constellations one they're going to take about two to three weeks to print
[2226.16 --> 2229.92]  all of these are going to be print to order and your entire order will be shipped together so if you
[2229.92 --> 2233.84]  order more items than just the shirt it's all going to ship at once when the shirt is ready
[2233.84 --> 2240.00]  we never offered constellations in a long sleeve and the long sleeve is also our own long sleeve this is
[2240.00 --> 2246.72]  going to be the first availability of our blank long sleeves and guys they're freaking awesome so
[2246.72 --> 2252.24]  here's the here's the old american apparel version so you can see how it looks actually printed i doubt
[2252.24 --> 2256.08]  the logo on the back will be orange we don't really do that anymore i suspect the logo will be some other
[2256.08 --> 2260.72]  color maybe white or something like that but don't quote me on that don't quote me on that so constellations
[2260.72 --> 2265.52]  is this design if you guys uh if you guys want to get your hands on an ltd long sleeve this is going to
[2265.52 --> 2270.64]  be the first possible availability of it all right let's get on with the show shall we what do you
[2270.64 --> 2274.24]  want to talk about next team viewer called me again that's what i want to talk about do you want to hear
[2274.24 --> 2281.60]  my voicemail oh you didn't pick up of course i'm not picking up let's go those freaking guys yeah
[2281.60 --> 2282.40]  all right hold on
[2287.60 --> 2295.04]  all right y'all ready y'all ready for this sent by seven two oh hold on okay let's get that number out of
[2295.04 --> 2303.20]  here let's uh we're not gonna okay tyler from your software uh check out to you here wanted to see
[2303.20 --> 2307.76]  what you can connect and speak briefly in regards to the older version of the license that your company
[2307.76 --> 2313.04]  is running with us uh you can give me a call back here at my direct line it's going to be seven two
[2313.04 --> 2322.80]  seven okay okay that's enough for your direct line literally literally he did it again out of nowhere
[2322.80 --> 2326.08]  could you even hear that i bet you guys couldn't even hear that they're basically just like yeah
[2326.08 --> 2332.08]  hi i'm calling from team viewer and i'd like to talk to you about the older version of the software
[2332.08 --> 2336.40]  that your company is running if you could give me a call back my directly i don't
[2337.52 --> 2344.56]  f**king direct line is how many times do i have to tell you guys not to call me you've already said you
[2344.56 --> 2352.32]  took me off the list once again here we are team viewer with you guys either lying about taking me off the
[2352.32 --> 2360.24]  list or you're lying about the existence of a list at all and you would think given that last time you
[2360.24 --> 2366.88]  guys called me and i complained about it so many people shared my frustration and were so s**t
[2368.08 --> 2373.84]  that the video got a million freaking views you would think after that experience you guys would go oh
[2373.84 --> 2383.04]  gee um maybe we shouldn't call linus anymore um i'm a really smart executive i'm a smart marketing
[2383.04 --> 2391.68]  executive and i think that this might be a good idea well listen i know the guy sounds like that because
[2391.68 --> 2396.48]  he works at team viewer but you should listen to him anyway because that's really smart you guys need
[2396.48 --> 2402.32]  to actually stop emailing me stop calling me i spent i forget how much it was so if the number's
[2402.32 --> 2408.80]  not right i don't care but i spent thousands of dollars it's like five thousand dollars on a
[2408.80 --> 2414.08]  perpetual license of team viewer 12. and for those of you saying i should switch to some other software
[2414.08 --> 2421.12]  i don't want to i paid for this software it actually works perfectly for what i need to do
[2421.12 --> 2430.32]  all i need to happen is for team viewer to never call me again not even once
[2433.04 --> 2439.20]  that was it that's all i have to say you should just like reverse chain them like what's the reverse
[2439.20 --> 2446.48]  chain task someone at work with wasting as much of their time as possible so just like
[2446.48 --> 2451.84]  rebounce them over and over again like like generate a bunch of like fake out email addresses
[2451.84 --> 2458.00]  or something because you can you can generate email addresses in in uh gmail that you don't pay for
[2458.88 --> 2463.76]  oh i guess you can like add pluses and stuff um so it can still be our domain but you don't pay for
[2463.76 --> 2467.28]  it because they're just like forwarding addresses or whatever no i know how that works like aliases yeah
[2467.28 --> 2472.16]  yeah yeah so so you just like bounce them from person to person to person to person to person to person
[2472.16 --> 2479.60]  and never actually have there be an end just have them chase this this non-existent carrot
[2481.36 --> 2488.56]  oh man you want to waste my time we'll we'll waste yours let's go oh it's just it's just more
[2488.56 --> 2493.60]  it's just more work than it's worth for me i just want them to not no i know but i just i bought
[2493.60 --> 2501.60]  your product and i just want you to leave me alone yeah um man anthony's anthony's discussion question
[2501.60 --> 2506.08]  is this isn't really a question but i literally am dealing with this with telus right now they keep
[2506.08 --> 2513.44]  messaging me every wednesday without fail to try to get me to install norton i said stop multiple times
[2513.44 --> 2521.04]  i got the 10th one this week i am angry by the way i use arch i uh thank you anthony for that i'm
[2521.04 --> 2525.84]  actually stunned that that's happening i i read that before the show and was like what like why
[2525.84 --> 2530.64]  why is telus calling them to install norton telus is one of those companies where now that they have
[2530.64 --> 2538.64]  pure fiber i love the service absolutely love the product their uptime is genuinely extremely strong
[2538.64 --> 2545.36]  as well but to like to give them credit over the years my experience is dealing with telus from like
[2545.36 --> 2551.84]  an administrative standpoint going all the way back to high school like we are talking how old am i now
[2551.84 --> 2557.20]  yeah we're talking 20 years i have a 20-year history with them i bet you this is true for
[2557.20 --> 2564.00]  anyone who's ever worked with like a major isp shaw has been better by and large from my experience
[2564.00 --> 2572.32]  shaw is super anti super like monopolistic and anti-competition in their business practices sure
[2572.32 --> 2577.68]  they are oh shaw's okay aggressively shaw's got some really stupid issues did you know you have to call
[2577.68 --> 2582.56]  shaw to put your modem in or to put your router thing in bridge mode you know you know that that
[2582.56 --> 2588.32]  router supports putting it in bridge mode just through accessing it over the local ip but shaw
[2588.32 --> 2593.60]  specifically blocks that functionality so it doesn't work so you must call them or at least they did the
[2593.60 --> 2598.00]  last time i used them i haven't touched a shaw internet product since telus pure fiber came to my
[2598.00 --> 2603.28]  neighborhood i'm also going to put an allegedly in front of this because like i don't i haven't i don't
[2603.28 --> 2609.52]  know but i've heard from a very wide range of people so i believe it to be true that shaw actively
[2609.52 --> 2615.84]  like legislatively blocks telus from putting conduit in new buildings oh i i would believe that well
[2615.84 --> 2620.40]  hold on a second don't you have some first-hand experience with that why don't you just tell that
[2620.40 --> 2624.56]  story i think that that's not allegedly that's a thing that happened to you that happened in that
[2624.56 --> 2630.64]  building as far as the developer told me sure then just say that but i don't tell the story so so as
[2630.64 --> 2637.44]  far as my understanding goes from more than one developer telling me this um shaw is seen as like
[2637.44 --> 2645.36]  a local isp and telus isn't for some weird reason and that gives shaw like first strike at new
[2645.36 --> 2652.24]  apartment buildings that go up in british columbia and shaw can just decide that they're going to only
[2652.24 --> 2658.00]  put in a certain amount of conduit into the building that only has enough space for what shaw's
[2658.00 --> 2665.76]  going to put in which does not allow telus to put anything in effectively the developer just goes
[2665.76 --> 2670.40]  like okay well we're being paid by shaw and telus can't do anything with us at this stage anyway so
[2670.40 --> 2675.12]  we're just going to build the building and then tell us to be able to get service into that building
[2675.12 --> 2681.60]  would have to like chop up tear out yeah like walls they'd have to chop up the building they have swiss
[2681.60 --> 2686.80]  cheese the building to fit all their new conduit in so they can actually service the building so tons
[2686.80 --> 2693.76]  of apartments in bc like a huge amount of new apartments don't have telus access and it's just
[2693.76 --> 2700.80]  like why is this even allowed that's the most monopolistic thing i've ever heard in the isp space
[2701.36 --> 2706.00]  why is that allowed i i don't understand i've never understood um
[2707.76 --> 2712.88]  yeah like someone at floatplane chat said it's bs it sounds like local monopolies it absolutely is
[2712.88 --> 2718.00]  you're you're buying into an apartment building is buying into an isp at this point yeah which is
[2718.00 --> 2724.56]  nuts which was actually a deciding factor for luke when he was shopping for his place because shaw's
[2724.56 --> 2733.20]  fiber isn't fiber oh boy oh we got luke with the spicy tank now it's not okay they go fiber to the node
[2733.20 --> 2738.56]  they advertise it as fiber it's so frustrating they go fiber to the node they go copper to your place
[2738.56 --> 2746.24]  tell us goes fiber to your place yes i prefer telus right now because they're not just like th baby
[2746.24 --> 2752.16]  blatantly lying to everyone yeah like that's so much better why are you oh my goodness i have two and a
[2752.16 --> 2757.12]  half gig now oh we have fiber because we go fiber to the node yeah you've been doing that forever yeah
[2757.12 --> 2763.36]  fiber to the node how else were you gonna get internet service to the node like what were you gonna do send
[2763.36 --> 2771.92]  smoke shut up you got fiber up to get internet smithing for decades yeah it's so frustrating
[2771.92 --> 2776.72]  how else were you gonna cover that distance it's honestly pathetic step your game up because like we
[2776.72 --> 2783.36]  we used to be a a like shaw house my my parents house had access to both yep and i i like my brother
[2783.36 --> 2788.08]  and i like sat our parents down one time and we were like we got to switch to shaw shaw's the way to go
[2788.08 --> 2793.60]  and they did it and we were stoked for a long time and now they're just like tell us his adsl
[2794.80 --> 2799.92]  it was terrible like the number of times this was my ex-girlfriend in high school like my high school
[2799.92 --> 2804.64]  sweetheart girlfriend the number of times i had to bring telus to her house because shaw wasn't
[2804.64 --> 2813.28]  available there because i we were out nowhere maple ridge okay and so they had no access to shaw and i had
[2813.28 --> 2817.68]  to bring them out i swear to you like half a dozen times and every single time they diagnosed a completely
[2817.68 --> 2824.88]  separate issue their adsl service went down all the time so frustrating and man their customer service
[2824.88 --> 2832.64]  was so bad back then yeah anyway i just i so like i i used to be on the shaw side and then fiber started
[2832.64 --> 2838.24]  becoming a thing and shaw just stayed in the past yeah they're like well what don't you like coax
[2838.80 --> 2843.92]  don't you like coax bro in this in this age of like everyone on the planet trying to be a streamer don't
[2843.92 --> 2849.44]  isn't it fine that we have this non-symmetrical you you buy like 900 down and no matter what we
[2849.44 --> 2855.84]  advertise you you get like 10 up or 20 up and then then like shaw shaw does their their speeds as this
[2855.84 --> 2861.76]  is another allegedly um but shaw does their speeds as far as my understanding goes as like sections
[2861.76 --> 2867.92]  yeah oh they do because it's not fiber to the house yeah so it's all shared so it's all shared so
[2867.92 --> 2876.16]  in peak times you're like 10 up goes down to like five and it's like oh i just can't do anything now
[2876.16 --> 2883.20]  to be clear goodness any isp is over provisioning that is actually normal and that's i don't mind
[2883.20 --> 2890.08]  that to a certain degree no but at at peak times i can speed test my telus stuff and it's pretty much
[2890.08 --> 2894.56]  what i'm paying for yeah i was mine when they first put it in i first paid for gigabit and it was like
[2894.56 --> 2900.00]  faster i was like oh no i couldn't check the gig no it was when i went to 500 at first and it was
[2900.00 --> 2904.40]  faster than 500 and then i had no way of knowing if i was faster than gigabit until i upgraded to
[2904.40 --> 2908.56]  greater than gigabit gear later and it was actually a little higher than gigabit i i have found if you
[2908.56 --> 2913.04]  don't test during like absolute peak telus connections are usually faster than advertised
[2913.04 --> 2919.44]  and like yes i'm not i'm not a telus show there are downsides but right now it's it's not a competition
[2919.44 --> 2925.04]  man telus has managed to screw up almost every single interaction i've ever had with them even
[2925.04 --> 2930.48]  when we had our itel uh fiber network put in here when we first upgraded to i guess it was gigabit
[2931.04 --> 2935.28]  itel just for some context as far as my understanding goes is a small company that runs off of telus's
[2935.28 --> 2942.56]  backbone right yeah yeah so uh so they they do their own stuff like they do actual engineering and stuff
[2942.56 --> 2946.88]  they're not just like some cheapo reseller and they like put down dark fiber and stuff too right but
[2946.88 --> 2951.76]  they are but they are not they're cool like a national tier isp either they're they're a
[2951.76 --> 2955.28]  relatively small shop although they've grown a lot it's in the time we've known them so when
[2955.28 --> 2960.80]  oh that's we first engaged with them they're basically just leasing uh they're leasing capacity
[2960.80 --> 2968.32]  from telus and their their cto and i spent literally like it was either an hour or two hours on the phone
[2968.32 --> 2973.12]  trying to diagnose why our upload speed was like a tenth of what it was supposed to be and it turns out
[2973.12 --> 2979.36]  that some some butterfingers numb nuts at telus just entered dip missed a zero
[2983.92 --> 2989.04]  forever to fix it oh my goodness like okay like literally everything i've ever done with telus
[2989.04 --> 2997.36]  has kind of been a cluster but the product these days is very good so that's that i had you got to
[2997.36 --> 3001.52]  give credit where credit is due all right you got to give credit where credit is due
[3003.20 --> 3007.92]  yeah people in chat are saying some isps boost their speeds when you go to speedtest.net
[3008.48 --> 3012.56]  sure but there's other ways to test speed yeah like i i've got a two and a half gigabit connection
[3012.56 --> 3018.72]  at home and i was downloading games off steam at 280 megabytes a second yeah like like i i have
[3018.72 --> 3025.44]  surpassed my rated speeds on steam as well like it's regularly yeah and and origin and like other services
[3025.44 --> 3030.88]  like it's it's it's fast the the one thing you get with telus right now is it's fast it's fast
[3030.88 --> 3036.24]  and that latency you get speed you get latency you take good little connections are really good just
[3036.24 --> 3041.60]  dealing with them isn't exactly the greatest thing ever yeah that's one way of putting it yeah speaking
[3041.60 --> 3045.20]  of dealing with them not being the greatest thing ever why don't we talk about apple's launch of their
[3045.20 --> 3052.16]  self-service repair program american apple customers can now take advantage of apple's self-service repair
[3052.16 --> 3058.80]  program to fix their mobile devices by going to this completely generic looking website that's right
[3058.80 --> 3066.24]  my friends you too can go to self-service repair.com this is actually apple i know right apparently it's
[3066.24 --> 3072.24]  right are you sure it's run by a third party company yeah okay but yes these are genuine apple parts
[3072.24 --> 3079.68]  and genuine apple tools but this isn't yeah this isn't like it literally is not apple though so the site has
[3079.68 --> 3083.92]  all the parts tools and manuals available to perform repairs on iphones going back to the 12
[3084.48 --> 3090.88]  um jonathan horse editorializes not handy as 11 and older are the models that will be needing repair
[3090.88 --> 3098.32]  right now that's a very fair criticism yep and so far one can repair man are we converting horse to like
[3098.96 --> 3107.04]  not an apple just like lover i feel like horse takes on apples have gotten more and more cynical
[3107.04 --> 3113.60]  the longer his finger oh boy love you jonathan you do a great job over at mac address i try not
[3113.60 --> 3118.32]  honestly i i try to have nothing to do with the editorial direction over there i think just being
[3118.32 --> 3126.32]  around here i'll just i'll pop by his desk it's stupid he'll be like oh why do you say i'm like well
[3126.32 --> 3131.36]  i don't know this this and this like oh okay yeah i can try and integrate that no no no no no just just
[3131.36 --> 3140.08]  do your thing uh anyway so far one can repair the battery bottom speaker rear camera display
[3140.08 --> 3148.88]  taptic engine and sim tray uh okay it's thorough but not easy looking users are to play apple
[3149.44 --> 3156.72]  are to play apple repair genius for a day oh okay um for example repairing anything requires using the
[3156.72 --> 3163.92]  heated display removal fixture and the display press oh i see so they give you guides and tools and
[3163.92 --> 3171.52]  everything but only to do it the like official way not necessarily the cheap and or efficient way so
[3171.52 --> 3175.52]  people in chat are saying that they charge you the same price that you would pay at the genius bar
[3175.52 --> 3183.28]  well that's the problem is these uh these tools are available for purchase for 256 and 216 dollars
[3183.28 --> 3188.48]  respectively so this is the heated display removal fixture and the display press but repairers can
[3188.48 --> 3195.04]  rent the entire kit for a week for 49 the issue is that the economics are sort of difficult to justify
[3195.04 --> 3203.36]  so on an iphone 12 display a screw kit costs 268 while going to the apple store costs 279 so you literally
[3203.36 --> 3211.76]  save 10 to do it yourself however if you send back your parts you do get a discount of 33.60 for a
[3211.76 --> 3223.44]  display so for 40 of savings you get to do it yourself when honestly for oem grade parts like you you you
[3223.44 --> 3233.76]  could definitely do this for a lot cheaper than that um okay our discussion questions are what are you
[3233.76 --> 3241.28]  most happy to see with this program i'm most happy that the program exists at all because now now the first
[3242.00 --> 3247.92]  the first you know okay let's say we're trying to move a really big rock you know i'm not that's my
[3247.92 --> 3251.28]  first take you're not well can can i can nope
[3254.64 --> 3261.68]  because i feel like this is going to be their look we did it move and they will not improve okay
[3261.68 --> 3270.40]  that's my concern i think the bigger picture no offense i think the bigger picture is we know that
[3270.40 --> 3278.72]  right to repair has a long way to go and if nothing else this is that first little bit of movement of
[3278.72 --> 3286.40]  the rock is it good enough no no i believe it will improve over time just by merit of them not
[3286.40 --> 3294.88]  removing access to iphone 12 stuff when the 14 and 15 and 16 17 launch like i i feel like i hope like
[3294.88 --> 3300.48]  i mean we'll see the back catalog of parts will expand just by nature of new things coming out and
[3300.48 --> 3305.92]  not removing access to that stuff that would be really awful i think throwing it under one of the
[3305.92 --> 3311.36]  worst websites i've seen in like a decade um and under a third party really doesn't help a lot of
[3311.36 --> 3318.80]  adoption like if you land if you land on spot's website here um and the third show it to you sure
[3319.36 --> 3325.84]  the little logo in the corner um and if you if you see that the logo is literally just plain text like
[3325.84 --> 3330.16]  if i land on this website i'm leaving immediately because i'm concerned about the security of my
[3330.16 --> 3335.68]  computer uh like i'm not i'm not i'm not buying something through this thinking that it's actually
[3335.68 --> 3341.52]  official it's clear that apple could have made this official but decided not to yes now now that's not
[3341.52 --> 3347.28]  to say that working through a third party is necessarily bad we praised valve for working through
[3347.28 --> 3355.20]  third parties like i fix it on the steam deck um like right to repair uh initiative so making parts
[3355.20 --> 3361.36]  available to to end users but the reason we did that is well they partnered with someone reputable
[3361.36 --> 3367.60]  uh they partnered with more than one partner and i mean is that okay do we need to give reasons other
[3367.60 --> 3372.96]  than that no i mean like the and i'm not trying to dog on on small companies by any means it's just
[3372.96 --> 3379.44]  this website literally looks like a scam like apple would have made it look more apple and an apple
[3379.44 --> 3385.36]  customer i think is going to want it to look a little more apple but can i come back to my point
[3385.36 --> 3393.04]  back to my point where there's no what if apple is doing this okay maybe maybe it becomes the industry
[3393.04 --> 3401.36]  norm to do at least this or maybe maybe now that it's a conversation now that an apple customer even
[3401.36 --> 3407.76]  becomes aware of the concept of being able to get replacement parts for your hardware and and perform
[3407.76 --> 3412.64]  repairs yourself or do them for your friends like if i was a high school student or something like
[3412.64 --> 3417.36]  that then how cool would it be if i could repair all of my friends iphones i mean i'm not gonna buy
[3417.36 --> 3422.96]  i guess i would just getting the word out is good so maybe we see one upmanship start to happen in the
[3422.96 --> 3428.80]  space i'm just i'm worried i'm worried that in this case due to the way that they did it and this
[3428.80 --> 3431.76]  is going to be a weird thing to argue but in this case due to the way that they did it getting
[3431.76 --> 3436.96]  the word out might actually be bad i know that sounds nuts but my argument for that is the pricing
[3436.96 --> 3444.32]  is so bad the pricing is so egregiously bad the website that it lands you on is so sketchy looking
[3444.32 --> 3449.36]  there's no about us you can't figure out who these people even are i'm on your screen now there's no
[3449.36 --> 3454.80]  you look at the bottom contact us is just like the most basic it's not even loading now there we go
[3454.80 --> 3460.40]  contact us is just like open a chat and here's a random phone number there's no about us there's
[3460.40 --> 3465.52]  nothing like who are these people i don't want to like send them a huge amount of money that's one of
[3465.52 --> 3469.92]  the first things that i do when i go to a website is about us and find out where they're located
[3469.92 --> 3475.12]  and then cross-reference that with like some kind of geographical resource like google maps make
[3475.12 --> 3480.80]  sure they're actually who are you yeah what's your building look like yeah um and then so pricing is
[3480.80 --> 3485.92]  super bad and it looks super sketchy so to me getting the word out this way feels like they're
[3485.92 --> 3490.56]  actually turning people off and making them pushing them into a defeatist mentality where they're like
[3490.56 --> 3495.36]  i have to get it repaired by apple there is no other solution because this is the solution that
[3495.36 --> 3501.68]  is being exposed to me in the easiest way possible and it's trash that's my argument i can't argue that
[3502.40 --> 3506.16]  but i just would like to i would like to feel better about this
[3507.92 --> 3513.12]  yeah i don't know in my delusional little magic minus world i hope it works out i hope you're right
[3513.12 --> 3517.12]  i hope people see this and go like oh maybe there's alternatives and then they work with
[3517.12 --> 3522.00]  whatever local shop or or they just research things themselves and try to do it themselves if
[3522.00 --> 3527.28]  they're if they're a little technically apt or whatever like that that would be fantastic i hope
[3527.28 --> 3535.28]  it goes that direction i just feel like honestly it feels kind of weird to say like a website made me
[3535.28 --> 3543.68]  lose hope like almost immediately but it really did like it's just so sketchy looking um okay uh what's the
[3543.68 --> 3547.84]  you're off for the dashboard for the uh merch messages again i just realized i don't have it up
[3547.84 --> 3556.88]  i don't exactly want to say i just see it yeah okay i think oh really it's not gonna auto fill for me
[3560.32 --> 3571.84]  oh my no that's not it oh oh my gosh like this this thing that okay you know what didn't complete um
[3571.84 --> 3576.16]  um i'll check my history i'll see if i can bring it up i can send it to the email that's on that
[3576.16 --> 3585.60]  computer okay yeah that would help okay anyway um yeah fine uh oh uh the the the the aura master
[3585.60 --> 3590.08]  and all in floatplane chat says i've been thinking about the availability of parts wouldn't it be
[3590.08 --> 3594.64]  worse for the environment to continue producing iphone 12 parts six or seven years after it released
[3594.64 --> 3598.56]  wouldn't having a ton of batteries and other parts lying around for years be bad too so no they would keep
[3598.56 --> 3604.88]  them in production there's so many iphone 12s out there and there will be so many iphone 12s out
[3604.88 --> 3608.96]  there even six seven years from now because to apple's credit they do do an excellent job of
[3608.96 --> 3613.60]  providing software updates for their devices that yeah you would be able to justify doing small
[3613.60 --> 3619.92]  production runs and no they wouldn't be lying around for years at a time and you might say okay well
[3619.92 --> 3624.24]  you know all these parts are effectively you know manufactured e-waste because you're putting them
[3624.24 --> 3629.12]  into old devices that are not gonna last but that's the thing as long as those parts are available
[3629.12 --> 3634.64]  you can actually keep running those devices on life support that's good because when you make a new
[3634.64 --> 3642.56]  device well you're making the whole device not just yeah those parts of it so also also it's not like
[3642.56 --> 3650.08]  they aren't going to like monitor their demand and produce for that like they don't just have like
[3650.08 --> 3657.36]  an entire factory pumping out iphone 8 screens for the end until the end of time as fast as they
[3657.36 --> 3661.52]  possibly can apparently the repair manuals are at least on the apple website yeah when you click
[3661.52 --> 3666.56]  the manuals button it just completely redirects you to apple i know which is also not how that's
[3666.56 --> 3672.72]  supposed to work i know i know i did that as well i didn't even want to break it up because it was
[3672.72 --> 3680.88]  like sketchy but not as sketchy as the other things so like i i don't know i'm not sold man and like
[3680.88 --> 3686.64]  again i don't want to rag on a small company but they got to fix these things you got to look
[3686.64 --> 3691.60]  legitimate when you're on the internet um raven darrett says you can run the devices but as people we seem
[3691.60 --> 3696.16]  to toss away working stuff for new shiny things all the time regardless right but we want those devices
[3696.16 --> 3705.44]  to go to someone right that's the point as long as it still works it's like buying a new car does not
[3705.44 --> 3712.00]  turn your old car into an environmental disaster immediately someone will drive that car and they
[3712.00 --> 3716.96]  will drive they will go buy that car instead of a brand new one also with enhanced repairability
[3716.96 --> 3723.52]  you might shift the culture to being more interested in keeping devices going there's a significant amount
[3723.52 --> 3729.68]  of people that are completely fine with their phones yes but the battery is not okay so they
[3729.68 --> 3735.52]  buy a new phone i'm honestly getting a little bit tired of my folding phone i picked up my note 9 the
[3735.52 --> 3740.88]  other night because like my battery was low on this and i just needed something mention it and i was like
[3740.88 --> 3746.16]  oh it still feels so good yeah i might put a new battery in it and just like rock the note 9 for
[3746.16 --> 3754.56]  another couple years i don't know man nice uh but yeah it's it's it's like uh i don't know wicked
[3754.56 --> 3759.36]  peruvian is really mad at you criticizing the website by the way says hey my uncle barry made
[3759.36 --> 3767.44]  that website for like two hours and it was super hard for him yeah i just like like design actually
[3767.44 --> 3774.24]  matters for a lot of reasons other than just like oh pretty it it it makes a website feel more
[3774.24 --> 3778.96]  legitimate it makes a company feel more legitimate it you you need to stay up to date so that people
[3778.96 --> 3784.08]  don't think that your website has been abandoned um you need to have an about us page so people can
[3784.08 --> 3788.80]  again add legitimacy to you if i haven't heard of your company and i'm going to spend a bunch of money
[3788.80 --> 3792.88]  with you i something that i very often do you mentioned how one of the first things you do when
[3792.88 --> 3796.40]  you go to a website is you go to the about us yeah one of the first things i do is how does this
[3796.40 --> 3802.08]  company make money yeah because a lot of times i want to make sure that whatever thing i'm using
[3802.08 --> 3807.52]  has a reasonable way of making money makes sense if it doesn't then i'm going to be like why are
[3807.52 --> 3812.80]  they how are they profiting off of me and am i actually okay with it if it's like oh they're
[3812.80 --> 3817.60]  clearly profiting off of me because i'm buying some service or i'm buying something that adds
[3818.32 --> 3822.88]  legitimacy to me but then i want to see like who the team is etc i actually care about those things
[3822.88 --> 3830.96]  um and and i know the the the greater world does as well so like please update the website we need to
[3830.96 --> 3834.80]  do a couple merch messages for those of you who haven't noticed already or you're new to the show

[3856.40 --> 3859.92]  them do you want to start at the top because i have already got an answer in my mind for that one
[3859.92 --> 3866.24]  brendan asks with elon buying twitter how much money would someone have to offer you to sell ltt
[3867.12 --> 3873.60]  whoo um i think if they offered 44 billion dollars 44 billion dollars would be pretty hard to say no
[3873.60 --> 3880.00]  to i'd have to wonder what the terms are like am i some kind of like sex slave for the rest of my life
[3880.00 --> 3886.08]  as part of the as part of the deal i mean you never know with the elites right i mean true yeah fair
[3886.08 --> 3892.00]  enough the kinds of rumors that swirl around the billionaire class are just like hilarious like
[3892.00 --> 3897.76]  did you ever hear the one about how this is the amount sorry you were in the middle of saying
[3897.76 --> 3903.92]  something but what was that guy's name you had the island you super sketchy dude oh uh what's his face
[3903.92 --> 3909.60]  uh the guy jeffrey epstein yeah yeah the amount of them that had photos with that dude or like hung out
[3909.60 --> 3917.04]  with him a lot it's like there's a lot of rumors yeah might be true did you ever hear the one about
[3917.04 --> 3922.08]  the co-founders of one of the fang companies i i just don't feel like naming them because it could
[3922.08 --> 3927.28]  be not accurate but yeah allegedly one of the co-founders of one of one of the fangs uh apparently
[3927.28 --> 3933.60]  had a soundproof room for conducting meetings completely soundproof oh yeah but like apparently
[3933.60 --> 3938.80]  was like in their home oh and i'm sitting here going what do you need that for i i don't know
[3938.80 --> 3946.08]  if i mentioned this on when but there's a there's a conf i struggle to say confirmed allegedly there's a
[3946.08 --> 3952.56]  there's a couple people that were founders of one kind of fangy company yeah and a single person who
[3952.56 --> 3958.56]  was a founder of another company that isn't technically included in fang but it would be that
[3958.56 --> 3964.24]  that had an apartment that was completely sound blocked off that they would go to in a private
[3964.24 --> 3968.64]  elevator up to that apartment it's completely soundproofed there's a chef that has a different
[3968.64 --> 3974.64]  entry that goes to a kitchen they leave food in like a certain area that is completely blocked off
[3974.64 --> 3978.80]  they they have no access from the kitchen into the rest of the apartment and then to get the food the
[3978.80 --> 3984.88]  chef has to leave and then they go in and get their food and they have meetings in there or at least
[3984.88 --> 3992.48]  used to crazy bloodsail admiral over in float plane chat can i just shout you out for this being
[3992.48 --> 3999.76]  hilarious uh hearsay and i'm assuming this is a johnny depp ever heard trial reference here objection
[3999.76 --> 4004.96]  hearsay did you see the one where amber heard's lawyer literally asks a question and then objects
[4004.96 --> 4014.40]  to his own question look man i don't normally i don't normally wade into like celebrity drama
[4014.40 --> 4019.76]  because it's not really my cup of tea because i don't it's just kind of a bottomless pit yeah but
[4019.76 --> 4024.88]  also that i gotta say based on how things are going so far i'm pretty team johnny on this one
[4025.52 --> 4030.40]  i just she is not looking good i have not really followed it that closely but i've been finding it
[4030.40 --> 4036.64]  very funny like i saw that clip um my girlfriend sent me a few other clips that have just been
[4036.64 --> 4044.88]  very entertaining yes zatharion he objected to his own question the judge was extra confused he he you
[4044.88 --> 4051.84]  you watch him like stumble afterwards um but it's yeah it's uh it's pretty funny oh man he just he
[4051.84 --> 4056.16]  objected to so many things i don't know i haven't been giving up to i shouldn't say anything but um
[4056.16 --> 4061.52]  um he objected apparently he objected to the testimony of the person that was testifying no
[4061.52 --> 4065.68]  he was prepping to object to the answer depth was giving not the question he was asking okay either
[4065.68 --> 4072.16]  way it wasn't even depth hilarious yeah i i don't care i don't care about the details either way it was
[4072.16 --> 4079.36]  hilarious and i loved it it was amazing talk to your humor yep um okay how much money would someone
[4079.36 --> 4088.32]  have to offer you to sell ltt well i can tell you for a fact that even if i got an offer that was that
[4088.32 --> 4098.64]  was millions of dollars um right now i am not at a stage in my career and i i think i speak for myself
[4099.36 --> 4104.88]  i speak for my wife who as most of you i think probably know you guys are wanshow regulars
[4104.88 --> 4111.20]  uh my wife who is my business partner so we are pretty much 50 50 owners it's a little complicated
[4111.20 --> 4115.44]  have i ever told the story about how i went full ego trip and i was like can i have 51
[4116.24 --> 4121.12]  back when we were setting up the company that's incredibly lame i i legitimately okay so hold on
[4121.12 --> 4126.64]  a second my justification for it is actually not completely ridiculous would would you like to hear
[4126.64 --> 4130.80]  my justification or would you like to sit there judging me uh i'm gonna do both you're gonna do both
[4130.80 --> 4138.32]  okay my justification for it is that i i liked being like the majority shareholder founder whatever
[4138.80 --> 4144.16]  but at the end of the day because we're married with no prenuptial agreement whatsoever if we were
[4144.16 --> 4150.40]  to split up my 51 goes half to me and half to her and her 49 goes half to me and half to
[4151.84 --> 4158.16]  anyway it actually doesn't matter so i was like look this doesn't matter i just want to be like
[4158.16 --> 4165.20]  lines media group i i i i have the controlling you know interest or whatever and it was like it was
[4165.20 --> 4170.24]  totally stupid and i totally get it but it also totally doesn't matter and she and i both knew it
[4170.24 --> 4179.12]  at the time so that's my justification for it it actually doesn't make a difference okay are you still
[4179.12 --> 4184.96]  judging yeah i mean it's still stupid is it less late linus and shares has always been an interesting thing
[4184.96 --> 4193.12]  that's all i'm saying and i'm not surprised is another thing that i will say i like look i like
[4193.76 --> 4199.52]  controlling the direction of the company entirely in every possible way have i done a bad job yes no
[4199.52 --> 4209.52]  no it's been good oh my god what a dick what a dick as i sit here and drink from my my ltd store water
[4209.52 --> 4214.72]  bottle wearing my my ltd store underwear and ltd store shirt yeah it's been horrible yeah i've
[4214.72 --> 4223.92]  clearly done a very bad job so so anyway i i was just like and i asked if she had said no it would
[4223.92 --> 4230.64]  have been 50 50. wait she said yes yeah she was like fine whatever i mean well she let me call it
[4230.64 --> 4239.20]  line just media group too yeah i i was open to other ideas true just i kind of want to change it
[4239.20 --> 4245.68]  you know what and in fairness to me so in fairness to me i recently offered to do another nine years
[4245.68 --> 4251.60]  the other way around i was like tell you what how about we do the paperwork you know if i want us to
[4251.60 --> 4256.56]  i want i want you to feel like we were having a conversation where like she felt like i was overriding
[4256.56 --> 4262.16]  something and i was like look no i don't want you to feel like that yes i have my convictions and i
[4262.16 --> 4266.72]  have my opinions and there's a way that i feel we should do it but i don't it's not that i it's not
[4266.72 --> 4271.68]  that i'm not listening or it's not that we can't do it your way it's also a very passionate arguer
[4271.68 --> 4277.28]  that's all true fair enough you've also traditionally and you've gotten a lot better specifically with
[4277.28 --> 4282.56]  yvonne lately um and it seems like she's appreciating it which is cool but you've also had
[4282.56 --> 4290.88]  maybe some uh tendencies to not exactly share the credit uh yes that's fair or accolades for things
[4290.88 --> 4298.80]  in the past i tend to speak in the singular yvonne has in fairness again to me yvonne has oh boy she's
[4298.80 --> 4305.68]  gonna watch this yvonne has made her own bed to an extent when it comes to how public facing she is
[4306.56 --> 4311.52]  there have been that does not countless that is not an excuse that does not count countless
[4311.52 --> 4317.60]  opportunities just like with those you're wrong so what i'm wrong with these yes when you said
[4317.60 --> 4323.68]  like like that's not a fair question to ask or whatever in the pre-show oh um i ended up being
[4323.68 --> 4330.88]  right so so she she decided to take that stance and then things that she did were claimed as actions
[4330.88 --> 4335.44]  from you well what what whoa hold on what did i take i'm not going to be able to give good examples
[4335.44 --> 4339.68]  of this i'm talking about over the last 10 years and this is something that she has approached you
[4339.68 --> 4346.56]  oh well here's an accusation but i'm afraid objection hearsay here's okay that would be fair
[4346.56 --> 4350.96]  and it would stand up in court you get that but you know this is a thing objection hearsay
[4352.80 --> 4357.36]  and again i'm a legal standpoint i'm winning this argument you are um
[4358.88 --> 4364.80]  and i did say however that it has gotten better recently well the thing especially in the in the two
[4364.80 --> 4372.48]  like the two more recent videos that she has shown up in yep um there's been a lot more more like she
[4372.48 --> 4378.96]  has she has expressed more desire to fair enough to play a more public role yeah and and honestly like
[4378.96 --> 4383.76]  i think part of it is that she just didn't have the energy to play a public role for a long time fair
[4383.76 --> 4389.76]  enough like she was she you got to understand the thing is that yvonne's biggest contribution to linus media
[4389.76 --> 4396.08]  group was actually made working at a different company than linus media group because without
[4396.08 --> 4403.36]  yvonne's seed capital financial support arm lines media group does not exist yeah it never makes it to
[4403.36 --> 4410.72]  this stage and then without her ongoing financial guidance it never it never hits that hockey stick
[4410.72 --> 4418.08]  moment where it takes off and all of that is stuff that takes place inherently kind of behind the scenes
[4418.08 --> 4423.36]  especially when you're so busy working on that stuff that you don't have time to go say i don't
[4423.36 --> 4430.72]  know start a a a cupcake decorating channel as as an offshoot that we that we promote to try to build
[4430.72 --> 4436.08]  our female audience or all the legitimate business cases that we could make for yvonne taking a more
[4436.08 --> 4440.56]  front and center role it's also not something that she's always been the most comfortable with i mean
[4440.56 --> 4446.96]  sometimes and you know hasn't always loved being on camera sorry hasn't always loved being on camera no
[4446.96 --> 4454.40]  and and sometimes you know if i had to if i had to pick my wife's biggest flaw it's insecurity
[4454.96 --> 4460.72]  literally her biggest flaw is not realizing how awesome she is which i think is not going to land me on
[4460.72 --> 4465.84]  the couch but that's not why i chose it i that's actually true and it's something that i've been chasing
[4465.84 --> 4471.12]  her about pretty much since the day we met because especially when we met boy was i ever punching up
[4471.12 --> 4481.12]  like she settled man she like and you know this isn't a dig it's very true i'm just gonna say guys
[4481.12 --> 4486.64]  out there find an insecure chick because she's gonna be so much better than you would have done otherwise
[4486.64 --> 4494.40]  not a great take yikes i'm obviously kidding i'm just saying but in all seriousness i was i was in my
[4494.40 --> 4500.56]  opinion clearly punching up and yeah over the years it's still it's been something that she struggled
[4500.56 --> 4505.60]  with that she hasn't realized like how one of my favorite songs okay one of the songs that reminds
[4505.60 --> 4513.12]  me of her most is one directions you don't know you're beautiful because she just like has no idea
[4513.12 --> 4518.16]  i'll be like yeah you did great and she'll be like oh oh i could have fixed this 100 things i'm like yeah
[4518.16 --> 4525.36]  you could have but you did great i know especially i i heard about this especially more early on it
[4525.36 --> 4530.80]  might still be a thing i don't know uh but i know she was very self-conscious about uh
[4532.48 --> 4541.68]  her work here as well oh i know oh man actually you're you're kicking bleep button but i don't know
[4541.68 --> 4547.44]  where it is but oh you can say ass i think it's fine i don't know whatever sounds good
[4547.44 --> 4555.12]  uh but like it it's just but but it was i feel like it was very hard for her to see that yep um
[4555.12 --> 4562.00]  and and i think that's like i don't know what necessarily changed um but but something changed
[4562.00 --> 4567.04]  there where she she wanted more recognition and i feel like maybe it was her seeing that
[4567.68 --> 4571.60]  maybe and then being like now i want the accolades which is cool because she deserves them i mean it's to
[4571.60 --> 4577.28]  be clear guys uh you know this is something that i have talked to yvonne about extensively over the
[4577.28 --> 4581.36]  years this is not something that's going to be some kind of a surprise for her we have an extremely
[4582.16 --> 4588.00]  open i don't want to say an extremely open relationship that is almost we were so close
[4589.12 --> 4591.60]  i was watching that train go at that wall
[4594.40 --> 4597.52]  it didn't quite hit the wall got a little off the rails
[4597.52 --> 4605.28]  we have a policy of extremely open communication in our relationship because we wouldn't have made
[4605.28 --> 4611.60]  it this far without it and there are times when honestly she will just tell me yeah this is
[4611.60 --> 4617.84]  something that i could take more more of a front-facing role on but honestly i just i just don't feel like
[4617.84 --> 4622.32]  talking to people right now why don't why don't you announce it or why don't you say it or you know i
[4622.32 --> 4626.08]  i like the way you say it and i will say in the in the credit to both of you as well as someone who's
[4626.08 --> 4630.96]  literally lived with you for an extended period of time conflict resolution seems quite strong oh
[4630.96 --> 4638.96]  well thank you yeah luke has probably overheard far more than really i realized at the time and i'm
[4638.96 --> 4646.88]  comfortable with um our walls are not as big as i think we like as soon as
[4648.24 --> 4654.08]  yeah not so much that's okay though um yeah but you know what we we we really do live by principles
[4654.08 --> 4660.00]  like never go to bed angry yeah um even if it means we're up till four in the morning like
[4661.04 --> 4665.84]  you just can't anyway the point is not to get into like relationship tips or whatever the point
[4665.84 --> 4673.20]  is how do we even get to this topic yes i have i have not given enough credit to her over the years
[4673.20 --> 4679.68]  it has always been my it's been my my instinct i mean i think it's okay oh boy here we go more hot
[4679.68 --> 4687.28]  takes i do find it takes a certain type to get into a social media role you have to be an attention seeker
[4687.28 --> 4694.80]  to a degree there are exceptions but you have to at least enjoy whatever type of spotlight it is that you
[4694.80 --> 4699.92]  end up taking for yourself whether it's a more behind the scenes kind of spotlight like a cgp gray
[4699.92 --> 4705.12]  whether you like having people whether you like just just sharing and educating you're still you're
[4705.12 --> 4709.28]  still in a spotlight even if it's like a necessary evil kind of spotlight yeah you might hate it i mean
[4709.28 --> 4714.80]  we've we've seen this by people who who like uh become internet famous by accident basically yeah but
[4714.80 --> 4720.80]  you have to at least be able to tolerate it you have to have a certain amount of of charisma right and
[4720.80 --> 4727.68]  that's not something that comes naturally to everyone i forget why i started this sentence
[4727.68 --> 4731.76]  so it doesn't really matter we're talking about how much money it would take to sell it oh right
[4731.76 --> 4737.04]  yeah how much money it would take i have another thing if you're still thinking about it no i'm ready
[4737.04 --> 4744.00]  okay okay but hit me hit me so i often have to reference what floatplane does by saying by trying
[4744.00 --> 4748.48]  to reference all of the companies because at this point we do a certain amount of thing for all of the
[4748.48 --> 4751.36]  companies and especially with the hiring and expansion that we're doing we're going to be
[4751.36 --> 4756.72]  doing even more of that which is great but saying all of the companies or like the greater companies
[4756.72 --> 4762.00]  or the companies under the numbered umbrella or whatever is getting really annoying yeah we do kind
[4762.00 --> 4768.96]  of need a name for our our umbrella organization and yeah i and and it should be something different
[4769.52 --> 4776.00]  honestly what i would like to do over the next three to five years is remove the linus branding from
[4776.00 --> 4783.20]  everything that we do i would like linus tech tips to become ltt and i slip up sometimes but i'm i'm
[4783.20 --> 4787.92]  trying to get in the habit of only referring to it as ltd like sometimes in a video it'll be like are
[4787.92 --> 4793.12]  we going to do this halfway no this is linus tech tips baby you know and so i want to be like no this
[4793.12 --> 4798.64]  is ltd like i want to i want to shift that branding um i mean we've already been doing it on the merch for
[4798.64 --> 4805.60]  years now we almost never print linus on anything um because it's just it's just time to move away
[4805.60 --> 4810.88]  from it i there's so many more people here it's all it's it's group it's not linus anymore right when
[4810.88 --> 4816.00]  the linus media group thing oh call it group group i'm not calling it group group sounds like fish like
[4816.00 --> 4822.56]  grouper group anyway the point is um no we're not calling it umbrella corp that's very funny though
[4822.56 --> 4830.16]  um so i want to move linus tech tips away i want linus media group to become a brand that we sort of
[4830.16 --> 4838.96]  phase out and then i want to create a a brand for that umbrella organization that contains ltt
[4838.96 --> 4844.32]  productions or whatever okay that contains creator warehouse that contains flow plane and i would like
[4844.32 --> 4850.96]  to i'd like to do all the branding around that because it's becoming clear to me as we go that and
[4850.96 --> 4855.76]  this is coming back around to the question it's becoming clear to me as we go that we are eventually
[4855.76 --> 4863.68]  going to have to raise capital in some way we cannot ivan and i cannot keep reinvesting personally
[4863.68 --> 4869.36]  and doubling down every single time that we need to grow whether it's labs whether it's backpacks and
[4869.36 --> 4876.64]  screwdrivers whatever it is whatever it's new facility at some point the the not stupid excuse me the
[4876.64 --> 4884.80]  not stupid thing to do is take some kind of outside capital in some way and i think that if we were to
[4884.80 --> 4892.48]  raise some kind of funds we would want to do it as that umbrella organization rather than as one of the
[4892.48 --> 4899.36]  individual silos within it so yeah having having some form of name and being able to point at that
[4899.36 --> 4906.96]  name as like something that's legitimate would be kind of cool yeah um yeah it's a very enterprise is
[4906.96 --> 4914.72]  limited not bad not bad one rv says please don't go public so there's lots of different ways to raise
[4915.44 --> 4921.44]  funds um going public is obviously one of them but it's far from the only way to do it
[4921.44 --> 4930.72]  it i don't know i don't know i don't know what it i don't know what it looks like um yeah new wana
[4930.72 --> 4937.12]  incorporated nice uh all right so it was with elon buying twitter how much money would someone have to
[4937.12 --> 4945.36]  offer you to sell ltt so coming back to the question i have spoken with the executive team here i have
[4945.36 --> 4951.84]  spoken with yvonne we are not at a place where we are ready to sell and so the offer kind of doesn't
[4951.84 --> 4957.92]  matter and the reason for that is that whatever the offer is is going to be based on business fundamentals
[4957.92 --> 4970.64]  like your uh what is it earnings before uh the interest tax and uh whatever your your ebita okay so
[4970.64 --> 4975.44]  it could be based on that it could be based on some kind of multiple of revenue but there are
[4975.44 --> 4982.08]  formulas for valuing a business and we are in a position right now where we believe we have such
[4982.08 --> 4987.84]  a period of explosive growth ahead of us with creator warehouse uh with new channels with the lab
[4987.84 --> 4994.40]  that we would be stupid to take any kind of offer today rather than what would come a year two or
[4994.40 --> 5006.00]  three years from now yeah and that's really exciting so i just don't want and i don't think that we would
[5006.00 --> 5014.16]  be able to guide this organization toward the success that we think we're headed towards if we didn't have
[5014.16 --> 5024.24]  full control am i a control freak yes it was a rhetorical question but yes yes i am i was going to
[5024.24 --> 5034.24]  answer it i was going to give you a second dude okay the most hilarious thing to me was back in the
[5034.24 --> 5039.36]  house when you were pushing me to show up on camera really hard but couldn't actually let me have a
[5039.36 --> 5044.80]  video just by myself either that dichotomy was one of the weirdest things to have to like work out in
[5044.80 --> 5049.92]  my brain ever um he would run downstairs because he'd realize we were filming something but he would
[5049.92 --> 5054.16]  realize it too late or he'd be on a call or something and you'd literally hear him sprinting
[5054.48 --> 5059.76]  from his desk downstairs to get in the shot and would like dive into the shot as i'm doing the
[5059.76 --> 5064.40]  outro to make sure that he was in it i was actually kind of just having fun with you but there's
[5064.40 --> 5069.36]  probably there's probably some kind of broken psychological we'll call me a little combi yeah
[5069.36 --> 5076.72]  that's fair that's fair that's fair all right i i'm archiving that we're not going to talk about that
[5076.72 --> 5082.00]  anymore and we should probably talk about sponsor spots before we do a couple more topics do some more
[5082.00 --> 5086.80]  some more merch messages here the show is brought to you by wait how do i do sponsor frames no no no
[5087.36 --> 5092.56]  on the dashboard but oh oh uh but i can bring it up which one do you want to do okay i want to do them

[5261.28 --> 5265.92]  you my thing though my thing's down here i want to show it to you i'm down dude all right uh flow
[5265.92 --> 5269.44]  plane chat came up with an amazing i didn't want to say it during the thing just in case i didn't
[5269.44 --> 5274.40]  like it oh for sure but flow plane chat came up with an amazing uh sales pitch for squarespace
[5274.40 --> 5279.44]  which is beautiful do you want to make your way oh i missed that one do you want to make your website
[5279.44 --> 5286.96]  not look like apple's repair site honestly you could build a better looking site in like a day
[5286.96 --> 5292.72]  on squarespace not like 10 minutes probably yeah well okay all the pictures were stock oh you're not
[5292.72 --> 5297.44]  even wrong the buttons are just like links to other website and it's just basic text you could literally
[5297.44 --> 5302.72]  okay maybe 10 minutes is too low at at max honestly i think you could recreate a better website than that
[5302.72 --> 5309.20]  in like under two hours and this is not like we're done the squarespace spot this is not a sponsor
[5309.20 --> 5315.44]  bit i know i just like actually just like do use it and it actually is really easy to use and that
[5315.44 --> 5321.68]  site is horrible there's nothing unique or or interesting really there you're just filling out
[5321.68 --> 5327.28]  like especially if you could just copy paste the text over then you're just done like almost yeah i
[5327.28 --> 5332.80]  know i know the longest part would be like picking a theme okay can i show you this yes yeah what's
[5332.80 --> 5338.00]  what's going on okay i'm sure you recognize i'm sure you recognize this yeah the frogger machine
[5339.20 --> 5344.64]  enough it's a reference to the pre-show sarah and i ended up in an argument over whether frogger was
[5344.64 --> 5350.80]  available on game gear and whether her assuming that it was was her trolling me which it turned
[5350.80 --> 5356.08]  out it wasn't it turned out that the system does not have frogger but it turns out that all the
[5356.08 --> 5360.40]  engineering was actually done it was just never released you can get it as a rom so her assuming
[5360.40 --> 5365.04]  that was not her trolling me that's where we ended up i was kind of right but i was also mostly wrong
[5365.04 --> 5367.44]  the pre-shows are pretty cool if you want to check them out subscribe to float plane yeah you
[5367.44 --> 5371.60]  should definitely be subscribed the vod including the pre-show is is on full plan exclusively on
[5371.60 --> 5376.80]  float plane yeah um also like lots of behind the scenes like if you're not on float yeah it's actually
[5376.80 --> 5382.32]  been popping off lately oh yeah rd is doing a lot of really good content amazing job of the behind
[5382.32 --> 5387.52]  the scenes like meet the team uh cutting room floor stuff there's some great exclusives we actually took
[5387.52 --> 5395.20]  a day off this week so as a surprise yeah to everyone but me yvonne and chase i think oh no
[5395.20 --> 5402.64]  the executives knew yeah yeah you knew okay so uh so the c-suite the executive managers and then chase
[5402.64 --> 5407.84]  who's our event coordinator knew but everyone else showed up for work on tuesday morning thinking they
[5407.84 --> 5414.80]  were showing up for work but at 9 45 a school bus drove into the parking lot we all got on it went
[5414.80 --> 5420.96]  bowling went to boston pizza for lunch and then we went to see uncharted in our own private theater
[5420.96 --> 5425.76]  and then came back to the office and everyone went home yeah it was actually amazing we've never done
[5425.76 --> 5431.12]  anything like it before it was genuinely really fun except i couldn't really my shoulders all screwed up
[5432.00 --> 5437.60]  so i couldn't really like i was bowling left-handed but it was really fun regardless yeah honestly the
[5437.60 --> 5443.52]  point of bowling is not it is to hang out yeah yeah and it was it was cool to build the the float plane team
[5443.52 --> 5447.84]  like you know doesn't get out much so it was cool to be able to like have the the float plane people
[5447.84 --> 5451.68]  mingle with other people that work here and all that kind of stuff it was a really good day yeah it
[5451.68 --> 5458.40]  was it was pretty fun anyway the point is um wait what were we talking about dang it right um arty even
[5458.40 --> 5464.96]  though i told him not to work i explicit did i explicitly tell everyone no work you did i did he just i
[5464.96 --> 5470.64]  don't know maybe actually enjoys his job i guess but decided to like vlog it and so there's an exclusive
[5470.64 --> 5476.48]  vlog on float plane with some of our bowling antics and stuff like that so it's cool yeah it was really
[5476.48 --> 5486.72]  fun it was really fun um anyway the point is what is this it's a game gear right okay thank you okay
[5486.72 --> 5492.88]  finally answering the question okay um is there anything is there anything about this particular
[5492.88 --> 5496.40]  hold on let me just get it kind of dialed in for you a little bit here is this the glass front
[5496.40 --> 5503.52]  one can you just chill for a second okay god geez you gotta ruin all the surprises you can never have
[5503.52 --> 5508.00]  a surprise with this guy okay so is there anything about this that kind of stands out to you playing
[5508.00 --> 5511.68]  it so i never had i've literally never used this is the first time i've ever held a game gear in my
[5511.68 --> 5516.40]  life really yeah this was like my childhood console i had i had a snes and i had a game gear and then i
[5516.40 --> 5520.48]  moved to my mom's house and then i had neither of them and i had no consoles ever again i had a game
[5520.48 --> 5526.48]  boy original and then i had a game boy advanced that was it okay so you're uh well we had i think
[5526.48 --> 5533.44]  back in the 90s um you know it doesn't matter what happened in the 90s 90s green seems pretty original
[5534.32 --> 5540.40]  the screen is definitely pretty original so this is the reason that the show was late i wish i'd taken
[5540.40 --> 5548.56]  a picture of what it entailed to turn it into this oh so this is new okay this is completely original a
[5548.56 --> 5556.40]  little rough this is an a5 game gear but like it okay i mean it's a game gear so well i can already
[5556.40 --> 5564.32]  immediately tell when it was here i could tell it's a brand new ips display man we are gonna have to get
[5564.32 --> 5571.04]  heavy into like retro console modding and stuff honestly man when i was when i was working on this
[5571.04 --> 5576.80]  with oh that's so much better is that incredible that's actually like so much because the screen was
[5576.80 --> 5580.80]  honestly the biggest problem yep the viewing angles were terrible but even just outside of that
[5580.80 --> 5585.84]  it wasn't very bright beyond terrible like look at this it just goes completely yellow from the top
[5586.48 --> 5591.92]  and completely white from the bottom there's like this narrow like maybe 10 degrees where you can
[5591.92 --> 5595.60]  actually make out an image on the screen you know what i mean and like legitimately almost just as
[5595.60 --> 5597.36]  bad as it's really dim hold up that one
[5600.48 --> 5605.60]  i got it it is completely a night and day difference there's nothing i can do to make it look
[5605.60 --> 5609.84]  anything like that is that cool or what that's really cool while we were working on this video
[5609.84 --> 5618.24]  i'm sitting here going like oh man there are so many businesses that that our umbrella organization
[5618.24 --> 5624.24]  could get into with just a little bit of startup capital some space and like a handful of employees
[5624.24 --> 5630.40]  that we could just like turn on immediately you know you start you you create some jobs for people with
[5630.40 --> 5635.60]  like uh like micro soldering skills you start creating internal documentation we get into like
[5635.60 --> 5639.60]  console modding i mean there's been so many times right that we've talked about linus you guys should
[5639.60 --> 5644.08]  really do just do like a system builder like why don't you guys just build computers if you like know
[5644.08 --> 5649.68]  how computers are supposed to or you can even just go like the more iFixity route and just sell like kits
[5649.68 --> 5658.40]  well the problem a lot of the time with the kits is that all the engineering work has been done like the guys that make this replacement screen ah the name is on the tip of my tongue sorry it escapes me right now but there's a full video
[5658.40 --> 5664.48]  coming about this don't miss it um they do all the engineering work but the problem is that they're
[5664.48 --> 5669.92]  doing extremely small production runs because these in many cases are really really small organizations
[5669.92 --> 5676.00]  so if you have someone that steps in and goes yeah look i'll i'll pay for you to do 5 000 or 10 000 units
[5676.00 --> 5682.80]  like let's actually make some of these things instead of people waiting in some cases three months oh yeah
[5682.80 --> 5687.44]  yeah for them to produce and then ship them from overseas all of a sudden you've got easy availability of
[5687.44 --> 5694.32]  this stuff in north america easy access to it so yeah i think people would actually pay a markup for
[5694.32 --> 5700.08]  us to sustain our operation and we could totally get into this stuff i know like i don't need more i
[5700.08 --> 5704.24]  don't know if i need more business divisions to run right man it's wild looking at them from here
[5704.24 --> 5709.84]  because the lower one is pure white the screen is purely white and then i can see the uh the upper one
[5709.84 --> 5716.56]  perfectly yeah like um i know with uh 3ds's i think it was people wanted to stream animal crossing back
[5716.56 --> 5722.48]  before there was animal crossing on on switch yeah okay and then then says ducky loot snip yep that's
[5722.48 --> 5727.36]  the one ben then makes the screen thank you okay animal crossing streaming for people that wanted to
[5727.36 --> 5734.24]  do that officially so on an actual 3ds whatever they they were like shipping their 3ds is off to like
[5734.24 --> 5739.84]  some who knows where person and they like might get it back in like half a year who knows the queue's
[5739.84 --> 5745.52]  like super long they might just break your 3ds and just send you one broken back like it was just
[5745.52 --> 5751.44]  yeah i don't know adding adding some uh some more business savvy that space would be pretty cool yeah
[5751.44 --> 5756.56]  and the technical work is there it just needs a little bit of capital that is a little bit of like
[5756.56 --> 5761.20]  trustworthiness like that consolidation the technical expertise is like they've been doing
[5761.20 --> 5766.80]  obviously fantastic work for a long time yeah yeah and you know what the crazy thing is a lot of this
[5766.80 --> 5775.68]  retro console hardware is either open source or like semi open the only reason that no one can get
[5775.68 --> 5780.56]  it is because no one is willing to put the capital into actually doing reasonable size production runs
[5780.56 --> 5786.24]  of these darn things so you know i'm just sitting here going like yeah why why why why don't we just
[5786.80 --> 5794.48]  why don't we just hire you know four or five people we just talk about it once in a while on the show
[5794.48 --> 5800.56]  you end up hiring shank build a brand around it i know right i'm like not even kidding i know right
[5801.12 --> 5806.32]  that's crazy that's cool yeah flow plane's like i love where this is going yeah but you guys love like
[5806.32 --> 5814.88]  everything yeah i can't take you seriously at a certain point have you seen have you seen the the mod
[5814.88 --> 5820.72]  that uh which one that shank did to the to the hot wheels pc or whatever i have it's amazing
[5820.72 --> 5827.92]  it's so amazing i love it uh oh what just happened i thought i just curated one and it disappeared
[5827.92 --> 5833.68]  uh oh yeah no no never mind it's here uh we should do a couple more curated merch messages bell hit me
[5833.68 --> 5840.80]  hello welcome to the editorialized questions uh this one's from derek as an avid beat saber player linus
[5840.80 --> 5848.00]  what are your preferred vr controllers maybe specifically with beat saber uh i have only used the original
[5848.00 --> 5854.08]  vive controllers and oh actually that's that's a lie no i've used the oculus controllers um the oculus
[5854.08 --> 5858.80]  controllers you are objectively wrong about them being better because if you were any good at the
[5858.80 --> 5864.16]  game you would have the problem with the battery covers coming off if you're like actually at speed
[5864.16 --> 5869.28]  like playing um as for the knuckles controllers i wish they were lighter but i guess they're my preferred
[5869.28 --> 5874.72]  because the only ones that i've used with like a proper vr headset plugged into a computer
[5874.72 --> 5882.32]  are the original vive controllers and the knuckles controllers and for everyone who is not catching it
[5882.96 --> 5889.36]  i'm taking the piss right now i'm just teasing the oculus quest is a fantastic value the controllers
[5889.36 --> 5896.72]  are fine but i personally have difficulty going at full speed keeping the battery covers on i just i just
[5896.72 --> 5901.44]  can't do it um i know that there's on which is not great something to note about the original vibe
[5901.44 --> 5907.44]  controllers is i never tried any alternate grips so i'm coming at you from like complete ignorance
[5907.44 --> 5911.76]  because i wasn't very good yet so i was just using like the drumstick grip but there's like ones where
[5911.76 --> 5915.84]  you put your fingers through the holes or something and it oh it redistributes the weight
[5916.40 --> 5922.16]  so that it's so that you're just you're able to rotate the controller more easily i just i'm i'm not
[5922.16 --> 5927.20]  this is probably a new problem i was just teasing derek i always found that the original uh
[5927.20 --> 5933.68]  uh not vive what am i trying to the the valve oculus no the valve valve index index the original
[5933.68 --> 5940.96]  index controllers uh not knuckles there were other index controllers was there not the stick ones that
[5940.96 --> 5946.24]  don't have the wrap around your those are vibe controllers okay yeah those ones then i guess my bad
[5946.24 --> 5953.68]  uh i actually really like the vive controllers uh in regards to how it feels when it translates into
[5954.56 --> 5959.84]  the vr space like it feels like you're actually holding the the beat yeah they have some weight
[5959.84 --> 5964.64]  to them yeah but if you're once you reach a certain level you don't want the weight anymore for sure
[5964.64 --> 5970.64]  yeah that's like i didn't get that far so i was still in the just like more experiential side of
[5970.64 --> 5977.12]  things right or uh yeah yeah vibe into music yeah so they it felt more proper with those but that's my
[5977.12 --> 5984.48]  only actual input all right um from matthew i would love to know the upcoming tech that you think will
[5984.48 --> 5995.36]  we should be looking forward to the most over the next year or two um i mean obviously new gen graphics
[5995.36 --> 6003.76]  cards i think okay you know what yeah i'm gonna pick one the ltd screwdriver amd's leaked zen 4 rdna 3 apu
[6003.76 --> 6010.64]  looks like it could be an absolute utter game changer for entry-level gaming keep gaming pcs
[6011.76 --> 6019.92]  like if you can get your cpu and graphics sorted out remember we're gonna have ddr5 memory so
[6020.64 --> 6025.28]  dramatically more memory bandwidth compared to previous gen platforms which ironically doesn't
[6025.28 --> 6032.24]  matter as much uh for higher end chips that do not need to use their system memory for vram uh so we're
[6032.24 --> 6037.20]  gonna have this high speed memory and i think you are gonna be able to build a legitimate gaming
[6037.20 --> 6046.80]  computer for like 400 500 600 bucks no gpu with no gpu and with great upgradability because these cpu cores
[6046.80 --> 6053.28]  are going to be so fast that instead of there's going to be no reason to buy some like optiplex thing
[6053.28 --> 6058.88]  you should just get you should just get this and it'll be everything you need today while you're like
[6058.88 --> 6065.76]  a you know in high school playing playing you know with high school money and then it'll still be
[6065.76 --> 6072.64]  upgradable once you get out into the workforce and you are making more money you throw a gpu in there
[6072.64 --> 6080.24]  and boom you have actually created no e-waste whatsoever with this machine through two full upgrade
[6080.24 --> 6087.92]  cycles worth of of use like i'm i'm super excited for it it's it's almost certainly not worth anyone actually
[6087.92 --> 6095.04]  making on like any real scale um but like a one-off or something of a of a case that is built for a no
[6095.04 --> 6100.64]  gpu really really really small system would be pretty cool i'd love to see someone like framework
[6100.64 --> 6104.56]  do it or something did you see they released disclosure i'm investor in framework did you
[6104.56 --> 6109.76]  see that they released their main board as a standalone part and then there's like it's either a 3d
[6109.76 --> 6114.64]  printed like schematic they released or there's like a basic case that you can get for it to just
[6114.64 --> 6119.04]  and then it's a computer now it's like oh okay cool that's sweet yeah that's awesome that's actually
[6119.04 --> 6124.24]  really well they said they would so now they're out there keeping promises which is good that means
[6124.24 --> 6128.88]  i don't have to put them on blast publicly which is yeah that's good yeah because i you know it's not
[6128.88 --> 6133.60]  like i want to go out and be like yeah that thing i invested in it sucks and you should hate it
[6134.72 --> 6138.80]  it's not the best financial decision for me gremlin injector in flow plane chat said that there's
[6138.80 --> 6142.48]  there's lots of cases out there because of nooks yeah but i don't i don't i don't want a nook
[6144.16 --> 6148.16]  a lot of cases like that nooks well i mean they're okay not all of them are nook nooks
[6148.16 --> 6153.92]  they like there are amd nookalikes is what i think we call them nookalikes is what we like to call them
[6153.92 --> 6159.68]  internally wow because i think intel actually pronounces it nook so so calling them nookalikes
[6159.68 --> 6166.64]  is really funny yeah yeah it doesn't matter anyway related to that upcoming tech someone asked if you
[6166.64 --> 6174.72]  had seen the ionia air and if you're excited for that i didn't hold on i need to be really careful
[6174.72 --> 6182.32]  the way that i answer this question oh let me just see ionio air is a thin and light i'm just gonna
[6182.32 --> 6190.24]  read what is in this article the makers thank you brad linder of lilputing.com lilputing.com oh like
[6190.24 --> 6195.04]  lilputians that's very cute actually i've been on this site before the makers of the ionio and ionio next
[6195.04 --> 6200.64]  blah blah ionio near less than ooh very light just about the size of a nintendo switch light but it's
[6200.64 --> 6206.40]  a full-fledged windows computer with nexia i'm worried about power envelope in such a small size i
[6206.40 --> 6210.96]  don't know what kind of performance we're gonna get they haven't revealed which processor it'll use yeah
[6210.96 --> 6214.96]  see that's going to be pretty important but the fact that they're not revealing it means it's probably
[6214.96 --> 6222.24]  embargoed which means that um it could be really good because it's something we haven't seen yet 12 rot
[6222.24 --> 6230.16]  ryzen 5000 that's 5.5 or 6 inch display this price will be competitive interesting yeah um okay
[6231.84 --> 6233.44]  that is all i know about it
[6236.24 --> 6236.96]  sounds cool
[6239.68 --> 6240.64]  uh question for luke
[6243.36 --> 6248.24]  yeah how's your personal rig running did you have any issues with the pin that you had to repair none it's
[6248.24 --> 6254.08]  been it's been flawless actually not a single problem it's actually more stable than my previous
[6254.08 --> 6258.32]  computer because my previous computer had some weird motherboard issues i don't know if you remember
[6258.32 --> 6265.68]  that um but yeah no no problems whatsoever it's been great uh from it's even it's even so i do have a
[6265.68 --> 6270.72]  ups but there's been a few power outages at my place um and it's been completely fine through all
[6270.72 --> 6278.00]  of those as well but again i do have a ups to add context to that from davante uh this is my first ltt
[6278.00 --> 6282.08]  store purchase thank you what is your dream product to be able to sell in the ltt store
[6282.08 --> 6288.72]  something that maybe we have absolutely no plans for like computer hardware or anything out of the
[6288.72 --> 6296.56]  ordinary dream hardware you know what's really funny is back when i bought this i was like man i want to
[6296.56 --> 6301.44]  i want to enjoy this but i can't with this screen we should like make kits to upgrade the screen of
[6301.44 --> 6306.00]  the game gear thankfully someone else did it for me massive shout out because you did it as well or
[6306.00 --> 6310.56]  better than we would have and now i don't have to like build a business around that which is cool
[6312.80 --> 6318.80]  so you kind of like almost want to be like a new age radio shack yeah well no i don't know if i'd say
[6318.80 --> 6325.44]  that man what a dream product for us to create you know what i'm going to open up my doc i'm going to open up
[6325.44 --> 6331.20]  my dreams doc um and then why don't we have why luke why don't you get us through a topic while i
[6331.20 --> 6335.76]  while i check the dream job let me see what we got i mean really my immediate dream is to ship a
[6335.76 --> 6344.48]  screwdriver or a backpack fair enough let's not forget about that uh sega is removing old sonic games from
[6344.48 --> 6352.16]  the store why sonic origins is launching june 23rd this is a remaster of the oh that's why this is a
[6352.16 --> 6357.60]  remaster of the first three sonic games released on sega genesis it's apparently going to have
[6357.60 --> 6365.36]  everyone's favorite drm denuvo ray ahead of that sega is pulling games from digital stores they are
[6365.36 --> 6373.68]  pulling sonic the hedgehog 1 sonic the hedgehog 2 sonic 3 sonic and knuckles and sonic cd why would you
[6373.68 --> 6379.20]  remove sonic cd there are a couple of exceptions sonic the hedgehog 1 and 2 will remain available via sega
[6379.20 --> 6387.44]  ages on the nintendo switch and the s and sonic the hedgehog 2 will still be playable via sega genesis
[6387.44 --> 6394.16]  on nintendo switch online plus uh you can just sucks it it does if i was seg i'd be pretty desperate too
[6394.16 --> 6401.36]  but you can still play the games if you already own them uh but customers will no longer be able to
[6401.36 --> 6408.00]  purchase them then there's the discussion question um it says sometimes these newer releases lack features
[6408.00 --> 6413.12]  or have new bugs so why would sega do this either way regardless of what you purchase they get your
[6413.12 --> 6418.80]  money so why not just keep them all up and then anthony says the current rights holders to duke
[6418.80 --> 6423.44]  nukem 3d did something similar with the current edition i didn't even know there was a current
[6423.44 --> 6428.96]  edition the previous superior version was delisted so they could sell a new one granted it had a new
[6428.96 --> 6433.20]  episode but lacked many features and polish yeah this happens all the time yeah this sucks think about
[6433.20 --> 6437.68]  think about the the gta remasters right like those came out and everyone just immediately hated it
[6437.68 --> 6442.48]  think about like anything blizzard has basically ever done the warcraft 3 remastered or reforged or
[6442.48 --> 6446.56]  whatever they called it didn't everyone just like universally pan it it's a disaster if i remember
[6446.56 --> 6453.04]  correctly it hasn't been updated in like a year like at all it's just trash yeah i uh i've got some
[6453.04 --> 6459.12]  answers for you yeah uh answer number one i think we should finally deliver that product that we joked
[6459.12 --> 6469.68]  about like six seven years ago the um uh the clenched to prone uh butt plug pc peripheral honestly
[6469.68 --> 6475.20]  it's not a terrible idea i bet you at this stage in the company we would actually be able to do it i
[6475.20 --> 6479.92]  bet we could get away with it like back then it was like a pipe dream at this time we actually have
[6479.92 --> 6494.56]  the like we could build it engineering know-how i was just waiting to deliver that oh no okay um yeah
[6495.20 --> 6500.48]  yeah and potentially other controllers in the future yeah because or other haptic feedback because you look
[6500.48 --> 6506.56]  at the way you look at the way uh unconventional game controllers have taken off right vision wanting
[6506.56 --> 6513.76]  to take more pretty much any any voluntary muscle in your body could be bound to some kind of control
[6513.76 --> 6518.40]  scheme right so you're just like you're sitting there and you're like okay it's a tense moment you
[6518.40 --> 6527.36]  would just automatically clench to prone playing a horror game yeah where you bind like clenched to prone
[6527.36 --> 6531.92]  except it's bound to like shoot or something to get your position away so you have to like not
[6531.92 --> 6540.08]  yeah it would be so interesting man the streams oh my goodness there's a new category on twitch
[6541.20 --> 6549.44]  it's like man and so hot tubs and unique input devices chat would explode like every time you
[6549.44 --> 6555.52]  every time you crouch every time your flashlight turned on or something like man you know all
[6555.52 --> 6561.76]  all yeah the flash all of those streamers right they you'd bind something and then chat would
[6561.76 --> 6567.52]  absolutely explode every time they like did that thing because you know they just want to know about
[6567.52 --> 6577.36]  that or something because twitch culture yeah you're awful um oh man yep yeah it would absolutely absolutely
[6577.36 --> 6583.60]  be a success absolutely people are asking for haptic feedback oh let's just add that to the of course it
[6583.60 --> 6589.76]  would have to have to have yeah i mean come on and it'd have to be like wireless you don't want to have
[6589.76 --> 6595.36]  like you know um like if you know those pajamas with the little like buttons in the back like you don't
[6595.36 --> 6600.64]  want to be dealing with that and like cable management come on uh people are like he's not wrong
[6600.64 --> 6607.12]  boys shut up and take my money over on twitch chat yeah
[6607.12 --> 6612.48]  yeah i i think we could legitimately build it um there's some other there's some other stuff i have
[6612.48 --> 6620.08]  in my like document of dreams um i would love to build like a bathtub scale rc boat like i think that
[6620.08 --> 6625.84]  would just be so much fun you guys should make a fire truck uh rc fire truck oh my god okay that i
[6625.84 --> 6629.68]  don't want to do the amount of like plastic molding you'd have to do to create a product like that
[6629.68 --> 6634.24]  it'd be terrible just be a good uh homage okay what are some other what are some other like cool
[6634.24 --> 6639.68]  product ideas that i wanted to do oh i wanted to do like a usb cable that stays exactly where you put
[6639.68 --> 6644.56]  it like kind of like a gorilla plot pod like it's like it's bendable so that it's like always in the
[6644.56 --> 6649.60]  same place when you need to reach for it i think it'd be super neat like really stiff yeah yeah um
[6650.80 --> 6659.44]  linish tush tips tush tips uh oh one of the ideas i had like way back in the day now that like cash is
[6659.44 --> 6664.08]  barely a thing anymore thanks covid was like the world's coolest piggy bank so it could be like
[6664.08 --> 6668.00]  wall mounted and it like sorts what you put in it displays the money through acrylic with like
[6668.00 --> 6673.04]  lighting and then there's like buttons to dispense like one or a roll of each coin or you can like key
[6673.04 --> 6678.08]  in how much money you want it'll just be like i thought that would be really cool just like a
[6678.08 --> 6684.88]  like a super fun cool product um there's like so many weird things in here okay here's one
[6684.88 --> 6692.80]  here's a product idea a pcie half height adapter board from a 1x slot to a 16x slot i probably came
[6692.80 --> 6697.76]  up with these before mining i came up with this one before uh gpu mining took off because this
[6697.76 --> 6702.72]  probably like exists now but the idea is to be able to install a 16x card in a 1x slot without
[6702.72 --> 6708.00]  sawing the back out of the slot like i've had to do a number of times in the past um i think yvonne
[6708.00 --> 6718.00]  should write a book so um like uh yvonne's book the youtuber's wife what it's like to be in the support
[6718.00 --> 6725.84]  role like growing an internet famous person without you know being the one that's in the front because
[6725.84 --> 6733.12]  it's actually a huge burden like i remember she had um she she ended up having like a commiseration session
[6733.12 --> 6738.96]  with another youtuber wife where they kind of talk and it turned out they had a lot of the same
[6738.96 --> 6746.32]  challenges and a lot of the same struggles uh just you know and they kind of compared coping mechanisms
[6746.32 --> 6749.76]  and it was just a really interesting conversation and i think it's something people would have found
[6749.76 --> 6755.68]  i only overheard a little bit of it because i was busy youtubing with the guy but it it ended up
[6755.68 --> 6761.36]  being a super interesting conversation um oh here's something okay i get so triggered when
[6761.36 --> 6766.96]  automatic dispensers whether it's for like soap or hand sanitizer or whatever i get so triggered when
[6766.96 --> 6772.08]  they uh when they dispense like three times the amount you need like one of the things people have
[6772.08 --> 6778.48]  actually noticed that there's a mod on my on my soap dispenser in the kids bathroom sort of a mod i
[6778.48 --> 6783.52]  don't know two uh zip ties around the thing shortens so that it shortens the throw so that they
[6783.52 --> 6787.60]  unless they pump it multiple times they actually can't dispense more than they need to wash their
[6787.60 --> 6794.80]  little kitty boo hands and so if i see them pumping it multiple times i'm like hey no one time because
[6794.80 --> 6802.24]  that is the exact correct amount i checked you don't need more and so i would love to just have
[6802.24 --> 6807.04]  dispensers that just always cleanly dispense the exact right amount of stuff and you could just like
[6807.04 --> 6812.08]  adjust it i know that some of that stuff exists but like you know what i wanted to do in terms of a
[6812.08 --> 6816.56]  product when i was younger and this doesn't i i actually really wanted to push it then i realized
[6816.56 --> 6820.72]  that i would have to like i don't think it's going to work because i wouldn't want to sell the product
[6820.72 --> 6826.56]  directly i'd want to sell it to people it's a container basically i want it you know large peanut
[6826.56 --> 6832.16]  butter containers it's always annoying to get into the bottom it's very likely that you're going to get
[6832.16 --> 6835.92]  peanut butter on your hands but on your hands and stuff so what i wanted to do was you know how you
[6835.92 --> 6840.64]  screw the big green lid on usually yeah i want to make it so well green if you're a pleb and you eat
[6840.64 --> 6845.84]  smooth but yes carry on well i don't eat smooth oh you're a might be a brand thing i like crunchy
[6845.84 --> 6850.32]  for sure oh okay no crunchies like absolutely okay my brand green is smooth okay i don't know
[6851.92 --> 6855.60]  i wanted to make so that halfway through the container there was the same type of screw
[6855.60 --> 6861.44]  mechanism that the lid has like exactly the same and i figured out ways to do this so that once you're
[6861.44 --> 6865.76]  about halfway through you could unscrew the top and then take the lid and put it on the lower half
[6865.76 --> 6871.68]  i like it yeah i like but selling that as a product doesn't work yeah that's tough because it
[6871.68 --> 6876.88]  already comes in a container so yeah that's the problem with my uh with my dispensers thing yeah
[6876.88 --> 6879.92]  because like how do you get make that like a toothpaste was one of the ones i had here well
[6879.92 --> 6886.32]  people you take your whole toothpaste and like into the first soap a lot of people buy soap dispensers oh
[6886.32 --> 6890.48]  well yeah that's soap yes for toothpaste though you're right yeah some of the other ones what are some of the
[6890.48 --> 6894.88]  other things i have you could probably get a toothpaste that squeezes the tube of toothpaste
[6894.88 --> 6901.68]  the right way yeah oh that sounds like a lot of engineering sounds significantly more difficult yeah
[6902.48 --> 6907.92]  uh are they are they talking about soap sorry i just zoned out yeah yeah yeah actually
[6909.76 --> 6918.16]  uh easy text station that ended up getting done by someone else um yeah i don't know i guess that's oh i
[6918.16 --> 6922.08]  i had the idea of doing like a kiosk that prints greeting cards on demand instead of requiring a
[6922.08 --> 6926.40]  huge inventory and like a whole aisle uh has probably someone's done that at this point that
[6926.40 --> 6930.88]  was like 10 years ago or something like that i write it wrote that wrote that down i came up with
[6930.88 --> 6935.68]  the idea of curated gift shopping like a thousand years ago so you just like fill out a survey about
[6935.68 --> 6940.64]  the person you're shopping for and it just like spits out a gift recommendation or like orders it for you
[6940.64 --> 6947.04]  also this one is one that i wish that yvonne had like had the bandwidth to pursue because i think she could have
[6947.04 --> 6954.24]  built like a bigger business than lmg just like doing her thing um but a kid's clothing service that
[6954.24 --> 6959.12]  just gives you the next size up like when you're ready and then you can just credit your old stuff
[6959.12 --> 6966.00]  by sending it back so effectively like because kids clothes man a lot of it will wear out sure fine but a
[6966.00 --> 6972.16]  lot of it they are going to use for such a short period of time and so lightly that it's like kind of a
[6972.16 --> 6980.64]  hassle to have to to have to deal with like getting rid of it um and so just reducing waste by creating
[6980.64 --> 6986.08]  a service where it will just automatically send you the next size or you can just like press one button
[6986.08 --> 6992.16]  and like all the sizing is done in like a standardized way across like instead of having to deal with all
[6992.16 --> 6995.76]  the different brands and all the different sizing like ordering clothes online is a nightmare and for
[6995.76 --> 6999.68]  kids it's even more of a nightmare because obviously they're you know they're all different right
[6999.68 --> 7004.64]  so being able to just go okay yeah here's their new size and everything shows up everything fits
[7004.64 --> 7009.28]  um i i think it's super valuable and i think there's a company that's already doing that but we came up
[7009.28 --> 7016.00]  with that idea a long time ago and it could have been absolutely killer absolutely killer yeah send the
[7016.00 --> 7022.16]  ripped stuff back for recycling in a small credit i think it could have totally reduced waste reduced cost
[7022.16 --> 7027.84]  um like honestly our kids own almost no new clothing because brand new kids clothing is stupid there is
[7027.84 --> 7035.20]  so much perfectly good kids clothing out there that is just sitting rotting in a thrift store because
[7035.84 --> 7043.92]  they just get so much more intake than they can possibly sell so yeah uh people are saying some
[7043.92 --> 7048.96]  of the places that do that yeah exactly is it called rent a swag is this an idea on parks and rec oh okay
[7048.96 --> 7053.84]  apparently parks and rec did a bit on this well there you go not my idea then but makes makes i don't know
[7053.84 --> 7059.60]  if i've never watched parks and rec but it makes a lot of sense especially in the kids context oh yeah
[7059.60 --> 7063.76]  for sure i think that's more specific it sounds like the parks and rec one just because it's called
[7063.76 --> 7068.00]  swag i'm assuming it's more adult focused one which is still i mean there's still some value there but
[7068.00 --> 7072.40]  it's much more interesting in the kids context because like for me i can wear a shirt for many years as
[7072.40 --> 7078.64]  long as the shirt doesn't deteriorate because i'm not growing yeah yeah exactly when you're growing
[7078.64 --> 7082.88]  constantly it's a bit of a problem oh shoot there was something else uh shoot i just came up with
[7082.88 --> 7087.36]  something and i guess i i forgot about it i was gonna say i would love to have uh something and i
[7087.36 --> 7093.68]  forget i guess it doesn't really matter why don't we just move on to the next uh next thing yeah from
[7093.68 --> 7098.96]  anon what are your thoughts on the aura ring and the mandatory paid subscription any other thoughts or
[7098.96 --> 7104.16]  reviews coming my thoughts on the aura ring are that i like it my thoughts on the paid themselves
[7104.16 --> 7112.64]  um i i did end up getting fomoed into getting the latest gen 3 they offered it to gen 1 or gen 2
[7112.64 --> 7118.08]  owners uh with a lifetime subscription if you upgrade like now so i was like i actually like
[7118.08 --> 7124.08]  this thing enough to buy another one and flip my old one but i do not like it enough to pay for it
[7124.08 --> 7130.00]  forever so i guess i'll go for it fair enough it does give me some useful insights i had the lowest
[7130.00 --> 7135.44]  readiness score since i got it uh while i had covid so it seems accurate apparently the parks and rec thing
[7135.44 --> 7141.36]  is literally based around kids so oh okay well there you go i came up with the exact same thing
[7142.00 --> 7147.44]  um or maybe i maybe parks and rec was on in a room somewhere while i was present and i like
[7147.44 --> 7155.28]  subliminally absorbed it i don't know oh man there was man there was something ah
[7155.28 --> 7163.28]  ah it doesn't matter i guess i i guess i'm over it crap okay
[7166.72 --> 7171.84]  from garrison hey luke and linus what are the biggest tech failures you wish would have been a
[7171.84 --> 7179.84]  success i think we've done this one before i think we basically said um uh oh man it's on zoom
[7179.84 --> 7185.20]  like i don't know there's there's i'm sure there's other stuff i remember saying something
[7185.20 --> 7189.92]  i think we did this one recently yeah from joshua hey linus how big of a role do you play in the
[7189.92 --> 7196.24]  creative process at ltc in 2022 except for hosting and reviewing scripts did covid uh affect the team
[7196.24 --> 7203.28]  in any way i mean obviously covid affects everyone who gets it um fortunately we haven't had any you
[7203.28 --> 7208.64]  know severe severe cases where anyone's i guess i can't really speak about medical things
[7208.64 --> 7214.32]  fortunately everyone's good how about that uh we're really pleased that we we haven't had to
[7214.32 --> 7221.20]  announce any covid fatalities out of our staff um as far as me i mean it only really affected me
[7221.92 --> 7228.24]  making my brain pretty foggy for a while and being really sick for a shorter while as far as being
[7228.24 --> 7233.28]  involved in the creative process i i would like to think i am fairly involved in the creative process
[7233.28 --> 7237.68]  still and that's something that i want to continue to be involved in the team is amazing they come
[7237.68 --> 7242.08]  up with ideas that i never would have i still do like to think that i contribute pretty significantly
[7242.08 --> 7252.16]  to making ideas better um i i am still the where the buck stops in terms of what videos get made we have
[7252.16 --> 7259.52]  weekly meetings um that james and i run with the rest of the writing team um a lot of the time
[7260.88 --> 7266.32]  i will end up just kind of rewriting things on the fly you know if we've got sort of a particular
[7266.32 --> 7270.56]  idea for how something goes and i'm like oh actually did we think of this angle and it's like
[7270.56 --> 7276.08]  oh um no that's a little bit different and we'll just kind of run with it from there uh one of the
[7276.08 --> 7280.08]  things that i do that i am still really good at is thinking on my feet if something goes wrong in the
[7280.08 --> 7287.36]  middle of a shoot that's that's where my creativity will definitely come into play um there are things
[7287.36 --> 7292.48]  that you know i have to be clear i'm not always right like i've been wrong many times uh jake is one of the
[7292.48 --> 7298.88]  ones that has really pushed me to like take the low-hanging fruit once in a while my dude you know
[7298.88 --> 7304.16]  stuff like linus responds to me in comments the those were jake and james initiatives getting me to
[7304.16 --> 7310.40]  do more stuff like that um jake has been chasing me to do way more house updates for you guys but
[7310.40 --> 7314.88]  what it took to do it was for me to get sick and literally not be able to make any other video
[7314.88 --> 7322.72]  so uh i think i think sometimes you have to you have to break line is down okay we were trying to
[7322.72 --> 7329.36]  get you to do lower hanging fruit for since day one the entire existence of the company look i always
[7329.36 --> 7332.80]  want to do bigger and better i don't think there's anything wrong with that but i don't think there's
[7332.80 --> 7337.12]  anything wrong with low-hanging fruit either a lot of times not all the time and you have to do
[7337.12 --> 7341.36]  bigger and better sometimes but sometimes that's just what people want it can break a team oh i
[7341.36 --> 7345.68]  remember what i was gonna say right uh one of the other things that i had really wanted to do was
[7345.68 --> 7351.12]  a handheld gaming pc but um valve and aya and one x player saved me the trouble because they they're
[7351.12 --> 7357.20]  like really good so i no longer feel compelled yeah no reason to do it that space has a lot of
[7357.20 --> 7361.68]  competition yeah it's great i love it yeah i'm excited i think that's the next big form factor
[7361.68 --> 7370.08]  and honestly you know if i'm someone like nintendo who has just sat completely unopposed as king queen
[7370.08 --> 7378.96]  god emperor of the handheld gaming space i am shaking in my boots right now absolutely shaking
[7378.96 --> 7385.04]  in my boots because i was sitting here thinking oh well i can just charge 20 30 40 50 dollars for
[7385.04 --> 7391.12]  like ancient software and because i have a monopoly people will pay it oh boy now i got to compete with
[7391.12 --> 7396.32]  like steam like cheap games on steam and like the e-word
[7396.32 --> 7407.60]  it's challenging yeah yeah you might actually have to like make new games and faster better consoles
[7407.60 --> 7412.96]  impossible no what we should really do is just take more wii u games and release them on switch
[7415.28 --> 7418.08]  are you secretly a nintendo executive yes
[7418.08 --> 7425.60]  you know like it's actually stunning to me that i think no there's a switch smash i think actually
[7426.24 --> 7434.32]  um there's no new mario kart it's it's just mario kart from wii u i know like what i heard i i haven't
[7434.32 --> 7438.48]  actually looked into it i heard there's a new dlc coming from mario kart that's actually like huge
[7438.48 --> 7444.00]  yeah like it's an expansion yeah so that's cool i mean basically every mario kart is a dlc anyway so it
[7444.00 --> 7448.24]  seems fine fair enough yeah yeah yeah for sure so like that that's cool i'm actually happy about
[7448.24 --> 7452.64]  that but like wow the the length of time that they just let ips sit because they can just keep
[7452.64 --> 7457.92]  selling it for full price anyways is crazy i just bought my son a copy of legend of zelda breath of
[7457.92 --> 7462.96]  the wild you want to know how much i paid for it probably full price 79 canadian yeah oh my and you
[7462.96 --> 7466.88]  know what i'm really mad about is i was gonna it was on sale at christmas time and i was like i'm
[7466.88 --> 7472.88]  gonna order this and then i was just like lazy and i missed the sale goes back and he asked for it for
[7472.88 --> 7478.08]  his birthday okay i shouldn't say i paid for it uh it was more complicated than that actually
[7478.72 --> 7488.80]  you know what i'm oh man a relative paid for it but we compensated a relative through like
[7489.52 --> 7496.48]  other things yeah you know what it doesn't matter the point is it was expensive yeah yeah and it sucked
[7496.48 --> 7502.56]  it sucks because it's like a four and a half year old game or whatever um it's joshua also asked uh
[7502.56 --> 7506.48]  how are things going with backpack and screwdriver notification numbers the backpack is sitting at
[7506.48 --> 7516.80]  42 798 we have so that new bigger lab um we hopefully have secured favorable financing terms
[7516.80 --> 7523.84]  so we only need uh i think 10 down which is good because that allowed us to buy 10 000 more backpacks
[7523.84 --> 7527.20]  oh okay yeah so we bought more backpacks we have 40 000 coming which means
[7527.20 --> 7533.84]  most of you will be able to get a backpack if you had to take a wager not not i'm not actually
[7533.84 --> 7538.56]  asking for a real wager if you had to take a guess um what type of conversion rate do you think you're
[7538.56 --> 7543.04]  going to get from notification sign we are hoping for somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 percent
[7543.04 --> 7547.28]  that would be on the high side compared to what we get for out of stock notifications
[7547.28 --> 7554.24]  but because these are items that have been so in demand for so long and we've received so many
[7554.24 --> 7559.04]  inquiries um and they've never been available before so it's not like a back in stock notification
[7559.04 --> 7564.88]  this is like a hey if you don't get it now there's actually more people signed up to get notifications
[7564.88 --> 7571.20]  to get this than like we can make with our current cash flow um i i'm hoping for higher than typical
[7571.20 --> 7578.24]  typical somewhere in the neighborhood of like 20 to 25 percent yeah okay cool yeah however with a product
[7578.24 --> 7584.24]  like this i suspect a lot of people just are not bothering to sign up for notifications and it is
[7584.24 --> 7589.76]  entirely possible that when the first you know 10 000 screwdrivers of first 10 000 backpacks arrive
[7589.76 --> 7596.32]  they will literally be immediately gone i'm sure that's true so yeah it could be interesting yeah you
[7596.32 --> 7603.28]  know what i think we might do i don't want to take pre-orders but i think for the first time i might be
[7603.28 --> 7610.24]  willing to take back orders and it's more because both the backpack and the screwdriver are going to
[7610.24 --> 7615.68]  be in production because the volumes are so high it's not like we haven't placed the order it's not
[7615.68 --> 7619.28]  like the factory isn't working on it but the deliveries are going to be spaced out a backorder
[7619.28 --> 7624.96]  is very different yeah so backpacks for example our 10 000 unit orders are going to arrive somewhere in
[7624.96 --> 7629.92]  the neighborhood of one to three weeks apart oh so it's not like sorry keep going so it's not like we
[7629.92 --> 7635.60]  are taking your money and maybe in six months you will get a product no these are ordered by the
[7635.60 --> 7642.00]  time we sell out of the first shipment um probably two more shipments will be on the water like it is
[7642.00 --> 7648.08]  definitely coming um and so i think for the first time we're just going to have to take back orders
[7648.08 --> 7654.16]  because otherwise i don't know how we would fairly distribute them unfortunately our mechanism for
[7654.16 --> 7661.04]  notifying um for sending email notifications when an item comes back in stock is not very good
[7661.04 --> 7667.60]  all 40 000 of those people are going to get an email at once and so if they don't of them will be at
[7667.60 --> 7671.04]  home depending on their time zone some they're going to be sleeping some they're going to be at work
[7671.92 --> 7676.24]  so if we don't give them an opportunity to kind of grab something from the second wave
[7676.24 --> 7681.36]  then they have to what we have to have them go sign up for a notification again we don't have a good way
[7681.36 --> 7685.12]  to manage it right now so i think taking back orders might be the only way to that might make
[7685.12 --> 7688.56]  sense and that's that's not the same thing as a pre-order because people will see reviews from
[7688.56 --> 7692.80]  other users and all that kind of stuff before like it's it's out in the wild yes before they make that
[7692.80 --> 7696.64]  purchase so i think that's going to be my compromise and you know what different honestly i don't want
[7696.64 --> 7701.44]  to say never as far as pre-orders go once it's items that we have a little bit more expertise in we
[7701.44 --> 7705.36]  might take pre-orders for a follow-up screwdriver where we're just going yeah it's the same ratchet
[7705.36 --> 7711.60]  mechanism uh we're working with the same uh you know the same tooling manufacturers for the molds
[7711.60 --> 7715.68]  it's going to be that thing but it's going to be small yeah we'll take your pre-order i you know i
[7715.68 --> 7721.92]  this one has like an empty back instead of the there's some variants that we're looking at right now
[7721.92 --> 7727.44]  based on the based on the reception to the release to the impending release of this one and based on how
[7727.44 --> 7734.24]  good we know the product is there's going to be more tools um so i'm not saying never i'm just saying
[7734.24 --> 7739.68]  these are unproven i don't want to take your money let's let's get them out there and we'll go from
[7739.68 --> 7748.80]  there cool um so yeah 42 798 for backpack 41 850 for black and orange screwdrivers and 37 421 for all
[7748.80 --> 7756.32]  black screwdrivers ah did we get sorry did we get 18 more all black notifications while i was talking
[7756.32 --> 7763.60]  about it we're at 42 810 for backpack hold on refresh again okay just y'all need to chill out yeah less
[7763.60 --> 7769.60]  than a minute okay this is all less than a minute ago uh people signing up have you have you announced
[7769.60 --> 7774.72]  in a mainline video that there's even signups yes we have okay yeah yeah i thought it might have just
[7774.72 --> 7779.52]  been weighing uh speaking of when why don't we do like another topic or something sure apple launch
[7779.52 --> 7783.92]  or self-repair actually are we in pretty good shape as far as topics oh twitter accepts elon musk's
[7783.92 --> 7791.12]  offer to buy twitter but you know what i think that's all i have to say about that dude to to not talk about
[7791.12 --> 7797.92]  the the purchasee and to talk about the thing that was purchased um i i did a little bit more looking
[7797.92 --> 7803.36]  into this and it was sparked by an atriog video but i i did a little bit more looking into this and
[7803.36 --> 7810.24]  man do i just think he got scammed you think so it's just trash okay first of all uh i found from a
[7810.24 --> 7818.48]  different source that they've been like uh i don't want to say falsely reporting um mistakenly reporting
[7818.48 --> 7822.56]  inaccurately reporting whatever you want to say sure their user counts twitter they've like
[7822.56 --> 7827.92]  literally as far as my yeah i i wish i had a link for this i believe it's like millions of users less
[7827.92 --> 7833.20]  than they said yeah to be fair i think it's like two or three million compared to the like 200 and
[7833.20 --> 7840.64]  whatever million that they actually have yeah but it's still like it's a lot of people less than what
[7840.64 --> 7847.68]  is actually there huh and like of course they find that out exactly now also i i have heard let's look
[7847.68 --> 7852.16]  this up let's see if i can find it right now it's crazy it's you know what let's put it in context for
[7852.16 --> 7861.76]  a second amazon bought twitch for one billion dollars okay okay listen to this and we thought that was
[7861.76 --> 7868.96]  crazy and it probably was because oh wait is it even in the doc this week talking about twitch the
[7868.96 --> 7875.36]  rumored 50 50 uh revenue split and like forcing streamers to uh like play more ads and stuff i have
[7875.36 --> 7881.04]  some hot takes on that so we'll definitely talk about it so so this is i hope this blows your brain
[7881.04 --> 7886.08]  because it blew the heck out of mine and i want some companionship here because this is nuts because
[7886.08 --> 7890.88]  i've been talking about how like ridiculous twitter is forever and this is actually driving me insane
[7890.88 --> 7896.08]  take a guess at what their annual research and development expenses were for 2021.
[7897.68 --> 7903.76]  i don't know uh twitter hold on hold on hold on okay okay just give me a second yeah no sorry you can't
[7903.76 --> 7907.92]  you can't ask me a big question like that and be like come on no answer answer yeah yeah okay i'm
[7907.92 --> 7912.72]  thinking i'm thinking i will give you i mean okay i want to think i want to think let me think let me
[7912.72 --> 7918.32]  think okay okay so they have software developers yeah okay software developers are very expensive yes
[7918.32 --> 7925.52]  so if their team is more than like five six people you know their total expenses and and remember your
[7925.52 --> 7929.44]  expenses includes more than just salaries right these people have to have a place to work they need
[7929.44 --> 7933.36]  equipment and salaries are more expensive people realize because there's government yeah they need
[7933.36 --> 7940.40]  skittles okay and m&ms it's a modern modern web smarties oh which i oh no not smarties that's more of
[7940.40 --> 7945.44]  like a different candy in the states okay um um it doesn't matter the point is they need candy uh they're
[7945.44 --> 7951.44]  developers okay so uh so if you have even like a handful of developers you're already spending a million
[7951.44 --> 7957.12]  dollars a year so i'm gonna say they have more than just a handful of developers i'm gonna say they spend
[7957.12 --> 7963.28]  20 million a year okay
[7966.80 --> 7977.44]  how far up am i um orders of magnitude orders yes shut up no they sorry two billion dollars a year
[7978.00 --> 7984.72]  uh so maybe not quite but 1.247 billion was their spend in 2021
[7984.72 --> 7993.52]  look at what they've done with it this is the like what are you doing and the oh they're so bad
[7993.52 --> 8000.56]  like what did he buy this is so trash and like okay if you're a developer at twitter i'm sorry it's
[8000.56 --> 8005.04]  honestly probably not your fault looking at that amount of expenditure and what you've been able to
[8005.04 --> 8010.48]  produce this is probably a management issue i know i'm regurgitating atrioc on that point but i completely
[8010.48 --> 8016.56]  agree with him that has got to be a management issue the fact that you can't take one one and a
[8016.56 --> 8023.60]  quarter billion dollars and create something better than like a glorified forum for admittedly a lot of
[8023.60 --> 8030.88]  people wait is crazy wait hold on a second 1.2 billion dollars is just r d or actually includes
[8030.88 --> 8035.36]  operating expenses of running the platform research and development expenses for 2021
[8036.16 --> 8048.00]  it's up 42.81 percent from 2020 which was 0.873 billion dollars it's still closer to 1 billion than then
[8048.00 --> 8052.80]  what did you say 20 million i said 20 million i figured they might have a team of like 50 60
[8052.80 --> 8058.56]  dads like what do they even do all day what do they do all day they killed they killed vine
[8060.32 --> 8066.24]  which like if you were able to fast forward into the future and see tick tock yeah well killing vine
[8066.24 --> 8070.56]  was just obviously stupid like even at the time you didn't even need to fast forward vine was huge
[8070.56 --> 8074.88]  one of the biggest things on youtube i don't know if you're like into youtube at that point in time
[8074.88 --> 8080.80]  one of the biggest things on youtube for even years after vine shut down now was vine compilations
[8081.44 --> 8087.76]  they were huge vine shutting down created some of the biggest youtubers that have ever existed
[8088.48 --> 8094.96]  they shut that platform down just gave it away they are only now running just twitter
[8095.60 --> 8100.08]  it's one and a quarter billion dollars some people brought up in the past when i ragged them for the
[8100.08 --> 8104.40]  edit button and i was like you could do this in a week yes that's not enough time
[8105.20 --> 8110.64]  sure i know i know yes it's more complicated because they have to reference things in a lot
[8110.64 --> 8114.32]  of different places and they're trying to be very data scalable and they they're going to get embedded
[8114.32 --> 8119.36]  on websites and have to deal with that and yada yada yada and it's been built a certain way i get it
[8119.36 --> 8122.80]  they spend one and a quarter billion dollars on r d
[8124.88 --> 8131.20]  figure it out you can send people to space what is spacex's uh just for another one of his companies
[8131.20 --> 8138.00]  spacex r d budget let's see if it's even public okay um
[8142.64 --> 8149.20]  all right um i'm just seeing comments about this so i'm not entirely certain but like that is an insane
[8149.20 --> 8158.72]  an absolutely ludicrous r d budget for what they've actually produced on twitter i do understand these
[8158.72 --> 8164.88]  massive development teams for these like really really really high-end companies there is a lot
[8164.88 --> 8169.76]  more technical bureaucracy in the way there's positives and negatives to that i'm not going
[8169.76 --> 8173.76]  to get like way into that now i know only certain people can actually push code and you're going to run
[8173.76 --> 8181.68]  into bottlenecks and like all this stuff happens absolutely but here's the thing apple spent 19
[8181.68 --> 8187.84]  billion dollars on r d for the fiscal year ending in september 2020 and has a product lineup that
[8187.84 --> 8196.40]  includes multiple operating systems and they're working on like cars and stuff like they're super
[8196.40 --> 8201.28]  wide-reaching at apple well yeah and the thing you got to realize about apple is that that's one honestly
[8201.28 --> 8206.56]  that's one thing that pisses me off the most about apple is that they are often at the forefront of
[8206.56 --> 8216.88]  product development whether it's micro lead display um you know exploration for wrist devices or or vr
[8216.88 --> 8222.08]  or like you say like cars or whatever it is they are often on the cutting freaking edge oh yeah we just
[8222.08 --> 8228.88]  like don't get to see a lot of it yeah or it's ludicrously priced um but like apple only spent
[8228.88 --> 8235.12]  like one point one and a half times that probably by by the time we're looking at the same year or
[8235.12 --> 8241.84]  sorry sorry uh 10 10 15 times what does this work out to i'm sorry math is still got cover bringing
[8241.84 --> 8248.96]  about 15 times the amount apple definitely has and apple is also a company that i often look at and go
[8249.84 --> 8256.40]  wow they spend an awful lot on r d for how many products they actually pay yeah i mean when apple is
[8256.40 --> 8267.12]  making you look like a complete idiot when it comes to r d spending insane like actually crazy i had
[8267.84 --> 8273.68]  no idea i've honestly spent a lot of this time when i'm like ragging on how trash twitter is i've spent
[8273.68 --> 8279.84]  a lot of it just assuming that it's a like really small team that's just raking in the dough because
[8279.84 --> 8285.36]  there's like none of them and they have this really massive platform but that's not even true it also
[8285.36 --> 8292.96]  wasn't profitable bro you got ripped the hell off yeah you bought a dumpster fire that's a big problem
[8292.96 --> 8300.88]  is like a twitter how on earth are you gonna turn a profit apparently uh when he who shall not be named
[8300.88 --> 8307.60]  uh got loans to to make this purchase yeah a lot of it the discussions at the bank included actually
[8307.60 --> 8313.68]  reducing staff count as one of the ways to approach profitability sure um and also he had apparently some
[8313.68 --> 8318.24]  other ideas i don't know i didn't really look into it that far but like apparently chopping down
[8318.24 --> 8324.88]  staff count is part of it and i believe he specified like executives which honestly looking at the spend
[8324.88 --> 8329.52]  and what they're getting out of it is probably the correct approach sure and i i don't know what
[8329.52 --> 8334.16]  executives i know nothing about twitter i know nothing about anyone that works there yeah i i know i'm not
[8334.16 --> 8341.28]  claiming anyone individually i don't care it doesn't matter but something has got to be going wrong here i i like it it
[8341.28 --> 8348.32]  it it's insane apparently um yeah i know i'm getting a bunch of conflicting numbers about spacex and i
[8348.32 --> 8353.36]  don't really care just sending something to space seemed like a a funny thing to reference but like
[8354.08 --> 8360.64]  i can't tell if binary c here is being verbally ironic or not but they said an unprofitable dumpster
[8360.64 --> 8366.88]  fire with a large intangible value is an ideal company to take private i i would actually think it's
[8366.88 --> 8371.92]  the opposite the other way around it's an ideal company to like go public yeah and take a bunch
[8371.92 --> 8382.88]  of people's money and then and then take or see out sorry sorry uh just take take off pco yeah yeah
[8382.88 --> 8394.64]  it's uh that's crazy i um i just i i i don't think i've been stunned by a statement that hard let's play a
[8394.64 --> 8402.16]  game okay because it's not like elon's the first billionaire to buy a media organization as a way to
[8402.16 --> 8410.40]  swing an unprofitable media organization as a way to swing their their thing around uh bezos bought the
[8410.40 --> 8415.04]  washington post and then and then immediately articles started running that were like extremely
[8415.04 --> 8422.64]  positive bezos but yeah sorry um yeah so so okay you're a billionaire okay which would you rather have
[8422.64 --> 8430.72]  you buy washington post or twitter um oh man i don't know uh i mean if i'm if i'm what is it
[8430.72 --> 8439.12]  rupert murdoch i just buy all of them um that's i don't know i feel like they're they're very different
[8439.12 --> 8444.64]  approaches because on one of them you're attempting well i don't know i don't want to presume what he's
[8444.64 --> 8450.64]  doing with it um yeah but and one of them you're you're wrestling some form of control
[8452.88 --> 8457.12]  i'm not placing intentions at all you're wrestling this is i think objective you're wrestling some
[8457.12 --> 8464.40]  form of control of an open forum yeah and in the other one you're theoretically not asserting any kind
[8464.40 --> 8469.68]  of control over it well no which the eu also already made very clear is absolutely not going to
[8469.68 --> 8474.24]  be happening unless twitter wants to pay i think somewhere in the neighborhood of seven percent of
[8474.24 --> 8479.84]  its of its turnover per year in fines they're like yeah you actually do need to regulate hate speech on
[8479.84 --> 8486.16]  the platform or you will either be fined to this degree or you will just be outright banned in the eu
[8486.16 --> 8491.36]  which would actually be pretty bad um for twitter well i mean they just lose money anyway so i guess
[8491.36 --> 8498.00]  yeah yeah i guess the fewer users the more profitable the better the balance sheet chop that r d budget down
[8498.00 --> 8507.28]  um i don't yeah i don't know i uh i feel like you probably get more direct direct value if that's your
[8507.28 --> 8512.80]  goal and i mean he hasn't stated that's his goal so i guess it's not his goal but i think you get more
[8512.80 --> 8521.20]  direct value by buying the uh the publication i'll be very interested to see what happens
[8521.20 --> 8530.96]  when and if there is some kind of non-free speech move that takes place on twitter whether it is um
[8530.96 --> 8536.48]  you know what whatever the perception of it is i'll be interested to see how that goes
[8536.48 --> 8541.68]  all right why don't we move on to some more merch messages from joe they asked specifically about
[8541.68 --> 8545.84]  final fantasy 6 but i'm going to open up the question a bit what are your preferred ways to play
[8545.84 --> 8553.60]  old games on original hardware remasters re-releases emulators etc final fantasy 6 is a funny one because
[8553.60 --> 8559.84]  the original translation has a lot of character in it that is not true to the original text so it's it's
[8559.84 --> 8565.20]  bad it's flawed in that sense but because i grew up with it without classic lines like son of a
[8565.20 --> 8572.32]  submariner i i just i find it hard to enjoy it um i i really liked the way that the characters were
[8572.32 --> 8583.60]  developed by what's his name bill bill something um i have to see uh six translator uh ted woolsey
[8583.60 --> 8589.28]  sorry not bill anything ted woolsey was the translator for various square games including a couple of my
[8589.28 --> 8596.00]  favorites final fantasy 6 and chrono trigger and i i honestly yeah maybe he was a bad translator in the
[8596.00 --> 8604.72]  sense that he added some of his own character to the text but i actually really enjoyed his style
[8604.72 --> 8611.52]  and so playing it again with any kind of fixed translation is a little i don't know it's a little
[8612.08 --> 8617.60]  weird for me with that said trying to share some of my favorite games from my childhood with my kids
[8617.60 --> 8621.84]  it's very clear that there are creature comforts that they take for granted in modern games that make
[8621.84 --> 8626.56]  old games just not as enjoyable for them so if i was going to recommend a version then i would
[8626.56 --> 8633.68]  probably recommend the pixel remaster um there's there's also the uh oh man what's it called there's
[8633.68 --> 8645.68]  a final fantasy 6 sort of uh fan c6 fan version i i like the idea of remasters because i find a lot of
[8645.68 --> 8649.60]  times if i think about old video games they look better in my head than they do in reality
[8649.60 --> 8659.12]  um but i have been burned by so many remasters over the years that what i default to wanting is a
[8659.12 --> 8664.24]  properly functioning version of the original game which if i don't have to emulate is great if i do
[8664.24 --> 8674.08]  have to emulate is fine um that's usually where i land best versions relocalization uncensored edition
[8674.08 --> 8680.80]  sprites more like they're japanese originals i don't know there's one there's one cool one that's
[8680.80 --> 8685.12]  like kind of altered in in ways that make the combat more interesting and there's like like a bunch of
[8685.12 --> 8688.48]  changes to it i really free oh brave new world brave new world that's the one thank you twitch chat
[8689.12 --> 8693.20]  um i tried it i made it like halfway through the game and it was like pretty good honestly it was
[8693.20 --> 8698.32]  pretty cool but you know when i go back and play an old game honestly i'd rather just play the version i
[8698.32 --> 8702.56]  remember even if it's super broken like i played back through final fantasy tactics recently and just
[8703.36 --> 8706.72]  yeah there are things that are super stupid and frustrating about it but that's
[8707.28 --> 8712.08]  why i that's why i enjoy it so i like playing the original version i do still like some creature
[8712.08 --> 8716.72]  comfort things like save states that's why i'll almost exclusively play on an emulator i think the
[8716.72 --> 8720.24]  game gear is a bit of an exception for me where i really do just want to play it on the original
[8720.24 --> 8726.48]  hardware because like the ergonomics are different there's no controller on earth that feels like that in
[8726.48 --> 8732.56]  your hand yeah yeah yeah like that is just clearly meant to be played on here yeah um
[8735.28 --> 8740.72]  okay from nick would you say the labs project is something you see as a big profit making
[8740.72 --> 8744.40]  investment or are you more doing it because you don't like the direction of the industry and you're
[8744.40 --> 8752.24]  using your position to change it a little from column a little from column b i think that as a business owner
[8752.24 --> 8760.24]  it is um it would be extremely irresponsible of me to just do stuff that is going to put the financial
[8760.24 --> 8769.28]  security of myself my family and my team in jeopardy if i didn't believe that we can make money on labs
[8769.28 --> 8774.72]  it's not something that i would be able to justify the multi-million dollar investment that we're going to
[8774.72 --> 8780.80]  be making into it before we can have any hope of turning a profit um but with that said there are
[8780.80 --> 8787.20]  absolutely things that we could pursue in the mid in the short mid and long term that would be more
[8787.20 --> 8797.60]  profitable than labs so on the one hand yes um my intention is to make money i have never used to be i have
[8797.60 --> 8804.48]  never claimed to be anything other than running a business and honestly i think that's the reason you
[8804.48 --> 8810.40]  guys should trust me because if i was doing something other than running a business i might
[8810.40 --> 8815.60]  try to get away with stuff like i you know way back in the day you know i we'd have people who are sort
[8815.60 --> 8819.76]  of questioning you know are we going to be honest with you guys and the answer was always well yeah
[8819.76 --> 8826.48]  because the internet never forgets and if we screw with you guys you will know you will find out and you
[8826.48 --> 8834.64]  will know forever so transparency has always been the best way for us to retain that trust and that
[8834.64 --> 8842.00]  trust is the most valuable thing to us so because this is a this is a business that we're running and
[8842.00 --> 8850.32]  our main value as an organization is viewer trust then the relationship is very clear i never like to
[8850.32 --> 8856.08]  enter an an arrangement or a business agreement that where i don't understand the value to both sides
[8856.08 --> 8863.52]  the value to my side is making money the value to your side is getting entertainment and information
[8863.52 --> 8872.24]  so if i can't keep doing those things i'm not going to make money so that would be bad for my business
[8872.24 --> 8876.80]  with that said there are other businesses that i absolutely could have gotten into i do this one
[8876.80 --> 8882.80]  because i love it because since i was a teenager what i would do in my spare time is sit and answer
[8882.80 --> 8889.20]  people's tech questions and and help them make the best purchase that they can so yeah it's a business
[8889.20 --> 8895.68]  but it's also something that i do because i just like to do it does that i think that probably answers
[8895.68 --> 8900.32]  it pretty clearly it's not the most eloquent way of putting it but like i honestly i still have a little
[8900.32 --> 8904.72]  bit of covert brain i'm not like last one in particular i kind of felt like i am all over the place
[8904.72 --> 8909.28]  this is not a very good show but it was also the first time we had done a remote show in a long time
[8909.28 --> 8917.44]  and it felt so bad it was laggy yeah it was laggy um if you guys want to get some idea of how i intend
[8917.44 --> 8921.52]  to make money on the labs there's a post on the forum where again back to transparency
[8922.32 --> 8930.32]  um i lay out the plan okay one of the ideas wellspring of content for ltt um that also includes
[8930.32 --> 8937.28]  short circuit includes any future channels um i i think that as we start testing products by the dozens
[8937.28 --> 8942.00]  or the hundreds interesting patterns and stories will emerge hey maybe someone is seeding golden
[8942.00 --> 8946.80]  laptop samples with liquid metal instead of standard thermal paste or you know maybe a power supply from
[8946.80 --> 8952.48]  a brand no one heard of is the undisputed king under 70 dollars video is still immensely profitable so
[8953.20 --> 8960.32]  we have the funding to go and create this this testing apparatus to make our videos better why don't
[8960.32 --> 8966.24]  we just do it two is affiliate revenue um if ltt labs achieves my goal of creating an alternate spec sheet
[8966.24 --> 8971.44]  where pretty much it's the only site you need to make a good purchase decision then we should be
[8971.44 --> 8977.68]  able to get a ton of affiliate revenue from it um advertising on site is unlikely i hate ads so i just
[8977.68 --> 8981.28]  don't think there's going to be a ton of that on there it's possible we'll put some banners here and
[8981.28 --> 8986.80]  there but it'll be more likely that we're just pushing the channels pushing uh affiliate revenue that
[8986.80 --> 8992.00]  sort of thing uh we could get into certification programs and third-party validation this one creates
[8992.00 --> 8996.00]  has the potential to create muddy waters but i think there's ways that we could silo it to make it so
[8996.00 --> 9003.20]  that it doesn't have to and the certification team um doesn't have to affect the editorial team
[9003.20 --> 9006.80]  maybe they just don't even talk to each other they're in completely separate offices like i
[9006.80 --> 9010.16]  don't know i think we could figure it out i think that's also probably the one that's like furthest
[9010.16 --> 9014.88]  down the line that's a fair yes that's a fair ways down the line well i would have said that but then we
[9014.88 --> 9021.52]  had a large global brand reach out to us earlier this week asking us to take a look at a product that
[9021.52 --> 9027.52]  is in the very early stages of development to provide feedback on it um okay i decided that
[9027.52 --> 9037.76]  where i'm at today i'm going to accept that but not paid so like i i just am really interested in
[9037.76 --> 9045.36]  this product and i'm really passionate about it and uh but i'm not in a position where a i have the time
[9045.36 --> 9051.12]  to like provide proper feedback and we don't have the expertise set up yet and b to have the
[9051.12 --> 9058.24]  facilities to provide empirical objective feedback have that 1.2 billion dollar r d budget yet yeah i
[9058.24 --> 9063.52]  could i could use 1.2 billion dollars i think i could do a lot with 1.2 billion dollars yeah probably a
[9063.52 --> 9069.44]  little bit more than twitter yeah um so so what i the way that i did this i don't think it creates any
[9069.44 --> 9075.28]  kind of conflict of interest for me to be involved i just i just really want this product to be better
[9075.28 --> 9081.04]  and i know that i will have some ideas if i if i play around with it so that was that was my that
[9081.04 --> 9085.84]  was my compromise for now but i think in the longer term it would be better for me to just recuse myself
[9085.84 --> 9090.48]  from that sort of thing like i could talk to the team about you know here are here are ways that we
[9090.48 --> 9095.36]  want to guide the industry towards being better we should really be focused on things like repairability
[9095.36 --> 9101.76]  as we as we provide this feedback we should be focused on things like not saving a dollar today
[9101.76 --> 9105.76]  to cost the consumer ten dollars tomorrow like putting together those guiding principles i would
[9105.76 --> 9112.88]  like to be involved in but in terms of the actual evaluation of the products and and even knowing like
[9112.88 --> 9120.32]  how much the transactions are either way i i think i should just not be involved in right um uh turning
[9120.32 --> 9125.28]  our testing knowledge into product development processes this one is gonna happen i promise
[9125.28 --> 9130.72]  you this will happen if we figure out how to make the best keyboard why don't we just make the best
[9130.72 --> 9137.76]  keyboard yeah there's conflicts of interest there too but i don't know we'll figure it out i i'd like
[9137.76 --> 9144.00]  to think that if i had a mouse pad i could still say another mouse pad is really good i mean we even
[9144.00 --> 9147.68]  said that in our launch video for the mouse pad we were like yeah hey we weren't quite at the spec of
[9147.68 --> 9152.32]  this other mouse pad we think it's okay because you actually have to travel like this many meters for it
[9152.32 --> 9157.60]  to drift this amount we think that's accurate enough for your caveman hands um but we you know
[9157.60 --> 9163.36]  we know that this one actually did a better job shout out them uh like i i'd like to think that we
[9163.36 --> 9167.76]  could be trusted that way but i guess we'll have to see how it turns out it's a fine line to walk but
[9167.76 --> 9173.68]  it's also technically a fine line that we've been walking the entire time for a long time so um there's
[9173.68 --> 9178.64]  the possibility of putting certain content behind paywalls like having professional level content versus
[9178.64 --> 9184.40]  consumer level content and it seems unlikely to me but it's possible um and then there's direct
[9184.40 --> 9188.64]  sales of products through the site why don't we go full circle and become a retailer like why do we
[9188.64 --> 9192.96]  take affiliate revenue when we can just put up a warehouse and just sell it to you directly
[9194.08 --> 9200.08]  there's more conflicts of interest there potentially i don't know we're just gonna have to navigate this
[9200.08 --> 9204.40]  the best way we can and you guys will tell us if you think we've done it wrong and we'll tell you
[9204.40 --> 9208.32]  guys if sorry that's the way it's going to be because we actually can't sustain the labs without
[9208.32 --> 9214.48]  it or whatever whatever that ends up looking like yeah we're just gonna do our best to keep
[9214.48 --> 9221.92]  the guiding principles of why are you doing this well one to make money but two as we are making money
[9221.92 --> 9229.92]  we absolutely are setting out to create better information for consumers to to to stop the bleeding
[9229.92 --> 9234.80]  of all the knowledgeable people going to the manufacturing side where they literally have
[9234.80 --> 9239.36]  no choice but to shill for the brand that pays their paycheck i'm tired of it
[9241.60 --> 9245.12]  anyway if you guys want to check out that post on the forum it's on the thread called ltt is about
[9245.12 --> 9250.08]  to change and it's on page six and i just i laid the whole thing out like yep here's the plan
[9251.36 --> 9256.56]  because why bother oh look at this i've got a i've got a mission statement that i wrote
[9256.56 --> 9263.12]  ltt labs is the answer to manipulation of on-site reviews and the degradation of the quality of
[9263.12 --> 9268.88]  online tech media over the last 10 years there that's our goal cool
[9271.28 --> 9278.80]  awesome from charles but also many many others uh they were wondering about any news on a rackmount case
[9278.80 --> 9283.52]  either if we're selling it how yours is going if you're going to get your neighbor to repaint it if
[9283.52 --> 9288.96]  you do a new one there's so many questions uh neighbor steve is probably too busy uh you know
[9288.96 --> 9293.44]  neighbor steve is still here right he just moved down or something yeah like down at the end uh
[9293.44 --> 9299.28]  neighbor steve is probably too busy to airbrush me a case um yvonne i think does want to keep her owl
[9299.28 --> 9307.28]  so she may keep her original case but we are in the very early stages of designing a new case for me
[9307.28 --> 9313.52]  if that goes really really well then i don't think it's impossible that we would find a case
[9313.52 --> 9318.24]  manufacturer to partner with to build a rackmount gaming case yeah i i know i know there's a lot of
[9318.24 --> 9324.00]  people who are super into it man watching the your home video i finally actually did watch it
[9324.00 --> 9330.32]  uh which one there's a lot that sorry the uh you're you're we're leaving this one oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[9330.32 --> 9336.72]  yeah the feels man it yeah a lot of that there was there was so much stuff that i feel like was
[9336.72 --> 9341.84]  missed but i feel like if you hit everything it would have been three hours long yeah so there
[9341.84 --> 9346.16]  were there was things that i was like i knew i cared about a lot and i like wish was in the video
[9346.16 --> 9351.04]  but then i had to think like okay does the audience care as much do you and yvonne care as much etc
[9351.04 --> 9355.60]  okay here's my merch message uh hit me with a couple okay okay can i guess can i guess a couple i'm
[9355.60 --> 9360.96]  gonna write them down i'm gonna write them down yeah uh and then i want to know if i get the same
[9360.96 --> 9375.52]  ones as you um okay okay okay hold on uh let me think things that would be things that would be really
[9375.52 --> 9385.12]  special to luke i'm waiting i'm trying to think of more while i sit here i've already thought of one
[9385.12 --> 9388.96]  additional one while i was sitting here okay all right i've got three i've got three don't look at
[9388.96 --> 9392.80]  them i will also say i i like i thought it was good i thought it was really good i enjoyed the
[9392.80 --> 9397.28]  whole thing i actually sat down and actually watched the whole thing which is like not that common there's
[9397.28 --> 9402.32]  some stuff that i'm really unhappy that i didn't put in too so we'll see if your list overlaps with mine
[9402.32 --> 9409.60]  a little bit the original three wan locations because there's three different hold on hold on hold on
[9409.60 --> 9415.76]  okay i gotta i gotta hold on i gotta i'm gonna turn this text white i swear i swear to you that's all
[9415.76 --> 9424.08]  i'm doing he's not even typing there you go that's the first one i wrote down yeah okay and okay so
[9425.12 --> 9429.60]  what was to the left of that was the peg wall my next note was going to be the peg wall
[9429.60 --> 9440.64]  so i was gonna bring that up too um i just like the garage in general like oh my god hold on hold on
[9440.64 --> 9444.72]  hold on okay highlighting highlighting ready highlighting yeah
[9448.40 --> 9452.56]  what did i write the general layout of the garage
[9452.56 --> 9459.92]  yeah yeah oh man every once in a while he he guesses things that i'm thinking and it's actually
[9459.92 --> 9468.64]  like terrifyingly accurate um this is not the only time this has happened like at all um okay uh
[9470.08 --> 9474.32]  am i gonna go three for three well i guess i got three because i had i had the peg wall in the
[9474.32 --> 9479.28]  wandshow set as kind of like one but yeah okay so i'm three for three so far what's the next thing
[9479.28 --> 9481.44]  you're gonna say the next thing would be my room
[9488.24 --> 9493.84]  okay that's pretty good um four for four that's all i have down though yeah i i mean that's mostly
[9493.84 --> 9498.48]  it there was there was other things that i thought of but like even i was like yeah
[9498.48 --> 9503.68]  probably shouldn't have been in the video but they're like i don't know there was oh that was so
[9503.68 --> 9509.20]  fun that's pretty funny yeah honestly i thought of all of them afterward and i regret
[9509.20 --> 9513.68]  it not having them in there's so much stuff there's like there's two i because i tried to
[9513.68 --> 9517.28]  think about like like what would i have done and i'm like yeah i don't know like there's there's too
[9517.28 --> 9522.40]  many things because like even if you walk in the backyard yeah there's almost no direction you can face
[9522.40 --> 9527.36]  where there wasn't like some type of major event something crazy that happened like the the like
[9527.36 --> 9530.16]  fence jump for that commercial that was at the langley house
[9530.16 --> 9539.12]  nope i promise nope i know because i hurt myself the corsair commercial oh that fence jump yeah i
[9539.12 --> 9543.28]  mean we've done a few fence jobs there was the one the one where i flipped for the be quiet thing
[9544.08 --> 9548.32]  i remember that one well because i was quite hurt for a while that was actually that was actually
[9548.32 --> 9553.68]  genuinely really good idea um but yeah there's a lot of like little things like that where i'm like
[9553.68 --> 9558.56]  i would have cared where i went up on the roof and threw the keyboard down yeah giveaway yeah
[9558.56 --> 9564.48]  yeah like i just the weird thing i shot in the shower for that like wd computex promotion yeah
[9564.48 --> 9571.20]  there's like so much weird stuff we shot in that house yep back in the day yeah we didn't have sets
[9571.20 --> 9577.92]  guys like you know what his whole house yeah yeah i don't yeah oh we need to do a scene where like
[9577.92 --> 9582.40]  you know the person wakes up in the morning okay well i'm gonna go get into my bed
[9584.56 --> 9589.92]  yeah so yeah i don't know it was it was really good but yeah it would have yeah it would have
[9589.92 --> 9595.12]  literally had to been like at least over an hour long oh yeah for sure and we cut so much from from
[9595.12 --> 9603.28]  that that i did end up talking about yeah yeah from michael who built their first pc with the help of
[9603.28 --> 9609.92]  our videos one question i've always wanted to ask is how you got into badminton oh um my wife got me
[9609.92 --> 9614.08]  into it and no ltt could not lose me to professional badminton i'm not that good
[9616.32 --> 9621.36]  there's only one major tech tuber who is a professional athlete and it is not this one
[9623.76 --> 9628.80]  from john are you excited about the rumor of intel returning to the high-end desktop market with alder
[9628.80 --> 9633.20]  lake x or do you think that market is dead with the current core counts on high-end consumer
[9633.20 --> 9640.00]  cpus like the 5950x man i hope it's not dead because like honestly thinking about it from a
[9640.00 --> 9646.48]  developer standpoint or like a prosumer standpoint it's really nice to be able to get that like
[9646.48 --> 9658.00]  tier or class buying the badge yeah yeah yeah 100 yeah i'm jazzed yeah in a nutshell i do think that
[9658.00 --> 9668.96]  hedt is more niche than it used to be i mean 5950x is a 16 core freaking consumer cpu and new zen 4 based
[9668.96 --> 9675.84]  ones are going to be like even more better presumably but there is still a value to it i mean we're we're
[9675.84 --> 9685.52]  sort of frustrated right now because we standardized on uh trx 40 or whatever the strx 40 or whatever amd's
[9685.52 --> 9691.36]  um threadripper 3000 series platform was we standardized on it for our editing stations
[9691.36 --> 9696.72]  thinking that we were going to get at least one more generation of cpus we actually ended up getting
[9696.72 --> 9704.08]  nothing and now we uh is it the boards or the chips that we standardized on that are eol the point is
[9704.08 --> 9710.56]  that it's it's hard to find more hardware for our workstations at a reasonable price and there also is
[9710.56 --> 9717.12]  not a clear replacement for it with all the pcie that we need like we've got 25 gigabit nix in there
[9717.12 --> 9724.08]  high-end gpus that are actually being used for not for gaming like for for for data use so the pcie
[9724.08 --> 9729.76]  bandwidth actually starts to matter a little bit more um yeah sometimes they have other kind of crazy
[9729.76 --> 9733.84]  peripherals we need to plug in we need lots of pcie you need lots of memory bandwidth we need lots of
[9733.84 --> 9738.40]  cores they're all running 24 cores in there and there's not a clear successor for it unless we want to pay
[9738.40 --> 9746.48]  lenovo for their they're the only authorized vendor of like the new threadripper pro because you can't
[9746.48 --> 9752.64]  get normal like regular prosumer threadripper it has to be professional threadripper now like it sucks
[9753.20 --> 9761.60]  yeah not a huge fan of cpus are in a way better space now than they were a while back but not a huge
[9761.60 --> 9768.72]  fan of where the hdt space is i want intel to come in and like light a fire under amd's butt which
[9768.72 --> 9773.12]  sounds like a very backwards that sounds so weird but you're totally right but i mean i warned you
[9773.12 --> 9778.80]  guys about this i said look the second amd has the upper hand they'll behave exactly like intel and they
[9778.80 --> 9785.92]  did they're not your friend there's no good guy and bad guy when it comes to cpus what we want is
[9785.92 --> 9791.76]  competition yeah and we got it in in certain spaces and on others there's been a lot of speculation
[9791.76 --> 9798.56]  uh about who the tech youtuber athlete is it's marquez um he's yeah insanely athletic yeah some of his
[9798.56 --> 9805.60]  clips frisbee of his ultimate frisbee are actually like otherworldly amazing like pure highlight reel
[9806.24 --> 9810.88]  golden goodness i still think i could beat him at badminton though has he ever played i don't know
[9810.88 --> 9816.88]  not enough i can tell you that much i could almost definitely beat him at badminton nice i like it
[9817.52 --> 9825.12]  no i'm not gonna say almost definitely okay marquez 10 grand oh let's go dude that'd be really cool
[9826.72 --> 9833.20]  i don't want to take his money i mean i will if he really wants me to but what if you just make it that
[9833.20 --> 9839.20]  he gets 10 grand if he wins and it's just a full full ego placement there is no actual okay sure
[9839.20 --> 9843.84]  nice yeah i don't want his money but yeah he's i'll give him 10 grand if he beats me nice there
[9843.84 --> 9849.44]  i love it much that'd be sweet i would commentate that yeah yeah i'd be super down we should totally
[9849.44 --> 9853.44]  stream it turn it into an event yeah you know what i could make it's like whether i lose or not
[9854.08 --> 9859.04]  yeah there we go it's like youtuber boxing yeah do you see the celebrity boxing yeah you know it's so
[9859.04 --> 9863.20]  funny because remember back when the paul brothers were first getting into that we were like i should
[9863.20 --> 9868.56]  fight austin and that like it became like a whole meme and now like dr mike is fighting in a box yeah i'm
[9868.56 --> 9878.00]  sitting here what dr mike versus i dumps or whatever it's so funny oh man oh i just want to
[9878.00 --> 9881.92]  know why they didn't invite me i would have totally fought austin oh my goodness we could do we could
[9881.92 --> 9890.32]  do almost like a reverse um nerd sports a reverse nerd sport where like you have to get nerfed until
[9890.32 --> 9895.52]  people beat you in badminton oh man i don't know i don't i think might not be that nerd sports was too
[9895.52 --> 9902.56]  traumatic for me i don't want to talk about it oh man okay let's keep moving on from osama when
[9902.56 --> 9909.52]  you're feeling down on yourself what do you do to pull yourself out of a funk oh man that's a tough
[9909.52 --> 9917.60]  one i think i can speak for both of us when i say we've definitely had funks yeah um you know i think
[9917.60 --> 9922.48]  for me sometimes it's a matter of just reframing the problem like when i did the the 10 million
[9922.48 --> 9927.52]  subscriber stream uh one of the big things that helped me for the next couple of years was
[9928.32 --> 9932.08]  you know uh saying okay well no i'm not going to do this because i have to i'm going to do it because
[9932.08 --> 9939.04]  i want to and finding finding things that i enjoyed and wanted to do and focusing on those um a big thing
[9939.04 --> 9944.80]  that pulls me out of bed in the morning is just the sheer sense of responsibility like if i don't show up
[9944.80 --> 9949.60]  for work like obviously one day is fine if i'm just like yeah i'm taking a flex day uh but if i don't show up
[9949.60 --> 9955.92]  for work for like a year there's a lot of mouths that literally don't eat which can add actually
[9955.92 --> 9965.28]  make it worse sometimes but usually makes it more manageable um i uh just sorry there was something in
[9965.28 --> 9969.60]  chat that i wanted oh someone was was saying that it might be more interesting to marquez and other
[9969.60 --> 9976.80]  creators if it was a uh charitable donation instead of a prize anyways um for me sure i mean he can always
[9976.80 --> 9980.00]  donate it i don't care yeah that's fair i mean we've done it that we've done things that way in
[9980.00 --> 9983.52]  the past where we just say here's a prize you do whatever you want with it yeah like like i mean
[9983.52 --> 9995.44]  i'm not i'm okay i really don't like charity pressure fair enough yeah i think that i'm man i'm going into
[9995.44 --> 10006.72]  hot take territory here i think that a lot of a lot of charitable and philanthropic actions um are about
[10006.72 --> 10016.00]  posturing are about image whitewashing are about um brand building and are not necessarily about
[10016.80 --> 10025.36]  actually giving up anything personally or making a huge impact um we do charitable stuff here but
[10025.36 --> 10035.44]  for the most part we keep it fairly quiet under wraps um because it's a i just don't i don't want
[10035.44 --> 10041.76]  to be accountable for what i care about and want like i've seen i've seen creators get backlash for
[10041.76 --> 10046.08]  donating for example to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals like why would
[10046.08 --> 10053.76]  you donate for animals when humans are still starving oh geez you know what why don't you there might be
[10053.76 --> 10057.84]  very go do something for the humans that are starving people have different causes that are
[10057.84 --> 10062.40]  important to them for a variety of reasons and that's that's their personal business totally fair
[10062.40 --> 10066.56]  so i just don't feel like having that conversation it's a stupid conversation and i'm not gonna burden
[10066.56 --> 10079.12]  my life with it um i i also just i don't know i just it just feels it just feels like it just feels
[10079.12 --> 10085.52]  icky like i don't like being bothered at the cash register about it um i i don't like yeah i just i don't
[10085.52 --> 10090.88]  like i don't like there being that pressure and so i that's that's definitely fair enough yeah yeah and
[10090.88 --> 10097.76]  there shouldn't be you know what there's nothing wrong with a major content creator doing some kind
[10097.76 --> 10104.64]  of doing some kind of event doing some kind of appearance and making money from it 100 yeah like
[10104.64 --> 10111.68]  and i've been very clear with you guys from day one i'm running a business i can't pay luke in your
[10111.68 --> 10119.52]  goodwill for my charitable donation to something so at the end of the day for me maybe this is maybe this
[10119.52 --> 10125.84]  is a selfish take but it's me and mine first i am far more concerned with making sure that everyone
[10125.84 --> 10131.44]  working under this roof has a place to live than i am with the people who are not under this roof and
[10131.44 --> 10140.64]  are not contributing to the success of this organization and that's not to say that it's you know
[10140.64 --> 10147.12]  just us all the time it's just this team first first yeah and i like you yeah sorry
[10149.52 --> 10155.76]  yeah i don't think it makes me a bad guy one of my favorite things to dive into is like
[10155.76 --> 10162.32]  uh when when some like hyper rich like like the last one i do was bezos he like donated a ton of
[10162.32 --> 10167.52]  money to something and people were like wow what a generous person and then people dove into it and
[10167.52 --> 10173.92]  was like hmm it's like the equivalent of me donating four dollars if you if you like do percentages and stuff
[10173.92 --> 10180.48]  like now it's complicated because it is it should be very clear guys that someone's net worth is a
[10180.48 --> 10187.92]  almost assuredly not accurate tied into the b is locked up in assets just because okay let's use elon
[10187.92 --> 10192.64]  just because elon musk has a net worth what is it like 250 billion or something like that it's
[10192.64 --> 10197.68]  changed a lot recently still had to get financing to buy twitter for 44 billion that's not just cash
[10197.68 --> 10203.52]  yeah like my my net worth i can tell you right now is a hell of a lot more than i have in my bank
[10203.52 --> 10210.24]  account that's just how it works in fact the vast majority of it which i know for a fact maybe i'll
[10210.24 --> 10217.52]  talk about it someday but the vast majority of my net worth is tied up in a thing that i actually can
[10217.52 --> 10222.08]  neither sell nor borrow against i know that it's worth that
[10222.08 --> 10228.64]  but i cannot extract money from it so
[10230.88 --> 10239.28]  it's it is what it is yes it's it's theoretical money right yeah um to jump back to the the um
[10240.16 --> 10243.68]  get out of the funk thing i was in a funk for a long time i don't think i've talked about this
[10243.68 --> 10247.76]  on camera much i'm not going to go into it my kelton's being kelton's being a tool over on twitch
[10247.76 --> 10251.68]  let's not talk about the locked up in assets thing please you can take a loan against your
[10251.68 --> 10257.68]  investments at which point you can borrow against that money but your investments might not be the
[10257.68 --> 10262.24]  kind of investments you're thinking of yes there are certain kinds of investments that you can borrow
[10262.24 --> 10268.00]  against there's a really uh really crafty uh wealth management strategy where you take out
[10268.80 --> 10273.20]  oh i forget how it works exactly someone explained it to me at some point but there's this kind of
[10273.20 --> 10280.08]  life insurance that you can get where you're basically like putting the you're basically
[10280.08 --> 10286.96]  putting the cash in a big pile that is like a life insurance policy and then that cash because
[10286.96 --> 10294.72]  it's basically just cash allows you to borrow against it tax-free and then when you die the policy
[10294.72 --> 10300.64]  pays out the money pays out the money pays back in and then you never actually had to take out the
[10300.64 --> 10305.52]  money personally and pay tax on it or something like that i forget exactly how it works yes there
[10305.52 --> 10311.04]  are assets that you can borrow against but there are also assets that are not easily borrowable
[10311.04 --> 10316.88]  against i couldn't even get a mortgage in the first couple of years of lmg because this business that
[10316.88 --> 10321.92]  was generating plenty enough money to be eligible for a mortgage if i was buying a house personally
[10321.92 --> 10331.12]  just like too new was just like no no that was actually an apparently it's called universal life
[10331.12 --> 10336.00]  policy or index for universal life insurance who knows not financial advice that's according to twitch
[10336.00 --> 10342.32]  yeah not financial advice i'm not a financial advisor okay sorry what were you gonna say um yeah so i i
[10342.32 --> 10346.88]  was in a funk for a pretty deep one for quite a while and i'm not going to go into it further than that but
[10346.88 --> 10352.00]  uh since then things have been getting a lot better and what i've more recently been doing is
[10352.00 --> 10358.08]  whenever i find myself spiraling i try to immediately do something physical go for a
[10358.08 --> 10363.76]  physical health is mental health oh it's like you gotta keep your body healthy yeah so i i try to go for
[10363.76 --> 10371.04]  a walk like which sounds lame but works significantly better than it should um try to go for a walk on those
[10371.04 --> 10377.20]  walks i find i don't usually this is going to sound provocative but i don't usually physically
[10377.20 --> 10383.12]  stimulate myself enough so i'll i'll try to usually go for go for walks i can help with that
[10384.40 --> 10390.88]  a lot of my walks well when i'm spiraling it's often very very late at night um because i i am a
[10390.88 --> 10396.16]  night owl so i'll just like go for a walk at 3 30 in the morning yeah and i'll be out in the field and
[10396.16 --> 10400.48]  i'll just like do squats and lunges and all this kind of stuff just to like get myself worked up
[10400.48 --> 10404.48]  sweat a lot and then go have a shower and often that's all i need and i feel great afterwards i
[10404.48 --> 10410.32]  like going for a ride what's nice about riding on a motorcycle is that if you're if you're in like a
[10410.32 --> 10416.80]  like a busy mind state you cannot stay in that state of mind when you're riding on a motorbike so it's
[10416.80 --> 10422.96]  gonna yeah you must be focused or you'll die the biggest and another another thing that i would say is
[10422.96 --> 10430.40]  is certain people in my life i have found are very effective at pulling me out right so i try to
[10431.36 --> 10438.00]  a lot i'm quite introverted i like hanging out by myself but i find that sometimes that's not good
[10438.00 --> 10443.76]  for me so i need to push myself to hang out with those people but one of the biggest things that i
[10443.76 --> 10448.48]  find is is just like context changes so you're talking about on the motorcycle you can't
[10449.20 --> 10453.84]  you can't let your mind just run there's this there's this really old concept where like if
[10453.84 --> 10458.48]  you're in a potentially confrontational situation and this is a fun fact i've used this for fan
[10458.48 --> 10464.16]  interactions when i notice that the person is feeling very anxious i will do this because it
[10464.16 --> 10470.40]  helps to shift frame of mind um but if you it's this is just a funny thing like if you're facing
[10470.40 --> 10476.48]  someone if you step off to the side randomly it's like kind of weird and people will now think about
[10476.48 --> 10480.72]  like oh i'm i'm looking at them i have to talk into this at the same time i'm looking at them like
[10480.72 --> 10486.40]  this now this is weird i'm gonna turn my body oh i unplugged myself but like it it starts making
[10486.40 --> 10491.28]  them think about things that aren't i'm really anxious about this conversation i'm really nervous
[10491.28 --> 10497.60]  and it it actually can really help like calm people down which is kind of cool uh you ever used
[10497.60 --> 10504.40]  it on me no oh all right well i don't think so i don't know it's been a long time dude um but yeah
[10504.40 --> 10510.88]  i don't think so but a lot of the time for me it's i just need to do something different and usually i'll
[10510.88 --> 10515.68]  use a walk but it could be something else if i'm in a situation where i can't go for a walk it's
[10515.68 --> 10522.72]  basically anything else just do something different change my action but yeah that's it i still ride an sv650s
[10522.72 --> 10528.16]  um and armchair yiddish asks if i had someone who wanted to give you money for a significant but
[10528.16 --> 10532.40]  non-majority portion of ltt would you take it it would depend on the terms every investor wants
[10532.40 --> 10537.68]  something that's literally the definition you put something in you expect something back and i'd need
[10537.68 --> 10544.16]  to know what that is because if i a don't agree with it or b don't understand it then i'm not going
[10544.16 --> 10553.04]  to be comfortable taking it before we go to the last set of merch messages did you want to talk
[10553.04 --> 10561.20]  about twitch the chat is reminding oh um yeah i saw a really terrible take from a twitch creator that
[10561.20 --> 10566.64]  was like twitch should just have ads that are totally non-intrusive like to the viewer like their
[10566.64 --> 10571.52]  ads should just like not be intrusive and i was looking at it going you know this feels like that whole
[10571.52 --> 10579.68]  thing remember when there was the big controversy on youtube where they uh basically started enforcing
[10579.68 --> 10584.88]  like ad advertiser friendly guidelines on videos and it was affecting the rate at which you could
[10584.88 --> 10591.68]  get monetization and you had this this whole outrage from especially certain corners of youtube that
[10591.68 --> 10597.28]  created very non-advertiser friendly content and my take at the time i felt like was very controversial
[10597.28 --> 10602.96]  and not received very well where i basically said well yeah did you expect was going to happen at some
[10602.96 --> 10607.68]  point there was going to be a reckoning where advertisers were not going to want you guys don't
[10607.68 --> 10614.40]  understand you don't work with like national and international brands they are extremely conservative
[10614.40 --> 10619.44]  when it comes to and obviously not all their exceptions but they are extremely conservative when it
[10619.44 --> 10626.40]  comes to the associations between their brand and other things you know you look at the way
[10626.40 --> 10632.08]  that that they will you know you'll watch like a nike commercial and it's just like someone
[10632.08 --> 10636.00]  persevering and at the end there's just like a nike logo and there aren't even like any words or
[10636.00 --> 10641.84]  anything because it's all about association they do not want the next thing you see after that low for
[10641.84 --> 10646.56]  the same reason they want you to see a bunch of whatever before you see the logo they do not want
[10646.56 --> 10651.68]  the next thing you see after the logo to be something that they consider to be not brand friendly it's
[10651.68 --> 10656.72]  just that simple and so i feel like this is another one of those situations where i'm going to come in
[10656.72 --> 10660.96]  and i'm going to say well yeah what what did you think was going to happen do you have any idea how
[10660.96 --> 10669.36]  much twitch costs to run and do you do you think that banner like static banner ads on a website are going
[10669.36 --> 10678.32]  to pay for it i promise you i give you my personal linus tech tips guarantee that unintrusive ads
[10678.32 --> 10686.48]  are not going to pay for a site like twitch no matter how many of them they plastered on the page
[10686.48 --> 10693.44]  unintrusive ads don't pay for the forum because because no advertiser is going to pay for an
[10693.44 --> 10699.92]  unintrusive ad because they don't work because they don't call your attention away obviously
[10699.92 --> 10707.84]  no offense no offense whoever does not understand how web advertising works even though it's like
[10707.84 --> 10714.16]  how they actually make a living my my take on it is the the thing that surprised me the most okay
[10714.16 --> 10719.60]  first of all doing it at all when your competitors are not i understand that twitch is losing money
[10719.60 --> 10724.48]  but if they don't want to essentially die they're not going to have to have like significantly worse
[10725.12 --> 10731.92]  uh uh revenue potential than other life is so hard and so expensive oh absolutely like i i sympathize
[10731.92 --> 10738.16]  for them truly but like it just doesn't matter if you want to survive um and then the other one is
[10739.20 --> 10747.84]  uh that that they announced no longer having exclusivity and exclusivity is rough rough rough rough
[10747.84 --> 10754.48]  for twitch creators it's really really bad for the creators um but making their revenue split
[10754.48 --> 10760.00]  worse than youtube well i hadn't even talked about the revenue split yet i was talking about the the
[10760.00 --> 10765.28]  that that twitch creator yet that's terrible making making the rev split worse than youtube and then also
[10765.28 --> 10772.00]  allowing people to split stream to youtube hilarious hilarious they're just going to push everyone
[10772.00 --> 10778.00]  over onto youtube so obviously man we should maybe twitch is done if they go through with this move
[10778.00 --> 10784.08]  twitch is done i wonder if we should be calling it productize our our stream splitting stuff i've told
[10784.08 --> 10788.40]  you i want to productize the stream splitting thing eight years ago it didn't make a lot of sense then
[10788.40 --> 10793.28]  it might make sense now well maybe if you had built it when it didn't make sense we would actually
[10793.28 --> 10797.12]  have a product ready to go when it doesn't make sense that product for eight years
[10797.12 --> 10802.00]  ever think of that smart guy eight years it hasn't been that long i thought you said eight years i
[10802.00 --> 10808.16]  don't know whatever it doesn't matter uh gyren fear over on twitch says ads don't really work anyway
[10808.16 --> 10812.96]  that's the kind of smooth brain take that i would expect from twitch chat ads don't work do you have
[10812.96 --> 10818.88]  any idea how big the advertising industry is yeah ads don't work function you're right we don't have
[10818.88 --> 10823.76]  any back-end information on how much uh turnover we turn around i don't know what the correct term is for
[10823.76 --> 10828.96]  it um but push with ads none at all yeah yeah we have we have no we it's not like we do any
[10828.96 --> 10834.16]  advertising at all in our business and never and it's not like anyone has ever bought anything that
[10834.16 --> 10839.92]  we've advertised please come on and like to be clear i'm not saying that they work on you maybe they
[10839.92 --> 10845.04]  don't maybe you're magic honestly i don't really see them either i was gonna say you you in particular
[10845.04 --> 10851.36]  i think really don't see ads it's actually like stunning like it'll be the most blatant most aggressive
[10851.36 --> 10854.24]  thing on the page you'll ask them about it like four seconds later and i'll be like what
[10855.28 --> 10862.00]  i thought everything other than that i can't see it but yeah i don't know but they don't kid yourself
[10862.00 --> 10865.92]  literally one of the most valuable companies in the world you might have heard of it google
[10865.92 --> 10873.04]  sorry alphabet excuse me um that that that like their entire business they have entire free services
[10873.04 --> 10879.20]  like youtube and gmail that are sustained based on targeting ads more effectively at you
[10879.20 --> 10887.84]  so that they will work even better oh anyway um jordan asks oh sorry i'm doing your job oh you
[10887.84 --> 10893.20]  didn't talk about the cargo uh the the the revenue the rev split oh yeah they're doomed yeah i mean it
[10893.20 --> 10897.52]  doesn't matter if they're losing money on a 50 50 rev split if everyone else is still doing 70 30
[10897.52 --> 10904.32]  then they're completely screwed as for having creators push more ads um yeah i mean that's um
[10904.32 --> 10910.64]  that that's just normal that's just needs to happen because banner ads no are not going to do it sorry
[10911.20 --> 10916.48]  nameless um creator and probably more than one creator i don't even think that's a controversial take in
[10916.48 --> 10922.24]  that community because there were like tens of thousands of upvotes on this super big brain idea that
[10922.24 --> 10934.08]  ads should just not disrupt the user at all like oh man oh man anyway back to the messages yeah yeah if any creators
[10934.08 --> 10939.36]  want to leave twitch uh flow plane we'll take it hey let's go i don't know if we're ready to be like
[10939.36 --> 10943.60]  a twitch competitor but what flow we have a live streaming only creator and he's killing actually
[10943.60 --> 10948.72]  that's true i was looking at the payouts uh yvonne just had it up on her on her uh monitor and i
[10948.72 --> 10956.24]  walked in i was like oh and the the users are stoked and like it's actually a very vibrant community but
[10956.24 --> 10961.76]  a more a more likely product might be i mean it's a little the ui is not great right a little early but
[10961.76 --> 10966.40]  our multi-streaming works great i don't know if you noticed but we are live right now on floatplane
[10966.40 --> 10970.40]  twitch and youtube and we could be live on facebook if we really felt like it couldn't we could we
[10970.40 --> 10974.64]  should just do it sure like why not i think i mentioned that like a long time ago yeah well i was
[10974.64 --> 10979.52]  wrong if i said no i don't know who said no yeah maybe we maybe maybe we both said yes and then just
[10979.52 --> 10986.64]  forgot that's with these guys definitely possible dude if it doesn't end up in like some form of
[10986.64 --> 10992.48]  solid documentation it's gone my memory is a sieve not a good one one with lots of holes in it
[10992.96 --> 10997.76]  i mean a good sieve would have okay you know what i've had enough i need to block you
[11000.00 --> 11007.36]  blocked oh yeah why didn't we just call call them out uh chris's 429 says garbage time yeah yeah call
[11007.36 --> 11012.24]  out garbage time dude it's awesome content yeah doing great super cool doing great over on floatplane yeah
[11012.24 --> 11019.20]  and like the thing is honestly kudos to garbage time for getting it for understanding that the
[11019.20 --> 11024.96]  reason whether it's patreon screwing over creators or twitch screwing over creators the reason is that
[11024.96 --> 11030.32]  these are unsustainable business models we know because we're like running one so yeah he totally
[11030.32 --> 11035.20]  understood we talk about it like every time i i really enjoy talking to him we um so just in case
[11035.20 --> 11041.92]  people don't know garbage time is the the same person that runs dank pods um it's garbage time on
[11041.92 --> 11047.52]  floatplane is a very music based stream he's a drummer he's a very good drummer um and he plays
[11047.52 --> 11052.64]  like meme songs and runs drum tracks along with them it's fantastic it's very fun it's tons of
[11052.64 --> 11059.84]  views uh he's building like a new studio and and he he's building a heavily reinforced door so that
[11059.84 --> 11063.84]  he can hit it harder with symbols because every once in a while he'll just like throw symbols around
[11063.84 --> 11068.88]  and stuff it's it's it's a fun show it's a fun time but i know one of the reasons why he likes
[11068.88 --> 11074.16]  it and why his fans like it is because it's a music stream oh right that's right our audio quality is
[11074.16 --> 11079.04]  so much better than like i don't think there's another video people like immediately when showing
[11079.04 --> 11083.12]  up are like whoa it sounds really good even when they don't know that that's like a thing with
[11083.12 --> 11089.20]  floatplane yeah so yeah cool i don't know well it's like actually really good and considering the
[11089.20 --> 11098.88]  fact that we have like seven depths and twitter is 1.2 billion sorry oh okay sorry not everyone
[11098.88 --> 11105.04]  who works at floatplane is a dev sorry um and then twitter has 1.2 billion dollars to create that
[11105.04 --> 11110.72]  steaming pile of garbage yeah floatplane's like amazing but yeah our multi-streaming thing allows
[11110.72 --> 11116.96]  us to simul stream on really any platform that we want yeah like we could spin up facebook like now but
[11116.96 --> 11122.72]  with just one with one source which is which is pretty cool and then we also have available and
[11122.72 --> 11126.24]  stuff i'm sure the infrastructure guys are going to yell at me when we have merch messages we have
[11126.24 --> 11131.60]  merch messages which anyone could theoretically use if they also have a shopify based like merch thing
[11132.56 --> 11137.68]  i mean there'd be some dev to productize it so i we've actually talked about that internally and
[11137.68 --> 11143.60]  there's quite a bit of dev to productize it uh it's not impossible yeah but it yeah it'll work
[11143.60 --> 11150.16]  like a lot of work all right well hopefully yvonne's in bed because the next two questions are about
[11150.16 --> 11155.20]  marriage tips oh no first one here is from jordan hey linus i'm getting married in october and i'm
[11155.20 --> 11162.96]  curious are there any special stories regarding your wedding bands um for our wedding bands the story is
[11162.96 --> 11172.56]  that they were cheap and fine i guess i didn't even want a band i wanted to do tattoos because at the time
[11172.56 --> 11176.48]  like i'm totally used to it now but at the time i didn't like wearing hand jewelry and i just didn't
[11176.48 --> 11181.04]  want something on my hand all the time now i feel naked without it but uh i just yeah i just wanted
[11181.04 --> 11185.20]  a tattoo and i was like come on this should be better like it's more permanent i'm i'm like i'm in
[11185.20 --> 11193.52]  it to win it baby let's let's let's go let's tattoo um she was just not into body body paint um and so
[11193.52 --> 11198.72]  she said no i prefer a band so i kind of went okay and then yvonne doesn't even wear her wedding band
[11199.36 --> 11206.40]  i don't think she's had it on since uh she gave birth to our firstborn which was like however many
[11206.40 --> 11212.88]  years ago it's been a bit yeah um so she just wears her engagement ring and the story there is that i
[11212.88 --> 11220.00]  actually like went and learned like a ton about diamonds because my whole thing was okay if i have
[11220.00 --> 11227.04]  to blow a bunch of money on a scam then i might as well i might as well get the best scam possible
[11227.68 --> 11237.12]  so yeah i picked a diamond that i felt was best suited to her i could have gone bigger
[11237.84 --> 11243.60]  but from my point of view if it wasn't internally flawless then it wouldn't be a good representative
[11243.60 --> 11248.64]  representation of yvonne she also has extremely slender fingers that's cute as heck and i thought sorry
[11248.64 --> 11254.24]  i said that's cute as heck and i also thought that because she has extremely slim fingers uh there
[11254.24 --> 11257.52]  would be it would be it would look kind of out of place and could even she worked with her hands a
[11257.52 --> 11262.48]  lot she's a pharmacist at the time could even get in the way if it was too big i also really preferred
[11262.48 --> 11267.52]  a more low profile setting and that was for the same reason i liked a simple setting because she's
[11267.52 --> 11274.64]  practical so it's just a simple four-prong setting on a traditional hearts and arrows diamond so it's a
[11274.64 --> 11279.68]  canadian diamond which was really important to me no conflict gem is going to go on my wife's hand
[11280.24 --> 11286.80]  um that's cool and um i'm just trying to think of like what else what else mattered to me i bought
[11286.80 --> 11292.40]  the diamond in the and the setting independently i forget why i did that right i just there was a
[11292.40 --> 11295.84]  setting i really liked and there was a diamond i really liked and there's no point getting them in
[11295.84 --> 11300.80]  one place and compared to buying them both together the jewel at a jewelry store compared to buying the
[11300.80 --> 11307.20]  diamond online it was significantly less expensive um peer drifter says borderline going for the gs
[11307.20 --> 11312.64]  sort of course it has a gs like no it's like a proper proper diamond uh like you can get ones for
[11312.64 --> 11319.68]  less that are like gigantic but they they don't sparkle the way that an if does so if i'd like if i'm
[11319.68 --> 11324.48]  gonna get scammed then i'm gonna get scammed properly i also didn't want something that was
[11324.48 --> 11330.16]  obviously very valuable i wanted it to seem like a poor person diamond to someone who doesn't know
[11330.16 --> 11336.72]  anything about rocks uh because the last thing i want is her getting like held up somewhere or
[11336.72 --> 11342.88]  something and her you know in a panic not being able to get it off or something and it's seeming
[11342.88 --> 11347.92]  like extremely valuable like worth cutting a hand off for like it was there was a very strategic
[11347.92 --> 11355.12]  decision made there and to be clear it wasn't crazy expensive no matter what it was going to be at my
[11355.12 --> 11359.92]  budget it was not going to be worth cutting someone's hand off for but i didn't want it to look like it
[11359.92 --> 11367.20]  was you can get big diamonds that are just trash tier stones especially back then when the lab
[11367.20 --> 11373.36]  created ones hadn't really taken off yet um like nowadays it's kind of hard to tell if a diamond's
[11373.36 --> 11377.84]  like worth something or not because it's all arbitrary anyway but but back then like yeah you
[11377.84 --> 11383.44]  could get giant trash tier stones that might look to someone who has no i like you know i'm not looking
[11383.44 --> 11388.24]  at them through a freaking thing um and they might think it's worth taking a life over but actually it's not
[11388.24 --> 11394.56]  worth anything and so i would rather her actually have a smaller stone yeah so that was that was my
[11394.56 --> 11402.56]  rationale behind the ring awesome answer uh another wedding or marriage question from brian how long
[11402.56 --> 11405.68]  have you been married and what's your take on marriage is it something to wait on for a certain
[11405.68 --> 11412.00]  amount of time or is it worth just diving in at 200 miles an hour uh well that second part is
[11412.00 --> 11419.52]  is i come from a broken home um and one of the things that i one of the goals that i set out for
[11419.52 --> 11427.68]  myself it's not a goal it's a requirement in my adult life i will not break my family it's that simple
[11427.68 --> 11437.28]  i will not accept my family becoming broken so um yvonne and i were together for i think six years
[11437.28 --> 11444.00]  before we got married and we lived together for a full year before formally tying the knot and the
[11444.00 --> 11450.08]  reason that we did so was because i needed to be darn good and sure because there was there was no taking
[11450.08 --> 11462.40]  it back for me um yeah so no it is not something to um dive into 200 miles an hour that would be bad
[11464.32 --> 11473.28]  or maybe not bad maybe great but it's not for me from ebby will ltd store ever stock cargo pants yeah
[11473.28 --> 11479.44]  we're working on it what about jorts that's another popular request let's go what the heck
[11479.44 --> 11486.08]  are jorts jean shorts oh jean shorts not right now saying there's a chance boys yeah i'm not saying no
[11486.08 --> 11494.00]  i'm just saying not now dude plaid shirts and jorts we are working on more colors of the flannel plaid
[11494.00 --> 11499.68]  or plaid flannel or whatever order that goes in that's cool uh from blake hey linus and luke what's
[11499.68 --> 11504.00]  a skill or hobby you wish you had more time to work on i've been doing woodworking oh electronics
[11504.00 --> 11513.76]  for sure i wish i was like i i wish i like really understood pcb like design man i'd be super into
[11513.76 --> 11521.28]  that i wish i was better at flying rc aircraft those are probably the big ones i i'm like i'm super into
[11521.28 --> 11526.24]  those but i don't have the time for them electronics would be my number one but not to take exactly what you
[11526.24 --> 11531.68]  said um i would i would put out blacksmithing i've wanted to get into blacksmithing for a very very
[11531.68 --> 11537.60]  long time but like it's really expensive and you need space i'd find in high school whose mom was
[11537.60 --> 11542.88]  super into it's amazing the kind of stuff you can make like a hunk of iron and a hammer yeah and i feel
[11542.88 --> 11547.12]  like the i mean we were talking about this earlier right i think i feel like it would be very
[11548.80 --> 11551.92]  it would make my brain happy i've just always kind of thought that about
[11551.92 --> 11559.52]  boom boom just hit it hold it handle it i've been pretty worried about that uh which is one
[11559.52 --> 11564.00]  of the reasons why i i invited you to go to a blacksmithing course i'm super down still and the
[11564.00 --> 11569.36]  reason why i haven't brought up that topic again is because i'm waiting for a shoulder the bowling
[11569.36 --> 11573.92]  alley was actually almost a test for me i started with my right arm and then i think it was like three
[11573.92 --> 11581.60]  throws throws in i felt it like it didn't hurt yeah but i you know you can feel the like the warnings and i
[11581.60 --> 11586.56]  was like okay nope we're going to left arm and we're not doing blacksmithing yet uh but it's it's
[11586.56 --> 11594.16]  getting a lot better the the situation is improving so yeah uh daniel asks oh sorry union grievance
[11594.16 --> 11599.76]  you're just excited yeah i just want to go home all right final question from daniel what was the
[11599.76 --> 11605.92]  hardest part about leaving the old house and what was the easiest hardest part honestly um i think is the
[11606.56 --> 11611.04]  every year since our kids were born we don't have a ton of family traditions but we do have this one
[11611.04 --> 11616.16]  we mark the door frames with their height and we're gonna i don't know it's not going to feel
[11616.16 --> 11623.68]  authentic to you know measure them all and like go mark them on the new doors or something um so i'm
[11623.68 --> 11631.68]  gonna miss that you know decade old writing when we go and we look at their growth charts and um have you
[11631.68 --> 11636.16]  thought about taking like having one of your doors because it's the frame i have considered ripping the
[11636.16 --> 11640.80]  door frames off and putting them in the new house we're not going to do that okay yeah but yes i did think
[11640.80 --> 11647.52]  about it fair enough yeah that just felt a little too stupid it's someone said alex steel on youtube
[11647.52 --> 11651.92]  for blacksmithing content yeah he's awesome i watch a bunch of other people as well i'm i i like the
[11651.92 --> 11658.00]  creators i would just like to i've never like with sports back in the day i played every sport under the
