[0.00 → 4.32] reason right there that's fair enough, but that doesn't put them to bed welcome to the
[4.32 → 8.72] wan show ladies and gentlemen we've got a fantastic show lined up for you today yeah
[8.72 → 15.20] but unfortunately Luke can't stay for all of it because he has to go home and put his birds to bed
[16.40 → 21.12] that's right we're going to be talking home automation i do have an update on the task
[21.12 → 28.08] switch situation and hey if I'm getting rid of all of my switches i may have a recipient
[28.08 → 34.56] for my donation because Luke has to go home to turn off a light, so his bird will go to sleep an
[34.56 → 39.04] impressive amount of stuff at my house is literally your old things I'll also be updating you guys on
[39.04 → 45.76] the state of the lab we took possession on Wednesday and i got a chance to go over there today
[46.96 → 53.84] and it's not good um what else we got today we have a question about ROK devices we want to know why
[53.84 → 60.00] you use them um i would read from the doc for this question, but it would be the length of a full video
[60.00 → 65.92] so we'll probably hopefully uh communicate with the audience as much as possible also Canadians are up in
[65.92 → 74.80] arms because Tim Hortons has been tracking people Canadians are also up in arms over uh bill c11 or
[74.80 → 80.48] whatever uh that's supposed to be in the doc today but i guess we won't be talking about that in detail
[80.48 → 94.48] let's go ahead and roll that intro
[94.48 → 112.08] show is brought to you guys by Squarespace Zoho desk and well front today let's jump right into
[112.08 → 118.24] our headline topic you haven't seen the lab at all yet I've seen the outside of the building that's it
[118.24 → 127.68] all right when i saw it okay it's about 20 000 square feet it's a big building it's right on the
[127.68 → 132.88] end of this street like i could almost work from here to there uh it's got a lot of things going for
[132.88 → 139.60] it is has a ton of power yeah lots it's big enough that we can grow into it for quite some time like we
[139.60 → 146.56] could have a team of 30 40 people working out of there between developers engineers writing we could
[146.56 → 153.36] have a ton of creation going on over there um did I already mention it has a ton of power coming into
[153.36 → 160.32] it lots tons of power like large literally 300 000 watts of power it used to be like a machine shop
[160.32 → 165.20] or something yeah it used to be a sheet metal fabrication place yeah, yeah so it has a lot going
[165.20 → 169.76] for it when i saw it, it was all kind of humming you know there was a business running out of there and
[169.76 → 180.08] um everything seemed like kind of at least you know presentable well unfortunately between the
[180.08 → 185.68] things that they were supposed to do okay the things the seller was supposed to take care of
[185.68 → 192.56] like replacing ceiling tiles that had been stained by previous leaks or uh patching up holes
[192.56 → 202.96] um and the things that were just kind of concealed by the existing equipment right it is in a state that is
[204.24 → 216.48] literally six figures worse than i had anticipated oh yeah okay, and then you know that you know that
[216.48 → 222.24] tone you know when my phone ringer went off right before the start of the show and i was like oh this is
[222.24 → 228.24] this is worse yeah okay so that is for i can't name this person, yet they're still on their probation
[228.24 → 238.16] um, but you know who they are one uh got it one of those hi Gary and Linus after doing a bunch of digging
[238.16 → 248.80] i found a used EMC chamber that's fit for purpose the quote on it is 50 000 us dollars that's the deal one
[252.24 → 260.56] nice why don't we talk through some of the deficiencies at the new place okay, okay first
[260.56 → 267.52] things first they just outright ripped out um some of some of the things that were supposed
[267.52 → 274.24] to stay for example there's a safety rail up on one of the balconies that okay so well they didn't just
[274.24 → 279.36] take it off okay if they had just taken it off that might have actually been better there were air
[279.36 → 283.44] compressors up there that we knew they were going to take with them that's equipment that you might
[283.44 → 290.56] want to take with you sure but instead of dragging them down the stairs the hard way they just took
[290.56 → 299.52] a sawmill or a root zip or something cut off the safety rails so that they could get a forklift up
[299.52 → 306.88] there grabbed it and booked it, and we're sitting here going so now you've basically taken it taken
[306.88 → 315.52] a building that was up to safety code you have unsafely codified it and just left this like 80
[315.52 → 321.60] pound hunk of steel or actually multiple ones just left them there hey you can bring that to a scrapyard
[321.60 → 327.52] hey thanks for that like five bucks, and it's just like weird stuff they took with them okay i have
[327.52 → 333.28] never I've never seen I've never seen anything like it, they took the paper towel dispensers off
[333.28 → 338.08] the bathroom walls they might need those in the new place well right, but that's the kind of thing
[338.08 → 343.12] that's typically included in a base building yeah they left the toilet paper dispensers but not the
[343.12 → 351.44] paper towels oh no not the paper towel dispensers they took doorknobs now to be clear they were
[351.44 → 360.08] combination door locks doorknobs which I'm not electronic ones not fancy ones in any way i
[360.08 → 365.92] could see them wanting to take those with them, but you're supposed to replace them with something
[366.64 → 373.52] so as it is you just stick a screwdriver in the thing nice and I'm just I'm sitting here going this
[373.52 → 381.12] is this is ridiculous that's legit you should like weld in uh LTT screwdrivers to all the doors and just
[381.12 → 390.16] have that be the doorknobs no, no no it would look cool no constant sponsorship every video
[392.48 → 403.52] basically can you go after them for this unfortunately there is no okay i don't know where you guys live
[403.52 → 410.40] but depending on the market that you're in um consumer protections or buyer protections in real
[410.40 → 418.08] estate have been significantly eroded yeah over well the last quite a few years to the point where
[418.08 → 425.76] you know when Yvonne and i bought our house our first home um it was normal for us to have
[425.76 → 433.60] like a multi-week due diligence period where we could go arrange our financing after making an offer
[434.24 → 440.16] get a proper thorough home inspection so that the so that the purchase agreement could have all the
[440.16 → 447.36] details for the things that need to be fixed before we move in um and there would be you know a reasonable
[447.36 → 454.00] in good faith negotiation process over these potential issues for example the house that we lived in for
[454.00 → 461.28] 10 years um the previous owners uh our home inspector noted that the water tank was like on
[461.28 → 467.12] its last legs it was going to go and so the previous owners in order to get the deal done split the cost
[467.12 → 472.40] of that that water tank with us so that when we were buying the home it would be in a reasonable ready to
[472.40 → 480.00] move into state well that's gone like in the lower mainland there i mean they are trying they are now
[480.00 → 486.64] talking about legislation that is going to eliminate blind bidding for example they are talking about
[486.64 → 494.32] legislation to have a mandatory cool down period so after an offer you have a mandatory period of time
[494.32 → 498.48] where you're allowed to go through that due diligence it's not long enough what I've seen proposed not
[498.48 → 505.36] nearly long enough, but they're starting to do something, but it doesn't exist right now so
[505.36 → 512.80] commercial real estate here is not quite as bad it's not it has not gotten quite as bad as residential
[512.80 → 518.00] but it's getting there it's getting really rough, and we are at a point now where we did do an
[518.00 → 526.24] inspection, so the base building envelope is at least sound you know, but those little details are things
[526.24 → 534.96] that you have essentially no, no leverage on and what we know is that after we made our offer another offer
[534.96 → 540.56] came in higher after our offer had been accepted so we knew that if we came in, and we pushed back
[540.56 → 547.68] and we said hey we want you guys to fix up this and do that and ensure x and y and z
[548.24 → 553.76] just go with the other they could have basically just kind of said no and our options would have been
[554.48 → 563.36] accept no for an answer or let the offer lapse, and they just take a different offer so if we wanted to close the deal
[563.36 → 568.08] which like i said there are a lot of benefits to it in terms of location in terms of size
[568.80 → 575.68] it's not a very nice building which is actually our advantage it's not well set up for its large
[575.68 → 580.96] enough that you should be running you know significant amounts of shipping in and out of it like it's
[580.96 → 588.40] 20 000 square feet um, but it's really not set up very well for truck access so it's like kind of crappy
[588.40 → 594.08] building but because all we need is a ton of power a ton of space and backpack storage
[595.28 → 602.00] and backpack storage sorry um potentially um is perfect for us right so it is a lot of stars aligned
[603.52 → 606.96] so what choice did we have really yeah
[609.12 → 615.28] yikes yeah um i mean i could go on we filmed a video while we were over there jams Yvonne and i
[615.28 → 619.52] jams was the only one who knew exactly where we were planning to put people there's just man
[619.52 → 624.56] there's a lot of stuff that i just feel like a combination of i wish I'd looked a little closer
[624.56 → 628.96] not that it would have made a difference we would have done it anyway there's no other building its
[628.96 → 635.20] kind of like it's kind of like buying a new car and then getting it home and realizing like your
[635.20 → 640.08] favourite your favourite coffee mug doesn't fit in the cupholder that well here or whatever yeah yeah
[640.08 → 644.72] just little things like that or holy crap it doesn't support android auto it only supports
[644.72 → 649.76] CarPlay and I'm an android kind of character i like i didn't realize it takes premium gas i don't want
[649.76 → 654.08] to pay for that yeah yeah see then nothing that's a dealbreaker you probably would have bought the
[654.08 → 662.00] same car anyway but like oh instead of walking around it and being like oh shiny excite
[664.08 → 667.12] I'm a little frustrated I'm a little disappointed and i wish that
[667.12 → 671.60] i wish i had been a little more prepared it should just and like you're talking about
[671.60 → 675.36] like the laws here should probably just be better but like you shouldn't be able to go into a building
[675.36 → 682.00] that you're handing off and just chop stuff up like the railings like the door handles
[682.96 → 688.32] no that's pretty crappy the door handles should be there should be some form of door handles
[688.32 → 692.00] like you said though they could take the like smart ones whatever and then put in like fairly
[692.00 → 696.88] standard door handles yeah as long as their door handles that function yes whatever but like
[697.44 → 702.64] so that should be done you shouldn't be able to completely remove functionality of a door yeah and
[703.36 → 708.24] and then also you shouldn't just like chop up safety railings like that's both of those things are
[708.24 → 714.24] crazy yeah like neither these are like somewhat reasonable the thing to understand too is that
[714.24 → 721.52] there are three parties involved there's the buyer the seller and the tenant so it was the tenant going and
[721.52 → 729.28] they don't care it's not their deal they don't oh the odds of the seller even if we do come back to
[729.28 → 735.52] the seller and be like um actually no this does need to be fixed the odds of them going and chasing
[735.52 → 742.00] this prior tenant and retrieving it basically minimal so they went in there and went as long as
[742.00 → 748.00] we don't do like a hundred grand worth of damage to this place it's unlikely to be worth the cost of
[748.00 → 755.92] pursuing this legally so we can just go for it yikes let's talk about the good things yikes the labs team
[755.92 → 762.24] is up to i believe six people now yeah they're working out of the old creator warehouse space um
[762.24 → 769.44] Gary got deported it's complicated, but he'll be back um so he's working out of where he used to live
[769.44 → 776.08] for now yeah i keep here i keep thinking that he's here and then hearing that he's not and I'm
[776.08 → 784.88] like yeah oh it's complicated okay um oh okay uh all right some other good things about the lab the
[784.88 → 790.24] line of sight between the existing office and the lab looks good so we should be able to set up Wi-Fi
[790.24 → 795.76] dishes that's going to be pretty cool um what else is good there's already been some perfect work done
[795.76 → 803.44] yep i mean uh this is apparently a deal so I'm apparently getting a deal on uh on an anechoic
[804.08 → 811.04] chamber so that's good how big is it i mean it looks pretty sick is that like walking
[811.04 → 817.76] it's three meters so like that looks pretty cool that's not small that makes sense that it's that
[817.76 → 826.32] expensive i thought this was like okay yeah yeah yeah i mean so that's things that big are gonna
[826.80 → 835.68] yeah they're going to cost some moola is it like on springs or anything um i guess you could just mount
[835.68 → 843.12] it however you wanted I'm adding Yvonne to this yeah we gotta it's fostered it's we have to do
[843.12 → 849.84] stuff um we'll make it oh man there's uh oh, oh man i found out my office is smaller than i thought
[849.84 → 858.40] oh no my office is going to get smaller oh daddy nidus okay come on more office with the two windows but
[858.40 → 864.96] it's too small you know i don't have to give you one you're not
[864.96 → 872.80] i thought we did not really i thought we established this a call room yeah, but it's
[872.80 → 877.36] yours whenever you want it do you want to show up to my call room no you can come to my office
[877.36 → 882.16] it's actually not huge enough to like to meet with multiple people and also have my oh that's
[882.16 → 887.36] not great yeah, yeah like it's wait how small is it then compare can you compare it to like this room
[887.36 → 895.28] uh it's maybe to like that kind of almost vertical two by six no it's not that big actually maybe more
[895.28 → 901.20] like to that light and then like to here yeah you can fit people in their well i mean i need my desk
[901.20 → 906.56] in there too yeah and stuff and like I'd like to have a test bench and stuff oh so like you want to
[906.56 → 911.20] transplant the same setup yeah like is it smaller than that one yeah it's smaller than my existing so i
[911.20 → 916.32] went from i went from i had the biggest office in this building to Yvonne took it and then i went into
[916.32 → 920.72] your old office Yvonne shares hers with like two other people one other person two you're right
[920.72 → 925.84] you're right you're right so i had like i had like the king office and then i went to the one
[925.84 → 932.16] that we built for you, and then you got none and then now I'm actually downgrading again and um i guess
[932.16 → 938.24] what we could probably infer from the fact that I'm getting a smaller one and your new one is smaller
[938.24 → 945.52] than my new one is that yours will be a significant downgrade from your old one yeah um i don't need a
[945.52 → 950.80] big office though yeah i would meet with probably a maximum of one person at a time, or it would just
[950.80 → 955.60] make more sense to go to a conference room okay that's another thing the place we had planned to
[955.60 → 961.20] put the server room the walls don't go all the way up noise isolation for it is going to be a
[961.20 → 968.72] significant challenge everything can be overcome not good everything can be overcome it's just you raise
[968.72 → 976.48] the walls' money yeah, yeah time no changing out the walls going to be a challenge because you can't just
[976.48 → 982.32] like because of the parking being maxed out we can't make any actual structural changes to the building
[983.52 → 990.24] so i don't know maybe we just Huck a bunch of like structural rock wool up there yeah okay like you
[990.24 → 997.52] can't change the floor plan essentially oh so it's not a room no it's like it's like a half wall up to
[997.52 → 1004.96] a t-bar drop ceiling got it yeah it's not it's not a real wall yeah uh we did find a place for a fire
[1004.96 → 1011.60] pole so that's good you're actually doing it no okay definitely not yeah I'm excited to move in i guess
[1011.60 → 1017.36] that's part of why I'm so disappointed because i was really excited to move in, and today reality hit me
[1017.36 → 1026.16] like a sledgehammer to the face that i am not moving in anytime soon i and nobody else are moving
[1026.16 → 1032.16] in at least like a couple of months okay yeah it's going to be it's going to be rough sounds like I'm working
[1032.16 → 1037.84] from home for a bit more boys or a bit more yep i hope you've got air conditioning at your house i do
[1037.84 → 1046.24] actually good excellent yeah that worked out that fixed yeah okay it's okay it's okay fine what do you
[1046.24 → 1051.04] want to talk about next why don't you pick a topic because i just i can't right now I'm sorry update on
[1051.04 → 1056.16] the jazzco situation will this make you happy no okay i thought it was good i thought it was good we
[1056.16 → 1062.24] can go to something else uh Tim Hortons is tracking your bits' no that's not good news either Luke uh
[1062.24 → 1068.96] let's talk jazzco last week i talked about the situation where jazzco the manufacturer of the motion
[1068.96 → 1075.28] sensing smart switches that i installed in my new house refused to provide updated firmware for the
[1075.28 → 1083.04] switches after Jake and i experienced um buggy behaviour we have since done a lot of troubleshooting
[1083.04 → 1089.36] we've gone back and forth with jazzco and there are a few noteworthy outcomes here outcome number one
[1089.36 → 1096.80] is that jazzco has publicly stated that they will engage with the community in an in good faith on the
[1096.80 → 1102.88] issue of firmware availability whether this ends up looking like you request it from them and they provide
[1102.88 → 1109.36] it or a download page on their website that's yet to be seen, but they've had high level discussions
[1109.36 → 1113.44] internally, and it looks like that's something that's going to change very good so that is
[1113.44 → 1121.12] excellent awesome great bad news oh more good news first more good news i don't know what was going on
[1121.12 → 1124.64] well we have an idea what's going on we'll give you more details on that in a moment but
[1124.64 → 1132.88] um i did manage to disable the motion sensor so i went and i bet i tried again and remember that
[1132.88 → 1136.96] issue i had where i thought maybe a firmware update would fix not being able to disable the motion sensor
[1136.96 → 1142.08] on it well i tried it and i worked was able to disable the motion nice gotta love when troubleshooting
[1142.08 → 1149.04] happens yeah so maybe i don't need new firmware also you should have access to new firmware anyway
[1149.04 → 1158.32] Vasco mixed up their hexadecimal and their binary and the firmware sorry hexadecimal and
[1158.32 → 1162.16] hold on let me double-check i mean that could be a thing but i don't know what you're talking about
[1163.28 → 1170.00] okay uh lets uh they actually like talk to you about this in an email uh yeah yep yep
[1170.00 → 1176.88] yep okay that's a lot of emails uh so they mixed up their so when certifying the firmware with
[1176.88 → 1183.36] the Z-Wave alliance you must fill out the form using hexadecimal format this was entered in as 32
[1183.36 → 1189.20] and was incorrectly translated from hex oh sorry two decimal as 50. The correct version for that
[1189.20 → 1199.36] certification should be 32. So the so-called 5.50 firmware is the one that I was using they do not
[1199.36 → 1206.48] have updated firmware they did send me the files so I can try to ref lash and see if that fixes any
[1206.48 → 1211.12] potential issue Jake validated this already so you don't have to check and see if there are no checks
[1214.56 → 1219.36] but then I was able to disable the motion anyway but then I was able to replicate the issue where i
[1219.36 → 1224.80] was not able to disable the motion because I went to adopt yet another switch, and it actually grabbed
[1224.80 → 1232.48] the same device number within the like the Z-Wave JS thing in home assistant and then like neither of
[1232.48 → 1238.48] them would work properly until i uh I disconnected both of them and then adopt them both adopted them
[1238.48 → 1244.56] both again, and then they would work so it could still there could still be buggy behaviour we don't
[1244.56 → 1251.92] know whether that is on home assistant or uh I think it's like a Z-Wave.js or something like that
[1251.92 → 1256.32] completely regardless you should still be able to access the firmware yes you should still have access to
[1256.32 → 1261.12] firmware I was still right to be mad about the fact that they would not give me firmware because I would have
[1261.12 → 1266.00] been far less mad if I just had bought a buggy product I still would have been mad I have also
[1266.00 → 1273.12] found bugs that have not been resolved for example the by the firmware by anything okay yeah by
[1273.12 → 1279.12] anything so the timeout so you would think at least I believe that's what this parameter does disclaimer i
[1279.12 → 1284.08] don't know maybe it does something else entirely I don't know but I would think that on a motion sensor
[1284.08 → 1292.08] a timeout field would affect how long it is until the motion sensor kicks back in so if i were to
[1292.64 → 1298.00] turn it off if it were to turn off how long before it starts sensing again and as it is, they're immediate
[1298.00 → 1305.04] out of the box so you can press the button to leave the bathroom and as you walk away it'll turn back on
[1305.04 → 1309.84] that's obviously not a desirable behaviour so I think that's what that field's supposed to do okay changing
[1309.84 → 1314.96] that does not appear to affect anything there's also a vacancy mode's kind of cool
[1314.96 → 1320.08] so occupancy mode turns on the light when it senses motion and then turns off the light when it stops
[1320.08 → 1327.36] sensing motion right vacancy mode will only turn on the light when you turn it on, and then it will turn
[1327.36 → 1334.08] it off when you leave vacancy mode does not appear to be functioning correctly but again I don't know
[1334.08 → 1338.64] whose fault that is so I'm not going to point any fingers yet sure what I do know is that there have
[1338.64 → 1346.08] been other developments seeing the problems that I was having with jazz I've had um one of the switch
[1346.08 → 1352.88] companies that a lot of people actually said that I should check out in the comments under last week's
[1352.88 → 1361.68] LAN show one of them reached out uh in the valley I want to say in uh yeah yep in a valley reached out
[1361.68 → 1368.16] um biotech reached out I think you mentioned in a valley in the on the show and there's
[1368.64 → 1375.52] yeah yeah so in a valley reached out uh biotech reached out and actually there's another switch
[1375.52 → 1385.92] company that um that Jake found that is so cool you should have a battle you should get like a sample
[1385.92 → 1392.40] set of switches from each one and have like a uh battle Royal realistically that's what we probably
[1392.40 → 1399.36] should have done, but one lives we just like are very busy we're very busy people, and it's like
[1399.36 → 1405.60] it's tough oh, but it's a video it's content if you don't have time you don't have time
[1407.36 → 1416.40] okay check these out okay widget apparently these guys are oh my stop enough apparently these guys are
[1416.40 → 1424.08] Canadian these are modular smart home switches so they've got humidity sensors motion
[1424.08 → 1431.52] sensors oh that's cool like you can put an USB port in there they're kind of fugly um in my humble
[1431.52 → 1437.12] opinion sorry widget I don't think they're that bad but in terms of functionality this looks flipping
[1437.76 → 1444.16] amazing so being able to just be like yeah hey couldn't help noticing that it's a little humid in here
[1444.16 → 1448.24] don't mind me going to switch on your fan in the bathroom do you care about the aesthetics of the
[1448.24 → 1454.80] switch if it felt good if the haptics were good oh that overpowered the aesthetics that's far more
[1454.80 → 1460.48] important yeah I agree I mean that's the main reason that I didn't go with um ca seta or whatever
[1460.48 → 1469.52] who's who's the parent brand uh for uh smart switches ca seta is it lutron yeah that's why i
[1469.52 → 1475.44] didn't go with those because they feel awful they're just abhorrent if I ever have to actually
[1475.44 → 1482.64] use them with my fingers it's its like i just I feel guilty spending money on them like i just i
[1482.64 → 1486.56] can't believe I gave them money for you know what do you want to reward that like terrible haptics
[1486.56 → 1494.56] yeah it's so important way to cheap out in the most obvious user facing kind of way you
[1494.56 → 1502.56] idiots like just that kind of thing you know yeah it's tough for sure so Vasco situation still
[1502.56 → 1508.96] developing the first video on it is going to be edited when Jake's back from uh back from vacation
[1508.96 → 1515.60] so whenever that happens, and we will hopefully get you guys completely up to speed you'll get to live
[1515.60 → 1521.60] through the frustration with us, it's definitely worth a watch just because i I don't remember the last
[1521.60 → 1527.60] time my anger was that white-hot man when i was always fun when I was on the phone and they
[1527.60 → 1532.40] were like sorry sir we do not provide firmware that's proprietary I'm like
[1536.08 → 1543.60] I will, I do applaud their change of stance me to credit where it's due yeah okay there is an
[1543.60 → 1550.88] enormous difference between having a know an ass backwards way of thinking and doubling down on it
[1551.52 → 1557.60] and having an ass backwards way of thinking and someone honestly not that nicely yeah sure
[1558.48 → 1565.04] telling you that your way of thinking is ass backwards and still having the maturity to self-reflect
[1565.04 → 1572.96] and go I respect that a ton I think that's huge okay yeah it's time to change yeah and if they
[1572.96 → 1578.72] actually follow through fully because there's still some follow-through right yes but if they
[1578.72 → 1583.12] actually follow through fully that's huge and very cool and I respect it, but there's the public
[1583.12 → 1589.28] commitment they are publicly in touch with home assistant that's a big deal that's cool that's a
[1589.28 → 1596.64] huge deal for the DIY community and the more and you have to understand like there is absolutely
[1596.64 → 1603.20] attention on this and seeing Vasco reverse seeing Vasco embrace this I guarantee you that'll put
[1603.20 → 1607.84] pressure on other players in the industry absolutely to take a more open approach and that's what we need
[1607.84 → 1614.72] because that's what's breaking smart home stuff that's what's killing the adoption is you've got all these
[1614.72 → 1621.60] horrible fragmented ecosystems, and you know as a consumer right let's say I couldn't afford to
[1621.60 → 1627.92] replace all the switches in my house like the vast majority of people let's say I wanted to upgrade
[1627.92 → 1635.28] piecemeal how do I know which one is still going to exist for me to actually get another one in a year
[1635.28 → 1641.44] or two years or five years so knowing that these are open, and they can all ultimately be tied together
[1641.44 → 1646.00] it's very cool it's critical yeah because otherwise why would you take that first step
[1646.00 → 1651.36] why would you get a smart switch so that you can turn your bird's stupid light on
[1652.00 → 1659.84] from a distance instead of driving all the way home to turn a light on or off to put your bird to bed
[1659.84 → 1665.68] what is wrong with you sorry those of you who missed it Luke's excuse for not coming over to watch
[1665.68 → 1670.72] a movie with more complications than that for not coming over to watch a movie with me tonight
[1670.72 → 1676.24] is that he has to go home so he can turn off the light so he can put his bird to bed and then
[1676.24 → 1684.16] put them to bed please explain so okay, so there are two things going on here one is that the birds have
[1684.16 → 1689.44] to go to bed eventually my girlfriend gets home and the second is you are a giant bird simp and the second
[1689.44 → 1698.96] yeah sure uh and the second is that they are they have extremely, extremely bad dark vision
[1698.96 → 1706.56] they become like effectively blind the second it's like dimly lit in the room um like one of the
[1706.56 → 1713.04] the easiest ways to catch them is just had a few light sources that are generally far away and turn off all
[1713.04 → 1716.96] the close ones, and then you just walk up to them and go like scoop because they can't see anything
[1716.96 → 1724.96] um so I don't I I have mentioned many times I don't have home automation stuff I forgot to turn
[1724.96 → 1729.84] the light on before I usually leave I remember so it's going to be actually it's summer now it probably
[1729.84 → 1735.84] doesn't matter actually they're birds, and it probably never mattered but carry on so it would be really dark
[1735.84 → 1742.08] and they would be uncomfortable, and it would be bad for them um, and then it's their bedtime around like
[1742.08 → 1751.20] 8 30 and sometimes the wans show can go real late that's fair real late that's fair what you said so
[1751.20 → 1755.36] I have to put them to bed I don't have to like it but I do have to respect it I don't think I'm going
[1755.36 → 1762.32] to be able to home automate putting them to bed I bet you could, it's possible man you do a little light
[1762.32 → 1766.88] curtain thing for their thing it's possible that would actually be kind of a cool project it could be
[1766.88 → 1772.56] kind of neat we uh title for the video bell can you note this down we solved the world's
[1772.56 → 1780.00] the stupidest problem I mean I think that would be a great collab with Simone Hertz it'd be sweet yeah
[1780.00 → 1785.84] like just building a stupid machine for a thing that no one should have to do okay Luke you know that
[1785.84 → 1792.64] not everyone babies their budgie the way that you do right sure and that your budgies but I do your
[1792.64 → 1799.60] budgies are playing you right sure okay I'm just making sure that I heard that bird dad
[1800.48 → 1807.52] I don't like this anti-bird stance line look I'm not I'm not anti birds aren't real no Canada is not
[1807.52 → 1813.84] real or Canada neither of them are real um as for Canada geese well they're double not real they're
[1813.84 → 1822.08] birds and Canadian um yeah I don't know I can make it work I can make it work it just probably I'd have to
[1822.08 → 1832.24] go home first that's all i have to put them to bed dude okay why why don't why don't we talk

[2064.08 → 2071.12] is an interactive topic ladies and gentlemen we had a lot of sorry I have one question you mentioned uh that
[2071.12 → 2075.20] you had a rant that's in a video that's coming up that's like the angriest you've been in a long
[2075.20 → 2085.36] time that's not really a question is it worse than eggshell uh I think I was uh so the thing about
[2085.36 → 2090.64] this is a question brought by the audience yeah the thing about the paint issue is that it had been
[2090.64 → 2096.56] like a slow burn right like i it had been one issue after another after another we're
[2096.56 → 2101.04] still not done with the issues with those painters by the way did I talk at all about how like they
[2101.04 → 2106.80] masking taped everything even though no professional painter in my opinion should be masking everything
[2106.80 → 2110.64] off with tape like that you should just know how to cut a straight line with a three-inch brush
[2111.28 → 2117.12] because you're a professional anyway the point is like super hard masking tape who did I think it was
[2117.12 → 2122.88] David called you out in some video because you did a line without masking, but it was all messy yes it's
[2122.88 → 2126.80] it's good enough it's better than what happens with masking tape especially if you leave it on for
[2126.80 → 2130.08] too long I don't know because so they left the masking tape on too long and there are places where
[2130.08 → 2135.20] once they finally ripped it away because it's latex paint it's kind of rubbery it peels away a
[2135.20 → 2139.76] bunch of the freaking wall too so then you what you're going to go back in with the sandpaper go cut the
[2139.76 → 2146.32] line anyway you might as well just cut it in the first place yeah basically um so it would have been
[2146.32 → 2149.52] a bit of a slow burn because it was like one issue after another after another
[2149.52 → 2158.64] whereas the shock the pure shock and awe of a company telling me that they have firmware so that
[2158.64 → 2163.12] that was a miscommunication obviously but the part that wasn't a miscommunication was that they do not
[2163.12 → 2171.76] provide them to clients that just it enraged me, so this is another level yeah it's like it's like sudden
[2171.76 → 2178.40] onset road rage versus like you've had a really long week, and you're tired and irritable right okay yeah
[2178.40 → 2186.32] yeah yeah yeah like that guy cut me off you know like just what exciting who does that who takes the
[2186.32 → 2194.56] paper towel dispensers out of the building and cuts off the safety rails are you did you film yeah nice
[2195.20 → 2199.36] Yvonne was actually the one who noticed it I didn't even notice because I was just like yeah I'm chill
[2199.36 → 2204.88] whatever I spent like two summers of my life walking around on roofs I don't care about like an open
[2204.88 → 2210.24] drop but from a like safety regulate regulatory standpoint right you do have to she was looking
[2210.24 → 2218.24] at it going um what money yeah yeah yep yep yep okay what are we supposed to be talking about here
[2218.96 → 2220.80] ah yes this is an interactive topic
[2223.20 → 2229.44] I posted just a little open letter to the float plane community earlier this week just being like hey
[2229.44 → 2234.96] hey really appreciate you guys I think it was the day that the money came out of our account for the
[2234.96 → 2242.00] lab and I was feeling a lot of anxiety because it's the most money that we've ever spent I don't know
[2242.00 → 2247.44] if I've disclosed the amount, but it was 13 13 and a half million dollars by the time all the fees were
[2247.44 → 2255.28] accounted for big bucks Canadian dollars I guess so like 10 us, but that's I mean far and away the most
[2255.28 → 2260.72] money we've ever spent on everything to be clear no we don't have 10 million dollars in the bank um
[2260.72 → 2267.12] we financed it so it was uh it was 10 down, but that's still a million dollars going out of the bank
[2267.12 → 2273.44] account um, and so I was feeling really stressed out and i I was like you know needed a minute and so i
[2273.44 → 2280.16] sat and I just typed up a little thing like hey float plane appreciate you um because yeah it's not
[2280.16 → 2287.20] as it's not as big of a driver of overall revenue compared to certain other business units whether
[2287.20 → 2293.44] it's like creator warehouse or uh the business team again love you business team real don't leave me um
[2294.48 → 2301.04] but it's really consistent like that community has stood behind us um yeah there's almost 21 000
[2301.04 → 2306.40] they're almost 21 000 strong, and you know those are real numbers at that point you know I can
[2306.40 → 2311.44] know that if my payments for this building are going to be off actually yeah
[2311.44 → 2317.52] hundreds of thousands of dollars a year which they are that you know float plane is going to be there
[2317.52 → 2322.56] providing that that consistent income right like it's its a big deal right, and so I was just like
[2322.56 → 2327.76] hey float plane appreciate you um anyway that uh the comments under that ended up having a lot of
[2327.76 → 2332.48] really great feedback about what we could do to make the platform better to help attract more people to
[2332.48 → 2339.52] it and keep growing it right because that's going to be it's going to get tougher as we go
[2339.52 → 2344.64] harder on manufacturers I think there are going to be significant sponsors that walk away from us
[2344.64 → 2351.52] and that's something that I've had to kind of steal myself for because we can't have it both ways right
[2351.52 → 2357.28] we can't have hey we're going to be brutally honest, but also we're going to sweep things under the rug when
[2357.28 → 2363.36] it's convenient right, so sponsors are going to have to just put on their big kid pants and deal with
[2363.36 → 2369.36] some of them sometimes do we're going to be critical of them and other times we're going to be engaging
[2369.36 → 2375.12] with them in a sponsored capacity and that's just the way it has to be if you want access to our audience
[2375.12 → 2379.20] who trusts us because we're going to give it to them straight then you're just going to have to take
[2379.20 → 2384.88] your lumps when they come right and um oh I forget where I was going with this
[2387.52 → 2391.44] right right right so these great suggestions to help grow this community which we're going to
[2391.44 → 2398.72] become more reliant on uh one of the one of the ones I saw over and over again is you need a ROK app
[2399.36 → 2406.64] and the first question that came to my mind various smart TV NVIDIA shield app Apple TV app yeah but
[2406.64 → 2414.08] ROK fire stick app is the one that I saw the most and ROK's have existed since back when I was
[2414.08 → 2422.16] working at NCI best buy for me, I didn't understand the reason that they existed than me neither and i
[2422.16 → 2427.76] don't understand the reason that they exist now me neither so I really want this to be a super
[2427.76 → 2434.08] interactive topic with you guys the community ROK lovers I want to know I want to know why did people
[2434.08 → 2440.08] buy them from NCI a handful yeah because I used to work at Best Buy no one ever bought them from
[2440.08 → 2446.08] best buy well that's okay and when I say some people I mean like we would sell three a week yeah
[2446.08 → 2452.24] like not a significant number so I just didn't get it like compared to something like the um do you
[2452.24 → 2460.80] remember popcorn time yeah yeah so compared to like popcorn time which was like a super clean way
[2460.80 → 2465.52] of tormenting movies back in the day it's not crazy not only would you torrent the movies but there
[2465.52 → 2472.00] was a great interface for browsing them like very Netflix-esque and then instead of waiting for the
[2472.00 → 2478.56] whole thing to download and then playing it popcorn time had figured out how to download the chunks in
[2478.56 → 2485.20] order and serve the video to you as it's streaming down so it essentially you would stream it really
[2485.20 → 2492.16] like Netflix, but then you would yeah, but then you would have the full file at the end of streaming it
[2492.16 → 2498.88] like tormenting uh it was kind of mind-blowing obviously it was like illegal and i to my knowledge
[2498.88 → 2504.56] doesn't exist any more maybe it does, but then there was also the patriot box office whose main function
[2504.56 → 2512.64] was it was really easy to access in that particular case uh I think it was like Korean soaps and um and
[2512.64 → 2518.08] like Chinese shows and stuff like that so I mean we would sell hundreds a week of devices like that
[2519.20 → 2527.68] but you know ROK especially back then when almost no one was paying for like web video content uh
[2528.40 → 2535.76] i just I didn't really get it then and nowadays I mean there's your TV which probably has a lot of
[2535.76 → 2544.80] apps for it already there's the NVIDIA shield which I mean whatever I might think of NVIDIA
[2544.80 → 2551.44] the shield is basically just an absolute no-brainer for me if you want a smart interface for a TV that
[2551.44 → 2558.88] either doesn't have one or has a poor one it's expensive yes I don't know how much ROK costs at all
[2558.88 → 2566.08] they have high-end models have we gotten any like really great feedback from people something
[2566.08 → 2572.64] that I saw that I'm looking into yeah um, and it does totally seem like it's a thing is there's a
[2572.64 → 2582.16] a bunch of TVs that have ROK integration by TCL has built-in ROK not just that RCA TCL on
[2582.16 → 2592.00] uh on is uh Walmart's house brand hi sense um yeah and like they're available at Costco which is
[2592.00 → 2596.16] probably where a lot of them come from Walmart which is probably where a lot of something being
[2596.16 → 2601.36] available isn't a reason to buy one no but if there's a TV at Costco a lot of people are probably
[2601.36 → 2606.80] going to assume that it's at least a decent offer like I bet you Costco there's a lot of TVs oh I see
[2606.80 → 2613.20] you mean a lot of the ones a lot of the TVs at Costco have on board ROK i I think, so there's
[2613.20 → 2618.64] multiple TVs at Costco that have it got it because it looks like yeah there's three different high sense
[2618.64 → 2627.04] TVs at Costco that have ROK built in okay all right what else we got here um some other people
[2627.04 → 2635.76] saying that they prefer ROK to their TVs already existing smart TV stuff Kuala says I love mine because
[2635.76 → 2640.64] it's more reliably updated and performs better than the built-in TV apps I can also take it on vacation
[2640.64 → 2646.88] yeah that okay so that wraps in actually a lot of other feedback that I've seen okay hammy 3d says
[2646.88 → 2652.00] cracking a fire stick is the best way at the moment so that might be a good reason to have one of
[2652.00 → 2661.36] those the remote is good says dextrous man x76 um ninja man away over on float plane chat says my ISB
[2661.36 → 2666.72] gave me my ISP gave me their streaming box for free, but it's a rebranded ROK okay that I didn't know
[2666.72 → 2675.44] that's interesting so basically way more people are using these than I realized I guess probably me as
[2675.44 → 2687.12] well okay so is this something, but man like oh it's going to be tough it's going to be tough i I can't, I can't
[2687.12 → 2695.20] promise guys yeah building a whole new platform just because I don't think it's yeah okay this is
[2695.20 → 2699.68] a good point Joseph says my grandparents got a ROK because they didn't know Chromecast existed yeah like
[2699.68 → 2708.40] if you want a low cast op or a low-cost option Chromecast I like I still I don't know it's one of
[2708.40 → 2718.40] the okay it's one of those things that I look at and I go yes I see the value add I just don't see
[2718.40 → 2725.04] the value add compared to other options if I wanted a super premium option I would absolutely get a shield
[2725.04 → 2732.48] if I wanted a budget option I would go for a Chromecast or I'm sure there are like low cost
[2732.48 → 2742.88] uh you know random ones that you can also get yeah there is and like I've never personally used it
[2742.88 → 2751.44] but this app has actually existed for a really long time now um which one just share screen hydration
[2751.44 → 2759.36] you can sure and like again I haven't personally used it um oh seriously, but this has existed for
[2760.16 → 2764.40] an extremely long time and everyone that I know that uses it says that it's good
[2764.40 → 2769.76] um, and it like works with your different subscriptions like it shows there there 's's like it works
[2769.76 → 2776.64] with so if you're subscribed to LTT and in this example nitwit ultra or whatever else it should work
[2776.64 → 2782.64] with all of that you can browse your various channels like i I've heard very good things about this um
[2782.64 → 2792.32] um okay I should probably reach out to BML zoo town at some point yeah and maybe just get him to
[2792.32 → 2797.60] like make it officially for us or something yeah yeah I don't know I don't have any money right now but
[2797.60 → 2804.00] maybe someday we could pay for it, I don't know all right yeah but yeah like honestly the
[2804.00 → 2811.60] uh a lot of the team is sick right now is what I will say without getting into specifics yeah that's
[2811.60 → 2818.96] fair um and the dev bandwidth that we have to be able to type of kind of spread around is very
[2818.96 → 2825.28] limited currently um I am hiring a speaking of having no money um I am hiring a back-end developer
[2825.28 → 2832.24] to try to come in and help support the flow plane team um and but it's going to like to take some time
[2832.24 → 2837.28] for that person to get onboarded and there 's's other extremely important things on the roadmap that
[2837.28 → 2844.80] would have to get done ahead of time etc but yeah all right um I guess it's the point in the show
[2844.80 → 2850.16] where we take some merch messages bell do you want to hit me with some merch messages I would love to
[2851.04 → 2856.08] from reed what are your thoughts on the new Varro making a VR headset with a brain controlled
[2856.08 → 2860.72] interface do you think that's what could make the push from for VR to become less of an experience
[2860.72 → 2868.72] and more of an everyday product uh I would say that the brain control interface stuff would have to be
[2870.16 → 2873.04] way better than any version I have ever used
[2873.04 → 2883.60] um and I doubt it um if it was then sweet but I find a lot of them end up turning into um
[2886.16 → 2893.60] less less like neural impulse control and more uh facial muscle movements um because you actually
[2893.60 → 2898.24] get a lot more man it's been a long time since I've read this up so I'm going to say some things wrong
[2898.24 → 2905.28] but like the electrical whatever stuff you get a lot more of it by just like smiling right so a
[2905.28 → 2910.40] lot of it ends up being like you just move your face around and that interfaces with it better um
[2911.36 → 2916.72] but I mean maybe they have a way better version I don't know I'd love to try this yeah at the very
[2916.72 → 2923.84] least apparently it's crazy high resolution and I think it costs like two grand or something like
[2923.84 → 2933.12] that like what damn oh the arrow well okay I think the arrow is not the like crazy okay well that one's
[2933.12 → 2942.48] two grand, so there's that uh man could it possibly be worth double a valve index
[2944.48 → 2949.60] uh yeah valve index is kind of old at this point yeah I guess that's I guess that's fair especially
[2949.60 → 2956.80] in a market that's like so cutting edge yeah yeah I guess that's I guess that's fair it's just it's
[2956.80 → 2963.84] easy to forget 200 hertz oh no that's the eye tracking I guess it's easy to forget that there's a ton
[2964.40 → 2970.24] of other VR headset companies out there they just are almost all focused on commercial products because
[2970.24 → 2978.88] that's where the money is someone tagged me saying EEG it's not an EEG though they're not like wiring you up
[2978.88 → 2984.08] I don't I seriously doubt that a company is going to trust end users to wire themselves up with an EEG
[2984.88 → 2990.80] properly um like that's i i I've never seen this product I didn't pay enough attention when you were
[2990.80 → 2994.72] showing it on screen to look for how they did it I can pretty much guarantee you they didn't do it that
[2994.72 → 3002.72] way um so it's yeah I don't know um again if it's way better that's fantastic I'm not saying it isn't
[3002.72 → 3008.32] I'm just saying the ones that I have used were like far from ready for that type of application but
[3008.88 → 3014.72] all right they're far from ready to rely on yeah we've had a lot of people interested in the
[3014.72 → 3019.52] backpack and screwdriver so shout out to that a couple of you last questions relating uh to
[3019.52 → 3028.40] specifics do you know if the screwdriver uh will take little heads from other brands uh yes, but you'll
[3028.40 → 3034.64] need an adapter I believe the I fix it kit comes with an adapter for their small bits to uh what is it
[3034.64 → 3039.84] a quarter inch hex drive I think is the like the standard one and yes there would be there would
[3039.84 → 3046.40] be absolutely no reason for that to not for that to not work we just passed 21 000 subscribers on
[3046.40 → 3053.60] flow plane oh nice let's go we also have almost 15 000 people watching on YouTube this is the best viewed
[3053.60 → 3059.44] uh wan show in quite some time thanks guys thanks for tuning in everyone hit us another question
[3059.44 → 3064.80] relating to the backpack is there any sort of weather resistance uh it does have weather
[3064.80 → 3072.88] resistant zippers, and we have had the uh we have had the fabric tested by an independent third party
[3072.88 → 3079.28] it's not you're not going to be able to dunk it underwater like it's not designed for that but if you
[3079.28 → 3085.92] were you know if you had a 20-minute commute you know on your bike, and it's oh no it started raining
[3085.92 → 3091.52] you'll, you'll be fine so I just want to jump in really quick some people are talking about the
[3092.16 → 3100.00] uh EEG thing uh yes it is facial some people have confirmed that it is facial and i I bet you
[3100.00 → 3105.36] because it's facial there's going to be huge amounts of interference from you moving your face
[3105.36 → 3110.88] and if you ever want to be in an application where you'd have like a voice call you talking is probably
[3110.88 → 3115.84] going to introduce lots of problems now if they can prove me wrong like I said earlier that's
[3115.84 → 3120.80] awesome I don't want to be right about this it sounds like it could be really cool um i just
[3120.80 → 3128.80] have never seen one that's anywhere near ready for a to be relied on in this type of situation
[3128.80 → 3133.92] um and I doubt that it is ready but if it is, that's great i would love to be wrong that explains a
[3133.92 → 3137.20] ton I mean obviously at that price it would come with a free facial
[3137.20 → 3142.16] oh
[3142.16 → 3145.84] next no we have to let him sit in that
[3150.80 → 3158.32] nick light asks what's that nice lanyard uh beside your water bottle oh yes we finally launched the
[3158.32 → 3164.16] lanyard that I've been wearing for like the last it's upside down oh we finally launched the lanyard that
[3164.16 → 3168.16] I've been wearing for like the last six months it's the lanyard
[3172.16 → 3177.60] Anthony named it Anthony named if it's his fault it's pretty it's a pretty cute name it's our standard
[3177.60 → 3183.12] black lanyard it's a little bit longer than the old ones we actually did get some feedback that for
[3183.12 → 3190.24] people who wear them around their neck it was just a touch short uh so it's a touch longer we haven't we
[3190.24 → 3194.64] haven't you know officially you know revved it or anything like that but I think it's like
[3194.64 → 3200.48] an inch longer on each side or something like that uh so it's got orange uh orange um
[3202.24 → 3207.68] what would it be like embroidery whatever it is orange stitching for the Linus tech tips, and then it's
[3207.68 → 3213.76] it's an it's a black lanyard so yeah like I said that's the one that's the one I've been using love it
[3213.76 → 3220.40] definitely has a nice little pop to it, and then we also have a deal to announce this week we are
[3220.40 → 3230.40] going to be running the uh offer code where is it I can't find it summer sweat discount we uh I know
[3230.40 → 3235.84] it's June, but we are overstocked on sweat kits so
[3235.84 → 3246.32] because we are also a little bit overstocked on um beanies right now if you pick up a swacked
[3246.32 → 3253.28] and a beanie you will get a 20 discount code automatically applied to your order
[3255.92 → 3261.20] really great feedback on the swacked it's exactly the same garment that has four and a half stars from

[3279.68 → 3286.72] at lttstore.com all right what's our next topic you really want to talk about Tim Hortons's tracking
[3286.72 → 3290.80] people don't you not really to be honest oh I just thought it was funny what do you want to do then
[3290.80 → 3296.32] basically everyone's tracking everyone don't trust anything with your data ever and if you install
[3296.32 → 3301.12] an app if there's a very high chance that it's like doing bad things do you prefer the military
[3301.12 → 3307.52] secret sub worth under thing okay I don't know what's going on here but I read that title it's very
[3307.52 → 3314.80] funny okay apparently i I knew this happened and I'm pretty sure we talked about on wan show like
[3315.68 → 3320.32] in the old set I think that's the right time frame for it this is the dumbest ship man
[3320.32 → 3326.32] but apparently another classified document has shown up on the war thunder forums in order to
[3326.32 → 3331.84] quell an argument making this apparently the third time in a year on the exact same forums
[3331.84 → 3337.76] that this has happened a classified military document this time apparently a Chinese tank
[3337.76 → 3342.64] crew member leaked classified information about a tank shell including a part of this shell itself
[3342.64 → 3355.28] oh man um the tank shell in question is the type DTC 10 125 millimetre armour piercing fin stabilized
[3355.28 → 3362.80] discarding Saba uh Saba round used in the type 96 and type 99 series main battle tanks the document
[3362.80 → 3371.04] indicates the velocity precision penetration rate physical structure of the penetrator primer type
[3371.04 → 3377.28] the physical structure of the penetrator oh yeah nice uh primer type and handling instructions
[3380.48 → 3381.68] oh man
[3381.68 → 3395.28] I mean can you imagine can you imagine violating a government military NDA to settle an argument no bro on
[3395.28 → 3400.16] a forum this tank is way better than you think it needs a buff
[3404.16 → 3407.84] I want to drive the tank that I drive in real life digitally, and it needs to be just as good
[3407.84 → 3417.20] as good as you can see it yeah yeah yeah so epic oh man i just i I can't even and the fact that
[3417.20 → 3426.08] this is happening on a regular basis I mean like okay this is our discussion this is our
[3426.08 → 3433.12] discussion topic here um while the idea that people will leak national security information that
[3433.12 → 3439.20] could get themselves potentially killed right because if you have access to this information
[3439.20 → 3445.52] presumably it's like your gear right that could get themselves killed in order to win an argument
[3446.32 → 3452.72] while that's hilarious the end result is that these crew members if they are crew members they might not
[3452.72 → 3457.68] be crew members they might be designers we don't know are harming themselves or working like logistics
[3457.68 → 3465.84] or something weird um Anthony says as one you to ride watch who plays DCS growling sidewinder puts it
[3465.84 → 3472.64] Wikipedia data is wrong on purpose no country is going to give out the real specs for their stuff
[3472.64 → 3478.16] because then potential adversaries will know how to defend against it if a guy leaks data because they
[3478.16 → 3484.72] don't like how the game simulates their hardware guess what you then need to scrap it and start over from
[3484.72 → 3496.48] scratch like war is bad yes i am across the board against violence from one human being to another human being
[3498.00 → 3506.72] yeah okay but if a belligerent nation knows how to bypass another's defences then they could be emboldened to
[3506.72 → 3514.24] act and then everyone is going to have a bad time because war is bad there are knock-on effects
[3514.24 → 3520.40] from any conflicts that are going to no matter how far away you are going to affect you I mean
[3520.40 → 3527.44] there's all the grain that's rotting in Ukraine right now for example that's terrible people who had
[3527.44 → 3534.24] nothing to do with this conflict are going to die like a huge amount of the world's calories come from
[3534.24 → 3539.76] there will be people that starve because of this and like it's not just going to stop like if
[3539.76 → 3547.60] there's an if there's a truce signed or whatever it's its not like they have to plant and then grow
[3547.60 → 3554.08] the dumbest part of all of this is that gain war thunders' developer in the past has already
[3554.08 → 3560.72] demonstrated that they refuse to use this leaked information in the game because they don't want to
[3560.72 → 3566.56] incentivize people to leak classified military documents because that's actually a bad thing that makes sense
[3569.76 → 3575.28] oh so why don't we talk about the other two incidents in July 2021 a player was arguing about
[3575.28 → 3580.56] the British challenger 2 main battle tank to settle the disagreement they posted basically the tank's
[3580.56 → 3585.68] operating manual an action that quickly got the UK ministry of defence involved then three months
[3585.68 → 3591.84] later a French player claiming to be a crew member in a Leclerc series 2 tank in service since 1992
[3591.84 → 3597.84] again got into an argument about the capabilities of their tank my tank and again posted part of the tank's
[3597.84 → 3606.72] operation manual come on guys wow the the the round that you were talking about before is apparently
[3606.72 → 3614.80] a next-gen round this isn't even old tech yeah that's crazy all right what else we want to talk
[3614.80 → 3621.04] about today actually why don't you hit us with a couple more merch messages all right from Joshua we
[3621.04 → 3625.52] talk a lot about our favourite tech but what's one of the worst tech products you've ever bought I feel
[3625.52 → 3630.16] like we had this question like last week yeah I feel like we did I'm not really stoked on my smart
[3630.16 → 3635.28] switches right now but that that could not be entirely task's fault we'll, we'll work on that
[3635.28 → 3642.16] we're gonna work on that I feel like I've dodged a lot of bullets um yeah like uh what was that oh man
[3642.16 → 3650.08] what was that android console oh yeah yeah like there's been a lot of stuff like i I enjoy
[3650.08 → 3655.04] we've talked about this with the steam deck right sure I enjoy being really, really early
[3655.04 → 3661.68] with new stuff sure um so you'd think by doing that I would have been caught by a bunch of
[3661.68 → 3666.64] stuff that was like very below expectations, but it hasn't been that bad because I think I've seen a
[3666.64 → 3672.40] lot of them coming I've definitely bought some dumb stuff, but it would have mostly been on purpose like
[3672.40 → 3678.40] the spud the spontaneous pop-up display that little like folding projector second you should
[3678.40 → 3686.48] look it up spud monitor uh or like IBO okay I bought a IBO for 800 or whatever that was going to be no
[3686.48 → 3693.04] I thought it was going to be terrible i I literally spent money to make money I invested in a IBO
[3693.04 → 3697.28] I am the one IBO investor who made out like a bandit on IBO
[3697.28 → 3702.80] okay this is interesting yeah I would have thought this would have been bad
[3703.92 → 3708.96] here I'll get on your screen it's sold out wow well yeah it's sold out because they don't make
[3708.96 → 3713.68] any more they don't make them apparently they're coming back with a sequel or something really
[3714.24 → 3717.60] I don't know someone mentioned it to me in the writers meeting and I was kind of going
[3718.40 → 3724.08] really you guys again I guess I don't think someone asked for a hammer update I don't think you can count
[3724.08 → 3730.80] the hammer yeah because you never actually got it yeah that's fair enough all right hit me from Tommy
[3730.80 → 3736.24] what does a LTT script look like is it like a script for TV or movie you going to show one yeah sure
[3736.24 → 3743.20] I'll show one sure why not should I show one for one that hasn't come out yet no, no really no you
[3743.20 → 3750.72] don't want it to be spicy no all right upload it on flow plane as text um don't show it on wan show
[3750.72 → 3757.84] okay let me uh we got it we got a 13 million dollar building to pay for okay here's one all right so uh
[3759.76 → 3765.92] hold on let me just make sure Linus's screen is like mostly sanitized oh boy uh yeah Linus's screen
[3765.92 → 3771.20] should be pretty good now all right here we go so here's the oh crap I don't well I don't have word
[3771.20 → 3777.04] on here so I guess oh the juice machine the juice press thing yeah but I don't think yeah neither of us
[3777.04 → 3784.16] bought that because it was like obviously, obviously stupid yeah no offence if you bought one yeah okay
[3784.16 → 3789.04] this is what it looks like uh everyone please ensure that the video title is the same for
[3789.04 → 3794.64] the folder name script name Trello card and calendar entry for the editors the primer project file
[3794.64 → 3800.00] sequence exported video file etc um you're supposed to put the author but I wrote this one so I didn't
[3800.00 → 3805.84] bother because uh the rules don't apply to me apparently I'm just really I'm really sloppy about these
[3805.84 → 3809.84] because people will cover for me thank you everyone I love my team uh we have a float plane
[3809.84 → 3815.84] title which is usually pretty plain Jane because that's what flow plane likes, and then we'll, we have
[3815.84 → 3823.92] some YouTube title ideas um typically we'll have anywhere between two or three all the way up to 10
[3823.92 → 3830.80] to 15 potential title ideas uh sometimes it's a lot harder to come up with a title uh we also put a
[3830.80 → 3837.28] slogan in here still we don't always roll an intro anymore but if we do, we have it here I don't think
[3837.28 → 3844.16] we rolled an intro on this one, but that's a hilarious slogan I'm inside intel get it all right it's
[3844.16 → 3849.76] pretty good thumbnail ideas uh product links are expected to be here so that when it comes time to
[3849.76 → 3853.60] actually post the video we can have all the applicable product links uh we're supposed to write
[3853.60 → 3863.28] up a little description like Linus goes full Monty wait no that's not it uh anyway uh Linus gets uh
[3863.28 → 3867.20] behind the scenes of intel you know whatever throw some keywords in there that kind of thing people are
[3867.20 → 3871.20] roasting the formatting asking if it's normally centred I don't believe it's normally centred
[3871.20 → 3875.12] why would it be centred and I don't think you need fancy formatting for this to be honest yeah this
[3875.12 → 3879.44] is all this is all just reference material that would be duplicated on Trello anyway
[3879.44 → 3884.72] uh there's some reference stuff here just in case people you know need links to hey if you're
[3884.72 → 3888.72] screen recording make sure you check out the document for how to do that we have the video
[3888.72 → 3893.84] bible this is really important every video should have a hook that grabs people's attention you should
[3893.84 → 3899.12] address the title and thumbnail in the first 10 to 20 seconds a naturally embedded relevant merch call
[3899.12 → 3905.12] out we've definitely let the relevant part lapse a little bit maybe we could work on that a bit
[3905.12 → 3909.04] an affiliate link call out we've actually replaced this with a call-out for float plane quite
[3909.04 → 3913.04] recently so that's part of why float plane subscriber numbers are going up right now for sure yeah an
[3913.04 → 3916.96] upcoming video that should compel people to subscribe we've done away with this one because our new
[3916.96 → 3922.80] subscriber rate is atrocious anyway so why bother we'll just focus on making sure we're getting served
[3922.80 → 3927.68] in uh suggested videos because that's where most of our viewership comes from anyway a throw to a
[3927.68 → 3931.68] compelling related video the viewer might want to watch we do that at the end just to try and
[3931.68 → 3937.20] try and retain people like say hey if you enjoyed this maybe you'll also enjoy that a primo giftable moment
[3937.20 → 3943.52] we see GIFs of you know me and uh the rest of the team here as a really great uh as a really great
[3943.52 → 3950.32] marketing exercise you know just more exposure uh for us so we know we always try and we always
[3950.32 → 3956.32] try and put fun little giftable moments into the videos giftable deal with it
[3958.64 → 3965.52] um this is a shot that I forgot to get where is it yeah its of someone blocking lines partially and
[3965.52 → 3969.92] Linus eyes closed waving hand away like no, no no indicating refusing a check we forgot to get this
[3970.40 → 3974.80] we did get this one this was just like me making little notes this isn't normally in the template
[3974.80 → 3980.08] any props we need it's nice to get that I had the intro that was shot the previous day when I thought
[3980.08 → 3985.84] it was going to be sponsored um so I have hey make sure you use that, and it's supposed to say until
[3985.84 → 3991.28] sponsored this video cut it off hard here um because that was supposed to have the sponsorship
[3991.28 → 3995.52] disclosure in it but if we didn't end up having it be sponsored because I wanted to make sure that i
[3995.52 → 4002.32] could just say whatever I needed to say without them being able to push back on it uh intel tends
[4002.32 → 4007.92] to be very sensitive about things like their internal processes and engineering facilities so
[4008.88 → 4013.36] I feel like if it had been sponsored the way it was supposed to like a fully sponsored video they
[4013.36 → 4017.68] would have expected to dictate a lot more of the content and i just I saw that place and I was like
[4017.68 → 4025.12] nah dog we may never look at this again it needs to be everything um all right, so then this is what
[4025.12 → 4029.44] the script looks like since I'll sponsor this vid cut it off hard here at least they tried I've never
[4029.44 → 4032.72] done this before but shortly after I arrived at intel's Israel design centre I ripped up the
[4032.72 → 4040.80] previously agreed upon sponsorship check so here you're basically seeing what is in the video um
[4040.80 → 4046.64] these marks here tend to be for if I'm moving locations, so two four is going to be in the
[4046.64 → 4053.68] validation lab you can see three one, so this is like a completely different segment um three two
[4053.68 → 4059.68] is where we kind of move to a different part of that room at the end you'll see you know any sponsor
[4059.68 → 4063.60] spots or anything like that we've actually recently started shooting those separately and then just
[4063.60 → 4069.20] chopping them into the video again so you won't see those anymore the thing you're missing and this
[4069.20 → 4075.60] could be partly because it's a script by me and I tend not to write guidance sometimes because I'm busy
[4075.60 → 4081.68] um it could also be because I opened it in WordPad rather than in word, but we often have annotations
[4081.68 → 4087.44] in the right margin that will highlight so they're comments right so you highlight the text that you
[4087.44 → 4092.72] want covered, and then you'll annotate a graph that's supposed to have coverage there or a b-roll shot or
[4093.36 → 4099.68] um like text that you want to appear on-screen or if you want a simple animation done then that'll be on the side
[4099.68 → 4105.52] and that's uh that's what they look like I'm not sure I'm not sure how that compares to
[4106.48 → 4110.96] whatever your expectations were but for better or for worse that's it
[4115.04 → 4121.52] very nice uh from Edward what's been the most surprising part of the growth of leg over the last
[4121.52 → 4131.36] couple years how much it costs I don't know speed uh probably create a warehouse fast I mean I was I
[4131.36 → 4137.12] was I was pretty bearish on the whole physical goods business and there still are
[4137.12 → 4142.00] challenges like it's not nearly as profitable as it kind of seems to be you know you look at the gross
[4142.00 → 4149.04] margin on a product, and it might be like oh yeah you know you're making uh of that ten dollars five
[4149.04 → 4156.96] dollars is profit but actually by the time you account for handling fees and packing materials
[4157.60 → 4166.08] and uh transaction uh overhead, and you account for the actual rates big the uh people who had to work
[4166.08 → 4173.20] on that product and all of that stuff, so okay yeah prices could be a little higher that sort of thing
[4173.20 → 4180.96] from dean I have a question for Luke you said a week or two ago that you may not get the steam deck
[4180.96 → 4185.52] when your email comes yeah is there a different handheld you would consider or using steam OS instead
[4185.52 → 4192.24] of windows not really to be completely honest um the steam OS versus windows thing doesn't really matter to
[4192.24 → 4198.48] me um I don't mind uh like from doing the Linux challenge I don't think I mind Linux in that
[4198.48 → 4208.64] situation uh no problem with it there yeah um and steam OS is its Linux, but it's like smoother it's
[4208.64 → 4212.88] yeah I've heard good things about it so that's that that part doesn't really matter to me much
[4212.88 → 4219.84] um and I was mostly interested because i I mostly wanted one because I really respected their approach
[4219.84 → 4223.92] to right to repair what they're planning on doing with I fix it which has started coming to fruition which
[4223.92 → 4230.08] is really cool yeah um and I wanted to see kind of how this thing grew um but now by the time I get
[4230.08 → 4236.96] if it's going to be like old so i yeah I'm still not necessarily I don't know I haven't fully decided
[4236.96 → 4243.28] but I probably won't end up actually buying it I'll take yours yeah I'm sure you'll be able to find a
[4243.28 → 4251.12] taker for it yeah yeah exactly yeah I'll probably just offload it oh man well this is annoying
[4251.12 → 4256.08] google is apparently killing location-based reminders in the assistant
[4258.08 → 4267.04] man i I have had I have had a very frustrating week with Google Assistant can I show you something
[4267.04 → 4276.08] really stupid can I show you something stupid right now yeah okay this is my Google News feed oh
[4276.08 → 4282.08] no, no sorry hold on a second so i set reminders to set alarms because I don't trust
[4282.08 → 4286.64] the reminders to actually get my attention oh yeah no reminders are horrible yeah yeah they're they're
[4286.64 → 4292.00] they're useless i I always remind myself with alarms, but that's completely that's completely separate okay
[4292.00 → 4299.36] so this is my Google News feed how would you categorize uh these topics as we go through tech
[4299.36 → 4314.80] uh movie film whatever tech uh business tech uh business government something like that tech
[4315.84 → 4325.36] it's mostly tech okay yeah all right because I own Linus media group I have gotten in the habit of using
[4325.36 → 4332.80] using my Linus media group email account as my primary google account this is a paid account it's
[4332.80 → 4337.52] called a g suite account used to be called google apps now it's called g suite that's not the point the
[4337.52 → 4344.40] point is that I am a paying ass customer for my Gmail so you should get less features than free customers
[4345.04 → 4353.28] hold on for my Gmail my Google Drive basically any other service that I use one nice feature is what did you
[4353.28 → 4363.52] not see in here uh i I starts with a and ends with this advertisements no ads right which is okay that's
[4363.52 → 4370.08] fairly nice also I would expect it given that I pay actually a significant amount of money to google
[4370.08 → 4378.64] now that we are up to like whatever we have to 70 people plus flow plane like okay so the problem the
[4378.64 → 4382.96] full plane bill is cheaper because we don't have as much drive space as you guys my drive is 98 full
[4382.96 → 4393.44] on my flow plane email the problem is that google has time and time again treated g suite users as
[4393.44 → 4398.88] second-class citizens' oh yeah absolutely there was a period of over a year when reminders aside from
[4398.88 → 4405.20] being garbage, and they're not being an easy way to set a decently long ringtone for them um there was
[4405.20 → 4409.20] a period of over a year when reminders didn't work you literally got an error that was like yeah
[4409.20 → 4419.68] reminders are not available for g suite users why take that code and put it there well no but
[4419.68 → 4429.28] do it yeah no but yes okay, okay now let me show you something
[4431.84 → 4434.88] open the front right garage door oh I saw this
[4438.24 → 4444.40] okay so no this is not no, no no, no no no tweet last night about open the right front garage door and
[4444.40 → 4449.12] it opening like the back garage door no, no that's separate from this that's just oh that's just natural
[4449.12 → 4455.76] language processing being still amazingly crappy no, no this is separate okay so here hold on
[4456.80 → 4458.24] open the front right garage door
[4460.72 → 4464.80] sorry I don't understand okay because
[4466.56 → 4469.44] yeah why like that seems like that should be something that it should get I don't I don't
[4469.44 → 4476.00] know yeah for Google for home which is a separate app okay so I got my home app right
[4477.12 → 4484.00] this is where you add your devices and stuff right okay so you can add your thermostats and your
[4484.00 → 4492.72] speakers and your garage doors all your smart home crap okay if I try to invite a home member
[4492.72 → 4501.44] let's say for example that I was to try to invite uh Luke okay, okay so I'm gonna no, no you're not gonna
[4501.44 → 4507.36] need that okay because I'm going to go through I'm going to invite you can't send the invitation at the
[4507.36 → 4513.28] moment try again try again try again why because you're a g suite user oh no way
[4513.28 → 4523.44] you may not oh oh oh the best part was that i was as a g suite user I was the owner of the home
[4524.08 → 4531.12] but I couldn't invite g suite users or non-g suite users because I was a g suite user I had to change
[4531.12 → 4537.76] so that a non-g suite user owned it and then I couldn't invite g suite users at all so I'm allowed to
[4537.76 → 4542.96] own it as a g suite user but I am not allowed to invite g suite users and then if I am a regular
[4542.96 → 4549.92] at gmail.com user I still cannot invite g suite users to this home that's so but the error message
[4549.92 → 4557.60] is not meaningful it just says sorry you couldn't do it try again okay now this gets really frustrating
[4557.60 → 4565.44] now that I go into the home app and I sign in to I will admit i I hate uh useless error messages I will
[4565.44 → 4570.72] admit float plane has a few um I would also argue that our team size is a little bit smaller than
[4570.72 → 4579.92] google okay so I've switched over to my proper home one oh are you kidding me okay there we go
[4579.92 → 4586.24] I've switched over because when it comes to different google uh apps on your phone right so
[4586.24 → 4590.08] there's like your news feed and there's then there's home and then there's the assistant or whatever
[4590.08 → 4597.04] they all sync there's like your like primary google account right so watch this open the front
[4597.04 → 4604.88] right garage door sure opening the front right garage door okay because now I'm logged into my
[4604.88 → 4611.76] like proper home one yeah okay but now I go to my news feed okay I'd like you to categorize these things
[4611.76 → 4622.32] for me uh business stuff government stuff whatever uh medical stuff uh business stuff
[4623.44 → 4631.36] ad let's do you see any tech in here very little okay and here's where it gets even worse bell do you
[4631.36 → 4636.72] know how to adjust the focus on that okay this is some next level dumb crap
[4636.72 → 4646.16] this is googled being bad at their one job okay I'd like to fix this obviously the best way would
[4646.16 → 4649.76] be if I could just import my work profile because now I'm stuck with this one if I want any of my
[4649.76 → 4654.64] smart home stuff to work right I'm because I'm not gonna I'm not going to have to go up and you
[4654.64 → 4659.76] switch which account uses which thing no, no no once you change it for one it changes it for all of
[4659.76 → 4670.40] them thank you very much google all right here's where it gets way dumber okay here we go ready okay
[4670.40 → 4676.88] can you guys hear me I have no idea so I go into my channels and interests okay so I'm going to be like hey
[4676.88 → 4691.28] I like tech okay following this is all literally just random songs and artists from my YouTube music
[4692.16 → 4699.44] if I block them I have gone through and painstakingly blocked them all before okay let's go back
[4699.44 → 4709.52] they just come back okay it's just full of random music again they are not in not interested okay i
[4709.52 → 4715.68] haven't hidden anything apparently and there is no button anywhere to add interests
[4720.08 → 4726.80] I thought your whole thing I thought your whole thing is that you're supposed to want to know everything
[4726.80 → 4732.96] I'm wilfully I'm willingly telling you I would like to give you my personal information so that
[4732.96 → 4742.64] you may better tailor content to me, and you will not do it so I can't pay my way out of this problem
[4742.64 → 4749.44] I can't manually input data my way out of this problem, and it's not like this is obviously this is
[4749.44 → 4757.84] obviously not a life or death problem it's just stupid yeah i this is a very minor problem compared
[4757.84 → 4762.48] to that but i I have YouTube premium close the front right garage door sorry yeah that's a good idea
[4764.56 → 4771.92] thanks google i uh so I have YouTube premium on my like personal account but i I tried to do the whole
[4771.92 → 4776.80] and i I like it this way much more I'm thinking of migrating to Firefox again trying that out but
[4776.80 → 4781.84] I like it this way much more where I have profiles so I have different browser windows yeah depending
[4781.84 → 4786.56] on what the thing is sure um, and it's great so I have my flow plane one it's all coloured blue so i
[4786.56 → 4792.48] know when I'm in my correct work browser and all that kind of stuff um but I don't have YouTube premium
[4792.48 → 4798.56] on every google account that I use because that would be insane I have it on my work one yeah and now
[4798.56 → 4804.56] what I'm going to buy it again like no that's crazy so and like usually if I'm in my work when I'm probably
[4804.56 → 4808.88] on float plane right so it doesn't matter there are no ads but i if I do have to open a YouTube link
[4808.88 → 4814.80] for some reason, and it opens up on my work one then there are ads everywhere and I'm like oh okay I have
[4814.80 → 4819.84] to copy this out open close on this one open on this other one watch it there gets rid of that browser
[4819.84 → 4823.76] when I'm done because now none of my work stuff is here jump back over to this one it's just if I have
[4823.76 → 4830.96] one account logged in on my phone that has YouTube premium it should count it yeah like I'm not
[4830.96 → 4836.40] going to buy separate YouTube premium I have like 12 google accounts logged in on my phone yeah because
[4836.40 → 4843.36] of all the YouTube channels and all that stuff right like it come on stop treating g suite users
[4843.36 → 4850.00] like second class citizens, so now my feed is full of ads full of not tech and if I want any of my home
[4850.00 → 4856.00] stuff to work then and if I want my YouTube premium to work I just have to be constantly switching what
[4856.00 → 4865.20] profile I'm on it's just really annoying it's just stupid oh escapement dog says also g suite stopped
[4865.20 → 4870.32] supporting google where too yeah it doesn't surprise me it was just one thing after another
[4870.32 → 4874.72] like all these years I forget all the times that I've been really annoyed trying to use a g suite
[4874.72 → 4878.96] account as my daily driver account I had a problem for a super long time when I couldn't change my
[4878.96 → 4885.92] profile picture and I was like, and it would just say like there was an error with this photo or
[4885.92 → 4890.32] whatever but I would try like a billion different photos, and it never works and I was just like well
[4891.12 → 4896.00] I guess my account's just like broken because the error was like super weird it had nothing to do with
[4896.00 → 4901.20] like permissions or account levels or whatever it was just there was a problem with this image so I was
[4901.20 → 4905.84] like oh okay whatever and then eventually I figured out that someone else on the team couldn't change
[4905.84 → 4911.28] their profile picture either and I was like what that's got to be a setting so I dove way through
[4911.28 → 4920.56] the settings and by default it has it off like why would this be off at any time so I just turn
[4920.56 → 4924.24] it on, and then it worked fine but like it doesn't tell you were talking about the error being weird it
[4924.24 → 4929.84] didn't tell me yeah no why don't you just say that yeah then yeah maybe because when they say that
[4929.84 → 4934.96] it generates a bunch of complaints that the feature doesn't work because it should be on by default
[4934.96 → 4943.60] oh so frustrating stupid uh anyway we have tons of topics this week yeah uh well Jake's got to
[4943.60 → 4950.88] hit us with a couple more merch messages first all right from Matthew in your opinion with
[4950.88 → 4956.32] oh we're getting a ton of merch messages here just a second back to being Matthew in your opinion with
[4956.32 → 4961.20] performance per generation leapfrogging and larger power draws coming are we looking at performance plateaus with
[4961.20 → 4967.68] an increased focus on efficiency and usability or ever-increasing performance peaks I think it's
[4967.68 → 4973.52] cyclical at this point I mean we've seen this in the past when architecturally they can't find a way to
[4973.52 → 4981.76] get a leg up on the competition they'll push the power envelope, and obviously it's better for the silicon to run
[4981.76 → 4989.20] cooler fewer warranty issues uh whenever they can, they'll try to run it as efficiently as possible so I think we're just
[4989.20 → 4995.28] seeing whatever we're seeing an ebb or a flow whatever whichever one is which right now yeah can you
[4995.28 → 5003.12] share the hilarious moment I would love to um uh cal and ann is uh is helping us out with some sanding
[5003.12 → 5007.84] for like a paint project that we're working on says thanks for closing the door on me
[5007.84 → 5014.32] wait so it was already open I'm assuming
[5014.32 → 5024.80] oh man oh Anthony is complaining about g suite also doesn't let you import data you can
[5024.80 → 5028.64] export everything from a Google account but good luck doing literally anything with it
[5028.64 → 5039.68] that's funny that's pretty good I didn't know that come on and like I could spend the next six months
[5039.68 → 5044.32] using my Google News feed again because when I first started using it, it was crap it was full of like
[5044.88 → 5051.20] Kim Kardashian and the royals and just like all that absolute garbage that I couldn't possibly care less
[5051.20 → 5057.76] about uh he says no it's not a problem just weirded me out okay good um mine gets randomly obsessed with
[5057.76 → 5062.56] things I was like I am going to invest in this I'm going to give this a chance because other people tell
[5062.56 → 5068.08] me it's perfect so i I did I stuck it out and took months, and it's like perfect now like it's
[5068.08 → 5072.56] like you, you saw it's just full of tech yeah basically mine's pretty good but every once in a
[5072.56 → 5077.44] while it'll latch onto something really weird and even if I never click on it, it'll just keep coming
[5077.44 → 5082.64] up keep coming up keeping, and then it'll randomly disappear I googled what the hell BTS was once and
[5082.64 → 5090.80] oh no oh man it was just like whatever Jilin was wearing yesterday for a while yeah yeah yeah
[5092.64 → 5096.64] like mine I don't I don't like you know honestly it seems like they do a lot of great stuff
[5097.52 → 5102.80] but I don't care what Jilin's wearing no yeah yeah i I don't watch very many TV shows I don't watch very
[5102.80 → 5109.92] many movies yeah and I am not interested in actors or actresses pretty much at all and randomly
[5111.28 → 5116.16] I'll get like this person that I've very likely never heard of and like every three articles will
[5116.16 → 5121.44] be about like some shirt they were wearing or something yeah and I'm like holy crap I have never
[5121.44 → 5125.28] clicked on one of these and I don't care and then like it'll keep happening for like three or
[5125.28 → 5129.28] four days, and then it'll disappear and never come back again yeah like why did it think that was a
[5129.28 → 5135.68] thing one of the really frustrating ones for me is one of your only interactions is not interested
[5135.68 → 5142.88] yeah right you can't say I want more of this, but the problem is that if you have literally already read
[5142.88 → 5150.24] it, and it shows up you can't say like I've had ones that show up over and over and over again you can't
[5150.24 → 5155.92] say it's less lately, but you can't say the thing that is the problem with this is that I already read it
[5155.92 → 5161.68] because that would be a really great signal oh like I read this and enjoyed it or something like
[5161.68 → 5168.00] that yes, yes I did engage with this I actually do like this but I do not wish to click on it right now
[5168.00 → 5172.48] yeah i really I think they didn't they used to have like a thumbs up like more of this thought so
[5172.48 → 5177.60] yeah I thought because I remember tuning mine back in the day with like I like this I don't like that
[5177.60 → 5183.44] it's frustrating when economics take a front seat compared to the user experience I've talked about
[5183.44 → 5188.96] this on when show before but one of my favourite features on Amazon back in the day was customers
[5188.96 → 5196.40] who viewed this ended up buying yeah these things and clearly that was interfering with their ability
[5196.40 → 5203.52] to put sponsored product showcases under them, and it went away and I was so angry because it saved me
[5204.08 → 5210.96] so much time I could just find approximately the thing that I was kind of looking for and someone else
[5210.96 → 5216.40] would have already done the work of digging through the trash heap that is Amazon's interface
[5216.96 → 5221.76] and finding the like handful of good ones so that I could pick the one that best suits my needs
[5222.64 → 5228.96] it's so infuriating yeah I do like by the way on Google News that you can block entire domains
[5229.68 → 5235.44] oh I did not know that that's actually sweet I'll go to a site and just get like destroyed by ads and
[5235.44 → 5239.92] I'll just back out and be like never again oh I should start doing that with like the paywall ones yes
[5239.92 → 5243.68] it's at the point now where a quarter of the articles in mine are paywalls I don't get any
[5243.68 → 5247.52] paywall stuff because I've blocked them all got it that makes sense that's sweet
[5249.20 → 5254.64] from john would you ever consider producing written content or written versions of our videos
[5254.64 → 5258.88] I often find myself looking for more articles on a product or topic rather than a video
[5258.88 → 5265.60] someone linked me an old wan show where you um and me I guess technically, but we were we
[5265.60 → 5269.52] were figuring out what we wanted to do with the forum yeah, and you were talking about how we were
[5269.52 → 5274.08] going to use bulletin and one of the main reasons why you wanted bulletin was because it had this like
[5274.08 → 5281.60] powerful cms behind it, and you could put written companions up with videos so yeah it's been considered
[5281.60 → 5283.60] weird
[5284.80 → 5293.12] what's this is it this is the time ed redesign oh the home page of the Linus tech tips' forum
[5294.24 → 5304.40] to um hold on where's the oh here we go okay, so this is the mock-up of what Linus tech tips dot com
[5304.40 → 5311.12] would have looked like before dark mode was the default for the universe yeah uh so Linus tech tips
[5311.12 → 5318.08] forums members gallery this is just a lot of placeholders um we'd have you know headlines
[5318.08 → 5325.12] news items sorry I think we still use that banner uh yes I think we do uh there's you know your link
[5325.12 → 5334.24] to wan show gotta love that ancient wan show logo heck yeah I have no idea this is obviously just
[5334.24 → 5339.60] crap that ed put in here uh let's have a look at some more things if you guys are interested in
[5339.60 → 5346.56] this here's what an article preview would look like I think article twitter preview it says I don't know
[5346.56 → 5353.20] what that means uh we had this cool idea where we would have community submissions for news articles kind
[5353.20 → 5358.16] of like just the news section on the forum and there'd be a tip jar for the author I thought that was
[5358.16 → 5365.36] kind of a cool idea um just to encourage people to to to like post more and summarize add their own
[5365.36 → 5371.20] thoughts people who were really prolific and perfect at it could potentially like actually do pretty
[5371.20 → 5380.56] decent uh this was I think this might have been an earlier or later version of the home page look at
[5380.56 → 5389.60] that old YouTube logo love it look at this date oh man this might be an earlier one this might be an
[5389.60 → 5397.68] earlier one what am I looking at here oh spicy top build logs remember when we used to feature build
[5397.68 → 5403.04] logs from the build log section of the forum i yeah that was awesome I should kind of miss that here's
[5403.04 → 5409.28] the compact no this one's this one's nothing Linus's mock-up oh okay apparently I did this
[5410.48 → 5414.96] the headlines chosen by the community for the community I don't think I've ever shown this before
[5415.76 → 5421.04] never saw the light of day buy from our affiliates I saw these tips in the jar no, no yeah to you yeah but
[5421.68 → 5427.12] features plot for these fast as possible uh top build logs decaying mechanism and based on likes oh
[5427.12 → 5435.60] yeah interesting kind of cool idea kind of cool idea uh yeah neat huh
[5438.88 → 5444.08] well now you saw a little piece of a little piece of LTT history hope you enjoyed it
[5446.64 → 5453.92] from grant will Linus be on they're just movies again also what made you start the series um i I don't
[5453.92 → 5460.24] know if they invite me and I have time I'd be happy to do it as for what made me start it uh jams
[5460.24 → 5465.52] Reilly and David would always spend their work time talking about movies, and they had the idea of
[5465.52 → 5471.12] starting a podcast and I was like well I guess it was on it was during their carpool they would spend a
[5471.12 → 5474.32] lot of time talking about them, and then it would bleed over into work time and I'd hear them talking
[5474.32 → 5478.72] about it, and they were like hey we want to do like a movie podcast and I was like oh cool lets uh try
[5478.72 → 5484.16] and support that, and so we did and so now we have the're just movies podcast because they thought
[5484.16 → 5490.96] carpool critics was not as good of a name yeah no comment they definitely did I have no comment on
[5490.96 → 5499.60] the I have no comment on the quality of they're just movies instead of carpool critics movie
[5499.60 → 5508.00] podcast uh we have an um oh boy where'd it go I think I lost the comment uh, but it was a question
[5508.00 → 5512.72] about the newsletter if we're going to do another newsletter again another newsletter what kind of
[5512.72 → 5519.44] newsletter I'm assuming they're talking about the LDT store because I wasn't sure either oh yes they're
[5519.44 → 5524.88] supposed to do them like every week or every other week so they've just been they've just been swamped
[5524.88 → 5530.72] right like they just moved they've got a lot of projects to ship you know backpacks screwdrivers
[5530.72 → 5536.80] lots of other things that we've got going on behind the scenes just yeah it just takes time so I am also
[5536.80 → 5544.64] not commenting but float plane chat is I think unanimously saying that carpool critics is better
[5545.36 → 5551.12] all right i I have no comment on float plane chats comment yeah no interesting me neither nope moving on
[5551.12 → 5556.80] if you like carpool critics better go like their latest video so we know that you like the
[5556.80 → 5562.72] old name that's some big brain stuff oh man this is this question from anonymous what do you think
[5562.72 → 5569.44] about the upcoming Google Pixel watch that's coming out frankly I have spent exactly zero of my precious
[5569.44 → 5575.76] brain cycles on the Google Pixel watch because I have no hope for it whatsoever and that might be me
[5575.76 → 5581.76] just being closed-minded, but this is not the first time google has said no for real it's different this
[5581.76 → 5589.36] time I will believe it when I see it when it is on my wrist, and it's amazing I will be amazed otherwise
[5589.36 → 5595.20] i just i I'm just I'm not I'm not going to become emotionally invested in this thing I'm sorry I just can't
[5595.20 → 5604.40] do it what's this uh this is a withing sum ah crap what's it called again smart something can't
[5604.40 → 5609.68] remember it's a tithings watch full disclosure uh the reason I have it is that they did a sponsorship
[5609.68 → 5615.76] but uh turning off my sponsored hat because they sure as heck didn't sponsor this I'm enjoying it so
[5615.76 → 5622.88] far it's got kind of everything you need it looks um very traditional yeah nothing you don't oh so
[5622.88 → 5630.24] it's just a little screen there yeah spo2 and ECG monitoring um it does log workouts and steps and
[5630.24 → 5636.08] stuff like that but I was at the point where I just was finding my smartwatch so useless that i
[5636.08 → 5642.32] basically just used it to tell the time anyway and this does that great, and it lasts for almost a
[5642.32 → 5648.32] month on battery and that part I'm assuming will last even longer than that the time no because it
[5648.32 → 5653.92] appears to be very digitally controlled gotcha if the electronics die inside I'm pretty sure the arms
[5653.92 → 5661.92] stop arming okay yeah because you can set the time in the app, and it'll be like oh, oh wow yeah okay got
[5661.92 → 5667.92] it that's it for merch messages, but you do have a couple little unboxing I don't know if you want to
[5667.92 → 5675.68] go through oh no let's talk about some more topics I wanted to talk about um New York state actually passed a
[5675.68 → 5684.72] couple of fascinating bills uh first up is the fair repair act where which stipulates that all
[5684.72 → 5691.60] manufacturers who sell digital electronic products within state borders must make tools parts and
[5691.60 → 5699.28] instructions for repair available to both consumers and independent shops heck yeah exceptions are made for
[5699.28 → 5708.88] home appliances why medical devices okay and this last one and agriculture equipment don't like that
[5708.88 → 5714.32] don't like that at all that's got to be some john deer lobbying right there yes that's exactly it the
[5714.32 → 5721.68] the medical devices one I don't know oh that one I don't know enough things that would fall in that
[5721.68 → 5728.80] category and there's a lot of liability there yeah there's I mean honestly though you talk to people
[5728.80 → 5736.16] in the medical field they're extremely frustrated that medicine costs so much because of things like
[5736.16 → 5742.24] really restrictive contracts for the repair and upkeep of these devices, but there's also a lot of
[5742.24 → 5747.76] liability depends what it is and like if you take the liability away from the company if you do self
[5747.76 → 5752.56] repair I think that's a thing that you should be able to uh decide on your own right but like home
[5752.56 → 5759.44] appliances like come on dude yeah Geez I'm happy we're making progress right that's always a good
[5759.44 → 5767.44] thing but like these exceptions are dumb agreed uh what else we got here, so the past legislature is
[5767.44 → 5771.92] awaiting signature from the governor they are expected to sign and this comes after Biden issued
[5771.92 → 5777.84] an executive order calling on the FTC to enforce freaking repair rights all right so that's something good
[5777.84 → 5784.56] uh fixity said it expects this to take effect by 2023 freaking awesome in other news New York passes
[5784.56 → 5791.20] a bill to limit bitcoin mining it targets a specific form of crypto mining that uses the high energy
[5791.20 → 5796.64] intensive proof of work authentication method this includes several popular digital currencies including
[5796.64 → 5801.68] bitcoin if signed into law this legislation will place a two-year ban on new permits being issued
[5801.68 → 5807.44] or existing permits being renewed to conduct proof of work authenticated cryptocurrency mining that relies on
[5807.44 → 5812.64] electricity generated from carbon based fuels, so this is part of New York's climate goals that
[5812.64 → 5817.60] require the state's greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 85 percent by 2050 under the climate
[5817.60 → 5825.44] leadership and community protection act so if you found a way um to work outside carbon-based
[5825.44 → 5835.76] fuels you could still do it yeah cool in other news Elon Musk wants to cut 10 of tesla jobs but apparently
[5835.76 → 5841.12] the hourly headcount will increase and this is mostly focused on salary employees so that's another
[5841.12 → 5846.72] way of saying that you feel like you're a little top-heavy in terms or middle heavy in terms of
[5846.72 → 5853.44] management tesla shares fell nine percent after the report but honestly man I wouldn't read too much into
[5853.44 → 5861.28] that for I'm out of my in I'm out of my investments i have no current investments but I do just like
[5861.28 → 5868.08] maintain I do I just like look at particular like tech I've got intel AMD NVIDIA in here, and it goes
[5868.08 → 5874.24] from huge green to big red day to day to day to day to day right now nine percents a lot
[5875.52 → 5882.00] nine percents a lot, but it has been it has been an uh Coinbase is down nine percent today too
[5882.56 → 5888.08] and yesterday yeah but I mean they were up bitcoin has been getting or not bitcoin coins in general have
[5888.08 → 5891.60] been getting kind of slaughtered over the last little bit I mean here are five days so they'll go
[5891.60 → 5894.80] day when they're up ten percent they'll go day when they're down they'll go day when they're up you
[5894.80 → 5899.36] got a couple of people calling you out for framework that's not a publicly traded company yeah sorry
[5899.36 → 5904.88] sorry, sorry I meant stocks yes I still do I still do hold my investment in framework
[5905.52 → 5911.44] okay AMC is a meme stock so let's not use that one i think AMD you still have stock in
[5911.44 → 5916.00] framework right yes you're talking tradable stocks yes yes or what I don't know I don't know
[5916.00 → 5925.36] what they're called yes I still that technically they are stocks yes i I have the 280 230 i I don't
[5925.36 → 5931.04] remember I don't remember how much because honestly guys wasn't the point i wrote the check
[5933.84 → 5935.28] and I hope that they succeed
[5938.08 → 5940.80] that's it that's all I can really do I mean I'd like to think that
[5940.80 → 5946.80] that um you guys have not noticed a difference in my treatment of framework or other laptop
[5946.80 → 5951.84] manufacturers ever since the investment I have actually had very little to do with our laptop
[5951.84 → 5956.08] content but when I have had anything to do with it, I would hope you guys have seen no difference if
[5956.08 → 5962.88] anything my goal is to treat them like the coach's son uh be harder on them as opposed to being any easier
[5962.88 → 5968.48] on them had that experience I actually enjoyed that but being the coach's son yeah my dad was a coach
[5968.48 → 5975.12] on like basically every sports team I was on that's pretty cool um, and he was actually awesome and no
[5975.12 → 5980.72] one ever no one on the team ever like maybe the first day they'd be like oh coach's son whatever
[5980.72 → 5984.56] and then after it was like a couple of weeks in they'd be like oh man I'm sorry bro
[5986.48 → 5990.08] which I preferred instead of everyone thinking I was getting special treatment
[5990.08 → 5996.80] um yeah it was great I really enjoyed my dad coaching Samsung's apparently getting out of the
[5996.80 → 6004.40] LCD market isn't that crazy that is wacky CDs are just no forget it we don't need CDs anymore
[6004.40 → 6010.00] as early as June Samsung display will stop producing LCD panels they used to be the world's
[6010.00 → 6015.28] leading LCD panel manufacturer, but their market share has dropped to just two percent due to Chinese and
[6015.28 → 6020.88] Taiwanese competition the display supply chain consultants or DCC say the average price index
[6020.88 → 6031.44] of LCD panels will drop to 36.6 out of 100 down from 41.5 in April so expect CDs to get cheaper
[6031.44 → 6036.56] and to be clear this isn't they're not leaving the like display market no they're just kind of moving
[6036.56 → 6042.48] on more than anything they will now focus heavily on OLED and quantum dot with most of their employees
[6042.48 → 6047.92] moving over to quantum dot there's no official statement from Samsung yet our discussion question
[6047.92 → 6054.64] is at what point do CDs go the way of CRT never oh I mean they will eventually I think there's better
[6054.64 → 6060.40] techs out there now I think it'll be different because CRTs have this like cult following in
[6060.40 → 6064.88] existence bulky well they're super bulky, but they have this cult following in existence because they
[6064.88 → 6070.80] have certain things that they're particularly perfect at um and I think that the technologies that
[6070.80 → 6076.96] are replacing LCD are going to replace them in a way that you there 's's no real draw to go back
[6076.96 → 6084.56] to LCD where there is a draw to go back to CRT um so I think LCD's death will be a little bit more
[6084.56 → 6094.48] permanent oh I think that's fair what would it what would it take for you to use windows on arm
[6094.48 → 6102.00] Microsoft just unveiled their mini an arm desktop called project Torterra um it was at this year's
[6102.00 → 6106.48] build 2022 conference this was actually from last week, but we didn't get to it and I wanted to talk
[6106.48 → 6113.52] about it is looks kind of like a headless surface studio here let's pull up my screen here blah blah
[6113.52 → 6119.36] blah blah blah blah let's find the point in the video where they show it um it was developed in partnership
[6119.36 → 6125.04] with Qualcomm so it's going to be using snapdragon silicon which up until now has proven to be
[6126.24 → 6133.84] basically a big part of the reason that windows on arm is not very successful uh where the bloody
[6133.84 → 6138.72] I just wouldn't dude i at this point I'm honestly like kind of barely holding on to using windows at all
[6140.48 → 6148.40] like the Linux challenge like really revealed to me that like it's not there, but it's not that far
[6149.36 → 6155.76] you know and like taking a worse version of windows is not really an option right now um
[6156.72 → 6161.12] yeah it's everything you hate about windows with everything that you hate about windows
[6161.12 → 6164.72] yeah got it yep yeah I'm not even remotely interested
[6167.44 → 6172.40] that's pretty much it yeah all right that's fair enough and I think that's pretty much it for the show
[6173.20 → 6178.88] thank you guys so much for tuning in if you made it this far hey don't forget we just
