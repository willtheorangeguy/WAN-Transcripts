[2022-06-26T22:22:28Z] Video: Intel Messed Up - WAN Show June 24, 2022 
Just finished watching 5 months worth of WAN Shows while playing video games, and I finally reached one that doesn't have chapters (I know timestamps are in the comments but I can't go back to that). I stopped watching when I got addicted to a certain streamer's Twitch VODs, but they took a break because they were moving so I had to find something else to watch in the background.
