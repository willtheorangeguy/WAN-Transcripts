[2022-12-12T19:24:28Z] Video: I Want To Smuggle CPUs - WAN Show December 9, 2022 
Hey so I’m commenting at 2:20 EST on Monday. I know about people putting timestamps in the comments section, but I was wondering when you guys try to make them into actual chapters on the video? Usually I’m doing something Friday night and can’t watch it live and I know that there are two days off for the weekend right after the show airs. But it would be really cool if someone from the team could just go in and take the time stamps from the best comment with them and verify them for a few minutes so chapters could be available by the end of Saturday? It shouldn’t take more than an hour to get it all done right? Anyways thanks for listening!
