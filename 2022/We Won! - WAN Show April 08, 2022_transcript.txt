[0.00 --> 6.24]  okay
[8.72 --> 13.20]  and you don't look at the chat loop oh sorry stop looking at the chat sorry don't look at the chat
[13.20 --> 18.32]  i didn't ruin everything yet i think i should just close it i'm just going to close it
[19.52 --> 26.48]  i can open it mid-show boom gone i forgot to ask you if the selected is unchecked
[27.12 --> 35.12]  and we're live welcome to the wan show ladies and take show we are live so i guess uh real later
[35.12 --> 42.40]  because we accidentally went live on all platforms by accident topic today we weren't quite ready to
[42.40 --> 49.20]  start goob latest to join the i fix it party providing parts and tools for self-repair
[49.84 --> 56.08]  pretty freaking big deal in other news amd accidentally gave you more gigahertz for free
[56.08 --> 62.64]  it or not my uh my doc just got signed out but i believe i remember some ubiquity sues kreb
[62.64 --> 69.76]  from krebs on security that's um uh another topic oh so thank you luke
[71.36 --> 79.60]  elon musk spent three billion dollars for a 9.2 stake in twitter becoming an instant board member
[80.16 --> 86.80]  note this is kind of political because of how and why it's claimed that this happened sorry signed
[87.68 --> 95.12]  so that later let's roll that intro yeah did they all right rock on uh aprim says stream is real broken
[95.12 --> 108.72]  what's going on are you broken youtube everything broken desync apparently what what desync what
[108.72 --> 113.52]  desync what's chugging it's chugging it is chugging it's chugging why is it chugging
[113.52 --> 129.60]  we're using 100 of our network but uh what it says encoding overloaded
[131.52 --> 138.32]  apparently the encoding is overloaded never ran into this before i'm gonna google live with everyone
[138.32 --> 143.92]  else on the wan show about what the heck that means all right whoa i think we're good okay
[145.92 --> 149.36]  uh don't worry about it we'll figure it out another time yeah
[151.28 --> 154.80]  let's jump right into our first topic we're back yeah
[159.84 --> 165.44]  google joins the i fix it party providing parts and tools for self-repair
[166.40 --> 173.76]  not to be outdone by rivals apple and samsung google has partnered with i fix it to provide not just
[173.76 --> 181.04]  self-repair parts but tools and guides the devices that will be supported are all pixel phones from
[181.04 --> 187.92]  the pixel 2 through the pixel 6 pro along with a commitment to support future pixel models and this
[187.92 --> 195.12]  is a particularly big deal for pixel owners because pixels break all the time oh yeah i mean luke
[195.44 --> 200.96]  you've had personal experience with pixel phones breaking and being just perpetually broken my
[200.96 --> 205.84]  screen is on for any amount of time the top drag down menu will just randomly come down over and over
[205.84 --> 209.92]  and over again rock on brother yeah you want to see your notification do you want to see your
[209.92 --> 214.24]  notification what want to see your notifications how about now that's my phone i feel like i'm conversing
[214.24 --> 219.92]  with my phone right now um yeah i've had ever since pixel 2 every version after that i've had tons of
[219.92 --> 226.24]  problems with every phone that i've had unfortunately um also just right to repair support in general
[226.24 --> 232.48]  is a fantastic thing to see i know it's very happy it's fantastic i think it's been on a tear just
[232.48 --> 237.68]  getting all these different companies to join with their general program credit to other advocates like
[237.68 --> 244.64]  lewis rossman absolutely absolutely absolutely incredible it's it's frustrating it's frustrating that it
[244.64 --> 252.40]  took this long and it's frustrating that it took so many people shouting so loudly about something so
[252.40 --> 262.72]  obvious yeah but it feels like the ball is actually moving yeah like especially over the last few months
[262.72 --> 270.08]  i think of its own accord yeah to the point where we might actually have dare i say it some momentum
[270.08 --> 275.04]  yeah yeah there's been some really significant companies joining on i didn't really see this one
[275.04 --> 279.60]  coming to be completely honest i didn't think google was going to jump on this but i'm really stoked that
[279.60 --> 286.16]  they did each kit comes with an eye opener tool pre-cut adhesives to restore water resistance
[286.16 --> 292.08]  and the appropriate spudgers picks tweezers precision bit drivers and suction cups that you need to get the job
[292.08 --> 297.84]  done the repair program launches later this year with no set availability date and there's a discussion
[297.84 --> 304.72]  question of is there any downside to this whatsoever um no i don't think we need to discuss that too much
[304.72 --> 307.12]  and the next question is who's next um
[310.80 --> 316.24]  oh wow i mean i don't we we're a software company i don't think we'd be able to
[317.92 --> 322.00]  oh no there's nothing we can do about it right now we are live so they're gonna have to
[322.00 --> 326.80]  flip over to one of the other services if it's not working properly okay uh i already said that in
[326.80 --> 330.80]  the chat okay so who's next i mean
[333.92 --> 340.32]  at this point i'd love to see sony step in for game consoles yeah that would be a big deal
[340.32 --> 346.08]  particularly cool because of um i believe it was a right to repair video and the guy used a stack of
[346.08 --> 350.88]  playstations as his example of why right to repair should exist because he's like this gigantic tower of
[350.88 --> 355.76]  playstations with like minor problems can't be fixed can't be fixed so yeah that would be great
[355.76 --> 360.88]  that's actually a really good example that'd be huge i mean my nintendo will never do it no because
[360.88 --> 370.88]  they just don't care about anything other than you buying nintendo yep that's it yep um yeah personally
[370.88 --> 377.60]  like there's there's some i think sony is a fantastic answer to be honest though just anyone just get more
[377.60 --> 382.32]  mass in this in this program just anybody that could potentially benefit from it i think would be
[382.32 --> 387.20]  great i mean who would you want to see like to me sony is a big one just because of the sheer
[388.00 --> 395.36]  volume of e-waste that gets produced every time we move to a new generation of console and people just
[395.36 --> 404.48]  start discarding their old ones um hp dell yeah yeah i mean mass laptop look i mean dell made all that
[404.48 --> 409.28]  noise about their sustainable what was it project luna i want to say it was a little weird i forget
[409.28 --> 416.48]  what like posturing yeah i i it felt a lot like posturing and now there's just no excuse yeah i feel
[416.48 --> 424.16]  like in discussing any laptop thing i should bring up shareholder framework uh but absolutely everyone
[424.16 --> 430.08]  should be doing it hp does a relatively good job actually they provide a lot of documentation on their
[430.08 --> 434.00]  own not even through third parties which is completely fine which is totally you don't have
[434.00 --> 439.36]  to join i fix it absolutely not necessarily like it's it's a it's a win right now when companies do
[439.36 --> 443.52]  because i fix it is handling a lot of it but if you want to create just as good of a program in
[443.52 --> 451.52]  regards to offering um repair guides repair parts tools etc to your customers great it does it does not
[451.52 --> 455.28]  need to go through i fix it i'm happy that i fix it is facilitating all this kind of stuff and i'm happy
[455.28 --> 460.32]  when people join but it is absolutely not the only way to get this done if your company's like no we
[460.32 --> 467.68]  have to keep things in house that's fine um just do it just do it then yeah any other like monstrous
[467.68 --> 475.12]  tech companies that we'd want to see jump on i mean okay uh here's another example of i mean i guess
[475.12 --> 484.80]  people don't really repair like a wireless router yeah okay uh i mean i haven't seen that many like break
[484.80 --> 492.00]  you know yeah generally they've been well i wasn't gonna i was gonna say generally they've been
[492.00 --> 495.92]  very reliable no no reliable is not the word that i would use but
[497.04 --> 501.68]  generally they work as well five years in as they did when they started yeah yeah yeah yeah that's
[501.68 --> 510.40]  a good that's a good way of putting it there's nothing necessarily to fix yeah yeah it's just broken yeah
[510.40 --> 518.56]  from the get-go yeah you have to do initial improvements on the subject of repairing things
[518.56 --> 523.52]  guess what i have here with me you asked me what this box was oh that wasn't even the box i was
[523.52 --> 532.24]  talking about but i'm so excited this is sarah's handcrafted painstakingly crafted retail packaging
[532.24 --> 539.28]  for the screwdriver oh you will be the first to unbox it luke so cool you want to you can you can
[539.28 --> 546.00]  read the thing on the back on the back it says this this is the screwdriver we're always he can read
[546.56 --> 554.32]  we've is there a typo no we've i dyslexia the heck out of it oh it's on me geez i don't know how
[554.32 --> 559.36]  many of these we've printed yet this is the screwdriver we've always wanted with mega pros retractable bit
[559.36 --> 564.56]  cartridge and our own shape feel and finish it's the best of what we saw in the existing screwdriver
[564.56 --> 569.92]  space we spared no expense in trying to make the perfect multi-bit screwdriver for everyone whether
[569.92 --> 576.24]  you're a pc enthusiast a handy person or just someone who appreciates quality products that last for years
[576.24 --> 580.88]  we are confident that this will be your go-to driver for years to come thank you so much for
[580.88 --> 585.52]  supporting this new project with us we hope you love it as much as we do and then line of sebastian in
[585.52 --> 590.56]  text and line sebastian in in signing and it also shows the bits that it comes with although you can
[590.56 --> 595.28]  buy the bit driver packs if you want more right yes yeah cool so you're gonna open it yeah you're
[595.28 --> 602.24]  gonna open it on the front it also shows the bit in spot gloss sarah is a big fan of spot gloss so that's
[602.24 --> 605.60]  like that's like the i don't know if they can really see it yeah it's hard to catch you have to
[605.60 --> 610.96]  kind of catch it in the light yeah i'm trying but i can't tell um but yeah you can see like an outline of
[610.96 --> 616.40]  the screwdriver and stuff we really have spared no expense trust me this is actually pretty cool i like
[616.40 --> 622.40]  this oh it's like orange insides as you can see things there's another what looks like spot gloss
[622.40 --> 628.80]  diagram of the uh of the internals of the screwdriver this time and with the bit load again would you
[628.80 --> 635.52]  like to hear the notification sign up numbers that's not final that's not final ignore that okay yeah
[635.52 --> 640.32]  okay the ratchet is that ratchet's not final there's still there's still some stuff to be done
[640.32 --> 644.48]  there i'm not going to sugarcoat it guys i'm not going to tell you stuff's done if it's not it's not
[644.48 --> 651.92]  quite done uh would you like to hear the latest numbers for signups though yes uh okay i'm not sure
[651.92 --> 656.08]  if i should be terrified in a good or bad way it's at the point now where both of them are looking like
[656.08 --> 662.16]  they could be a bit of a problem in terms of fulfillment at the beginning the screwdriver has a total of just
[662.16 --> 670.40]  shy of 60 000 notification signups for when it comes in stock so given that we were hoping to
[670.40 --> 677.68]  press go when we had 30 000 in stock thinking that that would last until our next shipment would hit
[677.68 --> 685.60]  us we're actually considering delaying general availability um it may be that on the first shipment
[685.60 --> 690.48]  the only way to get one will be to be signed up for the notification list because a lot of these people
[690.48 --> 696.00]  won't go through right away yeah but i suspect more than 50 will it'll be a lot of them so you are
[696.00 --> 704.64]  gonna want to get signed up if you want to get one and for the backpack uh we are at 33 000 signups
[704.64 --> 711.60]  our first shipment of backpacks is 10 000. basically if you have not yet signed up for a notification
[712.24 --> 717.68]  you are not getting one in the first shipment yeah and if you don't sign up for a notification
[717.68 --> 724.32]  now you will not get one in the second wave you will be waiting a while and either of these are
[724.96 --> 730.00]  like exclusive productions and stuff so if you don't get it it's okay you can get it later we will
[730.00 --> 735.84]  make more yeah but the longer the wait lists get the longer it will take because i mean honestly this
[735.84 --> 739.84]  is something we've talked about a fair bit on the wan show and i've talked about a lot internally lately
[739.84 --> 745.36]  we are very cash flow limited right now for the first time i think since probably the first couple of
[745.36 --> 752.64]  years we are our growth is limited by how much cash we can deploy at the moment it's all out there
[753.36 --> 760.40]  and there's just um i mean there's i guess there's a oh man should i should i should i break the news
[761.20 --> 768.32]  which one uh the the one the one down the road uh i think that one's probably okay should i break the
[768.32 --> 776.32]  news i think yeah okay what little people internally know this some do what little cash
[776.88 --> 785.04]  yvonne and i had left for business development and expenses that maybe we would put into we actually
[785.04 --> 790.64]  wanted to add another production of backpacks so we we have three runs that are already booked and we
[790.64 --> 797.68]  wanted to book a fourth uh but it may no longer be possible because do you guys remember how when we
[797.68 --> 806.96]  announced the lab i called it lab one well i think i said explicitly at the time it was called lab one
[806.96 --> 813.92]  because i knew that it wasn't going to be the the lab yeah it was lab one and there would be uh
[813.92 --> 823.12]  they're more different lab or labs we put an offer on lab two yeah lab two is
[825.28 --> 832.40]  over five times the size yeah five of that one yeah it's uh it's uh it's a big boy
[832.40 --> 843.12]  it's just a chungus chungus boy so basically what i think is going to be happening sometime over the
[843.12 --> 852.72]  next six months is we are going to have to do some serious reshuffling internally of our departments
[853.60 --> 860.32]  in order to try to optimize keeping people as close as possible to their reporting lines and making sure
[860.32 --> 867.20]  that everything runs as smoothly as as possible as we aggressively grow going into the latter half of
[867.20 --> 880.80]  2022 and 2023 so we are doubling our footprint um meaning that guys i need you to buy some screwdrivers
[882.80 --> 888.24]  i i got it should we talk about the pre-order thing i gotta be honest with you uh we had a serious
[888.24 --> 894.40]  conversation internally about opening up pre-orders uh one of the ideas that we had was opening up
[894.40 --> 902.08]  pre-orders to floatplane subscribers only uh this has two benefits for us as a business number one is
[902.08 --> 906.24]  if there's people that are really eager to get their hands on the screwdriver or backpack and they
[906.24 --> 910.88]  want to be absolutely first it incentivizes them to sign up for floatplane which helps us at a time
[910.88 --> 918.72]  that we're we're cash limited right now and number two is that it means that the people who are pre-ordering
[918.72 --> 927.36]  are the ones that are more likely to understand if there's a delay or a miscommunication or or something
[927.36 --> 934.40]  that any any small stumble in the lead up to actually shipping these products floatplane is unanimously like
[934.40 --> 940.88]  pre-order now take my money yeah i know i know that's what you guys would say which is why we considered
[940.88 --> 943.44]  opening them up to you guys but the problem is that
[946.88 --> 952.88]  actually it was yvonne who was like you can't do that even though she's the money person here
[952.88 --> 961.44]  right she was like dude you said you're not going to do it at this point it's not about money it's about
[961.44 --> 967.52]  you know is your word worth anything or not yeah we we tried to do some stuff knowing that where like
[967.52 --> 973.20]  we decided that we would technically get like one of the plans was okay if they are a flowplane
[973.20 --> 978.16]  subscriber and they buy the screwdriver at normal cost they get like free flowplane months like one
[978.16 --> 983.76]  yeah like it was going to be somewhere between one and two because the system was going to be way
[983.76 --> 989.60]  easier to build if we just didn't care when someone's billing cycle was yeah we promised a month
[989.60 --> 994.48]  and then it was just it could be up to almost two but like it'll just be whatever's left of this
[994.48 --> 999.92]  billing cycle plus the next one so we were trying to make it like yeah less i guess predatory that
[999.92 --> 1004.88]  way because we we we were worried about people being like oh you guys condemned the best buy thing
[1005.44 --> 1010.72]  and we were going to be like well yeah but this one like i don't know it's not the same for like
[1010.72 --> 1016.24]  a bunch of reasons and stuff but ultimately yeah i think if i was right she's right she's right we can't
[1016.24 --> 1022.88]  con we can't compromise the principles because if we compromise on our don't pre-order principles
[1022.88 --> 1028.48]  then it means that we are compromising you know people might think okay maybe they compromised on
[1028.48 --> 1034.96]  the quality of the product then right so nope now to be clear i'm not saying that we will never open up
[1034.96 --> 1041.04]  pre-orders of any form ever i think that what valve did with the steam deck is really smart where they had
[1041.04 --> 1047.68]  people pay a small amount of money to reserve because you want to know how many to make and it's
[1047.68 --> 1053.20]  really challenging if it's as simple as just signing up for an email i don't know what your commit level
[1053.20 --> 1062.80]  is right so that that 60 000 or that 35 000 that could mean anywhere from one to 60 000 people are
[1062.80 --> 1067.92]  going to buy them there could be a ton of people who didn't sign up think like we we can't actually build
[1067.92 --> 1073.68]  projections based on this stuff um so i think that exploring something like that in the future might
[1073.68 --> 1079.20]  be okay i think that if we were to do a product that's more iterative i would be potentially
[1079.20 --> 1086.96]  comfortable pre-selling it like maybe we do a different colorway of the backpack for example
[1086.96 --> 1093.36]  like we do uh we want to do a limited edition colorway and it's like guys look it's it's the same
[1093.36 --> 1098.24]  backpack that you know and love that almost sounds like a like a printer order situation but in blue
[1098.24 --> 1104.32]  yeah yeah yeah pre-order it we'll do a run at the factory here we go yeah you know right like that i
[1104.32 --> 1110.32]  think there's situations where it might be okay i think that once we once we're farther down a path
[1110.32 --> 1119.92]  where we've got this this consistency in our in our delivery and maybe when the world's and logistics
[1119.92 --> 1126.08]  are not such that it could be anywhere between a month to four months from now i don't know right
[1126.72 --> 1131.36]  if we have some idea when things will actually arrive i think the situation could change but as
[1131.36 --> 1138.88]  it stands right now i'm not comfortable enough to to take the money so things are going to be really
[1138.88 --> 1145.12]  tight for us probably for about the next four to six months after that our hope is that these products
[1145.12 --> 1151.68]  are going to be crazy hyper successful and we're going to we're going to be sort of laughing about
[1152.24 --> 1156.64]  yeah we're going to be laughing about ha ha q2 2022 remember that
[1162.08 --> 1166.16]  yeah sorry if if you're done there i want to be able to open flowplane chat so you got to tell me
[1166.16 --> 1171.76]  about what's on the store oh yes we do have a new product like i can't monitor chat right now all
[1171.76 --> 1178.16]  right this is one of those things that is the result of nick and i just having like
[1180.00 --> 1188.80]  conversation like uh he sent me over this thing that's like holy crap okay a shout out our community
[1188.80 --> 1199.84]  you guys have been amazing the lttstore.com artwork on r slash place came in number six and seven
[1199.84 --> 1209.76]  for the most edited pixels over the course of the entire campaign and it was all due to the war
[1210.32 --> 1224.24]  between lttstore.com and lttstore.com so to celebrate this epic battle we've created a limited edition shirt
[1224.24 --> 1233.68]  where the red outline represents one and the blue outline represents the other
[1234.80 --> 1242.16]  it's intentionally a little subtle okay yeah to make sure that it's something you can actually wear out
[1242.16 --> 1251.76]  in public oh my goodness but it absolutely pays homage to both sides um you know i feel like they were
[1251.76 --> 1258.80]  really good people on both sides sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry that's a that's a dated reference
[1258.80 --> 1269.04]  at this point thankfully um so there it is the ltt store place t-shirt this is a pre-sale guys so pre-sale
[1269.60 --> 1278.00]  but not really a pre-order because we are only printing the exact number of these that you lot actually
[1278.00 --> 1284.96]  order uh we are expecting them to ship by april 25th these shirts are in stock it's just a matter
[1284.96 --> 1291.12]  of working with our local printing partner to get them all printed up if you order multiple items your
[1291.12 --> 1297.76]  whole order will be held until the shirt is printed this is to save you and me on shipping costs why are we
[1297.76 --> 1304.24]  enriching fedex and ups and usps and all the shipping companies for no freaking reason we're not going to
[1304.24 --> 1311.68]  do that we'll ship the whole thing together not to mention burning extra fuel um so this is it
[1311.68 --> 1319.92]  immortalize the epic.com versus dot-com battle of r slash plays 2022 we somehow managed to secure a top
[1319.92 --> 1328.96]  10 spot in the most contested pixels all thanks to our utterly incredible community as for as for the
[1328.96 --> 1334.88]  the the shilliness we've got people in float plane chat talking about it the shilliness of wearing an
[1334.88 --> 1340.64]  lttstore.com shirt you know honestly that's the reason we've never done it i i i've i've i've had it
[1340.64 --> 1346.32]  pitched to me many times and i've opposed it every time i've been like look you know i it just it just
[1346.32 --> 1354.16]  feels like kind of taking the piss um but the reality of it is this community built that
[1354.16 --> 1361.60]  i'm okay fine i'll finally do it i'll find because there's also like it's actually super normal um
[1362.24 --> 1367.28]  like i don't know how else to say this but a lot of times when you buy just a shirt from a store in a
[1367.28 --> 1374.64]  mall it's just the store's logo but the dot com part is like but it also wouldn't be it wouldn't be
[1374.64 --> 1382.16]  about this moment if you didn't have dot com dot com in it like it maybe we do an ltt store shirt at some
[1382.16 --> 1387.20]  point i don't know ltd store or something across the front but i don't think we'd put the dot com
[1391.36 --> 1395.60]  uh i'm being asked are they the new lt t-shirts or are they american apparel i believe they are
[1395.60 --> 1399.60]  american apparel we are moving through the rest of our american apparel stock and then we're going to
[1399.60 --> 1405.76]  switch everything over to ltd shirts moving forward now that we've seen the outstanding reception to
[1405.76 --> 1413.36]  our own shirts so this will be one of the last shirts that we do exclusively in american apparel
[1413.36 --> 1418.32]  and it'll probably switch over sometime after this the reality of it is we didn't probably order
[1418.32 --> 1425.76]  enough of the custom ones to even do a limited edition drop like this because uh we just wanted to
[1425.76 --> 1431.12]  make sure that in mass protection they were still going to be good i don't know how long we are
[1431.12 --> 1437.12]  leaving this up for sale but i think nick and i had talked about like 24 hours maybe tell you what
[1437.12 --> 1440.88]  let's give it till the end of the weekend we'll go till sunday night give you guys a chance to get in
[1440.88 --> 1449.36]  there but let's get it uh let's get it going let's get it going cool awesome all right we should
[1449.36 --> 1455.04]  probably do like another discussion topic maybe yeah we did we did one all right at least one why don't
[1455.04 --> 1460.00]  we talk about the ubiquity scandal want to walk us through that yeah let's uh let me go find it really
[1460.00 --> 1466.40]  quick ubiquity sues brian krebs from krebs on security this was actually last week but we missed it and
[1466.40 --> 1478.00]  that was not intention that's not a word that wasn't intentional either not a word it's just low-key
[1478.00 --> 1484.40]  huck my phone at my laptop
[1485.68 --> 1490.72]  okay uh yeah we didn't intentionally skip it just the show went on for like i think it was like almost
[1490.72 --> 1496.72]  two and a half hours or something so we decided to bail um which i don't have anything to do tonight
[1496.72 --> 1502.40]  so let's rock out let's hang out let's do a four-hour stream um anyways ubiquity sues brian krebs
[1502.40 --> 1509.52]  uh on tuesday ubiquity fired a defam tuesday last filed a defamation lawsuit against brian krebs writer
[1509.52 --> 1514.72]  slash owner of krebs on security uh which if you're into security you've probably heard of over his
[1514.72 --> 1521.60]  coverage of a data breach from 2021 which ended up being the work of a company insider pretty crazy
[1521.60 --> 1527.84]  apparently the backstory is in january of 2021 ubiquity disclosed a data breach that they said was
[1527.84 --> 1533.76]  minor and had occurred at a third party cloud provider at the end of march with information
[1533.76 --> 1539.36]  provided by in quotes a source who participated in the response krebs reported that the breach was
[1539.36 --> 1545.12]  much worse than what was disclosed then in december of 2021 the federal prosecutors uh
[1546.72 --> 1552.72]  indicted nicholas sharp a senior developer and alleged member of the forensic investigation team
[1552.72 --> 1559.76]  accusing him of causing the breach and extorting ubiquity to pay a ransom of 25 bitcoin to prevent
[1559.76 --> 1566.56]  the info from getting posted online krebs included in his december follow-up piece that prosecutors said
[1566.56 --> 1570.64]  that sharp caused false or misleading news stories to be published about the incident
[1571.68 --> 1578.08]  ubiquity takes issue with that particular piece interesting they're filing hinges on their confidence
[1578.08 --> 1583.36]  that sharp was krebs's source uh for the original story and that despite knowing this and not
[1583.36 --> 1588.00]  retracting the story they say krebs affirmed defamatory statements
[1590.72 --> 1596.96]  in december krebs defended his story noting that the facts of the article uh that it was more
[1596.96 --> 1602.64]  catastrophic catastrophic than disclosed are not in dispute it's just now known who's to blame for the
[1602.64 --> 1607.28]  breach also sharp has not been convicted he referred to his original source as
[1607.28 --> 1615.92]  a ubiquity employee and sharp as a former ubiquity developer okay
[1619.20 --> 1625.52]  man um on twitter criminal defense attorney and former computer scientist t greg doucette
[1625.52 --> 1631.68]  considered it a slap lawsuit which is a strategic lawsuit against public participation and noted that
[1631.68 --> 1639.36]  the suit was filed in virginia a state without an anti-slap statute so here's the discussion question
[1639.36 --> 1645.36]  actually there's a couple of discussion questions the one that was put in by jonathan horst is is a
[1645.36 --> 1651.28]  security breach caused by an insider less catastrophic than one caused by an outsider to which i would
[1651.28 --> 1657.68]  answer no no not at all not at all if anything it could be going on for much longer and go much deeper
[1657.68 --> 1662.80]  than you might otherwise uh than what otherwise might be possible if someone was coming in from the
[1662.80 --> 1671.28]  outside and discussion question number two is as members of the media who have at times needed to
[1671.28 --> 1681.44]  protect our sources for reporting do we think it is okay for a tech company to sue a member of the media
[1681.44 --> 1688.32]  over what appears to be um a situation where they suspect
[1691.60 --> 1701.44]  but don't seem to be providing any incontrovertible proof that the source was the person who allegedly
[1701.44 --> 1710.56]  is responsible for the breach but who hasn't actually been convicted um i think that if ubiquity
[1711.12 --> 1720.00]  takes issue with this situation the correct thing for them to do is to disclose everything that they know
[1720.56 --> 1732.00]  to brian krebs ask brian hey does this change anything about your article and if the answer is no
[1732.96 --> 1738.40]  then they need to go back to the drawing board and figure out what they have incorrect about their
[1738.40 --> 1747.76]  facts if they're doing an internal investigation instead of filing a lawsuit against him like it's
[1749.84 --> 1757.84]  yeah this is not this is not cool um yeah especially because like
[1760.24 --> 1762.16]  there's defamation and there's also kind of like
[1762.16 --> 1772.96]  when you subjectively look at things you can paint things in a in a better or worse way right yeah and
[1772.96 --> 1778.64]  if if ubiquity wanted to not get painted in a in a bad light for like the rest of ever this probably
[1778.64 --> 1785.20]  wasn't the way to go about this yeah like i don't really get it did they think that you know people weren't going to notice that
[1785.20 --> 1789.20]  that people weren't going to talk about this yeah and the reality of it is
[1789.84 --> 1798.00]  that ubiquity brought a lot of this on themselves by not correctly disclosing the severity of the breach
[1798.00 --> 1806.96]  breach in the first place so honestly the way that this feels to me and i'm using my i'm choosing my words
[1806.96 --> 1814.32]  very carefully here because the last thing i want to do is get sued by ubiquity this feels to me like
[1814.96 --> 1824.16]  more of a vengeful move oh yeah than anything that's actually about finding the truth and protecting customers
[1824.16 --> 1830.16]  is that do you kind of understand what i mean here like this this doesn't seem to be about
[1830.96 --> 1837.68]  moving forward in the best way possible this seems to be about punishing something that was done
[1838.40 --> 1844.32]  in the past jake just added a note saying that ubiquity is asking for 425 000 in damages
[1844.32 --> 1860.08]  so what damages right because um you know what what should you owe in damages for not properly disclosing a
[1860.08 --> 1872.32]  breach like i it's just uh yeah the correct thing to do is say sorry are bad and then do better
[1872.32 --> 1879.20]  and the thing is ubiquity is generally okay about doing that they've made mistakes they've had some
[1879.20 --> 1888.80]  mulligans that square ac access point that i bought way back in the day and they knew it and they mostly
[1888.80 --> 1895.36]  dealt with it with their community i didn't get any benefit from their their mitigations and they did
[1895.36 --> 1900.80]  never worked properly for me which you know and maybe it was a partly emotional decision but it's one of
[1900.80 --> 1906.32]  the reasons that i went ruckus access points in my house i've had great experiences with pretty much
[1906.32 --> 1911.44]  everything else from ubiquity as far as products go everything else about my home network is ubiquity
[1911.44 --> 1917.76]  almost everything at work is ubiquity uh with the exception of like uh we have that those dell 25 gig
[1917.76 --> 1923.84]  switches and stuff like that if i recall correctly but um you know i had that sour taste in my mouth
[1923.84 --> 1931.36]  over their access points and so you know you you know you guys know how to apologize and move on
[1931.92 --> 1938.40]  but i think that's um that kind of got lost here whether it's an ego issue or whether it's um
[1939.20 --> 1947.20]  some other kind of emotional issue or whether this is just about you know getting back at whoever it was
[1947.20 --> 1953.68]  internally who who blew the whistle on this which i also don't think is cool this was a big deal people
[1953.68 --> 1963.04]  needed to know i'm uh i'm extremely unhappy with this whole situation that's what i'm gonna say um
[1965.20 --> 1972.32]  now to be clear that doesn't mean that krebs is perfect um
[1972.32 --> 1979.92]  um and it could be that there's more to this story than meets the eye i just
[1981.28 --> 1989.52]  i hope here's what i'll say final word i hope that when all the information from this case comes out
[1989.52 --> 1998.32]  and this is my personal commitment both brian and ubiquity to follow this up okay if i forget community
[1998.32 --> 2005.04]  guys hold me to this i sincerely hope that when all of the details finally emerge when this lawsuit
[2005.04 --> 2015.12]  is finalized that there was a very good reason yeah for them to go after him yeah that's what i'll say
[2015.12 --> 2021.28]  because right now you know all we can do is you know all we can do is sniff all we can do is go how
[2021.28 --> 2027.12]  how does this how does this smell it doesn't smell good good right now yeah smells bad yeah but like
[2027.12 --> 2032.32]  you mentioned we don't know everything we don't we really don't but if if there isn't like
[2033.76 --> 2040.96]  a better reason than what we can see right now this feels not great so i'm hoping for i'm hoping for
[2040.96 --> 2047.28]  the best yeah because honestly ubiquity is one of those companies that has come in and been extremely
[2047.28 --> 2053.44]  disruptive good good disruptor they've been an excellent disruptor in a network space that needed
[2053.44 --> 2060.80]  disruption there's still big heavy monolithic company no service fees yeah there's no service
[2060.80 --> 2065.28]  fees to use their software and when when they were kind of popping off was when was it i think it's
[2065.28 --> 2073.76]  cisco that owns meraki yep that like not to be a jerk but fairly predatory setup um not a fan of how
[2073.76 --> 2079.44]  meraki works um and that was right around the same time that ubiquity kind of came in and saved the day
[2079.44 --> 2084.40]  in that regard um especially for for smaller enterprise stuff that can't necessarily afford
[2084.40 --> 2092.08]  yeah or even just licenses small to medium business right like they are so i want to root for them
[2092.08 --> 2098.48]  because i love the product and overall i i love the mission that they are on
[2100.48 --> 2104.48]  but i'm really unhappy about the situation right now damages being thrown at a
[2104.48 --> 2113.12]  a blogger yeah is okay moving on yeah
[2116.24 --> 2123.12]  what should we do next uh elon musk oh three billion dollars yeah someone else no let's just do it so
[2124.32 --> 2131.28]  can i just i'm gonna we're gonna go backwards i'm gonna start with a little paragraph here that
[2131.28 --> 2138.72]  that actually it's a few paragraphs anthony's discussion question segment of this wow this is
[2138.72 --> 2145.84]  long almost as long as his write-up for for the event that took place i thought this was still notes
[2145.84 --> 2152.00]  about the event and i think he's done i think he's done a great job of outlining the issues here
[2152.56 --> 2157.52]  um you know what are the implications of twitter adding an edit button beyond just fixing typos is hit
[2157.52 --> 2164.48]  one we'll talk about that later but here we get into things that get a little spicier so this is
[2164.48 --> 2171.20]  anthony okay this is not me i'm not i'm not taking a stance no hot takes this week okay anthony says is
[2171.20 --> 2176.40]  the expectation that free speech will be enforced on twitter going to make the platform a better place
[2176.40 --> 2182.00]  anthony says twitter is a platform owned by private individuals if people feel strongly about free speech
[2182.00 --> 2187.44]  on it it should be nationalized and made a public utility instead paid for with taxpayer dollars
[2187.44 --> 2192.72]  that's how private versus public property works both in freedom of speech and how it's paid for sort of
[2193.60 --> 2197.52]  unless the private individuals want freedom of speech to be upheld on the platform right but then
[2197.52 --> 2203.68]  that's up to them yeah but freedom of speech is a right not a discretionary decision made by the
[2203.68 --> 2212.64]  private owners of a whatever well it can be because if it's a private establishment like you're saying
[2212.64 --> 2217.36]  you you you don't have the right to freedom of speech right right but the private owners of the
[2217.36 --> 2223.76]  establishment can discretionarily choose to enforce that same standard sure but i think that when when
[2223.76 --> 2228.88]  people talk about freedom of speech particularly in america they're talking about the constitutional right
[2228.88 --> 2234.72]  i understand and so to me you have to draw a line between discretionary freedom of speech
[2234.72 --> 2240.24]  and constitutional freedom of speech and anthony's not wrong the constitutional kind takes place
[2241.20 --> 2246.24]  in public spaces in public spaces yeah and i mean specifically speaking out against the government
[2246.24 --> 2251.36]  but like that's a whole separate conversation there are actually things you can't say um okay next
[2251.36 --> 2258.64]  question is it a good thing that a single person can easily take admittedly incomplete but
[2258.64 --> 2263.76]  such a degree of control over virtually anything he likes with few repercussions
[2264.40 --> 2269.60]  i'm adding a little bit of my own spice here especially when this person has a history of
[2273.60 --> 2278.08]  participating he can't be taxed more than he is because he needs that money to get us to mars
[2278.08 --> 2281.84]  participating that's what he's gonna use the money for he's not gonna use it for buying twitter
[2281.84 --> 2287.12]  he's not gonna use it for buying other stuff he needs it to get to mars participating in russia
[2287.12 --> 2296.40]  style revisionist history he calls himself the founder of tesla does he yeah he literally sued the
[2296.40 --> 2305.20]  founders for the title of founder he's not the founder i didn't know about this yeah like it's just
[2305.20 --> 2317.44]  i i i why elon musk co-founded and leads tesla okay no no he didn't i did not know that was a thing
[2319.44 --> 2319.68]  like
[2319.68 --> 2331.28]  that seems so weird but okay uh anthony says now these are anthony's words now musk already has more money than
[2331.28 --> 2335.76]  he knows what to do with and has repeatedly shown that he doesn't care to use it for selfless purposes
[2336.32 --> 2342.64]  this heavily implies it's not an ideological freedom or benevolent move and even if it were
[2342.64 --> 2349.36]  it's motivated by opposing biases not neutrality finally anthony asks why is elon musk seen as a
[2349.36 --> 2354.80]  savior to so many people and he says when people feel helpless they look to someone powerful who can
[2354.80 --> 2360.80]  help powerful people however are dangerous musk may represent what people want today but when his views
[2360.80 --> 2365.28]  don't align there will be literal there will be little to stop him from unilaterally imposing them
[2365.28 --> 2370.88]  anyway if his minority share grows or he could just pump and dump like usual either or can you tell i'm
[2370.88 --> 2375.60]  not a fan yeah a little bit especially if he answered every single question that he asked
[2375.60 --> 2385.92]  he did extremely thoroughly um yeah i don't know i uh the the guy has a lot of money
[2387.04 --> 2391.84]  his extreme amounts of money yeah and on our current systems that means that you can do extreme amounts
[2391.84 --> 2397.20]  of things extreme amounts of just about anything you want i mean honestly now we're getting okay crap
[2397.20 --> 2403.28]  i'm gonna i'm gonna go hot take here um i think we need to choose our male male role models better
[2403.28 --> 2416.48]  okay frankly um i i immediately lose respect for a man who does not take care of his family
[2418.00 --> 2424.08]  that simple uh and i think that there's i think that there's a lot of discussion right now in the
[2424.08 --> 2430.08]  world about uh you know what is masculinity right does he not take care of his family a lot of discussion
[2430.08 --> 2436.16]  around toxic masculinity um a lot of discussion around like what that is you know what that means
[2436.16 --> 2443.68]  or or whatever and i'm not getting into any of that but i think man or women or anywhere in between um
[2444.32 --> 2452.88]  if you can't be trusted to take care of your own flesh and blood and the people that you make commitments
[2452.88 --> 2461.12]  to um then how can you be trusted in anything does does he i don't really follow an example
[2461.12 --> 2466.40]  an example is the way that people you know idolize someone like steve jobs okay who
[2468.08 --> 2473.04]  yep there's some there's some i know about that stuff i don't know about elon but there are some
[2473.04 --> 2478.96]  nasty oh yeah skeletons in that closet and i just sit here and i go i'm sorry why should i respect you
[2478.96 --> 2482.16]  amazing movie he still hasn't watched it i've been trying to get him to watch it for a decade i know
[2482.16 --> 2486.88]  i totally need a decade i totally need to amazing movie though if you want to hear about some of that
[2486.88 --> 2491.92]  stuff um but yeah okay yeah i agree with that one yeah like does this apply to elon i don't know
[2492.72 --> 2499.12]  so i forget the details um hold on a second no there's there's there's some spicy stuff there
[2499.12 --> 2503.36]  uh oh oh oh oh uh elon musk first wife here we go
[2503.36 --> 2512.56]  oh it's not a long time ago i was a starter wife inside america's messiest divorce first hits
[2516.32 --> 2524.72]  oh boy so he did he was with her from 2000 until 2008 i believe so anyway the point is
[2524.72 --> 2534.24]  yeah i think we need to choose our role models better in general uh in float plane chat laddie has
[2534.24 --> 2541.60]  an excellent an excellent summary of why we just shouldn't take this guy seriously uh constant again
[2541.60 --> 2546.08]  someone else's words you know okay i'm just repeating them constantly lies about charity for
[2546.08 --> 2551.20]  self-promotion lies about his products and capabilities and is unethical about his treatment of employees he's
[2551.20 --> 2558.48]  toxic as hell so what does he lie about in a in a charity sense uh i'm not sure that's why i said
[2558.48 --> 2564.32]  someone else's words i'm i'm totally okay with doesn't oh yeah values free speech like a lot but
[2564.32 --> 2568.00]  doesn't value transparency at all you know about the whole thing where tesla literally doesn't have
[2568.00 --> 2574.00]  a press relations department it got inconvenient to answer questions like hey why have you
[2574.88 --> 2579.28]  massaged the numbers with respect to the safety of your autonomous driving technology
[2579.28 --> 2585.28]  um and so they just dissolved it they just don't answer they just don't answer hey uh couldn't help
[2585.28 --> 2591.36]  noticing that you guys like literally like glued this in or you're using like a piece of wood here
[2591.36 --> 2596.88]  instead of what you're supposed to be using okay we're just not going to answer emails anymore like
[2596.88 --> 2604.80]  it's actually just uh i i have a very difficult time i have a very difficult yeah also pumped dogecoin
[2604.80 --> 2609.52]  um yep yeah yeah that that whole i mean yeah do we have to
[2612.16 --> 2616.96]  i i i yeah i'm all i'm trying to do is make sure that things we're saying on this show is back up
[2616.96 --> 2621.52]  laddie says he recently lied about providing starlink to ukraine the u.s government funded most of it and
[2621.52 --> 2625.60]  he claimed it was all his charity or at the very least didn't provide the full context
[2626.96 --> 2632.00]  uh yeah i don't think he claimed it was all his charity no but i mean the tweet was like
[2632.00 --> 2637.36]  like you would assume you would assume yeah i'm just trying to make sure the stuff we say is is
[2637.36 --> 2642.08]  backed up yeah so maybe lied is actually definitely the wrong word but allowing people
[2642.08 --> 2647.68]  to assume things especially when you're someone who knows social media as well as musk does
[2649.12 --> 2650.72]  fundamentally to me it's not that different
[2652.24 --> 2658.00]  knock 23 says doge is still the best all right duly noted duly noted um
[2658.00 --> 2664.40]  um yeah the bit man says i do not respect steve jobs at all personally and the stuff in his personal
[2664.40 --> 2670.16]  life is disgusting to say the least that being said people respect him for his vision um do you have
[2670.16 --> 2674.40]  thoughts about picking and choosing what aspects of a person you want to respect and look up to
[2675.52 --> 2678.64]  you know what like the problem with that is that
[2678.64 --> 2686.72]  you end up you end up whitewashing for lack of a better word you end up you end up whitewashing
[2686.72 --> 2695.84]  these people and allowing them to continue to exist in this position of power and respect when
[2696.96 --> 2700.80]  frankly i i would rather we just see them for what they are
[2700.80 --> 2710.00]  i don't know i mean it's it's it's an interesting question would we be better off with the billionaires
[2710.00 --> 2716.00]  we have or would we be better off taking people that have actually come from nothing handing them
[2716.00 --> 2722.00]  the billions of dollars and letting them decide what to do with it i i think effectively infinite
[2722.00 --> 2727.12]  money is going to corrupt the majority of people sure but maybe we'd be maybe we'd be better off if
[2727.12 --> 2731.20]  they at least spent some time outside of the ivory tower there's no there's no functional way to do
[2731.20 --> 2735.36]  that though i know i know yeah well i don't know the french kind of figured it out
[2738.08 --> 2745.76]  okay maybe there's been a hot take today there's been a lot of chat about that um but no action um
[2746.72 --> 2751.04]  i i don't know it's it's a it's a weird thing to to say that someone like isn't allowed to invest
[2751.04 --> 2758.48]  in companies anymore is a pretty ham-fisted um response to to modern capitalism but i'm not i'm
[2758.48 --> 2764.96]  not necessarily sure how to how to do it um i'm excited that he he pushed for the edit option edit
[2764.96 --> 2768.64]  tweet option realistically they were working on it already they had already been working on it well
[2768.64 --> 2773.20]  i mean they're it's not like this is a new idea it's fascinating to me that they weren't done in
[2773.20 --> 2778.96]  a week um like apparently they've been working on it for like over a year and that's just actually like
[2778.96 --> 2785.12]  i mean that's extremely interesting at the scale twitter operates uh nah shouldn't matter well
[2785.12 --> 2792.16]  hold on a second because okay okay here i'm gonna play devil's advocate okay part of twitter's part of
[2792.16 --> 2801.36]  twitter's deal is that because you can't edit anything it's either there or you delete it
[2801.36 --> 2808.24]  it it exists in this binary state i mean there's no real thing deleting it is not real though but
[2808.24 --> 2814.80]  okay sure but the point is that from a public from a public standpoint so okay and that's it's permanent
[2814.80 --> 2819.36]  yeah it's permanent right if it goes up at all it's permanent because people people have scrapers and
[2819.36 --> 2828.32]  people so i would i would guess that in order to implement editing in a way that still has the integrity
[2828.32 --> 2833.76]  of that permanence of the platform very easy facebook already did it just copy them
[2835.76 --> 2841.44]  i'm just saying it might be you can literally see revision history and there's a very obvious like
[2841.44 --> 2846.64]  this post has been edited like very obvious and you like highlight over that and it shows revision history
[2846.64 --> 2853.28]  it's like extremely clear been done by other people the blueprints have been made for you just copy no
[2853.28 --> 2858.24]  one is expecting you to come up with the world's most original edit function just do it it's like
[2858.24 --> 2863.28]  actually pathetic that they haven't done it yet that's and twitter is a terrible platform and i'm
[2863.28 --> 2869.44]  happy that more people are hating on it because it's trash all right okay that's fair um oh we should
[2869.44 --> 2875.20]  probably also bring up that musk didn't disclose his stake in twitter or the fact that he intended for
[2875.20 --> 2882.16]  it to be an active stake which means that essentially um he was able to stealthily acquire the shares
[2883.36 --> 2888.72]  without driving up the price because a high profile person like him coming in and taking such a large
[2888.72 --> 2892.96]  stake would have driven up the price which is why there are disclosure timelines and there are laws
[2892.96 --> 2900.56]  around that so i just we can just put throw it on the pile of him just who's in it for himself only um
[2900.56 --> 2909.04]  um yeah i don't know i'm just i'm at the point now where i i just can't i can't
[2912.56 --> 2914.96]  yeah i can't pretend that he's anything other than
[2916.56 --> 2921.60]  i think he's a very public version of that i think there's an extreme amount of these people in
[2921.60 --> 2926.24]  for sure oh i don't think he's an exception at all and i think he catches a lot of flack just because he
[2926.24 --> 2931.68]  talks publicly more than a lot of the other ones uh but he's just more shameless which is just i
[2931.68 --> 2937.44]  don't know if that's worse or better like do you think bezos is better probably not we talk about elon
[2937.44 --> 2942.88]  significantly more yeah that's true um i i think i mean we talk about bezos a fair bit on like tech
[2942.88 --> 2948.48]  linkedin stuff though just because he's in this industry he even has he even has like a nickname
[2948.48 --> 2956.08]  we call him daddy bezos yeah that's generally a positive thing oh no it's not yeah sugar daddy is not
[2956.08 --> 2962.48]  a positive connotation mr lafreniere if most people called a straw poll i think if most people called
[2962.48 --> 2971.36]  an adult male daddy that's a that's seen as like a wow nice you're doing good you're probably
[2971.36 --> 2974.00]  attractive and wealthy damn
[2976.56 --> 2980.96]  i think that's what's going on i think that's where the internet's at i think you are gonna be
[2980.96 --> 2985.84]  so wrong on this one petition to call linus daddy from now on
[2987.76 --> 2994.96]  you know what's funny is uh jake said it so that the greeting when i scan the ubiquity thing is actually
[2994.96 --> 2999.60]  papa yeah but he's doing that ironically because that's like
[2999.60 --> 3011.28]  i think he's i think he's using it in a pejorative manner okay so guys let us know let us know all
[3011.28 --> 3018.00]  right man musk i've like i haven't just come out and been like yeah guy's a douchebag up until now
[3018.00 --> 3027.52]  because it's not really great in my position just like issuing personal insults to giant figures in
[3027.52 --> 3033.76]  industries that i will have to you know cover in the future but he's just gotten such a long track
[3033.76 --> 3039.68]  record of just being a complete ass face now that i just i don't think there's any hope of rehabilitation
[3039.68 --> 3046.96]  so what what do i eventually i was going to have to take a stand on it i respect uh that he's found a
[3046.96 --> 3055.28]  way to make industry in certain areas that are hopefully positive for the world um and i respect that
[3055.28 --> 3062.40]  he did in a capitalistic way i don't respect how much money he takes from those things um and i
[3062.40 --> 3068.00]  don't respect the way he like treats his workers and stuff like that yeah i have no idea about the
[3068.00 --> 3072.32]  you were talking about the like uh family stuff i know nothing about that i don't know anything about
[3072.32 --> 3080.08]  the charity things uh i don't know any of that kind of stuff okay whatever you guys yeah uh by the way
[3080.08 --> 3091.68]  get wrecked that is welcome to the internet pull by the way there is no way there is no way no way
[3091.68 --> 3098.16]  that's what's up no no that's not real that is real straw poll is flawless there's no problem with it
[3098.16 --> 3103.76]  broken 100 percent don't refresh the page don't refresh i am refreshing the page no it didn't even
[3103.76 --> 3107.92]  register any more votes yeah because straw poll is flawless okay there's no there's never been a problem
[3107.92 --> 3113.92]  with straw poll i don't believe this i literally cannot believe this you believe whatever you
[3113.92 --> 3120.40]  want yeah float planes like no i voted no i voted negative no way too bad 100 percent positive yeah
[3120.40 --> 3127.36]  yeah a crane says daddy is a sexualized term buddy yeah exactly yeah and no sexualized term in the
[3127.36 --> 3136.00]  history of man has ever been a positive thing daddy daddy is creepy okay daddy's creepy oh so you're
[3136.00 --> 3143.12]  calling your employees creepy now what no daddy bezos no i'm calling bezos creepy he's like he's daddy
[3143.12 --> 3150.24]  bezos he's like watching you through your ring freaking doorbell like he's not he's not he's not he
[3150.24 --> 3154.96]  doesn't watch you through your doorbell no it's you go to a room in his house and it's just monitors
[3155.68 --> 3162.16]  everyone's doorbell the ceiling the all the walls just every single person's they're all covered in samsung
[3162.16 --> 3174.64]  the wall displays oh my goodness 100 baby let's go oh so stupid there's no way we need to get our own
[3174.64 --> 3179.20]  polling system at some point yeah because what is that with straw polls sucking now yeah it's it's just
[3179.20 --> 3185.60]  not counting tons of votes it's whatever i'm still going to take the win because why not but um it's
[3185.60 --> 3191.60]  definitely not counting all the votes all right uh should we oh we should do our let's do our sponsors
[3191.60 --> 3197.52]  oh we should do some merch messages holy crap there's got to be so many because people are picking

[3266.40 --> 3270.72]  finish this one but then you're up sorry sorry sorry i've been watching since the original build
[3270.72 --> 3277.28]  blog in 2014. i personally hope it's on a display shelf as it deserves i believe we ended up actually
[3277.28 --> 3286.16]  giving away the skeleton of it and the guts eventually died so that's where we're at on that what else we
[3286.16 --> 3291.68]  got what product computer hardware peripherals or consoles or game launch have you both been most
[3291.68 --> 3300.24]  excited about over the years and that's from dawson halo 2 excited really yeah the the halo 2 launch
[3300.24 --> 3307.84]  was probably one of the most fun times i've had i remember we we were lined up we're at uh willowbrook
[3307.84 --> 3314.96]  mall and eb games back then i think it has had a name change uh but eb games back then we were lined up
[3314.96 --> 3320.08]  at the back where like the truck would load eb games there was all these people lined up uh these dudes
[3320.08 --> 3326.16]  drove a truck up and they had a generator in the back and an old crt and an original xbox and they
[3326.16 --> 3330.80]  were playing halo 1 and people were able to like cycle in and play and eb games employee came out and
[3330.80 --> 3335.20]  like started yelling out questions and i knew all the answers all the questions so i won a bunch of
[3335.20 --> 3339.68]  stuff because i read the like pc gamer article or whatever everyone was just like broing out having
[3339.68 --> 3348.56]  fun talking about halo um yeah halo halo 2 or potentially uh burning crusade but both of them
[3349.52 --> 3354.88]  this said launch and both of them the reason why i liked them so much was the lineup which you never
[3354.88 --> 3359.44]  really have anymore because everyone just buys things online but but lining up midnight launches
[3359.44 --> 3366.80]  were so much fun i enjoyed the we launch lineup so much i did it twice yvonne and i did it together
[3366.80 --> 3375.04]  and it's you know what it's cool it's fun okay crazy pitch guys as a date go to it doesn't even matter
[3375.04 --> 3382.88]  what it is but like go to a midnight screening or a product like a major product launch and like line
[3382.88 --> 3388.88]  up and camp out and hang out you'll you'll probably find people to play pokemon with or like absolutely
[3388.88 --> 3395.52]  absolutely it's an experience worth having and it was in december so it was like snowing we're lined
[3395.52 --> 3401.84]  up and outside toys r us we did uh best buy i think it was future shop back then wow yeah we did we did
[3401.84 --> 3406.88]  either future shop or best buy whatever it was and we also did toys r us and i i think one of the reasons
[3406.88 --> 3410.56]  is and we talked about this on the show before passion is very interesting and one of the things
[3410.56 --> 3414.16]  you're going to run into in those lineups is often a lot of people that are very passionate are very
[3414.16 --> 3418.88]  interested in a lot of the same things you are so conversation is often very interesting a lot of
[3418.88 --> 3423.04]  people will go to pretty extreme lengths like i was talking about with the guys about the truck like
[3423.04 --> 3428.80]  to to make sure that it's like kind of fun for everyone around like i used to love midnight game
[3428.80 --> 3434.40]  launches i would be more interested in certain games if i knew that like eb or a local store was
[3434.40 --> 3438.72]  going to have a midnight launch i would be like oh well maybe i'll get it maybe i'll look into this
[3438.72 --> 3443.52]  game more because i knew they were going to have a launch it was fun um it's hard for me to compare
[3444.80 --> 3450.40]  any kind of excitement i could have for something as an adult to the kind of excitement that i had
[3450.40 --> 3459.12]  when i was a child waiting for the super nintendo that was my christmas present it was the only thing
[3459.12 --> 3466.00]  that i asked for for christmas i was like i don't care about anything else may i have a super nintendo
[3466.72 --> 3473.04]  and um i i think i've told the story of the drama that went on around that where my aunt's house
[3473.04 --> 3480.08]  actually got robbed and my my super nintendo got stolen like moments before christmas and she had
[3480.08 --> 3484.40]  to buy a new one from a scalper so that i'd have something to open up on christmas morning so i didn't
[3484.40 --> 3490.16]  get the two controller uh super mario world bundle i got it with just the one controller so i had to wait
[3490.16 --> 3495.76]  until i could get my hands on another controller to play two player but i i don't think anything can
[3495.76 --> 3503.44]  compare it was 1994 right i was eight years old like nothing compares to that yeah and that's 95
[3503.44 --> 3508.88]  so i was nine so i i was specifically going with launches if we're going with like the first time
[3508.88 --> 3514.24]  i got something well that was a launch that like it was at launch okay so it like launched and i was
[3514.24 --> 3520.40]  like yeah off you know like it's different it hits different oh it absolutely does that i remember
[3520.40 --> 3527.28]  i remember i i don't two times that i have definitely cried in my lifespan were when we
[3527.28 --> 3535.84]  first got an n64 and when we first got an xbox um those those weren't launches that is some pathetic
[3535.84 --> 3542.80]  gamer right there i'm pretty sure my brother did too and it's totally okay i i remember like with the
[3542.80 --> 3549.04]  xbox one my dad convinced us uh that he had bought my mom a crystal ball i don't know why i didn't question
[3549.04 --> 3553.52]  why that would have been a thing but i was just like whatever sounds good and it was in this big
[3553.52 --> 3558.32]  box in the middle and my mom didn't know that my dad did this no one else knew that my dad told us
[3558.32 --> 3562.40]  this right so my mom was like trying to get us to open it because she's really excited for us to get
[3562.40 --> 3569.28]  it but my dad told us like you can't let her open it because like this needs to be the last thing
[3569.28 --> 3574.40]  because it's like the really cool thing right so we were fighting my mom to not open this present
[3574.40 --> 3583.20]  and we thought when we went to go open it we thought it was for mom so like my brother takes
[3583.20 --> 3587.28]  one side and i take the other side and we lift it off the top and my dad's already like unboxed
[3587.28 --> 3592.80]  everything and laid it out in like this really cool way um so we lift the top up and my family's just
[3592.80 --> 3599.36]  like that's for you but we're looking at my mom so we don't realize until we look down and it was just
[3599.36 --> 3606.64]  it was very cool yeah did your parents ever pull the um the like the misleading rapping
[3607.28 --> 3613.60]  gag on you guys oh yeah yeah okay i i forget what it was my parents absolutely pulled it on me
[3613.60 --> 3618.32]  um this is totally unrelated but definitely a funny story that i want to immortalize
[3619.52 --> 3624.16]  did you ever get scammed on april fool's day on a non-school day
[3624.16 --> 3633.20]  i don't think so my dad pulled it on me oh when i was a young boy oh he got me up on a saturday
[3633.20 --> 3640.64]  at 7 15 in the morning he goes get ready for school come on let's go we made it as far as being
[3640.64 --> 3649.84]  fully clothed backpack on what like almost to the school he goes it's saturday april fools
[3649.84 --> 3662.88]  my my my girls got my boy oh really so it was easier than usual because their school
[3662.88 --> 3669.76]  happened to have april fools off for parent conferences okay so it wasn't a saturday yeah
[3669.76 --> 3677.36]  yeah it was a weekday they go in they start miming getting their their clothes on and everything and
[3677.36 --> 3684.16]  they're like let's go he got as far as walking out the front door to go get the the carpool uh
[3684.16 --> 3688.80]  the the the kid that we carpool with to come to come over because he was late
[3690.64 --> 3695.04]  and they run out and they're like yeah i'm from the old schools
[3697.20 --> 3702.56]  oh that's fantastic and my when i came home because i didn't even know about it when i came home
[3702.56 --> 3707.92]  my daughter thought the most hilarious thing about it was that she was now on wait you didn't
[3707.92 --> 3713.36]  organize this no she was well into her second day of having not worn anything but pajamas
[3714.08 --> 3716.32]  and she had made him get dressed
[3720.16 --> 3727.52]  oh i thought it was amazing i thought it was amazing i loved it that's funny um all right what else we got
[3727.52 --> 3733.68]  so this is from pierce but also a few other people have asked uh if you have a braces update okay
[3737.52 --> 3748.24]  dr y love you you did a terrible job of the braces i told you you were doing a terrible job
[3748.24 --> 3754.32]  while you were doing it i told you specifically what about it was terrible and how it was going to fail
[3754.32 --> 3763.12]  you insisted on doing it that way i told you you might as well book my follow-up now because they
[3763.12 --> 3771.12]  will need to be fixed they immediately broke within two days in exactly the way that i said that they
[3771.12 --> 3778.64]  would break i came back and got them fixed i said this is going to happen again it will happen immediately
[3778.64 --> 3787.52]  and here's why and you did it again so i literally took a pair of needle nose pliers
[3787.52 --> 3793.60]  after two or three of them had broken off again the brackets i ripped them all off and i said i'm going
[3793.60 --> 3801.84]  to a different i'm going to a different doctor uh i went to an orthodontic clinic um near the office
[3801.84 --> 3805.60]  because i figured that would be convenient so i could jet over there during work and come back like on my lunch
[3805.60 --> 3812.24]  and i got a quotation for both train tracks and invisalign they were actually not as different
[3812.24 --> 3817.76]  as i expected so i figured okay i'm going to do invisalign i i told them that and they said okay
[3817.76 --> 3822.56]  we'd be happy to do invisalign on you but we couldn't help noticing that your top wisdom teeth are still in
[3824.64 --> 3828.64]  the way that your mouth is right now because you've had your bottoms out because they kept getting
[3828.64 --> 3832.40]  infected but i didn't do the tops because i didn't want to do them all at once and i was like
[3832.40 --> 3840.00]  oh my whole face is gonna be like um and i had such an awful experience getting the bottom ones out
[3840.00 --> 3846.24]  i will never forget the sound it made because they were like deep like full proper teeth and they were
[3846.24 --> 3853.04]  like buried by gum they had to like really get in there and like oh i'll never forget that feeling
[3853.04 --> 3857.36]  i i'm one of those people where the pain at the dentist isn't what really bothers me as much
[3857.36 --> 3864.08]  um i i tend to be kind of i think the term is sensory defensive um so certain textures certain
[3864.08 --> 3873.04]  sounds um i actually find the i for years this is hilarious i went through many cavities some without
[3873.04 --> 3881.20]  anesthetic like for for shallow ones um i went through many cavities not realizing that the dentist
[3881.20 --> 3887.12]  drill is the one for emptying out the cavity i thought the dentist drill was the rotary toothbrush
[3887.12 --> 3894.96]  that they use because that everyone says they hate the dentist drill and i hate that thing
[3895.68 --> 3904.48]  like it makes my skin crawl even as an even as a 30 something adult man i am sitting there in the
[3904.48 --> 3910.32]  chair the dentist is like talking to me i have my hands clenched around something i usually have my feet
[3910.32 --> 3914.32]  crossed without thinking about it and i have my eyes closed while they're working on me with that thing
[3914.32 --> 3922.24]  because it is so unpleasant yeah um and so that that sound no they did not knock me out those of you
[3922.24 --> 3926.56]  asking i don't want to risk going under general anesthetic for such a minor procedure it's not worth it
[3927.28 --> 3933.28]  for me personally that is my personal decision um you you can go under general and not wake up like that
[3933.28 --> 3946.24]  that's a thing uh and i was not into that so um anyway what was i saying right so the orthodontist
[3946.24 --> 3952.56]  comes back to me and goes yeah so what happens then is your top wisdom teeth are not biting down
[3952.56 --> 3958.32]  on anything which means that they can shift now i would make the argument to them but the way the gums
[3958.32 --> 3963.12]  have covered and the amount the tops have come down they're probably not going to keep falling
[3963.12 --> 3968.96]  but that can happen and if that happens it'll shift all the teeth again and so they don't want to do
[3968.96 --> 3976.48]  orthodontic work on me until i get my wisdoms out and i just keep putting it off yeah and putting it off
[3976.48 --> 3978.56]  yeah and putting it off yeah
[3982.88 --> 3990.48]  so i want to if you look at the bottoms yeah it's getting kind of nasty and it's getting worse like
[3990.48 --> 3995.52]  the way they're just like crowding up together and particularly now that i have some more room here
[3995.52 --> 4002.40]  maybe they can kind of fix that uh even and this is with disking that was one of the most unpleasant
[4002.40 --> 4008.32]  uh sensory experiences that i have ever had do you know what disking is no um disking so if you look
[4008.32 --> 4016.72]  at the shape of my bottom teeth all right yeah yeah they have kind of like a a v shape and so uh disking
[4016.72 --> 4022.40]  is trying to salvage back some of the space between those teeth by doing what it sounds like putting
[4022.40 --> 4031.76]  discs taking a rotary tool oh and shaving in between them so not only was there the unpleasantness of that
[4031.76 --> 4038.64]  sensation but there was the fear that a slip of what is essentially a dremel tool in your mouth
[4038.64 --> 4046.96]  could be pretty awful yeah um everyone's saying top wisdom teeth aren't as bad i know i know that it's
[4046.96 --> 4051.84]  less likely to get infected because stuff doesn't like fall into it and stuff and stuff and stuff but
[4051.84 --> 4057.68]  i uh i just i just hated it the only good thing about getting my wisdom teeth out was that i finally
[4057.68 --> 4064.72]  bought a switch because i was told that i would be doing nothing but sitting and drinking liquids for
[4064.72 --> 4071.44]  days so i might as well get settled and i was like you know what i'm finally gonna get a switch
[4072.32 --> 4078.80]  so i did and i got completely sucked into a legend of zelda breath of the wild which i i still have no
[4078.80 --> 4086.24]  regrets about even though nintendo is an awful awful anti-consumer company that i i should feel bad about
[4086.24 --> 4093.52]  giving money too yeah uh all right hit me up with one more from dennis i think i've been watching for
[4093.52 --> 4097.92]  over 10 years at this point remember my first video being you walking around outside with a monitor and
[4097.92 --> 4105.44]  opening it on a random table what's your most memorable moment of ltt holy crap you know it's not
[4105.44 --> 4115.76]  the first time i've been asked that um wow but it's it gets harder every time like i was watching uh
[4116.40 --> 4122.96]  i was trying to find some clip for some reason and i pulled up the wrong video what turned out to be the
[4122.96 --> 4129.44]  wrong video and i watched the intro of it and it was it was like a three and a half year old video by this
[4129.44 --> 4137.20]  point so it was it was completely fresh and it was a video about the um i forget what it's called the key mouse
[4137.20 --> 4144.88]  the key mouse so it's a keyboard that has mouse sensors so you can type and mouse without ever actually
[4146.08 --> 4155.44]  lifting your hands off of it and uh james was the writer for it and we did this we did this goofy sketch at the beginning
[4155.44 --> 4162.48]  where colton is playing the role of this presenter who's pitching who's pitching a product in a business
[4162.48 --> 4170.16]  meeting here i might as well just bring it up uh i don't think we have my audio fixed uh key mouse l
[4170.16 --> 4176.80]  whatever ltt yeah here we go i don't think we have my audio fixed but that's fine we'll just uh tokyo japan
[4176.80 --> 4187.12]  here it is here it is um so what we did is we envisioned the pitch meeting and we actually had
[4187.76 --> 4198.72]  um we had the we had the voices dubbed over in japanese and then we subtitled our own our own video
[4199.92 --> 4206.00]  and so it's just this stupid pitch uh of him being like well so so that's good but what are we going to
[4206.00 --> 4212.88]  call it and i believe it's a female voice for colton's like mental uh and so it's in japanese oh oh
[4214.40 --> 4215.20]  uh uh
[4219.20 --> 4229.52]  anyway um i guess what i'm trying to say is over the years we've done so many things that i i didn't even
[4229.52 --> 4235.68]  remember doing this i watched i i burst out laughing just watching this i was like that was so freaking
[4235.68 --> 4242.88]  funny uh i don't know we use the conference room all the time aiden we use it like if anything we
[4242.88 --> 4248.40]  don't have enough conference room these days yeah we use it all the time it is more used now than ever
[4248.40 --> 4258.40]  uh i don't know there's been a lot of stuff like there's there's milestones right you know a million
[4258.40 --> 4264.08]  subscribers or the first time we got a youtube rep or subscribers is pretty sick you know the new the
[4264.08 --> 4269.28]  new office like i remember how pissed i was i told you this story too uh we were at pax this was one of
[4269.28 --> 4275.92]  the first maybe it was actually the first no i don't know maybe it was the second pax but it was at a very
[4275.92 --> 4281.36]  early pax back when i used to do the indie mega booth yeah and there was this guy in the indie
[4281.36 --> 4284.48]  mega booth and i was i was going around talking to people about their games and stuff because i was
[4284.48 --> 4291.28]  trying to figure out if i was going to do another indie mega booth video um and he was like sorry who
[4291.28 --> 4296.00]  are you and i was like oh we're this like tech channel we have almost a million subscribers and he
[4296.00 --> 4302.64]  was like oh well if you cover my game maybe you'll get to a million and i was like the you know me the
[4302.64 --> 4312.80]  amount of immediate rage was like very high and i was just like no there is no way i am covering
[4312.80 --> 4321.68]  your crappy game so hitting hitting that like first one million milestone i remember thinking back
[4321.68 --> 4328.72]  to that dude and just being like well you dude we made it without you um there's been so many moments
[4328.72 --> 4332.64]  like yeah you know some of them are you know remembering how hard it was and how hard we
[4332.64 --> 4338.08]  worked like that first ces when i had to i had to fight so hard just to get a meeting with anybody
[4338.08 --> 4343.84]  yeah and then there's the ones like on the trip to intel i think i talked about this in tel aviv um
[4344.64 --> 4352.72]  having you know literally 25 30 40 i don't know it was like a crowd of people that had apparently all
[4352.72 --> 4358.96]  been messaging throughout the day that they wanted to have like a photo op and and take selfies with
[4358.96 --> 4364.88]  me and my handlers kept being like like they he actually has to make a video like video first video
[4364.88 --> 4369.84]  first they finally come to me they're like look uh the dam's gonna burst here at some point like we
[4369.84 --> 4373.52]  have to we have to do something are you okay doing that i'm like you guys didn't even ask me yeah i'm
[4373.52 --> 4382.64]  totally down and the experience the experience of walking out there with people who are so smart that
[4382.64 --> 4387.44]  they are building the most advanced products designing the most advanced products on the planet
[4387.44 --> 4394.48]  and they're like a fan of me like you know by comparison i i i feel like i'm pretty smart i'm good
[4394.48 --> 4402.80]  at some stuff but the amount of respect that i have for what they do and they're like they're like oh
[4402.80 --> 4407.84]  can i get a picture of the oh this is so exciting i'm like guys chill you're the ones doing the cool
[4407.84 --> 4414.64]  stuff right like how mind-blowing that is for me as an experience right where i talk to people that i'm
[4414.64 --> 4421.60]  like and they're like oh linus you're super cool i'm like no i'm not you know like i just there's
[4421.60 --> 4428.64]  there's just been it's just countless you know this has been a wild run you guys and you know i'm
[4428.64 --> 4433.12]  reminded of bittersweet moments right like the 10 million subscriber stream that wasn't an easy
[4433.12 --> 4438.56]  thing for me to say but it was also cathartic and it was it was i still go back and read comments on
[4438.56 --> 4444.96]  it just to just to see your guys's support um and how much what we're doing means to you you know it's
[4445.84 --> 4451.76]  it's hard to distill it down to one moment i don't think i can yeah fair enough um
[4451.76 --> 4461.04]  yeah i don't think i can i i was reminded of highlander which by the way we didn't talk about
[4461.04 --> 4468.24]  it on wan show yet somebody beat it oh really yeah you go to alaska our guinness world record
[4468.24 --> 4473.28]  no longer stands wait so it must have been continental united states we'll uh we'll we'll pull
[4473.28 --> 4480.48]  it up but i i wanted to i i thought i sent it to riley i'm gonna check my scent i'll check my scent to
[4480.48 --> 4487.12]  riley because i want to talk about it but highlander is no longer the world's highest elevation land
[4487.12 --> 4494.72]  party and these guys went they went hard they like trained for months they went much higher than we did
[4495.28 --> 4500.88]  oh so yeah it must not be continental united states then i'll i'll check i'll check um
[4502.80 --> 4509.44]  here's the context which to be clear doesn't diminish at all land show lol
[4510.48 --> 4512.56]  how does this i think this is it i think this is it

[4731.28 --> 4739.52]  that's awesome that's cool uh so let's uh the group goes by the name strike team alpha they clearly
[4739.52 --> 4749.76]  clearly had us in their radar because there's just like no other reason to try to set a record for
[4749.76 --> 4756.64]  highest altitude land party on land right like we man we had to fight with guinness to even get this
[4756.64 --> 4763.44]  to be a record because it didn't exist before we decided this should be a a thing that you can set a
[4763.44 --> 4768.08]  record for it's kind of cool that someone carried the torch forward it is kind of happy that we like
[4768.08 --> 4775.44]  lost it that's cool i love it so uh their elevation was five thousand eight hundred ninety four meters
[4775.44 --> 4784.08]  here they are laptops in hand yeah all right um strike team alpha trained for hold on a second
[4784.64 --> 4789.44]  months where where does it say how many months they trained for preparation here we go preparation for
[4789.44 --> 4796.48]  the attempt began in june of 2021 with an hour of physical training per day eventually increasing to up
[4796.48 --> 4802.08]  to eight plus hours they hosted a number of practice land parties in cold rooms and meat lockers
[4802.08 --> 4807.04]  to replicate the cold temperatures of the altitude they hope to reach as a result of their dedicated
[4807.04 --> 4812.24]  preparation and planning everything went to plan on the day of the attempt most climbers would reach
[4812.24 --> 4817.20]  uhuru peak and take 15 to 30 minutes of rest before returning to base camp the group had to stay
[4817.20 --> 4823.84]  there for four plus hours setting up tents to help endure the cold their equipment hosting the land party and
[4823.84 --> 4829.20]  gathering their evidence for the record they then had to hike 12 hours back to base camp while tired
[4829.20 --> 4836.56]  and hungry with added breathing difficulties on top of that is that amazing or what that is awesome how
[4837.12 --> 4846.56]  hard did these guys go extremely to absolutely annihilate our record that's fantastic this is amazing
[4846.56 --> 4855.44]  they've been landing since 2012 and just massive respect the only thing that i'm upset about here is
[4855.44 --> 4864.48]  that it took me four months to see this and be like yo guys you rock you know you know games are in a
[4864.48 --> 4867.44]  bad state when you have a group of people that have been landing since 2012 and they're like you know
[4867.44 --> 4874.96]  what would be a good idea playing some cs 1.6 spending spending eight hours a day training to climb a
[4874.96 --> 4883.44]  mountain instead of playing video games i love it i also love how neckbeard um these guys are
[4884.40 --> 4889.84]  it's amazing the guy on the far left is like down to here you know it might be a good idea for what
[4889.84 --> 4898.88]  they're doing if it's that cold 100 i absolutely love it so i man i'm stoked so people are like land
[4898.88 --> 4905.28]  party in outer space when no no so that was actually one of the things that allowed uh or that we were
[4905.28 --> 4910.72]  able to uh lean on to convince guinness to allow us to make it a world record because they were like
[4910.72 --> 4916.32]  well this is just stupid because anyone could just play computer games on a plane and we're like no no it
[4916.32 --> 4921.52]  it has to be on land so we were actually like scaling a peak in order to do we had to explain
[4921.52 --> 4928.16]  what a land party was and stuff right so yeah i'm i'm always going to be proud of us for establishing
[4928.16 --> 4934.16]  this as a category yeah i'm super proud of these guys for taking it to the next level yeah figuratively
[4934.16 --> 4941.36]  and literally and i'm excited to see the next challenge if the if you guys have any any video or
[4941.36 --> 4946.24]  anything we'd love for you to send it over so we could show it on uh on wanshow or something
[4946.24 --> 4950.48]  like that maybe have you guys on so you can talk about the experience uh the way to get in touch
[4950.48 --> 4955.84]  with us is linustech tips at gmail.com we want to hear from you so um i'm not even going to try to
[4955.84 --> 4964.32]  pronounce your names unfortunately these are challenging um for my for my english tongue here
[4964.32 --> 4971.60]  but um we'd love to we'd love to have you guys on and talk about it super excited all right we should
[4971.60 --> 4979.76]  do a few more merch messages because i feel like these are really piling up so far i am surprised to
[4980.48 --> 4991.12]  um find out and inform you i'm surprised to discover and pleased to inform you that 461 people will be
[4991.12 --> 4999.12]  proudly wearing lttstore.com on the front of their chest in the near future oh that's amazing you guys
[4999.12 --> 5007.68]  are ridiculous you guys are absolutely ridiculous and calm it's a little bit of both yeah um okay
[5007.68 --> 5012.96]  yeah let's do let's do a merch message then maybe another another main topic here chase asks finally
[5012.96 --> 5016.88]  i've been waiting for this i just got my first 3d printer and i'm wondering how you guys integrate 3d
[5016.88 --> 5022.24]  printing into your workflow good lord there's a lot of ways we've 3d printed everything from holders for
[5022.24 --> 5029.52]  cpus and sd cards just to make them more convenient to organize and keep track of to uh you know 3d
[5029.52 --> 5036.00]  printing replacement io shields and pci brackets for devices that otherwise we wouldn't be able to secure
[5036.00 --> 5044.56]  to a chassis to uh making toys for my kids to i mean what do we not use a 3d printer for at this point
[5044.56 --> 5052.32]  i mean prototyping products for ltt store we've used it extensively for that uh
[5056.08 --> 5062.08]  yeah they're great love 3d printer loss of holders i think that's probably the main thing
[5062.72 --> 5068.08]  lots of holders you mentioned holders but like just lots and lots and lots of uh i i didn't have uh i
[5068.08 --> 5075.20]  i didn't have back covers for my game gear so jake uh i think he found and then tweaked a design and
[5075.20 --> 5080.64]  printed some some back covers for my game gear so the batteries wouldn't fall out like yeah they're
[5080.64 --> 5088.96]  just they're great they're great let's oh sure one more cooper asks uh what the upgrade do you think
[5088.96 --> 5092.72]  provide the best reward for effort and cost in your new home upgrade series
[5092.72 --> 5101.44]  the stairs honestly not having those stairs there was just so boneheaded i don't know why the
[5101.44 --> 5106.72]  previous owners didn't do it yeah it's a little weird yeah like the fact that there was obviously
[5106.72 --> 5113.68]  supposed to be a staircase there and it just wasn't there was super stupid uh i shouldn't say stupid i
[5113.68 --> 5117.92]  understand why they didn't do it because they didn't finish that side so i guess they figured well
[5117.92 --> 5122.40]  why bother having stairs there but obviously you're never going to finish it if you don't put stairs there
[5122.72 --> 5128.72]  yeah so yeah i'm super excited about the stairs i'm i don't know if it's practical i don't remember
[5128.72 --> 5136.80]  if practical was part of the question but i'm super jazzed to use computer and server heat to dump into
[5136.80 --> 5141.92]  the swimming pool that's going to be awesome you're doing solar heat as well that too yeah yeah they're
[5141.92 --> 5149.20]  both going to just dump into the pool which is crazy and amazing oh sweet um yeah i don't know i think it's
[5149.20 --> 5154.24]  just oh oh i saw the projector for the first time today
[5156.80 --> 5165.12]  okay what's it called ls 1200 something epson's new projector oh ls 12 000 from epson
[5166.08 --> 5174.64]  it's five grand us which is still a lot of money better than the wall but the image quality of this thing
[5174.64 --> 5184.56]  is laser backlit lcd so there's no um there's no rainbow effect the backlight is crazy strong for
[5184.56 --> 5194.32]  a light controlled room it hits 2700 lumens it does up to 4k 120 with like okay it's noticeable i can
[5194.32 --> 5201.28]  detect it most people on earth would not detect the input lag so the gaming experience on this thing is
[5201.28 --> 5210.16]  going to be flipping amazing i i'm just i'm excited and the thing i'm most excited about is that to get
[5210.16 --> 5214.72]  this level of performance if we'd done this even a year ago would have cost closer to 20 25 grand
[5215.76 --> 5221.84]  so yes it's pretty that's a lot of money yeah but compared to what it would have been
[5223.28 --> 5227.68]  i'm just happy you didn't get the wall i'm excited yeah it would have been so stupid compared to this
[5227.68 --> 5232.96]  yeah like so stupid i'm so glad i didn't do it that's actually what we went for with title thumbnail
[5232.96 --> 5240.40]  and appetizer of the video was uh like jake was right essentially he tried to talk me out of it too
[5240.40 --> 5248.16]  yeah yeah okay back to topics yeah let's do let's do a discussion topic here shall we sure is there
[5248.16 --> 5256.48]  any that we like need to get through uh i think we didn't talk about the sony game pass competition last
[5256.48 --> 5262.80]  week we could do the great intel patent kerfuffle there's no notes for this yeah there's no notes
[5262.80 --> 5268.16]  because honestly it's sort of it's one of those things that's kind of a nothing story and it's all
[5268.16 --> 5273.68]  like kind of on purpose under fox came out afterward and said yeah this was kind of a social experiment
[5273.68 --> 5279.04]  but basically in a nutshell under fox posted this thread uh since the beginning of 2018 i've been
[5279.04 --> 5284.64]  following work of the hillsborough team at intel looking forward to having access to the first patent
[5284.64 --> 5288.00]  of the disruptive new architecture that was being developed in 2019 this patent was finally
[5288.00 --> 5293.12]  published upon analyzing it i was shocked by what i saw and certain that the patent would never be
[5293.12 --> 5300.32]  granted in the state in which it was presented because if you look at many of the diagrams in the
[5300.32 --> 5311.68]  patent application they are literally block for block copies of amd's zen microarchitecture presentation
[5312.24 --> 5329.28]  from august 2016 all right all right like literally word for word and it goes on and on and on
[5330.08 --> 5337.92]  someone just went through the zen microarchitecture presentation and recreated
[5337.92 --> 5350.72]  and these diagrams arrow for arrow box for box text for text in some cases um and what ultimately happened
[5351.92 --> 5360.16]  is and intel has actually responded to this and under fox has come out and said yes i understood this
[5360.16 --> 5367.84]  dr ian cutras had a look at it and was like okay this is actually um not as crazy as it seems
[5368.56 --> 5376.24]  i responded because this was flagged to me where i basically went whoa whoa this is so brazen i'm
[5376.24 --> 5381.76]  having a hard time believing it's real and he kind of goes okay hold on a second here have a look at
[5381.76 --> 5391.12]  this here's the actual patent it's a patent for something unrelated and those amd slides were used as an
[5391.12 --> 5401.76]  example of existing cpu microarchitecture that intel's actual thing that they are patenting could be applied
[5401.76 --> 5417.76]  to why intel used an amd cpu architecture deck instead of their own um is perhaps a deeper question
[5417.76 --> 5425.68]  dr cutras's take is an intern's summer project oh okay said intern took generic cpu architecture slides
[5425.68 --> 5430.40]  and ended up with amd actual patent covers some minor thing to do with security and monitoring
[5430.40 --> 5437.68]  so it could just be that like someone whether for the lulls or out of ignorance or carelessness or
[5437.68 --> 5444.56]  laziness or i don't know whatever the reason was they applied for an intel patent using a bunch of amd
[5444.56 --> 5454.48]  drawings and it's not a big deal and it's okay but there was certainly a small blow up on the internet
[5454.48 --> 5461.20]  when these slides and diagrams were first brought up and compared against each other
[5461.20 --> 5470.72]  so i just thought i thought it was funny and i wanted to talk about it oh we need to talk about
[5470.72 --> 5475.04]  amd accidentally giving you more gigahertz for free the original article here at least the article we're
[5475.04 --> 5483.44]  citing is from tom's hardware amd has confirmed that its gpu drivers are overclocking cpus without
[5484.24 --> 5490.88]  asking over the past few weeks some ryzen users noticed changes in the bios that they had never
[5490.88 --> 5494.72]  approved and upon investigation by the community it was found that the source of the unrequested
[5494.72 --> 5501.20]  overclocks was actually amd's own gpu drivers in september of last year amd added a ryzen master
[5501.20 --> 5507.04]  module to their adrenaline gpu drivers to make the process of overclocking your ryzen cpu and amd gpu
[5507.04 --> 5512.08]  as simple as the press of a button previously it required both ryzen master and the gpu driver to be
[5512.08 --> 5517.36]  installed but with the new drivers applying a gpu profile can now alter your bios settings to enable
[5517.36 --> 5523.52]  automatic overclocking which as you may know voids your warranty typically when overclocking through
[5523.52 --> 5527.44]  ryzen master or adrenaline drivers you're greeted by a disclaimer that warns you will be breaking your
[5527.44 --> 5532.64]  warranty but the disclaimer was not being shown in this case furthermore not all systems are prepared
[5532.64 --> 5536.96]  for overclocks and this could result in thermal throttling shortened product lifespan or stability
[5536.96 --> 5543.76]  issues which could result in a worst case scenario in failed hardware or the loss of data amd has
[5543.76 --> 5547.76]  acknowledged the issue and is currently investigating but as of their most recent driver update on april
[5547.76 --> 5551.68]  the 5th there is no word from team red on whether the issue has been resolved
[5553.68 --> 5560.00]  i think it's mostly not a huge deal but it does go to show just how much trust we're giving these
[5560.00 --> 5565.04]  companies and how much control they potentially have over our systems yeah that they can just like
[5565.04 --> 5570.24]  overclock it without you actually knowing pretty wacky well i mean we're seeing that sort of across
[5570.24 --> 5575.60]  the board right now too because you get it with phones and all this other stuff 100 all right
[5577.36 --> 5585.28]  mr belevance if you please from brayden actually wait i lied we have to revisit something here luke
[5586.24 --> 5590.96]  this was not the blowout that you thought it was no you weren't supposed to go back to it i went back
[5590.96 --> 5596.08]  to you i was supposed to see straw poll wasn't supposed to work supposed to stay at 100 forever i still think
[5596.08 --> 5603.92]  it's broken because this 974 here is the same 974 that it was when it was just all that i'm sure
[5603.92 --> 5609.04]  it still is so i i'm sure it's there were a lot more votes than this but it's just very clear that
[5609.04 --> 5615.52]  this was not as one i knew it wasn't going to be a 100 yeah yeah well yeah it wasn't even i knew it was
[5615.52 --> 5624.32]  still correct yeah it's debatable this is a flawed tool flawed tool okay sorry daddy mr mr bellavance
[5625.68 --> 5633.20]  uh just for the record i'm with luke uh that is weird but it is positive yeah uh yeah yeah
[5633.76 --> 5638.48]  as brayden was saying the jump from 2d to 3d rendering in games was an upgrade in both visuals
[5638.48 --> 5643.76]  and gameplay same to the jump to vr visuals as well as gameplay do you think ray tracing can offer any
[5643.76 --> 5648.56]  advancements in gameplay or is it really only a visual upgrade i think they're very small in the
[5648.56 --> 5654.24]  same way that you know physics real-time physics was supposed to deliver huge improvements in gameplay
[5654.24 --> 5659.52]  in some games it has destructible environments absolutely added essential i would say essential
[5659.52 --> 5666.24]  gameplay elements to say for example the battlefield series um as for how much of the destructible
[5666.24 --> 5673.28]  environment um progress that was made actually came about because of real-time physics
[5673.76 --> 5681.36]  that's a that's a spicier topic but i do see the potential for you know real-time ray tracing to
[5681.36 --> 5688.96]  allow you to say for example in a stealth game peek around a corner using a shiny object you picked up
[5688.96 --> 5697.20]  or something like that but i think it's going to be a polish you know a level of polish on your game not
[5697.20 --> 5704.80]  but um you know critical fun enhancing like enabling new gameplay styles yeah or or like core
[5704.80 --> 5719.20]  core gameplay elements that are gonna make this the game of the year you know what i mean that's that's the way that i see it right now also i take issue with your assertion that the move to from 2d to 3d necessarily improved gameplay
[5719.20 --> 5727.04]  eventually yes immediately there were some misfires oh yeah as someone who lived through that we didn't
[5727.04 --> 5734.88]  figure out how the the best way to make people move in 3d was for like a long time like a whole generation
[5734.88 --> 5744.00]  of consoles like it was it was yeah kind of it took a sec from joseph what's your opinion on whole home
[5744.00 --> 5748.24]  wireless charging we charge or similar maybe for your new house we'd love to see a video on it
[5749.28 --> 5756.80]  sorry which one are similar uh we charge we charge uh where do i find this one i don't see joseph
[5756.80 --> 5764.00]  similar i think he was saying joseph it is a long distance or long range wireless charger
[5764.00 --> 5773.52]  uh okay so we have actually showcased similar technology on the channel i don't know if it was
[5773.52 --> 5781.76]  we charge or something else for me uh i'd love to see wireless charging just kind of magically happen
[5781.76 --> 5789.76]  as you're just walking around your house but because it requires line of sight um i just and because
[5789.76 --> 5796.56]  the modules are currently not at a low enough cost or small enough size to be properly integrated into
[5797.28 --> 5804.80]  devices like this i just i i don't see i don't see a path forward for it right now it feels like it's
[5804.80 --> 5812.88]  kind of stuck in that cool enough to not forget about it but not revolutionary enough to um you know
[5812.88 --> 5819.92]  really band together consolidate the industry and push it forward that's where i'm at on it
[5822.32 --> 5827.52]  from lingfei have you still been using your lg tone free earbuds and still sleeping with them any
[5827.52 --> 5834.16]  updates i switch between the airpods pros and the tone free fp8s i still find both of them extremely
[5834.16 --> 5839.36]  comfortable i do find the airpods pros slightly more comfortable but as long as i don't do two nights in a
[5839.36 --> 5844.56]  row with the tone freeze uh they they don't bother me at all and i love that the battery life is a lot
[5844.56 --> 5851.92]  longer than my airpods pros so that's where that's where i'm at on those maybe a question for luke alexander
[5851.92 --> 5856.88]  asks what's the best keyboard for someone with big hands who likes tall clicky feeling keys but
[5856.88 --> 5863.04]  doesn't want them to make any noise does that exist uh that's that's kind of multiple questions you're
[5863.04 --> 5869.20]  asking for a lot yeah there's there's a lot of a lot of sub questions in there um you're not looking for
[5869.20 --> 5874.56]  clicky so that kind of narrows down your your switch selection but at the same time even in the
[5874.56 --> 5879.44]  non-clicky space there's a huge amount of preferential things that i can't tell you what you're going to
[5879.44 --> 5888.00]  like um in terms of tall um just get like normal size keycaps i guess um and then you're asking for
[5888.00 --> 5895.28]  an entire keyboard um so yeah i would just because i can't tell you what switch you're gonna like
[5895.28 --> 5901.84]  so i would just find a non-clicky switch that you want to try and just buy keyboard with standard
[5901.84 --> 5907.68]  keycaps because most standard keycaps are tall i mean if you want it to feel clicky but not be loud
[5907.68 --> 5916.32]  something like an mx brown something in that kind of quiet quiet tactile category might be nice there
[5916.32 --> 5921.44]  are also yeah if you're if you want tactile there are also ones out there that are more tactile but still
[5921.44 --> 5928.32]  quiet um than browns um but but yeah unfortunately there's a huge amount of like subjectivity there
[5928.32 --> 5934.72]  and like big hands doesn't really come into play with any of it um because they should be standard
[5934.72 --> 5942.40]  spacing yeah if it's a proper keyboard yeah so man man as soon as you mention cherry mx browns freaking
[5943.28 --> 5947.76]  look i still like them i don't even care you mentioned them i know but as soon as you mention them
[5947.76 --> 5952.88]  oh yeah yeah people just did that a war starts you can thank you can thank glasses for that
[5956.08 --> 5963.36]  i like them whatever i'm actually using the g915 these days though i yeah i don't know how to go
[5963.36 --> 5968.88]  back i'm using it at work and at home now i really like it and again someone with big hands i really like
[5968.88 --> 5977.12]  low profile keyboards i find okay uh in pure like satisfaction of typing i do not like them the most
[5977.12 --> 5984.48]  but i am way faster on them they're good just objectively i type significantly faster good okay
[5984.48 --> 5992.96]  uh flow plane chat is blowing up asking about the lab's lead unfortunately the lab's lead had a personal
[5994.16 --> 6001.52]  thing to attend to today it'll be next week i'm so sorry also the last pc build guide you'll ever need
[6001.52 --> 6006.80]  is not coming out this weekend because mark who was supposed to finish it up today ended up getting
[6006.80 --> 6011.92]  tapped for shooting duty with me and jake at my house doing the projector video so both of the
[6011.92 --> 6018.64]  promises that i made last week on wanshow are not coming true nice sorry about that solid we're still
[6018.64 --> 6027.68]  not making pre-orders all right uh from evan if you could go back and change one thing business-wise
[6027.68 --> 6036.80]  about your lgt or ntx experiences would there be anything or what would it be oh man that's a big
[6036.80 --> 6041.20]  one what would you change about us uh
[6048.72 --> 6053.36]  it's hard because i try not to think that way too much because if you think that way a lot you're
[6053.36 --> 6056.96]  just going to wallow in regret constantly and that's not actually a productive thing to do
[6057.84 --> 6065.28]  wow look with the life tips here i'm just saying you know um you you can reflect on actions and like
[6065.28 --> 6070.16]  try to use those to inform future actions but saying that changing the past would necessarily
[6070.16 --> 6073.92]  be a good thing is questionable um hmm
[6073.92 --> 6081.04]  i think with float plane to talk about float plane either
[6083.60 --> 6088.56]  starting off plan with with the knowledge and the planning that we were going to be more general
[6089.52 --> 6096.24]  or starting off harder sure because and this is one of those things where like we didn't have the
[6096.24 --> 6100.00]  there it was impossible for us to know this we were going to run into this when we started flow plane
[6100.00 --> 6104.96]  we had no competition and now our competition is patreon video and youtube memberships which are
[6104.96 --> 6110.72]  pretty monstrous competitors um so having no competition we were like oh we can just like
[6110.72 --> 6116.72]  keep it lean and mean and we have time yeah we ran out of time we ran out of time yeah so knowing that
[6116.72 --> 6121.60]  we were going to either be multi-disciplinary which i think is great or pushing maybe harder at the
[6121.60 --> 6126.48]  beginning i think would have maybe both been better but then at the same time like the road that we
[6126.48 --> 6131.92]  went on left us with a very skilled development team that was able to scale ended up doing fantastic
[6131.92 --> 6139.36]  things later on so maybe doing those things would have been detrimental i don't know um so yeah i don't
[6139.36 --> 6147.76]  know that's somewhat of a non-answer but yeah yeah as for linus media group um man i again there are
[6147.76 --> 6154.88]  things we absolutely could have done differently or better i could have hired earlier i could have um
[6154.88 --> 6160.48]  um man i don't think i could have put in more hours honestly especially in the early days no
[6161.36 --> 6170.64]  um we we got by like we we just like barely dodged so many disasters that like i this is even more of
[6170.64 --> 6177.20]  a non-answer but i would almost say there's things that like i don't know if it was luck or effort but i'm
[6177.20 --> 6182.40]  really happy they went the way they did yeah like when we got kicked out of the house we were using as a studio
[6182.40 --> 6187.12]  right as we had already closed on a proper commercial space so we were gonna have somewhere
[6187.12 --> 6194.08]  to go that was so narrow like yeah like i i i i shouldn't have done it earlier because it didn't
[6194.08 --> 6197.76]  hamper our growth in any way to be there and i definitely shouldn't have done it later because
[6197.76 --> 6202.48]  we would have literally been thrown out on the street like what else can it you know and so the
[6202.48 --> 6207.84]  major moves like that but what could i have changed yeah nothing i'm not saying i did everything
[6207.84 --> 6213.28]  perfectly absolutely not but then you have to take a different path you have to sometimes fail to learn
[6213.84 --> 6221.52]  yeah so like i think the things where mistakes happened i think because i would like to say
[6221.52 --> 6226.32]  that we were productive about those mistakes i think i wish i had had a better vision
[6228.24 --> 6233.60]  but then like that's that's like impossible right so like how i don't know sort of i mean some people
[6233.60 --> 6238.72]  you know look at the vision mr beast has for example i i didn't have a vision like that but
[6238.72 --> 6245.68]  that was never you and i think that's okay well i just mean like he he has a path i didn't have a
[6245.68 --> 6251.12]  path i i was like best case scenario we've got like four or five people and we're self-sufficient
[6252.32 --> 6256.80]  i didn't i wasn't even thinking about the company being profitable at that point i just meant like
[6256.80 --> 6261.12]  we'll be able to pay everyone's salary and we'll like bro out and play with tech that was that was my
[6261.12 --> 6266.32]  end game i think you exchanged that goal though because like at one point like you said that was
[6266.32 --> 6270.40]  your end game and then we sort of got there and then we were like no the stars
[6272.64 --> 6277.12]  yeah i don't know maybe man maybe maybe that was a mistake maybe i should have taken my time i i don't
[6277.12 --> 6281.76]  know like i don't know at the end of the day what i'm gonna look hard to evaluate what the result of
[6281.76 --> 6288.16]  those changes would be um sg watt says should have invested in crypto okay sure but that's not like
[6288.16 --> 6294.96]  to do with running our business yeah yeah that is fair that's fair not that i'm saying that you
[6294.96 --> 6300.56]  should go in now i don't even i don't know i don't want to get involved i only have what we've mined in
[6300.56 --> 6305.60]  the lounge for like pizza nights which we now do every two weeks you got to start coming i didn't even
[6305.60 --> 6312.40]  know that yeah um uh chase organizes it and so we're gonna so what we're gonna do is we're gonna rotate
[6312.40 --> 6318.72]  it so that it happens on different weeknights on each cycle oh that's pretty cool so that everyone
[6318.72 --> 6321.76]  should kind of get a chance to come at some point or yeah i like that actually
[6324.88 --> 6330.88]  from sean uh any updates on the steam deck daily driver video i've kind of given up
[6332.80 --> 6341.12]  i just like i gamed on it a lot and um every time i've used anything else i have just
[6341.68 --> 6346.80]  used by computer because it's for work and i don't i'm not doing i'm not doing work things
[6347.44 --> 6354.40]  um in linux right now and then after that i like actually haven't gamed much lately and so it's just
[6354.40 --> 6362.08]  not really a video anymore i think so that's where i'm at on that sorry crap that's now three broken
[6362.08 --> 6372.08]  promises today shoot shoot okay softball question for you uh after maybe that hard one from liz any
[6372.08 --> 6379.20]  upcoming games that you're excited about uh yes uh where is it it's in my trello i'll have to check my
[6380.08 --> 6389.04]  i have a personal trello for like games to play shut up be nice so wait is this is this a game that's
[6389.04 --> 6393.04]  already out no it's not out yet it's an upcoming you have to pick an upcoming it was just if it's in
[6393.04 --> 6397.20]  your trello i didn't know if it was like actually i want to play sea of stars and rise of the third
[6397.20 --> 6402.56]  power they both look awesome never heard of either of those nice that's cool um
[6402.56 --> 6408.56]  um i feel like i've been saying this for i think four years but i'm still gonna say skull and bones
[6411.60 --> 6418.64]  yeah whenever it comes out maybe uh maybe 2030 we'll see this looks amazing
[6419.60 --> 6425.44]  uh the art looks amazing i think you showed me this actually yeah yeah i just it looks so beautiful
[6425.44 --> 6430.00]  i just really want to play it and then what was the other one i said see if stars and uh i already
[6430.00 --> 6437.44]  don't remember uh rise of the something where is it uh come on rise of the third power yeah it looks
[6437.44 --> 6447.20]  amazing i i'm not going to pre-order but i am excited starfield if you told me when i was
[6447.20 --> 6456.72]  17 that bethesda was going to make starfield and it was going to come out when i was around this age
[6456.72 --> 6461.60]  i would have been like wow i'm excited for future me that's going to be an amazing game if you told me
[6461.60 --> 6466.80]  the last few years that bethesda was going to make any game at all i don't think i'd be that excited
[6466.80 --> 6472.24]  yeah um so that's where i'm currently sitting out with starfield hopefully it's great i'm going in with
[6472.24 --> 6478.80]  extremely low expectations and i suspect that they might uh land below that so i'm concerned
[6479.68 --> 6486.72]  but this looks like another crosscode where it's like the game that i would fund if i started a game
[6486.72 --> 6494.32]  studio because this is just like what i want to play i want a super story driven like 16-bit style
[6495.28 --> 6501.36]  um wait coming february 10th 2022 did they is this available or did they miss that
[6502.24 --> 6512.16]  um uh is this out this is out oh oh i'm totally gonna play it nice cool i'm excited oh it's deck
[6512.16 --> 6516.88]  verified heck yeah i'm gonna buy it tonight all right there you go
[6520.24 --> 6527.76]  all right hit me all right from joshua what were the best and worst parts of working at ncix and how
[6527.76 --> 6536.56]  are they different from founding and heading linus media group hmm uh okay best and worst parts of
[6536.56 --> 6546.08]  work okay the best part of working at ncix is that i basically got a a business education while being
[6546.08 --> 6556.48]  paid to do it i am extremely glad that when i played the game of life i took a gamble and i skipped school and
[6556.48 --> 6562.32]  i went straight into a business that was big enough that there was a lot to learn and knowledgeable
[6562.32 --> 6571.20]  people to absorb from but small enough that i could legitimately affect change and make my way to the
[6571.20 --> 6579.68]  top of the company in a span of just you know four or five years um i am super grateful for my time at ncix
[6579.68 --> 6586.96]  i i definitely worked hard to make the most of it they didn't hand me anything but um i was given the
[6586.96 --> 6598.24]  opportunity to become more knowledgeable more patient um to learn how to take risks to learn how to calculate
[6598.24 --> 6604.08]  my risks uh all so many of the things both what to do and what not to do
[6604.08 --> 6612.24]  so so many of the things that i now consider just core parts of myself even though they weren't i
[6612.24 --> 6618.72]  learned at ncix um you know things like our our summer you know summer of fun i ripped off the whole
[6618.72 --> 6627.52]  thing directly from ncix even the name uh so we just have uh in the summer we do a budget per per employee
[6627.52 --> 6634.08]  uh and you can as long as you have what some minimum number of lmg creator warehouse or float
[6634.08 --> 6642.64]  plane employees that all do the activity then you can write off up to a certain amount per get together
[6642.64 --> 6648.88]  just to encourage people to do stuff that's fun together outside of work hours and also even do
[6648.88 --> 6653.20]  stuff that they otherwise might not like maybe you wouldn't go go karting because it's like pretty
[6653.20 --> 6657.84]  expensive it is but if it's free and the only cost is that you like have to hang out with colleagues
[6657.84 --> 6664.16]  well hey oh sure yeah i'll go go karting so uh that was ripped off directly from ncix and then the
[6664.16 --> 6671.52]  part of that that i learned not to do from ncix is um unceremoniously terminate a program like that
[6672.48 --> 6678.40]  without replacing it with something else my uh my least favorite part was getting paid below minimum wage
[6678.40 --> 6686.88]  um yeah and i don't know i feel like i was so detached from the actual company other than getting
[6686.88 --> 6693.20]  paid below minimum wage that i don't have a lot of particularly favorite parts about working with ncix
[6693.20 --> 6697.44]  hanging out with me it was basically just hanging out with linus no one else there even knew who the
[6697.44 --> 6703.36]  hell i was yeah it's true like i didn't like interface with the company well you showed up like
[6703.36 --> 6709.04]  after hours everybody was gone yeah it was just like you and me yeah they're late yeah i'd enter
[6709.04 --> 6713.92]  the studio directly like i usually didn't even come in the front doors we'd like water around the
[6713.92 --> 6719.84]  warehouse and like grab things every once in a while like i knew i could probably like map out the layout
[6719.84 --> 6724.32]  of headquarters now because i remember like i moved around the building a fair amount but no one's ever
[6724.32 --> 6733.12]  there so yeah i don't know and then for me i'd say the worst part was dealing with people that
[6733.36 --> 6742.96]  i whose skills i didn't respect people who i felt were in jobs that they were not qualified for
[6742.96 --> 6749.84]  and ended up wasting a lot of mine and the company's resources i don't like waste i don't mind spending
[6749.84 --> 6756.32]  but i hate waste that's what i've told every labs person who has joined so far is your job is to think
[6757.12 --> 6762.72]  pontificate plan because there's no website to publish to so your job is to do all of these things
[6763.28 --> 6772.16]  spend money don't waste it is what what i've told them yeah hit me again all right from anonymous
[6772.16 --> 6780.64]  what's your most underrated battle station upgrade hmm i think that monitor upgrades
[6781.76 --> 6788.80]  it's people understand it now but back in the day a monitor upgrade was considered like kind of the last
[6788.80 --> 6795.04]  thing you would do you know what no i'm changing my answer mouse pad and that's not just because we
[6795.04 --> 6800.00]  sell mouse pads we sell mouse pads because i'm super picky about mouse pads because i was the kind of
[6800.00 --> 6805.84]  person that used a piece of paper for many years of my life and when i finally got a good mouse pad boy did
[6805.84 --> 6811.92]  it ever make a huge difference for me and i've been a believer ever since um every once in a while i'll end up
[6811.92 --> 6817.84]  traveling and i'll forget to bring a mouse pad and i'll get handed some stupid like freebie mouse pad
[6817.84 --> 6823.76]  because most companies don't invest in proper mouse pads for their workstations and it just it sucks i
[6823.76 --> 6828.64]  hate it because a proper mouse pad makes a big difference to the comfort of your arm it makes
[6829.52 --> 6834.16]  having a little bit of cushion it just feels it feels better it tracks better so you're not going to
[6834.16 --> 6839.20]  miss click when you're aiming for something small you're moving quickly yeah i'm going with mouse pad
[6841.12 --> 6844.80]  yeah i'm going to kind of cop out and just say general peripherals as well back when i was a kid
[6844.80 --> 6848.80]  and i was trying to get a terrible answer i was trying to get into counter strike and and call of
[6848.80 --> 6855.04]  duty like pro teams uh i was on this i was on this counter strike team and our lead we didn't have a
[6855.04 --> 6861.52]  coach but our like best player would do these workshops with people uh so he was trying to like
[6861.52 --> 6865.60]  train us to like aim properly and do all this kind of stuff and he would dive into our mice
[6866.40 --> 6871.20]  and our like keyboards and and mouse pads and stuff right and this was like this was way long ago i was
[6871.20 --> 6876.32]  like 14 or 13 or something um and he would like if anyone had a wired mouse he'd be like dude no
[6876.32 --> 6881.76]  because this was back when wired mice weren't very good um wireless you mean yes sorry okay if if
[6881.76 --> 6887.04]  people had wireless mice he's like dude no um and he would he would go over consistency like crazy and
[6887.04 --> 6891.44]  all the stuff and i i noticed pretty early on like everything he's focusing on is peripheral
[6891.44 --> 6895.44]  and our way that we interact with the game right and people that had lower performance computers
[6896.32 --> 6900.96]  it was like yeah that wasn't great but what he was way more focused on was how we controlled our
[6900.96 --> 6905.60]  our actions right and it's i mean he was right in a lot of ways i'm gonna come up with another one
[6907.12 --> 6913.76]  air conditioning air underrated big deal when you're comfortable you're focused when you're not
[6913.76 --> 6918.24]  comfortable you're not focused and actually that's funny uh bells like why not our sponsor secret lab
[6918.24 --> 6920.56]  yeah chair is another big part of being comfortable while you're gaming
[6922.96 --> 6927.04]  yeah i think i agree with chair except i spent like a pretty high portion of my life
[6927.04 --> 6933.92]  sitting on exercise balls yeah i thought that was great so well i don't know yeah awful gaming on an
[6933.92 --> 6942.32]  exercise ball yeah i don't even want to talk about it uh bell uh from tyler what hardware features or
[6942.32 --> 6949.76]  changes can you absolutely not get behind oh uh well i mean an obvious one would be hole punches or
[6949.76 --> 6957.20]  notches and displays i went out of my way to completely avoid that stupid trend um man can you
[6957.20 --> 6962.72]  absolutely not get behind i'm trying to think i'm sure there's some but i'm trying to think
[6970.24 --> 6974.88]  subscription hardware where you have to pay for both the hardware and the subscription mentioned
[6974.88 --> 6979.44]  that earlier i'm kind of a pickle i'm a pick a lane kind of guy i don't mind paying a subscription for
[6979.44 --> 6986.16]  something i don't mind paying up front i don't like both yeah yeah if you're gonna subsidize your
[6986.16 --> 6994.24]  shiz then fine subsidize it what else conrad says like gaming mice bell says non-removable power cables
[6994.24 --> 7001.52]  apple i mean i hope that's not a trend but i was kind of trying to think trends anything anti-rights for
[7001.52 --> 7008.64]  repair we don't like changes yeah this is it this is not an absolutely cannot get behind but i'm not
[7008.64 --> 7014.64]  a fan of it and i understand it's probably progress it's probably better um but the overclock ability
[7014.64 --> 7018.72]  of things trending downwards oh yeah yeah it's probably better that things are just as fast as
[7018.72 --> 7022.64]  they can be out of the box but it does make it more boring yeah it's hilarious to me that water
[7022.64 --> 7027.92]  cooling is a bigger industry than it's ever been even though there's less point in water cooling than
[7027.92 --> 7034.24]  there has ever been yeah avon we're on the last merch message she needs to go and i need to go um
[7034.80 --> 7042.32]  and i guess that's it then i feel like i should give you guys a final tally here um so far there are
[7043.20 --> 7052.24]  this is so stupid uh i mean like stupid in a hey thanks guys y'all are great there are 558 of you
[7052.24 --> 7061.04]  that are actually going to wear lttstore.com nice on the front of you and um thank you for that uh
[7061.04 --> 7065.60]  cable ties are low-key one of our top selling items now that we have all the different colors
[7065.60 --> 7070.24]  and the larger packs oh that's cool um so that's pretty cool you guys you guys want some inside
[7070.24 --> 7075.84]  baseball you want a little bit inside baseball before we go uh desk pads and water bottles continue
[7075.84 --> 7080.72]  to be some of our biggest movers i i love our water bottles i think they're great i had a conversation
[7080.72 --> 7086.16]  with kyle about why you're not allowed to uh dishwash them i was like hey um i've always
[7086.16 --> 7090.56]  wondered about this because if there's a vacuum in there like the heat surely couldn't cause a pressure
[7090.56 --> 7096.96]  problem and he's like no it's a melting issue the way that they seal the vacuum is with a glass bead
[7096.96 --> 7104.16]  that they melt into here and the problem is that when it heats up and expands and then cools and contracts
[7104.16 --> 7110.00]  glass and metal do not heat up and expand at the same rate and that's why these thermally insulated
[7110.00 --> 7114.80]  water bottles are not safe to put in the dishwasher makes sense it's not that it's like going to explode
[7114.80 --> 7120.80]  or something it's just that it will could damage it and i have run them effective and they have
[7120.80 --> 7126.40]  not been damaged but it's not a guarantee so that's why we say that you can't do it yeah and i've seen
[7126.40 --> 7132.24]  people complaining about how our water bottles are not dishwasher safe no insulated water bottle should
[7132.24 --> 7137.44]  go in the dishwasher so anyone that you are putting in that is also insulated you're doing that
[7137.44 --> 7143.52]  contrary to the manufacturer's guidance you just don't realize it probably because we try to be
[7143.52 --> 7148.88]  really upfront about that kind of stuff all right i think that's pretty much it we will see you again
[7148.88 --> 7162.08]  next week same bad time same bad channel bye oh uh that didn't work uh okay uh
