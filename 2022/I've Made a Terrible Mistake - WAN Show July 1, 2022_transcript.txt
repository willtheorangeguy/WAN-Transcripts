[0.00 --> 6.48]  welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen we got a fantastic show lined up for you today
[6.48 --> 17.08]  and a lot of great topics including what happened to my hair yeah yeah yeah i will say this much
[17.08 --> 22.58]  there's a channel super fun i've heard you're not gonna want to miss it we'll be talking about that
[22.58 --> 28.88]  we're also gonna be talking about youtube's new features to combat comment spam it turns out they
[28.88 --> 36.84]  care or at least they care a little we're gonna dig into it what else we got uh i'm scrolling it looks
[36.84 --> 42.06]  like the dock is still uh under construction uh but we are we are working on it this one's pretty good
[42.06 --> 48.68]  oh well i turned the text yellow instead of highlighting it so uh there's a google engineer
[48.68 --> 55.22]  explains why business versus non-business g-suites accounts work the way that they do in which is to
[55.22 --> 60.50]  say that the business ones the paid ones don't work yes yes it's very interested to hear about
[60.50 --> 64.52]  that it's pretty much what you'd expect but it's interesting to hear it like from someone that
[64.52 --> 69.84]  actually works there you know like it's that's good that's helpful that's nice um i'm not gonna do this
[69.84 --> 79.06]  one where is it there it is oh yeah intel's block scale crypto miner is out early but also late
[79.06 --> 84.90]  yep bad timing intel let's go ahead and roll that intro that seems to be a theme for them lately
[84.90 --> 114.88]  the show was brought to you today by reloptics squarespace and secret lab let's jump right
[114.88 --> 120.82]  into what i know is on everyone's mind first and foremost what the heck happened to my hair
[120.82 --> 128.84]  yeah do you like my haircut do you like the new day well i'm glad i can count on you for your
[128.84 --> 136.98]  forthrightness i don't think it always i don't think it's like horrible but i think it's a clear
[136.98 --> 145.34]  definite absolute downgrade uh i mean and being a downgrade over doing nothing no no see like four
[145.34 --> 150.02]  months but i don't pretty rough i don't necessarily agree with that because there's a lot of different
[150.02 --> 155.04]  like men's hairstyles that you can get away with that are like attractive and are actually genuinely
[155.04 --> 162.18]  good that take not be drinking that take very little maintenance yes tell me more found it i feel
[162.18 --> 167.28]  like you had hit your like apex you had figured out your beard your beard was good now it's like
[167.28 --> 175.04]  smaller i think i think you trim did you trim the beard back well i didn't oh he did that too yes yeah
[175.04 --> 182.36]  it doesn't look as good uh so i feel like you had figured that out and then that's downgraded and i feel
[182.36 --> 187.38]  like you had figured the hair out because you don't like doing tons of maintenance with your hair no i don't
[187.38 --> 192.66]  so you had something that worked really well and it was a package and it was good and you were doing
[192.66 --> 199.36]  good so you're saying basically and now it looks like someone who like and i'm on the down i'm on
[199.36 --> 204.12]  the down slope i'm on the down slope now it looks like you like saw someone else's haircut that worked
[204.12 --> 209.14]  really well for them and you're like i'm gonna take exactly that even though it doesn't work for me
[209.14 --> 214.16]  okay do you know what the video was because it sounds like you know what the video was i actually don't
[214.16 --> 223.28]  don't dennis went to yvonne and asked her for a reference picture the reference picture she chose
[223.28 --> 230.32]  was uh chris hemsworth like thor chris hemsworth but with like the you know like like this one you
[230.32 --> 234.10]  know oh sorry i swept it the wrong way it doesn't matter the point is it's supposed to go up a bit at
[234.10 --> 241.92]  the very least okay she picked that dennis then had three hours of professional instruction
[241.92 --> 248.66]  from a top tier hairdresser on dummies and everything learning to use all the tools
[248.66 --> 257.68]  to learn how to give that haircut then he had one hour to execute that haircut including beard trim
[257.68 --> 263.18]  on me and obviously this is going to be a bit of a spoiler for you wan show viewers but
[263.18 --> 271.20]  i promise you the journey is just as much fun as the destination if not more so because there were
[271.20 --> 276.88]  some additional challenges some curveballs that i threw into dennis as part of the whole challenge
[276.88 --> 286.32]  but i will say this i have often gone to the hairdresser and not really understood why they do
[286.32 --> 292.10]  things the way that they do do you do you get it now is that the direction no oh i still don't get it
[292.10 --> 299.90]  okay because dennis did things that were like proper the way that a hairdresser would do it like for
[299.90 --> 305.06]  example do you use just like a guard and a trimmer and a and a shaver to trim your beard yeah okay
[305.06 --> 311.84]  according to the hairdresser you should never go against the grain you always go with the grain
[311.84 --> 318.32]  so been doing it wrong yeah i don't know how you you can't get certain because it just flattens it
[318.32 --> 323.92]  well let's talk about that okay when i trim my beard which i think i've got down to pretty much a
[323.92 --> 333.26]  science at this point pretty good it takes me about 110 seconds like it actually takes me pretty much
[333.26 --> 339.10]  no you have your guard length figured out yeah it's number four pretty much across the board i go a
[339.10 --> 343.56]  little easy here because i have like kind of a thin spot right here neither of us i'm assuming
[343.56 --> 349.68]  not exactly masters of beards oh no not at all take this for the yeah don't take the complete
[349.68 --> 354.46]  ignorant nonsense that it is okay yeah yeah but i just grab a number four i just go
[354.46 --> 361.66]  grab everything that everything that it will cut you know kind of blend a little bit here try not to
[361.66 --> 367.44]  take off too much in that kind of weak spot right there and then i take off the guard i fix up the
[367.44 --> 374.52]  cheeks and then i just kind of go yeah and then i'm done it actually takes me less than two minutes
[374.52 --> 381.90]  meanwhile dennis following the the proper way of doing it where you go down managed to get as low
[381.90 --> 389.50]  as a number one without taking pretty much anything off and then he goes and he starts cutting freehand
[389.50 --> 397.30]  around the mustache which was terrifying oh like no guard so i do that well no guard but not like
[397.30 --> 403.82]  like i rest against my lip because it won't cut it yeah so i i like use the lip as a as a as a guide
[403.82 --> 410.38]  no i mean freehand like like like a pencil just like oh like holding my head and going like
[410.38 --> 416.72]  one slip and i'm looking like i got like a bear spot here you know what i mean
[416.72 --> 423.04]  it was madness can i see the back of your head and can you take the headphones off and like just turn a
[423.04 --> 432.02]  little bit i'll ditch the headphones off how do i look okay okay i need to yeah wow i spent half an
[432.02 --> 441.96]  hour on this fade yeah yep okay see i don't i don't know i know nothing about hair but like it
[441.96 --> 449.56]  doesn't really seem like it's blended properly um because like you can see the layers which i don't
[449.56 --> 456.92]  think is like what's supposed to happen yeah um i don't know you've got some stuff going on back
[456.92 --> 461.98]  here yeah yeah yeah yeah i i don't think dennis was familiar with the concept of a cow lick
[461.98 --> 470.32]  which was interesting okay yeah and he kept saying oh your hair is so thin and i'm like yeah dennis i'm
[470.32 --> 478.68]  not asian i don't have like coarse hair i yeah it's thin oh it's so curly like okay hey it's not
[478.68 --> 485.46]  that curly i've got a bit of a wave but it's not curly and like yes yes i have i have white guy hair
[485.46 --> 490.40]  what do you want from me that's sort of what i was talking about though is like it doesn't look like
[490.40 --> 496.26]  it was cut for you which might be the problem with the the like the source material or whatever but
[496.26 --> 501.80]  like honestly the second i saw you because i ran into him in the stairwell earlier today and the
[501.80 --> 509.38]  second i saw you i was just like huh it's just like more weird than anything because it just doesn't
[509.38 --> 513.40]  i don't personally i don't think it suits you this is great twitch chat twitch chat be like wow
[513.40 --> 519.40]  linus balding af bald spot above the right ear no no no that would be dennis's hand to work
[519.40 --> 528.30]  wait what wait what is this oh no no that's just okay okay there we go yeah so yes some hairline
[528.30 --> 533.94]  receding but no that's not just like a bald spot that's just well he didn't really take any length
[533.94 --> 540.72]  off that too it's really long it's like the hair on the top of his head really long but also like
[540.72 --> 545.54]  down the back like there's hair that's really long down the back well he barely touched the top
[545.54 --> 554.04]  he spent half an hour of his time on this fade that is extremely uneven like it goes from nothing
[554.04 --> 561.68]  to hello yeah yeah yeah yeah and then probably another 10 minutes on the beard so the poll on
[561.68 --> 569.28]  float plane is showing 72 no 72 do not like the hair here i'll share my screen with you guys
[569.28 --> 575.98]  here's uh we have a new polling system on float plane freaking amazing massive shout out float plane
[575.98 --> 582.58]  team for putting that together for us way easier to generate polls now um but yeah that's uh
[582.58 --> 590.92]  are you going to leave it i have to that's part of the like i mean that's the rules you can't have
[590.92 --> 598.72]  stakes see i always talk to i always talk to people internally about this i hate fakeness i i hate
[598.72 --> 603.62]  fake reactions and fake pranks i just i just didn't know like okay you have to hold it for the rest of
[603.62 --> 610.18]  the week or like what the fakeness that is online content in general i was i was doom scrolling on
[610.18 --> 614.28]  facebook in the middle of the night like i don't know it must have been a couple of months ago that's
[614.28 --> 619.52]  got to be one of the worst things to doom scroll on pretty much i came across this video that's like
[619.52 --> 628.42]  she surprised her her she she surprised her husband with a visit from military duty or something
[628.42 --> 637.20]  and and it's this thing that that she's wearing like like an old man like a rubber mask and like
[637.20 --> 641.36]  dressed up as someone else entirely and he's a doctor and he's like sitting working his computer
[641.36 --> 648.02]  and she manages to completely strip down her costume to like her her army while he's working
[648.02 --> 653.64]  while he's supposedly working and not noticing any of this and i'm sitting this has like 20 million
[653.64 --> 659.42]  views of course like just just and i'm sitting here going i was watching it as part of like i
[659.42 --> 665.46]  continued watching it i i figured out it was fake immediately but i was continuing watching it just
[665.46 --> 672.48]  to kind of see what are people watching you know reading the comments right there's some people where
[672.48 --> 678.54]  they're like commenting like they're playing along obviously but there's a lot where you look at it
[678.54 --> 686.34]  and you go no unironically you you don't realize that this is just a complete setup i don't i don't
[686.34 --> 692.96]  get it anyway i refuse i refuse to participate in it so a big part of the the challenge i think for
[692.96 --> 701.34]  channel super fun for me is that the stakes like the the scale of stakes for you know fun like skit
[701.34 --> 708.22]  or prank or challenge videos on youtube has been thrown so far out of whack by both people who are
[708.22 --> 716.88]  just actually wild and willing to go to just unbelievable extremes for their content and people
[716.88 --> 725.38]  who fake the consequences right yeah so as a you know actual company with an employee agreement
[725.38 --> 734.16]  and work safe policies we can't really like we can't really compete but what we can do is we can be
[734.16 --> 740.88]  genuine about what we do yeah and so from my point of view unless i actually had to live with the haircut
[740.88 --> 747.04]  for some substantial period of time so but there's no stakes there's no there's no risk and if there's
[747.04 --> 751.96]  no risk there's no tension and what's what's the substantial period of time so like how long at least
[751.96 --> 757.94]  a few weeks before i touch it up yeah because i like are you worried about a decrease in in video views
[757.94 --> 765.30]  should you use old pictures of you as thumbnail shots did you just say to me i think your genuine
[765.30 --> 776.00]  you know your appeal may have gone down i have i ever told you the story about how i went from one
[776.00 --> 781.02]  hairdresser to another hairdresser because the first one was so bad i don't think so it sounds like a
[781.02 --> 787.02]  really compelling tale though please i i decided like oh i'll i'll go to like a nice hairdresser because
[787.02 --> 792.36]  i've always gone to like just really like very cheap ones so i'll go to a really nice hairdresser so i
[792.36 --> 798.44]  went there they did the haircut i wasn't really super i was already like yeah whatever but i
[798.44 --> 802.54]  realized as i was walking out that they never did the mirror thing so you can see the back of your head
[802.54 --> 808.24]  and as i was getting in the car i just brushed the back of my head and realized that she did literally
[808.24 --> 814.44]  nothing like it was super long so i just drove to my previous hairdresser and i was like yeah i'm not
[814.44 --> 819.36]  gonna like explain this but if you can like fix what happened that would be awesome
[819.36 --> 826.50]  that was sweet as part of this video the hairdresser that trained dennis actually
[826.50 --> 833.18]  said that whatever he screwed up i could go in and she would fix it but like i said yeah you gotta
[833.18 --> 837.38]  you gotta live with it for a certain amount of time for sure yes i i think two to three weeks is
[837.38 --> 843.18]  probably the right amount of time for me to have emo linus videos going up it's just so long
[843.18 --> 851.34]  it's very long it's very long you're being very mean though by the way and i think the community's
[851.34 --> 856.78]  with me here i don't know how to post polls but i'm sure someone will post it for me
[856.78 --> 864.74]  oh you can't do you need the main screen oh okay main screen turn on uh no oh okay okay
[864.74 --> 873.76]  luke too mean yes i gotta i gotta roast it if if this situation was swapped you'd be going in just
[873.76 --> 880.70]  as hard if not no way yes you know it i have never gone this hard at you about anything and that is
[880.70 --> 889.12]  that is the god's honest truth i don't believe that at all i'm gonna vote no on this you're gonna vote
[889.12 --> 898.40]  no yes okay flow plane whose side are you on here probably mine clearly luke's
[898.40 --> 907.12]  he's a rude mean guy and you guys are really not giving me the support that i feel that i deserve
[907.12 --> 912.90]  yeah you know what i don't even think he's a rude mean guy i think he's a nice guy who does rude mean
[912.90 --> 918.24]  things i'm not mad i'm just disappointed flow plane that's funny
[918.24 --> 925.82]  okay but enough with the uh enough with the the hair let's talk about youtube's new feature to
[925.82 --> 932.92]  combat comment spam we talked about this as recently as last week we did a dedicated video about it when
[932.92 --> 940.40]  theo joe released his tool that would basically do youtube's job for them through api calls to
[940.40 --> 951.28]  check comments scan them for obvious spam like tap to masturbate my like that kind of stuff well like
[951.28 --> 957.26]  honestly honestly yeah they're they're pretty blatant they're they're they're they're right
[957.26 --> 962.68]  there they're they're in there you know they got the just oh yeah and they got the the pornographic
[962.68 --> 968.92]  profile pictures and everything like it just honestly it doesn't seem it's either it's either that
[968.92 --> 974.82]  spectrum or it's the the the the fake channels like oh lioness tech tips is doing a giveaway for
[974.82 --> 979.56]  whatever yeah mr beast is doing a giveaway for whatever contact me on whatsapp and the thing is guys
[979.56 --> 984.44]  you gotta understand they wouldn't be doing it if it doesn't work and it's not constructive
[984.44 --> 991.64]  to blame the victim here we have to blame the scammers first and foremost and then second since
[991.64 --> 998.54]  you're not going to get the scammers to stop asking nicely you've got to blame the platform because
[998.54 --> 1007.28]  it didn't seem that complicated no offense theo joe nice guy do i think he's a world-class software
[1007.28 --> 1015.32]  developer no by his own admission he's a hobbyist who taught himself how to make a really cool tool
[1015.32 --> 1021.42]  make this tool yeah like he's an amateur guys literally by the definition i'm not trying to throw shade
[1021.42 --> 1029.44]  but he's an amateur and he was able to create a filter just by just just looking at the comments
[1029.44 --> 1034.24]  caring enough i've had youtube representatives ask me oh can you send examples no i can't send
[1034.24 --> 1041.30]  examples they're everywhere go on a video you should have just linked them youtube.com well yeah right
[1041.30 --> 1047.38]  because they're they're literally everywhere it's been so frustrating you know well
[1047.38 --> 1055.46]  masturbate's not a bad word it's the correct term okay for pleasuring yourself it's not a bad word
[1055.46 --> 1060.40]  i'll try to read the comments why i didn't beep it oh yeah yeah anyway i'll try to read the comments
[1060.40 --> 1065.42]  under wanshow and i'll see someone say something and i'll be and i'll see a reply and i'll be like oh
[1065.42 --> 1069.52]  i'm actually interested to see like what other people think about this statement and i click view
[1069.52 --> 1074.36]  reply and it's like go to my telegram it's like oh my god come claim your giveaway all you have to do
[1074.36 --> 1081.66]  is send me 80 for shipping i mean they must have been making bank the point is it's been going on
[1081.66 --> 1089.14]  for so long that i mean i understand i i felt this way myself i understand the community's frustration
[1089.14 --> 1094.94]  and the community sentiment that youtube clearly just doesn't care i mean the last conversation that
[1094.94 --> 1103.42]  i had with youtube about this was look guys at this point you guys need to do what you do and go way
[1103.42 --> 1110.58]  too far for a solution and work your way backwards rather than trying to implement quarter measures
[1110.58 --> 1118.36]  or half measures to try to stop the bleeding you need to just get that is it tourniquet tourniquet
[1118.36 --> 1123.48]  i guess tourniquet depends on the stop bleeding tourniquet would it in french would it be tourniquet
[1123.48 --> 1130.26]  i don't know q-u-e-t i think tourniquet oh pronunciation i have no idea anyway anyway
[1130.26 --> 1138.04]  tourniquet you need to just get that thing on that leg that is clearly off cinch it get the blood to
[1138.04 --> 1144.18]  stop like the suggestion i gave them was like look you guys need to stop allowing anything other than
[1144.18 --> 1151.66]  official language alpha numeric characters that's it that's it no special characters just block it
[1151.66 --> 1161.72]  all usernames message contents all of it figure out your and then start to slowly bring it back
[1161.72 --> 1168.98]  because this is clearly costing people a lot of money i might have an unpopular opinion here but i
[1168.98 --> 1172.50]  don't even know if you need to bring it back from why do you need special characters in the comments
[1172.50 --> 1178.22]  yeah i'm not trying to i'm not as long as there are no languages yeah that are that are screwed with
[1178.22 --> 1183.20]  no exactly but there's there's a huge amount of characters that are essentially only used for
[1183.20 --> 1189.82]  fooling people exactly only used for exploits or abuse like oh this this looks like an eye but it's
[1189.82 --> 1194.08]  not an eye it's some other thing or or whatever else like there's there's tons of that stuff so
[1194.08 --> 1201.76]  i don't know i just i i can't thorium says alphanumeric would lock out other languages sorry i i'm i'm using
[1201.76 --> 1206.04]  the term when that's why i specifically said like what you need for languages i mean they're alpha
[1206.04 --> 1211.88]  characters whatever those would be now i know that there could be some challenges associated with
[1211.88 --> 1219.12]  that like i don't know much about what's involved in typing in simplified or traditional chinese for
[1219.12 --> 1224.48]  example so there could be some misleading characters that you absolutely do need that you have to have
[1224.48 --> 1230.26]  yeah there definitely would be yeah but there are also ones that i really just don't think you need
[1230.26 --> 1240.78]  that badly yeah yeah yeah oh turn to k in french don't pronounce the t all right so there you go
[1240.78 --> 1249.66]  got it sure anyway they finally have a response the talking points from adam here are funny
[1249.66 --> 1253.32]  no we are not running a giveaway and we certainly aren't doing it through telegram
[1253.32 --> 1258.68]  yes thank you adam for that youtube has finally announced some updates to combat the spam and
[1258.68 --> 1264.06]  impersonation that has been rampant in the video comment section the updates listed are that they
[1264.06 --> 1271.50]  are no longer allowing channels to hide subscriber counts this is supposedly to make impersonation
[1271.50 --> 1276.42]  more difficult as much as i like the attempt and i do agree with what you were saying about how they
[1276.42 --> 1280.96]  need to go too far the first time i don't think this is going to make pretty much any difference at all
[1280.96 --> 1287.32]  well let's get through the rest of the changes sure okay uh they are improving comment uh creator
[1287.32 --> 1294.98]  comment moderation in the youtube studio uh increased strictness in the held for review tab is now
[1294.98 --> 1300.40]  available to all creators so it's a moderation level a new moderation level i have still seen
[1300.40 --> 1308.66]  significant spam creep through we have had access to that feature for some weeks okay yeah and they are
[1308.66 --> 1315.38]  limiting the type and frequency of special characters in channel names removing characters that can be easily
[1315.38 --> 1321.70]  misread for other letters from the allowed character set for example uh here i'm just going to share the
[1321.70 --> 1332.12]  doc here with you guys for a second whoop this is no longer allowed youtube that's a sort of that's a
[1332.12 --> 1342.14]  youtube of sorts welcome to my video site yen ooo whatever that t is oob youtube will then continue
[1342.14 --> 1347.30]  monitoring the situation and investigating other ways to remove spam okay i agree with you i don't think
[1347.30 --> 1354.36]  this goes far enough i don't understand why they don't just remove the special characters also from
[1354.36 --> 1362.98]  like body text why i don't i don't know it's a problem so just block it yeah just the channel name being
[1362.98 --> 1368.62]  special characters is probably not enough um there's also a lot of like to use mr beast as an example
[1368.62 --> 1374.58]  there's a lot of uh channels that he has that are derivatives of beast yeah i don't know what they
[1374.58 --> 1381.38]  are but yep so you could mislead someone by having like a beast plays with a zed instead of giveaways
[1381.38 --> 1388.86]  beast giveaways yeah yeah beast prizes that's exactly the sort of thing that these scammers
[1388.86 --> 1395.02]  literally spend their entire day brainstorming and coming up we figured that out in a few seconds
[1395.02 --> 1400.44]  they'll figure out much better things and the thing you guys have got to understand too is that
[1400.44 --> 1407.62]  these scam industries are not maybe what you think they are they're they're not just some
[1407.62 --> 1413.64]  you know person who can't get a job you know sitting alone in their basement coming up with clever
[1413.64 --> 1420.62]  scam there there are there are sizable enterprises dedicated with coming up dedicated to coming up with
[1420.62 --> 1427.56]  tens of hundreds of employees to rip people off online and the the really wild thing is that they
[1427.56 --> 1434.74]  can have employees that don't even realize that they work for scammers they're just developers working
[1434.74 --> 1442.30]  on features and they get a paycheck and they might not even realize it so these are these are sizable
[1442.30 --> 1448.36]  teams with significant resources there is a anywhere where there's a lot of money you can afford to hire
[1448.36 --> 1456.98]  talent so there are actually talented people working on this stuff and in youtube's defense it's a non-trivial
[1456.98 --> 1464.14]  problem to solve and you have to find a balance between site usability and blocking scammers and spammers
[1464.14 --> 1473.04]  the the yeah i i do think it's non-trivial because it's an arms race um though like theo joe's thing did
[1473.04 --> 1481.02]  work very well so and there's there's things that could have been done uh that were not super ultra
[1481.02 --> 1488.10]  high effort you know what i mean there's low-hanging fruit solutions that were not implemented and i don't
[1488.10 --> 1493.92]  honestly think that these measures are going to like solve it i don't think hiding subscriber counts is
[1493.92 --> 1498.60]  going to solve it when i bet you a lot of people aren't doing that level of due diligence anyways because
[1498.60 --> 1504.44]  if they were they would obviously be able to tell it wasn't the same channel um in in a variety of
[1504.44 --> 1508.28]  other ways because if you're looking at subscriber count there's you could look at the videos that are
[1508.28 --> 1514.58]  on the channel um like there's there's other ways it's also i mean you got to remember a huge part of
[1514.58 --> 1519.20]  scamming is social engineering right once you are once you've started a conversation with someone
[1519.20 --> 1527.00]  you can talk your way through a lot of problems yeah uh you could just say yeah we don't have any
[1527.00 --> 1531.86]  subscribers on this channel because it's just the one we use to contact people some low-level
[1531.86 --> 1539.82]  employee manages it instead of jimmy himself mr beast oh okay yeah i could see someone saying oh
[1539.82 --> 1545.38]  well that sounds plausible enough yeah and it does i don't think it goes far enough the uh the increased
[1545.38 --> 1550.26]  strictness feature is really the one that needs to be good yeah and it needs to be better like the rest
[1550.26 --> 1555.46]  of these are kind of whatever um increased strictness needs to be good it's clearly you're saying it's not
[1555.46 --> 1561.18]  working or not doing enough it is better okay but it's not solving it we have it enabled across all
[1561.18 --> 1569.34]  of our channels now and it is better but it is not perfect let's see let's see let's see how fast
[1569.34 --> 1576.46]  you can find a spam comment on the most recent ldt upload that one might be a little challenging just
[1576.46 --> 1582.62]  because it is from yesterday so we don't upload on friday do they like take a while to
[1582.62 --> 1587.64]  well i also don't know if we're still running the theo joe script
[1587.64 --> 1595.10]  if we are that almost certainly would have found it oh never mind i found something already okay i
[1595.10 --> 1601.78]  take it back so here's how long it took me i popped open the comments uh video comments i haven't
[1601.78 --> 1607.10]  responded this filter is enabled by default i don't know why so i was scrolling down looking this is all
[1607.10 --> 1612.52]  42 minutes ago one of the things that youtube employees have pointed out to me in the past is that
[1612.52 --> 1617.26]  right in the minutes after a video goes live there can be a lot of spam because the bots will be
[1617.26 --> 1622.26]  triggered by a video going live and they will post all their crappy spam right in those first few
[1622.26 --> 1629.54]  minutes and then they're the thumbs up and thumbs down are ways that the community can help to
[1629.54 --> 1635.44]  moderate the comment section making it so that those comments might still be there but only a creator
[1635.44 --> 1640.40]  would normally see them because as a creator the way that i consume comments is probably very different
[1640.40 --> 1645.24]  from the way that you would consume comments i look at them in chronological order because i don't want
[1645.24 --> 1649.76]  to miss things and or i want to make sure well mostly i don't want to miss things i want to see
[1649.76 --> 1655.40]  everything not just what got the most up votes so i will look through the whole feed so i will see all
[1655.40 --> 1660.80]  that crap but if i were to actually look at it in the public view sorted by by best or whatever the
[1660.80 --> 1666.68]  default sorting is top i i wouldn't i wouldn't really see it personally i just like the thumbs up and
[1666.68 --> 1672.60]  thumbs down to be public again um like they are on reddit which is i mean it's got its own toxicity but
[1672.60 --> 1680.98]  at least has very little spam from my experience except in very very like small threads on really
[1680.98 --> 1685.56]  obscure communities you'll find spam there but any reasonably moderated community like human moderation
[1685.56 --> 1692.28]  just kind of seems to be the answer anyway the point is i'm on this video um and this is from quite
[1692.28 --> 1700.00]  recent we managed to have to go as far oh um first of all yeah this definitely rest in peace techno
[1700.00 --> 1705.96]  blade oh did you see that have you watched the video i did it's heartbreaking that's yeah have you
[1705.96 --> 1714.42]  seen the merch i i'm planning to buy myself the uh limited edition um uh the the the two-sided one i
[1714.42 --> 1720.16]  forget exactly what the graphics are but i was thinking about getting the gg easy uh here we go
[1720.16 --> 1725.66]  from three hours ago this is a video that went up yesterday uh here's a reply so this is basically
[1725.66 --> 1731.68]  the chief tech whatever hello fan telegram linus tech tips official thank you for watching
[1731.68 --> 1736.92]  congratulations you've won a price i wonder if that's an intentional typo because they've done
[1736.92 --> 1744.58]  it twice here and they've put a little emoji next to it of a gift so it's amazing what the human brain
[1744.58 --> 1748.86]  can do when when you're reading like you can have the first what is it the first letter and the last
[1748.86 --> 1752.98]  letter correct and then everything else random and you will still be able to read the word
[1752.98 --> 1760.86]  like easily it's pretty crazy so stuff like that is almost certainly intentional because you will
[1760.86 --> 1766.30]  see this emoji gloss over it probably not even notice that it's a typo but that's probably how
[1766.30 --> 1770.50]  they're getting around this particular filter and the thing is i could go in i could put in text
[1770.50 --> 1774.76]  filters i could see this i could go okay well let's not allow the word prize right in our in our
[1774.76 --> 1779.68]  comments but clearly uh youtube the fact that they're doing this means that youtube is already
[1779.68 --> 1787.34]  responding to the word prize in comments i can't block the word price but i don't i mean again am i
[1787.34 --> 1791.64]  just being am i just hating on people's personal expression when i say i don't really understand why
[1791.64 --> 1798.48]  we need emojis and i think emojis i think emojis are fine i don't think that really matters i i have
[1798.48 --> 1807.64]  do we need them uh if it's a question of user safety and emojis i'd like to see them implemented
[1807.64 --> 1812.88]  again there's a lot of things in life where if you if you try if you put safety as the paramount
[1812.88 --> 1818.14]  thing in the equation then we just don't ever do anything um that's literally the definition like
[1818.14 --> 1822.00]  this is why we can't have nice things it's basically what you're saying but and i have no
[1822.00 --> 1828.48]  problem with them re-implementing it but they need to do something now something i have i have a
[1828.48 --> 1834.28]  message from telegram line of spectives official as well um on my screen i found on a i believe a
[1834.28 --> 1840.92]  different video and it says something huge for you text me to claim there's no emojis not needed
[1840.92 --> 1847.94]  and you gotta understand too i actually moderate our comments when i see these guys when i'm just
[1847.94 --> 1854.40]  doom scrolling comments on the can i will block user from channel which is a much more useful tool
[1854.40 --> 1858.46]  than it used to be i've man i've complained about it so much the fact that there isn't a single button
[1858.46 --> 1865.14]  still for years years i've been asking for a single button i want to report spam delete the comment and
[1865.14 --> 1873.44]  block the user from the channel one button for years i've had to choose choose a function no
[1873.44 --> 1883.22]  no no no now block user from channel does now at least delete that comment but i don't know if it
[1883.22 --> 1891.36]  reports it to youtube as spam because it should only take a handful of spam reports to flag a review
[1891.36 --> 1902.18]  okay is this spam yes nuked you do have to be careful with uh so flag review yes auto banning is
[1902.18 --> 1908.00]  is spooky i understand that as a weapon people will abuse it absolutely they will abuse it but
[1908.00 --> 1912.62]  that's why you have to review it yeah no yeah no for sure and you said it the right way i have another
[1912.62 --> 1920.42]  one telegram line of sex tips official one they added a number it's a different channel um and it's
[1920.42 --> 1926.66]  essentially the same thing they're doing the price with the with the gift emoji and just to just to
[1926.66 --> 1933.16]  validate that we do in fact have this setting enabled hopefully i'm not going to show you guys
[1933.16 --> 1941.56]  anything i wouldn't too horrible in the dashboard here i should be fine um defaults hmm i don't
[1941.56 --> 1951.14]  actually is it channel guidelines welcome message okay oh example guidelines uh well here here's a good
[1951.14 --> 1957.54]  guideline no self-promotion or spam uh okay i actually don't know where in the dashboard this
[1957.54 --> 1967.48]  is i'm gonna go ahead and block what am i looking for here defaults ah yes here we go okay so verified
[1967.48 --> 1976.18]  this is in fact this is in fact enabled and yet discard changes well i didn't make any changes smart
[1976.18 --> 1982.42]  okay and yet here we are so i found a block of them here from about three hours ago where this
[1982.42 --> 1989.44]  linus tech tips official telegram account is just replying to people and i can go in and i can hide
[1989.44 --> 1997.90]  user from channel still can't report it at the same time and so this one probably won't be there anymore
[1997.90 --> 2006.04]  oh that's so stupid oh i hate man inconsistent ui stuff drives me crazy every other site on the
[2006.04 --> 2012.10]  entire internet you click the time stamp and it will load the page with that comment
[2012.10 --> 2020.74]  no i guess i'll click here sure why not let's do it differently because we're just different
[2020.74 --> 2030.98]  this appears to still be here so what just happened then uh we do know that there's a like is that the
[2030.98 --> 2037.32]  exact one because we found linus tech tips official one as well so is there like a a special character
[2037.32 --> 2043.02]  these all appear to be from the same one telegram linus tech tips official i don't remember which one
[2043.02 --> 2050.74]  i removed but let's see is this one still here and it's just you know at the at the volume yeah this
[2050.74 --> 2055.62]  appears to still be here at the volume of comments that there are on a channel our size
[2055.62 --> 2060.80]  and you'll see it on evergreen content in particular it'll be on the brand new videos that
[2060.80 --> 2067.94]  were just uploaded and the old ones that still get a lot of views you can't it's not manageable for us
[2067.94 --> 2072.76]  to moderate this stuff manually unless there are tools like if the community could report it to us
[2072.76 --> 2077.56]  and it was as simple as going through a daily report being like yes yes yes yes no yes no no yes no
[2077.56 --> 2083.70]  yes no right like that's that's manageable but we can't go digging for it it's absurd
[2083.70 --> 2092.22]  so anyway this is all the evidence that i need night pause and flowplane chat said it's easier to
[2092.22 --> 2097.04]  kill a channel by using by falsely i'm adding some things here it's easier to kill a channel by
[2097.04 --> 2104.26]  falsely using dmca than it is to get rid of spam well there's been some there's been some controversies
[2104.26 --> 2110.86]  i haven't had the time unfortunately to look into some of the recent controversies in enough depth to
[2110.86 --> 2117.58]  talk about them oh here's another one telegram me at official linus sebastian all right you know what
[2117.58 --> 2118.24]  i will
[2118.24 --> 2124.80]  see if you just have like a cordial conversation with them yeah why don't we just uh why don't we
[2124.80 --> 2131.50]  just why don't we just have a chat well why don't we have a little chat you should you should call it
[2131.50 --> 2140.14]  oh is your telegram tied your phone number oh hold on i've got my i've got my drug dealer phone
[2140.14 --> 2142.74]  ah very nice very good
[2142.74 --> 2151.68]  i don't think it's charged though crap usbc my iphone's not charged oh um may i please have a
[2151.68 --> 2158.84]  lightning charger thanks all right okay well we move on in the meantime yeah let's move on let's move on
[2158.84 --> 2163.12]  in the meantime hold on i'm just gonna uh i'm just gonna hide this user from the channel
[2163.12 --> 2170.56]  so yeah this this is the this is it's clear that what they're doing is not enough my challenge to
[2170.56 --> 2182.48]  youtube go nuclear go nuclear get rid of it slowly re-implement because that's the only way
[2182.48 --> 2190.92]  change one variable at a time c okay does this and and and the thing is is you might say oh well
[2190.92 --> 2197.18]  that's that's too much it's too far well okay then we'll know soon enough won't we because there
[2197.18 --> 2202.66]  will be zero spam or maybe there won't be because that's the other outcome maybe they'll still be able
[2202.66 --> 2207.58]  to get around it maybe it turns out the nuclear option actually isn't even enough and they need to
[2207.58 --> 2212.50]  do more but we won't know unless we actually do something and i don't think they've i don't think
[2212.50 --> 2221.28]  they've done enough it's starting to look like everywhere look at this look at this just every single
[2221.28 --> 2226.14]  comment and so whenever a youtube employee asks me oh can you please send me an example like look
[2226.14 --> 2232.28]  i don't want to be disrespectful use your own website for seconds do you even use the platform
[2232.28 --> 2240.06]  if you haven't experienced this spam and you haven't witnessed it being a problem the only
[2240.06 --> 2248.84]  conclusion i can come to is that you don't even use youtube like i don't know sometimes i get i get very
[2248.84 --> 2260.18]  i may have a reputation for getting quite fired up by things when i engage with youtube employees
[2260.18 --> 2268.84]  and i feel bad about that i legitimately do i actually i i went off on here's another one here's
[2268.84 --> 2275.62]  a freaking another one i'm not even trying to look for them here it is same video how about we make them
[2275.62 --> 2283.00]  a comment moderator yeah for sure that would be good so it's so frustrating so i i went off on someone
[2283.00 --> 2289.66]  that as far as my knowledge goes is fairly influential in the mobile creator studio app
[2289.66 --> 2296.38]  because oh you have no issues with that at all because there have been a number of changes made
[2296.38 --> 2303.24]  that i whether this individual had any influence over them or not honestly it's hard to say because
[2303.24 --> 2310.82]  a lot of the a lot of the problems at youtube seem to be coming from uh from somewhere higher
[2310.82 --> 2318.92]  is is all i'll say i but i i basically like lost it i was sitting here going okay i spent a bunch
[2318.92 --> 2325.54]  of time talking to you about this laying out things that would be useful um like period over period
[2325.54 --> 2329.96]  comparisons is something that used to be in the mobile creator studio app so i could easily see this
[2329.96 --> 2335.66]  month over last month for example instead they replaced it with this compared to your typical
[2335.66 --> 2342.48]  performance uh line so it shows kind of what your typical range is for performance and then
[2342.48 --> 2351.22]  where you were relative to that the problem for me is that i've experienced the shortcomings of the
[2351.22 --> 2357.30]  typical performance metric typical performance might look at some kind of rolling average of your
[2357.30 --> 2362.36]  last three or your last six months or something along those lines and if you were at the low end of your
[2362.36 --> 2371.26]  typical performance six months in a row guess what just happened your channel got way smaller and
[2371.26 --> 2377.02]  you've got this little green check check mark in your in your dashboard that says everything is okay
[2377.02 --> 2386.82]  no it's not okay looking at month over month is the way that any functional business operates
[2386.82 --> 2391.44]  so you will look at you'll look at period over period you'll look at this period year over year
[2391.44 --> 2399.48]  that's how you monitor trends you don't monitor trends by going oh compared to typical what is
[2399.48 --> 2404.82]  typical i mean if okay if you want to have a section of the dashboard where i can define typical
[2404.82 --> 2410.24]  where i can say typical is whatever my last 28 days was i still don't think that's like well no it's
[2410.24 --> 2414.56]  obviously it's a stupid workaround to a problem that should have never existed anyway the point is
[2414.56 --> 2424.46]  i absolutely went off on this person i felt i felt terrible because i i know i know deep down that
[2424.46 --> 2430.74]  many of these changes probably nothing to do with this individual and they were they were either
[2430.74 --> 2436.84]  directives or just sort of general general directions that youtube is going like for example there's
[2436.84 --> 2443.72]  far reduced visibility for dislikes yeah in the creator studio app and it's it's really frustrating
[2443.72 --> 2449.80]  because okay my workaround for this this this is a really good one okay so let's go look at this
[2449.80 --> 2455.70]  it used to be that i could see like dislike ratio right here uh so it was just like right when you
[2455.70 --> 2460.00]  click on a video metric of a video it would be like right there because right after i publish that's
[2460.00 --> 2465.26]  one of the first things i look at okay do people even like this thing and because i'm comparing apples to
[2465.26 --> 2471.24]  apples my own channel that uploads every day to my own channel uploading again today it's just it's a
[2471.24 --> 2478.14]  really quick and easy litmus test oh well they moved it well thanks for that now i get to click go to video
[2478.14 --> 2485.94]  analytics where it is conveniently not on the first page below the full i get to go click engagement and
[2485.94 --> 2492.34]  then finally i can see a ratio but not absolute values i can only see a percentage now what do you what
[2492.34 --> 2498.78]  do you notice about this ratio this is a video that was published yesterday seems pretty high
[2498.78 --> 2509.00]  well that's channel average okay where's the actual ratio it says na doesn't it oh that's actually
[2509.00 --> 2516.10]  oh okay i was reading it completely wrong okay it takes there's a delay for it to populate now my
[2516.10 --> 2522.58]  workaround for this used to be that i could just that i could click the that i could click the go to
[2522.58 --> 2531.26]  youtube icon in the creator studio app in order to see f***ing analytics right and then i could go view
[2531.26 --> 2539.00]  it on the actual youtube app but guess what i can only view that if i'm logged in as that channel
[2539.00 --> 2546.96]  because i can't see f***ing dislikes anymore and and you might think it's not an inconvenience to be
[2546.96 --> 2551.58]  logged in as the actual channel because clearly i was in the creator studio but because we have multiple
[2551.58 --> 2557.16]  channels we actually have a multi-channel management tool where i am logged in as my work account
[2557.16 --> 2564.98]  i have no way on my phone to see the like dislike ratio of this video we uploaded yesterday this is
[2564.98 --> 2571.76]  absolutely f***ing basic information that i need to do a f***ing job
[2571.76 --> 2575.70]  i love how when you're like i went too far
[2575.70 --> 2581.58]  rant number three baby let's go
[2581.58 --> 2585.56]  the point is that i shouldn't have targeted an individual
[2585.56 --> 2591.64]  i shouldn't have gone off on an individual now in fairness i didn't i didn't call names
[2591.64 --> 2598.80]  like it wasn't like that but i i i went after these problems in a way that made it seem as though
[2598.80 --> 2604.22]  i thought that they could immediately fix them and i i clearly i understand that they can't
[2604.22 --> 2611.14]  it's just it's very frustrating you know they're sitting there not solving real problems breaking
[2611.14 --> 2619.10]  solutions that i already had to my problems like i i just i i don't know how to i don't know how to
[2619.10 --> 2624.06]  i don't know how to talk about it anymore because i've asked nicely
[2624.06 --> 2630.84]  i've been happy to hear about the that they plan to do better for hdr
[2630.84 --> 2637.50]  sure but i have often thought that they have been going in very weird directions developmental wise
[2637.50 --> 2646.36]  um i've just just like working on really odd things taking features away instead of adding features
[2646.36 --> 2650.96]  like not not doing things that you would hope for a company to do if you wanted to see that company
[2650.96 --> 2655.72]  grow you know what i mean it seems like they're trying to control their current user base more than
[2655.72 --> 2659.90]  they are trying to grow their user base that might be because they think their user base is the entire
[2659.90 --> 2665.26]  world well they're trying to go somewhat correct about that and they are trying to grow their user base but it's
[2665.26 --> 2671.32]  through tools like shorts for example it's not through necessarily i don't know i don't even
[2671.32 --> 2675.64]  know what to call this i mean how is it even possible that in the analytics drop down there's
[2675.64 --> 2681.60]  no custom date range how's it even possible in the year 2022 that's such a like crazy list to go
[2681.60 --> 2687.62]  through we've got seven days 28 days 90 days 365 days lifetime june may april march february january
[2687.62 --> 2693.48]  december 2021 november 2021 october 2021 september 2021 august 2021 and july 2021 no custom
[2693.48 --> 2698.74]  why would i ever want to see a custom date range now as i recall and i'm a little rusty on this
[2698.74 --> 2704.02]  because it's been a while since they completely up the mobile creator studio little rusty on this one
[2704.02 --> 2709.16]  but i believe there used to be a way for me to just drag it there definitely was on desktop which
[2709.16 --> 2714.04]  was amazing because on the desktop one there was even a little bar below where you could see like a
[2714.04 --> 2718.18]  much larger time period oh yeah and then you could take your highlighted period and you could move it and
[2718.18 --> 2721.86]  do like a quick like okay what if i want to see one year over one year and you could get and all the
[2721.86 --> 2725.82]  analytics would just like immediately there's a bump here what was that yeah you could just go look
[2725.82 --> 2730.66]  at it it's very easy and and it would it would update everything below it like what the top viewed
[2730.66 --> 2735.86]  videos in that time it was like oh it was amazing and then clamping down on social blade too well yeah
[2735.86 --> 2743.10]  i i have i have sent yet another polite request for them to give social blade proper api access again
[2743.10 --> 2748.60]  so they can store the data for longer than two years uh it's just it just sucks because these are these
[2748.60 --> 2754.60]  are tools that we use to to do our jobs right and you know i get it maybe maybe you don't care about
[2754.60 --> 2761.26]  me doing a better job of making videos but gosh darn it you probably should oh my god that's
[2761.26 --> 2767.90]  probably should indeed sort of fundamental you know
[2768.78 --> 2773.86]  i'm going to find a type c port yeah no i got this okay i gotta charge up my iphone
[2773.86 --> 2783.10]  sorry i mentioned it in should we move on yeah i i guess so i i i'm i'm done i'm these are all
[2783.10 --> 2789.98]  conversations that i've had before and instead of just no offense shouting into a vacuum because
[2789.98 --> 2795.94]  there's nothing you guys can do to fix it i've had these conversations with actual people who work
[2795.94 --> 2802.66]  on these actual tools and it's still been ineffective and one of the really frustrating things has been that
[2802.66 --> 2808.06]  you know how we did a video recently talking about the deplorable state of hdr on youtube
[2808.06 --> 2814.90]  so i i already talked to you about how fires have been been lit yeah that's cool and and now i'm
[2814.90 --> 2822.50]  hearing it from third parties that fires have been lit over there cool sort of because it shouldn't
[2822.50 --> 2830.42]  take that it shouldn't i shouldn't have to make a video i shouldn't have to i should say hey i'm a
[2830.42 --> 2836.08]  content creator on your platform i'd like to think a pretty successful one here i'm telling you i'm
[2836.08 --> 2842.80]  telling you what i need these are my tools you actually don't use them no offense you don't use
[2842.80 --> 2849.78]  them like talking to a youtube employee it it's like it's like when i was at ncix and the the
[2849.78 --> 2855.98]  president would have changes made to the product management team's tools and he and the developers
[2855.98 --> 2860.48]  would get together and have a meeting about how they should work and then we'd get them and we're
[2860.48 --> 2866.04]  going hey there's extra clicks and you increase the loading time so that you can add this extra
[2866.04 --> 2871.80]  measure that i don't even use literally none of us use it and then you won't revert it because now
[2871.80 --> 2875.60]  you've spent a bunch you got this sunk cost fallacy nonsense going on you spend a bunch of
[2875.60 --> 2880.90]  money developing this feature no we don't want it it actually made it worse you have to talk to
[2880.90 --> 2888.34]  people who actually use the tools i mean one of the things i've been saying about the mobile creator
[2888.34 --> 2896.48]  studio app for the longest time is it should be a one-stop shop for creation i should not have to use
[2896.48 --> 2902.96]  the player app to upload a video for example yeah i should not have to use the player app
[2902.96 --> 2912.94]  to look at the comments on a community post for example and yet i do why do i have to do that
[2912.94 --> 2918.00]  why are they not developing that i would even see it more acceptable if it like didn't work the other
[2918.00 --> 2922.28]  way around like if you were in the studio app and you wanted to watch a video and it like launched it
[2922.28 --> 2926.84]  in the player app i'd be totally fine with that but you should be able to do okay i didn't even know
[2926.84 --> 2931.82]  but you should be able to do all of the creation and like analytic viewing and everything yeah where
[2931.82 --> 2936.48]  are my better like comment moderation tools yeah that should be in there in here yeah like it's
[2936.48 --> 2945.00]  just it's infuriating like why can't i why can't i manage who my moderators are in here
[2945.00 --> 2951.30]  because apparently we need some apparently there's been some unruly stuff in in youtube chat today but
[2951.30 --> 2958.04]  i have no way to control that personally so oh my god here's another one telegram me at linus
[2958.04 --> 2964.06]  tech tips 20 yeah it's not working guys it's not good enough and you should have known that
[2964.06 --> 2969.70]  immediately oh yeah because you've already been trialing these features on channels like mine
[2969.70 --> 2976.02]  where it's clearly not working why do i have to be the one to spell this out maybe you should hire me
[2976.02 --> 2981.26]  as an executive so i can come in and have an ounce of common sense hmm if this isn't working in our
[2981.26 --> 2987.90]  limited trial maybe it's not good enough maybe to determine if it's working or not all i have to do
[2987.90 --> 2995.28]  is go look at a video that that is the weirdest part like when the fact that they asked you for
[2995.28 --> 3001.06]  an example is actually astonishing because you can you can go anywhere on youtube and they're just
[3001.06 --> 3008.66]  all over the place so i don't know it's very odd let's move on i was gonna say you done okay i think
[3008.66 --> 3017.62]  we should mention that there's new stuff in the store thanks for watching thanks for you can go
[3017.62 --> 3021.96]  to hell but like i can't do this all day no
[3021.96 --> 3029.04]  what are we talking about new stuff in the store oh new stuff on the store okay let's talk about cool
[3029.04 --> 3036.08]  stuff for a change lttstore.com oh man have we ever got some stuff for you guys it's summer
[3036.08 --> 3044.56]  suns out calves legs out calves out calves out yeah man my legs are pale knees out but that that's
[3044.56 --> 3050.80]  okay don't worry our shorts will not make your legs look as pale as as mine they've got waterproof
[3050.80 --> 3059.36]  zippers because that's just how we roll ykk baby they're made out of the same 100 cotton french terry
[3059.36 --> 3066.00]  fabric as our sweatpants i i don't know if i'm allowed to say this as adam's employer but i'd say
[3066.00 --> 3073.68]  they complement the assets oh in my in my humble opinion okay my humble opinion we've got sizes from
[3073.68 --> 3079.12]  small all the way to 3xl don't forget that oh channeling my inner muscle man don't forget you can
[3079.12 --> 3083.54]  mouse over the picture oh not all of them apparently some of them are oh yeah yep you can mouse over the
[3083.54 --> 3089.72]  picture you can see who modeled them what size they're wearing that's a really really cool feature
[3089.72 --> 3094.64]  uh we love zipper pockets around here good place is it my butt that's my butt let's go is that your
[3094.64 --> 3097.80]  butt i think so oh nice butt nice nice butt where you fret
[3097.80 --> 3109.22]  it's not the greatest pickup line um while you're at it with your shorts we've got two
[3109.22 --> 3115.72]  two printed hoodies that i believe you've got one more week to order the hard drive hoodie please do
[3115.72 --> 3119.76]  not use this graphic it is not representative this one there we go we should make that the default
[3119.76 --> 3127.46]  graphic for it it looks absolutely flippin amazing in person the exploded hard drive hoodie as well as
[3127.46 --> 3134.36]  we're doing a reprint of the processor hoodie which also gets a ton of comments this one looks amazing
[3134.36 --> 3140.84]  absolutely amazing so you guys can check those out really good reviews great hoodie glad i got a size
[3140.84 --> 3146.70]  up oh import document declared so i was charged tax we review just so you guys know we review all low star
[3146.70 --> 3151.82]  reviews and make sure we get in touch with people by the way we did come up with a plan for what to do
[3151.82 --> 3157.10]  about oh i didn't get my order i didn't get my order like uh like one star reviews when it was just
[3157.10 --> 3163.24]  like lost in the mail there's nothing we can do about that um uh what what was what did we settle on
[3163.24 --> 3170.04]  oh yeah yeah we're gonna just do a respond feature but it's gonna take some time oh yeah
[3170.04 --> 3175.54]  right yeah yeah yeah so we'll just um i was not sure if there was like some customer service back
[3175.54 --> 3179.42]  and stuff you're talking about or whatever but yeah in regards to the reviews it's just also i think
[3179.42 --> 3183.62]  there may have that that exists by the way oh we just have to implement it or what you just have to
[3183.62 --> 3192.76]  do it oh all right well i will uh yeah i'll have to talk to um nick about that you may not know how
[3192.76 --> 3198.32]  by the way i just want to clarify something when i was talking about editing the reviews before i
[3198.32 --> 3202.92]  think there was a bit of a miscommunication because the way that okay for example i've edited
[3202.92 --> 3207.72]  people's posts on the forum before because i'm an admin and i have that power sometimes i do it to
[3207.72 --> 3213.56]  troll people but i would never make it seem as though the words came from that person so the way that i
[3213.56 --> 3220.40]  meant was in like old school forum style so their post would be there unedited and then it would say
[3220.40 --> 3229.06]  edit bold response response from linus tech tips team this commenter said that we could say that we
[3229.06 --> 3233.92]  got this resolved and here's how we did it like it would be a response so essentially the response
[3233.92 --> 3238.12]  thing was exactly what i was asking for i think if there yeah i just am dumb and didn't come up with
[3238.12 --> 3243.32]  that right well it exists so yeah so anyway i just wanted to clarify that because there were some
[3243.32 --> 3248.08]  i saw i saw some comments on the forum and on twitter like man linus is really getting into like
[3248.08 --> 3254.62]  shady business practice like whoa whoa whoa whoa i'm not talking making it seem as though someone
[3254.62 --> 3259.02]  said something they didn't people are yeah people are a little bit less cool with the with the
[3259.02 --> 3267.18]  comment editing stuff that uh give me one quick second oh oh okay apparently nick didn't know yeah
[3267.18 --> 3271.52]  oh okay you can yeah you can reply it's a thing whatever i don't know people are less cool with the
[3271.52 --> 3277.66]  comment uh yeah yeah so like back in old school forum days that was standard and accepted but i think
[3277.66 --> 3284.06]  i think you can't do that on like reddit so now it's like super weird oh to say like edit blah blah
[3284.06 --> 3289.42]  whatever else really because i because that's not that's not like a new internet thing but that's the
[3289.42 --> 3297.32]  more transparent way to do it no i think it'd be a reply a reply but then it might not be seen
[3297.32 --> 3303.46]  whereas like i'm not talking about editing the original because i mean i i believe in transparency
[3303.46 --> 3309.92]  so i'm talking like you would leave the original post no i know i know it's it's just if you it's a it's
[3309.92 --> 3316.32]  a line that can be crossed that now there could be suspicion of whether or not you are editing parts of
[3316.32 --> 3321.78]  the original post of anything right i guess so but i don't know oh apparently no you can self-edit on
[3321.78 --> 3328.74]  reddit no you can self-edit you can't edit other people's yeah okay okay okay okay yeah sure
[3328.74 --> 3337.80]  you can self-edit on reddit um also there's the there's the jerry rig razor knife uh yeah so this
[3337.80 --> 3345.12]  is interesting we got in touch with zach jerry rig everything and we were all like hey we've got
[3345.12 --> 3355.66]  these giant desk pads uh they're so big that it turns out um this particular one is maybe makes
[3355.66 --> 3362.84]  more sense as a desk pad as four desk pads so i believe the one we're running the promo on is the
[3362.84 --> 3374.36]  one uh 1.2 meter by 700 centimeter desk pad uh this boy this boy right here if you pick up one of these
[3374.36 --> 3382.46]  so uh this one right here let's go ahead and add that to cart i believe it applies automatically bonus
[3382.46 --> 3390.60]  nope i have no idea how this works oh oh my gosh did we actually do it this way okay apparently
[3390.60 --> 3404.04]  we just carry the jerry rig racer knife now so if you add the giant desk pad and a jerry rig
[3404.04 --> 3411.42]  knife to your cart you will get your jerry rig knife for zero dollars you can use it to cut up your
[3411.42 --> 3418.20]  desk pad into four desk into four mouse pads and you will also get a jerry rig knife so we reached
[3418.20 --> 3423.62]  out to zach we were like hey we've got this giant desk pad uh we think you know for some people it
[3423.62 --> 3430.98]  might make sense as four mouse pads but they might not have a knife do you have a knife do you have
[3430.98 --> 3437.74]  hundreds of knives could we maybe buy hundreds of knives and he was like i got you but balder
[3437.74 --> 3444.92]  it was like that but much balder nice and musclier i mean you know how zach is right yeah uh so that's
[3444.92 --> 3453.28]  it that's the promo add the 1200 by 700 millimeter northern lights desk pad to your cart add the jerry
[3453.28 --> 3459.66]  rig knife to your cart in whatever color you like and you will get the knife for zero dollars and
[3459.66 --> 3464.88]  four mouse pads um you should also pick up some other stuff that we actually make money on please
[3464.88 --> 3472.74]  that would be terrific how about a water bottle or the new shorts or one of the one of the hoodies
[3472.74 --> 3479.12]  the shorts are nice yeah i've stoked about the shorts actually uh oh wait a second did we launch the
[3479.12 --> 3486.44]  women's sweat shorts as well oh cool uh we also have the women's one so we have the unisex ones and the
[3486.44 --> 3494.32]  women's ones designed for all the relaxed fits oh wow look at that can i just say massive shout out
[3494.32 --> 3500.82]  to our staff for being such good sports about like modeling the merch like we get contributions
[3500.82 --> 3508.44]  across the across every sort of spectrum that you could possibly think of and i think it gives us
[3508.44 --> 3515.56]  a really cool vibe there's so much more variety in our merch pictures they're real people instead of
[3515.56 --> 3521.34]  yeah it's not like one person who took a photo with a green screen shirt one time yeah it's used on like
[3521.34 --> 3529.24]  every single product ever yeah it's it's nice it's nice as someone who gets kind of frustrated by the
[3529.24 --> 3536.18]  concept of clothes shopping online because it's like how the heck is this gonna fit me ever um it's nice to be
[3536.18 --> 3540.36]  able to see quite a range of like body sizes and types so i can figure out actually how something
[3540.36 --> 3544.44]  might fit me yeah foos king zero says i wouldn't model unless i was paid i mean to be clear they're
[3544.44 --> 3550.52]  all paid they're paid but but modeling the merch is not part of their regular job duties it's something
[3550.52 --> 3556.54]  that people just do because i mean our shooters do make it kind of fun actually yeah you kind of you
[3556.54 --> 3560.36]  kind of feel like you do like random stuff all the time kind of feel like a model you know it's
[3560.36 --> 3565.90]  yeah it's pretty fun yeah it was a good shoot shorts was a good shoot glad to hear it did you shoot
[3565.90 --> 3572.86]  with oh uh is our i think graphic designer off probation yet i don't believe so i was gonna
[3572.86 --> 3580.28]  say i think it's still a pro bo okay cool let's go ahead and jump into our next topic shall we
[3580.28 --> 3585.94]  less cool news oh we should do some merch messages oh sponsors right okay well luke you go first
[3585.94 --> 3590.72]  oh man well should we should we talk about i'm gonna highlight it it's above you can scroll up
[3590.72 --> 3595.98]  oh let's scroll up a bunch i thought you were higher than you were oh yeah up a little bit oh
[3595.98 --> 3601.90]  down a little bit yeah there oh yeah let's uh we did allude probably talk about it more specifically
[3601.90 --> 3611.14]  why don't you run through it um techno blade has died at 23 years old 23 the my yeah crazy the
[3611.14 --> 3615.64]  minecraft community has gathered to remember techno blade a youtuber with 11.9 million subs
[3615.64 --> 3620.34]  who died at the age of 23 after announcing he'd been diagnosed with cancer in his right arm
[3620.34 --> 3627.54]  last year uh while sick he wrote a farewell letter uh which was read by his dad in a youtube video to
[3627.54 --> 3634.80]  his channel yesterday uh titled so long nerds which remains at number one on youtube's trending page
[3634.80 --> 3643.62]  in the video techno blade reveals um that his name is alex not dave which i think actually so funny
[3643.62 --> 3649.26]  they they pranked you gotta watch the video because there's a lot of other just you gotta watch the
[3649.26 --> 3654.48]  video uh but they they pranked their audience by making them think that his name was uh uh dave
[3654.48 --> 3661.06]  he made it seem like they leave accidentally was leaked it reminded me a lot of trying to essentially
[3661.06 --> 3665.82]  like hide my address when i used to live in the basement suite the type same type of tactics is yeah
[3665.82 --> 3672.10]  i don't know um friend and co-streamer tommy in it posted a minecraft screenshot of an in-game note
[3672.10 --> 3678.10]  left by techno blade uh saying that having abolished all governments of men i have ascended to heaven
[3678.10 --> 3685.02]  to take on the kingdom of god which is just pretty epic um and hours after his death his family
[3685.02 --> 3692.78]  released planned merch um with the portion of the proceeds will be going to the sarcoma which i believe
[3692.78 --> 3698.78]  is the type of cancer that he had um sarcoma foundation of america um and the planned merch is all
[3698.78 --> 3709.02]  like it's uh yeah like gg easy good game um yeah i've got it up now yeah so yeah this is the one i
[3709.02 --> 3714.54]  like the so long nerds one so long nerds that one's really good but yeah consider checking it out um
[3714.54 --> 3718.94]  portion of the proceeds going to a good place and a portion of the proceeds is going to go to
[3718.94 --> 3726.92]  i'm assuming to to help his family which is also a good thing so yeah watch the video too yeah for
[3726.92 --> 3732.02]  sure i mean that's that's one of the ways that you can you can support them in this time you know
[3732.02 --> 3740.78]  watch the video leave a comment um you know that was something that um affected my family more than
[3740.78 --> 3748.32]  and actually me more than i realized it would uh when my grandpa passed um the one that we did the
[3748.32 --> 3756.68]  grandpa meets google video with uh there were many members of my family that just kind of sat and uh
[3756.68 --> 3764.80]  and read the comments just just the outpouring of of good vibes from the community um and it was just
[3764.80 --> 3770.80]  it was it was very helpful for them you know they just sat thought of him sat and you know read these
[3770.80 --> 3777.54]  positive these positive messages of encouragement it it means a lot so i would say that you know you don't
[3777.54 --> 3787.98]  have to spend money to support someone go leave a comment um you know watch the video his his dad

[4048.16 --> 4054.00]  whatever i don't remember what you need to do with it let's do some um uh so let's do some merch
[4054.00 --> 4059.00]  messages shall we oh i gotta get i gotta get telegram on here i don't oh oh oh right while you do that
[4059.00 --> 4063.74]  oh i'm gonna go for it new icloud terms and conditions yeah hit me with some merch messages
[4063.74 --> 4070.44]  from joshua since the start of ltt what milestones did you had for the company and have you surpassed them
[4070.44 --> 4076.40]  are there any new milestones that you've set that uh you haven't crossed yet i mean the goal was
[4076.40 --> 4085.08]  four to five people and it being having enough revenue that we can all make like a a real i want
[4085.08 --> 4092.20]  to have a real wage you know um that was it from there it went to i want to be a real company
[4092.20 --> 4100.06]  and then and luke can attest to this i did actually do the voice and i did actually say that
[4100.06 --> 4107.22]  like seven eight nine years ago i've been saying it since very early definitely happened in that exact
[4107.22 --> 4114.70]  voice yeah i want to be real company uh one million was was pretty cool yeah yeah one million was cool
[4114.70 --> 4121.24]  10 million honestly didn't really care yeah uh i did a lot of personal reflection at 10 million just
[4121.24 --> 4128.90]  because so much of my life has been poured into this i'd say for me personally my goal is for that
[4128.90 --> 4135.64]  real company to be able to function without me that's that's a big one that's the next level because
[4135.64 --> 4146.62]  there's a big difference between a ceo that is running a successful company and a good ceo and to me
[4146.62 --> 4153.80]  just because this company is successful with me at the helm doesn't actually mean that i built a good
[4153.80 --> 4160.36]  company the true measure of a good company is that the culture and the hustle and survive with
[4160.36 --> 4168.70]  mismanagement the the decision making a good manager can survive without me so that's that's really my
[4168.70 --> 4175.82]  next goal and i that's a big part of why labs is so important because right now i feel like it's it's my
[4175.82 --> 4182.96]  it's it's my personal passion that drives a lot of the the change in our in our content and it's not
[4182.96 --> 4187.60]  just me there are different kinds of changes that are driven by different people the camera department
[4187.60 --> 4194.98]  is notorious for constantly pushing me for better production values for example the hdr rnd that is
[4194.98 --> 4200.84]  being done here is has not been done by me i i had to i had a briefing with ed on it today where i was
[4200.84 --> 4205.98]  like oh what have you been working on for the last while and he he showed me all all the stuff that
[4205.98 --> 4209.86]  we've been doing all the calls we've been having with we've been talking with youtube we've been
[4209.86 --> 4216.08]  talking with adobe um you know learning how to how to use these tools it's like oh okay well cool
[4216.08 --> 4220.98]  well we got keep at it right like but i feel like
[4220.98 --> 4231.94]  the that passion that drove me to stay up till the middle of the night replying to people's threads
[4231.94 --> 4237.68]  on the forum to make sure they didn't buy the right thing that's something that we don't have an obvious
[4237.68 --> 4247.86]  internal replacement for and our writers are great but you need that it has to it has to trickle down
[4247.86 --> 4253.48]  you know what i mean like like the the writers and the editors and the shooters they're not the
[4253.48 --> 4259.92]  the bosses of each other do you kind of get what i mean and so if you can't have an individual that is
[4259.92 --> 4268.20]  injecting that passion and that drive then what you need is a department whose entire job is to have that
[4268.20 --> 4274.70]  drive and so that's a big part of why labs exist because one of the things i pull something into a more
[4274.70 --> 4279.08]  of an analytical space so you can create actionable items instead of just forcing it to be passionate
[4279.08 --> 4288.38]  all the time yes exactly arm the team with the tools yeah that make it easy to to to to put that
[4288.38 --> 4294.98]  analysis into the work that they do and and it's not the lab is not just for video reviews the lab is
[4294.98 --> 4300.44]  for consumers the lab is for our business team man one of the first things i want the lab doing once
[4300.44 --> 4305.62]  they are fully set up is vetting sponsors i mean when we have a charger company come in and say okay
[4305.62 --> 4313.12]  we've got a 65 watt charger it's this small make sure and if it's 66 watts then let's talk about that
[4313.12 --> 4321.88]  and if it's 64 well then we're changing the talking points damn it and like i just i i feel like it's it's
[4321.88 --> 4329.72]  the solution to so many maybe not necessarily problems but but future potential pitfalls
[4329.72 --> 4335.46]  having that having that team in place and and building out that that infrastructure
[4335.46 --> 4340.34]  yeah uh what was i supposed to be talking about right now this was a merch message
[4340.34 --> 4345.66]  do you have any milestones that you haven't hit or yeah well that's new milestones yeah i think i think
[4345.66 --> 4352.78]  that was voiced yeah we're good yeah that one cool from michael i'm working on making my house
[4352.78 --> 4359.60]  smart but would like to air gap most items what are your thoughts on smart locks i don't have any smart
[4359.60 --> 4368.40]  locks um do you want your lock to be picked physically or through software or both what difference does it
[4368.40 --> 4373.94]  make quite frankly there's going to be security vulnerabilities with both 100 there's this quote from
[4373.94 --> 4377.78]  someone i don't remember who and i'm gonna misquote it so i'm sorry because you probably said it better than i did
[4377.78 --> 4382.04]  whoever said it um but it's like there's something along the lines of like software engineers
[4382.04 --> 4389.80]  want like like traditional locks because they know the software is not secure and like people who are
[4389.80 --> 4394.44]  good at like machining and mechanics and stuff want smart locks because they know the mechanical locks
[4394.44 --> 4401.86]  are insecure it's like there's problems with both just try to try to find uh i don't know there's some
[4401.86 --> 4406.18]  there's some creators on youtube lock picking lawyers fantastic one there's other ones as well
[4406.18 --> 4411.56]  uh that review this type of stuff just try to find the best thing you can yeah
[4411.56 --> 4422.60]  from trey interesting oh sorry wrong message from ridge hey love you guys been watching since the
[4422.60 --> 4426.70]  ncix days a couple weeks ago you mentioned a potential compatibility issue with your harmony remote
[4426.70 --> 4430.74]  i'm also in need of a replacement but not sure what to buy did you consider doing a roundup or have you
[4430.74 --> 4437.12]  done any research we actually got this question three times today okay yeah uh my harmony remote
[4437.12 --> 4444.18]  the compatibility issue that i ran into was that the database entries are not really getting updated
[4444.18 --> 4448.24]  anymore because logitech doesn't give two hoots about harmony because they don't even sell the
[4448.24 --> 4455.46]  products anymore so it was uh it was a marantz slash denon i i don't remember the actual brand on it
[4455.46 --> 4463.12]  but it's like their their parent that makes their receivers it was this little hdmi 2.1 switcher
[4463.12 --> 4471.82]  that is meant to add more hdmi 2.1 inputs to those first gen hdmi 2.1 receivers that don't have a ton
[4471.82 --> 4476.70]  of inputs which is like stupid because that's the whole point of the receiver right so it's it's a
[4476.70 --> 4481.10]  really cool product it's this it's this pretty inexpensive it's just a few hundred dollars and i think
[4481.10 --> 4488.26]  it's three inputs one output and it was a really good way to have a pc xbox and playstation 5
[4488.26 --> 4494.26]  all running hdmi 2.1 to a 2.1 tv and the cool thing is you don't even need their receiver to use it
[4494.26 --> 4498.90]  even though all of their marketing materials say it's it's an accessory for the receiver
[4498.90 --> 4506.92]  i can tell you from personal experience it totally works without it goodbye anyway they it's not in the
[4506.92 --> 4512.52]  database whereas the old model is now i was able to train it you can you can add something new
[4512.52 --> 4518.74]  manually but that's a hassle that not everyone wants to deal with and i suspect that as the software
[4518.74 --> 4523.26]  continues to not get updated it's going to get more and more difficult to use like their desktop
[4523.26 --> 4530.26]  software clearly hasn't been touched since oh i don't know windows eight days maybe this time it's a
[4530.26 --> 4536.70]  it's a really clunky interface and it takes a it's very time consuming to use one that i have not used
[4536.70 --> 4542.84]  yet but i have one sofa baton sent over there i believe it's called sofa baton x1 that's a fantastic
[4542.84 --> 4550.56]  name x1 yeah i believe this is the one that they sent over boop to be clear i'm not endorsing it
[4550.56 --> 4558.34]  i have not used it yet but i have heard good things this appears to be the spiritual successor
[4558.34 --> 4566.06]  to harmony i i do intend to try it because i want to have universal remotes at each watching
[4566.06 --> 4572.14]  location just so that like my kids or or like it's little things you know the babysitter is over
[4572.14 --> 4579.14]  we're out the kids are in bed like yeah sure like watch tv i don't i don't care sorry mr sebastian can't
[4579.14 --> 4586.18]  figure out how to turn on your tv like that's that sucks that's stupid no so it's it's nice to have
[4586.18 --> 4590.38]  a universal remote right guess i'll just sit here yeah i guess i'll just stare at the wall i mean
[4590.38 --> 4597.70]  she brings her homework but like whatever summer there's no homework okay you want some tv like
[4597.70 --> 4603.18]  it's nice if they're if they're able to use it so that's the one that i'm aware of
[4603.90 --> 4607.44]  next
[4607.44 --> 4615.74]  from david i know in your home theater setup you had to raise the second row up did you figure out
[4615.74 --> 4624.10]  a solution yeah the solution is a big plywood box we actually had an outlet wired into the top of it
[4624.10 --> 4630.16]  so that the powered couches can plug in and then the backing covers it so the whole thing is super clean
[4630.16 --> 4636.56]  it's got a single stair so it's one stair and then up it's 13 inches and then we carpeted it
[4636.56 --> 4645.08]  and stuffed the whole thing with uh rock wool so that helps that helps prevent it from creating like a
[4645.08 --> 4649.72]  reverberation chamber in the middle of the room yeah seems great makes sense
[4649.72 --> 4658.78]  from kevin any thoughts on hpe announcing the pro liant rl 300 arm server this week do you think
[4658.78 --> 4663.58]  we'll see a video on the channel talking about the server or thoughts on arm in the data center space
[4663.58 --> 4675.62]  oh server server applications are extremely difficult to benchmark in a meaningful way because
[4675.62 --> 4682.02]  so often the companies that use them are running their own software that is completely proprietary and
[4682.02 --> 4688.76]  even if it did have benchmarking tools they are not available to the general press and wouldn't be
[4688.76 --> 4693.18]  because to even run those benchmarking tools you would have to probably be a developer
[4693.18 --> 4702.32]  that's the problem um there are outlets that do it in my opinion great job of covering server hardware
[4702.32 --> 4706.52]  and i think this is one of those situations where we're just going to leave it to them maybe go check
[4706.52 --> 4712.90]  out serve the home i'm sure that they have some thoughts on it it's something you might see from us
[4712.90 --> 4718.86]  in the future but right now we are focused on consumer and then server to the extent that it
[4718.86 --> 4728.36]  touches on our own business yeah thanks the move away from x86 is going to be good but i
[4728.36 --> 4734.30]  i'm a little wary about how ready we are hyper specialized situations like maybe what it's doing
[4734.30 --> 4738.20]  is going to work really well with it if that's the situation that it's deployed in where they know it's
[4738.20 --> 4744.40]  going to work really well with it that's fantastic um but i don't think we're like as an industry i
[4744.40 --> 4750.66]  don't think we can just like flip over right away or anything this message is from jonathan but also
[4750.66 --> 4757.48]  a few others on june 21st 2019 you predicted that microsoft windows would be free in three years
[4757.48 --> 4766.46]  do you have an update on this prediction post pandemic i mean it was sort of a it was sort of a cheat
[4766.46 --> 4776.84]  of a prediction because functionally using windows does not have to cost money microsoft has eased off
[4776.84 --> 4783.46]  of their piracy protections to such a degree that it is pretty clear that they don't care it's also
[4783.46 --> 4791.82]  really funny like if you google buy windows 11 in the sidebar oh not even sidebar the last time i did
[4791.82 --> 4799.10]  this was in the sidebar right here 23 from turnkey point i'm sure they could get this taken down
[4799.10 --> 4807.82]  but they don't the the reality of it is microsoft wants the whole world running on windows that is
[4807.82 --> 4815.66]  far far more important to them than collecting a hundred dollars from custom pc builders they want
[4815.66 --> 4823.86]  windows to be the standard so that companies like hp and dell will buy licenses in enormous vault you
[4823.86 --> 4827.86]  you got to understand they want to sell business licenses yeah care about something to you you you
[4827.86 --> 4836.86]  got it you got to understand guys the the custom pc space is this is this tiny splinter in the eye
[4836.86 --> 4845.02]  of these companies we are the loudest most obnoxious minority we're lucky they bother listening to us at all
[4845.02 --> 4851.46]  because from a business standpoint we don't matter also such an obscene percentage of people in this
[4851.46 --> 4862.14]  space just pirate it anyways yes so like like we suck but in my i think my theory my theory for
[4862.14 --> 4868.98]  why we're getting a new prediction okay is that we're influencers we're the recommenders exactly
[4868.98 --> 4874.64]  everyone watching this show right now is an influencer it's it's very likely that if you're watching this
[4874.64 --> 4881.08]  you are like the tech person for your family so if microsoft or intel or amd or nvidia mess with you
[4881.08 --> 4889.24]  too bad well you're gonna stop recommending their stuff and that multiplication effect it ain't worth it
[4889.24 --> 4900.04]  it ain't worth it so no microsoft hasn't officially gone free to play with windows 11 but i'm not
[4900.04 --> 4907.76]  backing down it's clearly happening there's more and more ads and uh more and more ads and
[4907.76 --> 4915.84]  adjacent services included with windows you look at the way that um you know xbox game pass is advertised
[4915.84 --> 4922.36]  when you do a fresh windows install they are clearly on the trajectory i just got the timeline wrong
[4922.36 --> 4933.66]  there from daniel any updates on the cellfi cell repeater installation it's been good i have cell
[4933.66 --> 4937.28]  reception at my house i don't know what to say about it other than that you know if i have a
[4937.28 --> 4943.84]  a wi-fi issue for whatever reason i can flip over to mobile data and it works and if people call me i can
[4943.84 --> 4949.88]  hear them and they can hear me i mean it's one of those things cell repeater is such a non-sexy
[4949.88 --> 4956.08]  it's a it's a thankless installation yeah it gets there it works right away you're like sweet and
[4956.08 --> 4960.84]  then you never think about it again never think about it not even once more yeah and if it doesn't
[4960.84 --> 4970.80]  work then you're really mad it's like a lot of um it's like a lot of it work and like server work
[4970.80 --> 4977.02]  stuff in general it's like you don't want to like invest a ton in it you don't want to care about it
[4977.02 --> 4982.88]  and stuff and then it stops working or something goes down and you're like oh we need to solve this
[4982.88 --> 4987.64]  no we need to throw everything on this okay i will say one positive thing about this haircut
[4987.64 --> 4994.58]  it is very easy like when i'm mad to get this vibe going
[4994.58 --> 5001.74]  oh my god i hate this so much oh i know what you're talking i think i know what you're talking about
[5001.74 --> 5018.24]  though oh yeah yeah yeah totally oh my goodness same same energy for sure
[5018.24 --> 5027.34]  from ryan yeah just watch the vidcon vlog on flowplane it was great i know you have ltx but
[5027.34 --> 5030.78]  have you ever considered having a booth or hosting a panel at broader events like vidcon
[5030.78 --> 5039.96]  no no that sounds like a lot of work we have ltx i mean yeah the thing is i just
[5039.96 --> 5046.62]  i know you are gonna come at me about this but oh i'm ready i don't even know what it is
[5047.28 --> 5056.12]  in-person promotions why in-person yeah like it's just it seems like an utter waste of time i think
[5056.12 --> 5064.38]  in-person promotions of you or like a youtube channel i would agree because yeah i know you've
[5064.38 --> 5070.04]  gone after intel for abandoning packs and they are maintaining a booth and they are wrong about that
[5070.04 --> 5078.02]  okay um but i don't think you need to have a booth there so well i okay but you gotta remember i'm not
[5078.02 --> 5084.06]  just me anymore i don't think linus 80 people i don't think linus tech tips needs to have a who work
[5084.06 --> 5091.10]  for i have been umbrella corporation there's been a few creators that have like there's been a few
[5091.10 --> 5098.06]  creators uh that have had booths at shows before and i've been like why are you why because it how
[5098.06 --> 5104.90]  many people can you possibly hope to reach with a physical presence dozens hundreds thousands
[5104.90 --> 5113.40]  10 000 maybe there's also a medium thing right like you create or the company whatever right
[5113.40 --> 5118.34]  because we're not talking about you specifically linus media group and all the derivatives they
[5118.34 --> 5123.94]  create that's we need a name for that um they create videos they create online content if you go
[5123.94 --> 5131.32]  to youtube you're there to see their stuff right yeah you don't go to these places to find products
[5131.32 --> 5136.12]  to find new companies to find peripheral things and it's also like i'm not going to go to a show
[5136.12 --> 5143.42]  and be like okay i'm going to evaluate linus by his handshake i might go to a show to evaluate corsair
[5143.42 --> 5148.56]  keyboards by how it is to type on them yeah okay like there's there's there's reasons why these
[5148.56 --> 5152.40]  companies should be in these places and i don't think it's the same we be there with our merch
[5152.40 --> 5159.86]  that increases like yeah having a pop-up shot at a certain thing could make sense it's low-key an
[5159.86 --> 5164.14]  enormous part of our business no that could totally make sense i don't necessarily think we should
[5164.14 --> 5168.06]  have like a personality panel that might be something that you could do to draw attention
[5168.06 --> 5174.18]  to that booth in the exact same way that other companies might hire an influencer creator whatever
[5174.18 --> 5178.96]  right to bring attention to a booth it might be the same thing effectively it would actually be
[5178.96 --> 5186.06]  really funny if you just hired other creators to bring attention to the ldd store booth um you know
[5186.06 --> 5191.90]  that we're doing some influencer marketing around our products right yeah like we have uh i don't
[5191.90 --> 5195.44]  want to i don't want to i don't want to name the names i want it to be a surprise but we have like
[5195.44 --> 5201.78]  wan hoodie promotions going up on other influencers channels we definitely have some stuff lined up for
[5201.78 --> 5209.08]  screwdriver launch like it's gonna be amazing yeah uh by the way far now over in floatplane chat
[5209.08 --> 5216.00]  okay hear me out what about yvonne and partners not liking that name i think it's great
[5216.00 --> 5219.50]  got something to tell me
[5219.50 --> 5229.70]  partner implies two that's not really a partnership you don't have partners yvonne
[5229.70 --> 5236.74]  uh why don't we jump into our next topic
[5236.74 --> 5246.82]  intel's block scale crypto miner is out early they finally shipped their block scale asic
[5246.82 --> 5254.74]  it was originally slated for q3 release code name bonanza mine secure hash algorithm to fit is a
[5254.74 --> 5261.48]  secure hash algorithm 256 hardware accelerator that can do up to 580 giga hash per second
[5261.48 --> 5270.26]  with just 4.8 to 22.7 watts of power consumption that is freaking incredible it's 14.2 millimeters
[5270.26 --> 5276.80]  squared which is actually a pretty tiny die meaning each wafer can produce a theoretical 1250 chips
[5276.80 --> 5284.44]  and is manufactured on the cutting edge tsmc n5 process this thing sounds freaking awesome
[5284.44 --> 5294.66]  if it was six months ago i i think i don't know i think that take is wrong and maybe this is a hot
[5294.66 --> 5300.60]  take really i think it's take me baby i think it's still fine that it comes out now i did a tech linked
[5300.60 --> 5306.26]  today and i said what was in the thing and then i came here and i saw this and i was like okay now i
[5306.26 --> 5311.58]  can throw my own spin on this and i don't think i don't think it's too late really i think these will
[5311.58 --> 5320.52]  fly you think they will fly i think they will fly well okay for one thing the cryptocurrency uh
[5320.52 --> 5326.44]  industry is clearly in need of some more efficient hardware if prices have crashed yeah because like a
[5326.44 --> 5332.20]  lot of the prop like discourse that i've seen online a lot of the problem is that the calculation
[5332.20 --> 5338.48]  of performance per watt is just not there now it's not people being like oh i don't want to do this
[5338.48 --> 5345.06]  anymore it's oh right now technically if i turn my machines on i'm losing money which is a situation
[5345.06 --> 5351.12]  that crypto mining has been in multiple times in the past because difficulty ramps or whatever right
[5351.12 --> 5359.14]  now this topic was created was uh was i don't know populated was filled out by uh nicholas plouf who
[5359.14 --> 5365.20]  did some very helpful math thanks plouf you should be uh you should be a writer for ltt for a living
[5365.20 --> 5371.80]  the one of the issue i mean aside from the fact that there was a crypto crash and investment in the
[5371.80 --> 5380.16]  space is going like like this is that intel talked a lot about the energy efficiency of this of this asic
[5380.16 --> 5387.14]  um over a thousand times the performance per watt but the issue is that they compared themselves to
[5387.14 --> 5398.66]  discrete gpus which is fine for certain algorithms but compared to dedicated asic miners is not very
[5398.66 --> 5408.20]  good and according to plouf's math the new bonanza mine block scale asic from intel seems to be worse
[5408.20 --> 5416.20]  than a an ant main bitcoin miner s19 xp hydro that's not necessarily going to matter too much um
[5416.20 --> 5423.80]  did he do a wattage calculation yeah so what's the difference that miner is 255 tera hash per second
[5423.80 --> 5433.16]  at 5 300 watts and 256 of intel's chips would be 148 tera hash per second at 5 800 watts oh there's
[5433.16 --> 5439.26]  less power vision so then cost will just be the equation yeah i mean that's the thing about that
[5439.26 --> 5445.46]  industry is it's it's all just down to cost it's it's funny i saw it i saw a tweet today someone was
[5445.46 --> 5452.78]  saying like oh it turns out that a big part of the silicon shortage was mining because apparently
[5452.78 --> 5458.50]  there's just like in certain industries did we not know that inventory is piling up and i was tagged on
[5458.50 --> 5463.48]  uh yeah anyone who's been paying even sort of attention like and i'm one of the people tagged
[5463.48 --> 5469.60]  obviously knew this yeah um but yeah like you're you're in an industry where it's all just money
[5469.60 --> 5474.42]  driven what you're what you're attempting to buy is a money printing machine yeah but that money
[5474.42 --> 5479.70]  printing machine very well then you won't buy it that money printing machine costs money to buy and
[5479.70 --> 5485.42]  it costs money to run so it's it's a fairly simple calculation so they they need if they can get their
[5485.42 --> 5492.52]  initial cost really low then there's potential value there and if you can find customers where their
[5492.52 --> 5496.98]  power is cheap or or whatever they have some way of generating their own power who knows
[5496.98 --> 5502.44]  um if the initial cost is low maybe they'll be interested in buying your product if ant mine is
[5502.44 --> 5510.30]  sold out like they always are yeah bitmain never builds enough inventory then then maybe you will have
[5510.30 --> 5516.12]  inventory at all so they'll sell out i yeah i don't know the calculation that it's worse is
[5516.12 --> 5522.60]  kind of funny um but i i still and i didn't know that when i was trying to defend it but i still
[5522.60 --> 5526.94]  kind of suspect that they'll they'll probably fly because there's a lot of people that are still
[5526.94 --> 5532.26]  mining there's a lot of people that still have profitable mining operations as well which i think
[5532.26 --> 5539.02]  a lot of like i've just said a lot of people a lot of times um but i i think people are are looking
[5539.02 --> 5544.24]  over that because it's more fun to look at the like the wasteland yeah people who are flipping all
[5544.24 --> 5548.92]  their gpus on ebay right now but that is not everyone there are there are people that were
[5548.92 --> 5554.14]  more prepared more prepared to weather the storm and i think just because the gold rush is over i
[5554.14 --> 5559.60]  don't think mine is going mining is going to end um i think people are going to find a way to exist
[5559.60 --> 5564.30]  in the new environment and yeah we'll see
[5564.30 --> 5577.82]  um psa i would like people to stop making assumptions about the ltt screwdriver until we actually deliver it
[5577.82 --> 5587.02]  we posted a picture on the ltt twitter handle like of the components blow up yeah and i have just seen
[5587.02 --> 5594.76]  the most wild assumptions i've seen everything from the ratchet mechanism is not durable which you would
[5594.76 --> 5602.46]  have absolutely no way whatsoever of evaluating because you cannot see it to that the handle will
[5602.46 --> 5611.10]  not stay attached to that you will be able to twist the handle because there's not enough of a flange to
[5611.10 --> 5621.94]  the oh man what was one of the other like really really wacky ones i saw um oh i don't remember but guys
[5621.94 --> 5629.56]  it's been in development for two and a half years do you think we've just been twiddling our thumbs
[5629.56 --> 5637.78]  we have the concept for the pop-up shop all locked in we are hoping that the pop-up shop will happen
[5637.78 --> 5645.02]  sometime in the next month to month and a half at that time you will be able to in person assuming
[5645.02 --> 5652.48]  you're in vancouver you will be able to in person feel it screw things in with it screw things out with
[5652.48 --> 5659.72]  it we will have drivers from competing brands on hand you can try them all out for yourself until then
[5659.72 --> 5662.62]  maybe just shut up
[5662.62 --> 5672.06]  that might be good rather than compare a thing that you've never held in it's a tool there's a lot more
[5672.06 --> 5679.84]  to it than what you can convey in a picture it has to feel good it has to like it has to be durable it
[5679.84 --> 5689.58]  has to just stop your pull is terrible i didn't make that pull they've been twiddling their thumbs
[5689.58 --> 5699.14]  yes no i won't tell okay i have to know float plane come on guys i've had enough of you guys anyway
[5699.14 --> 5706.72]  the point is the point is we're gonna get people to try it in person our intention is to have live
[5706.72 --> 5712.54]  stream cameras there have i talked about that yet yeah i think that was my idea we will have live
[5712.54 --> 5717.22]  stream cameras there where real customers will be able to give their real impressions of it
[5717.22 --> 5726.20]  and just i am so winter stasis over on twitch yeah 4chan says it's a rebranded generic screwdriver
[5726.20 --> 5734.26]  sorry bro yeah exactly exactly that's you know what there i'll admit it that's what it is thank you
[5734.26 --> 5740.56]  4chan it took how many years of development yeah i'm really i'm really glad that you guys were there
[5740.56 --> 5743.94]  to tell me what happened over the last two and a half years here
[5743.94 --> 5753.62]  lobster roll says wow damn we pay you this is how we're treated how did you guys treat me okay did you
[5753.62 --> 5760.62]  consider that how you treated me 58 of you said or 76 of you said yes we've been twiddling our thumbs
[5760.62 --> 5765.18]  rude so rude they're almost as rude as luke
[5765.18 --> 5772.44]  zatharian says snap on will be there too absolutely oh we'll be there to check it out oh no i mean well
[5772.44 --> 5775.98]  we'll have their screwdrivers there they don't need to come and bring them but they can bring more if
[5775.98 --> 5779.12]  they like that would actually be really convenient there's there's been a couple comments in
[5779.12 --> 5783.98]  it took them a really long time to find the right font for the rebrand logo yeah exactly yeah
[5783.98 --> 5789.08]  years and engineers you had to put some like some real engineering work into that font
[5789.08 --> 5794.08]  uh there's been a couple comments about the the poll i just wanted to point out a few things
[5794.08 --> 5799.70]  uh the mobile version is coming it's not here yet but the mobile version is coming and we have some
[5799.70 --> 5805.88]  other kind of like feature ideas right now the admin of the channel because this is this is going
[5805.88 --> 5810.68]  to be rolled out for for all creators the admin of the channel can see all polls that have ever
[5810.68 --> 5815.16]  happened on the channel who created them and who closed them and all that type of stuff in an admin
[5815.16 --> 5821.72]  panel um but right now that's not viewable for the users so we're we're trying to figure out like
[5821.72 --> 5827.24]  the best way to maybe do that i know like twitch polls and youtube polls they just go away which is
[5827.24 --> 5832.68]  how the flow plane poll currently works right but we've been thinking like maybe once it's closed and
[5832.68 --> 5838.12]  done and the timer fades and all that type of stuff it could like migrate under the player or something
[5838.12 --> 5845.40]  i don't know but right now it's it it it will fade after the poll goes up but yeah it's a well-known
[5845.40 --> 5849.96]  fact that engineers are bad logo designers it's true maybe we should have hired a graphic designer
[5849.96 --> 5857.08]  and we would have been able to bring this thing out a lot sooner what oh man i just yeah it it makes
[5857.08 --> 5861.64]  my brain hurt because people will say no it's a it's a it's going to be a bad product because it's from
[5861.64 --> 5866.60]  an unproven company it's like well hold on a second we licensed ip from mega pro they've been around for
[5866.60 --> 5874.76]  ever um their their drivers have held up fine just fine so there's there's the people that will say
[5874.76 --> 5880.52]  it's it's a it's it's unproven it's like well no and then there's the people that say it's just
[5880.52 --> 5886.76]  rebranded but also well no have you noticed that it looks absolutely nothing like a mega pro driver
[5887.48 --> 5893.08]  like nothing like it yes it uses some of their patented mechanisms like the bit loader
[5893.08 --> 5897.72]  um and we sort of used their ratchet at this point we've basically redesigned it but
[5897.72 --> 5904.12]  we definitely paid to use it um so it's it's it's somewhere it's somewhere in between
[5905.08 --> 5909.48]  because you're not allowed to just build something that uses other people's patented technology unless
[5909.48 --> 5915.56]  you license it so yeah it's it's a combination of things but yes it will it will take the things that
[5915.56 --> 5921.56]  give good reliability to it from mega pro and it will take the things that we think make it a great
[5921.56 --> 5929.32]  screwdriver especially for building computers and uh add those to it all right what else we got to
[5929.32 --> 5940.12]  talk about today nvidia released the gtx 1630 a dumb card that no one asked for okay we have asked them
[5940.12 --> 5944.84]  to stop editorializing quite so much in these talking points right they're not wrong though we have
[5944.84 --> 5951.64]  nvidia threw intel a bone by taking the prize for most pathetic gpu of 2022 with the release of the
[5951.64 --> 5961.08]  gtx 1630 yes not 30 30 or 2030 but 16 30 geforce 10 series is still here i'm sorry 16 series the
[5961.08 --> 5969.08]  specs are turing architecture 512 cuda cores 1785 megahertz boost four gigs of gddr6 and a
[5969.08 --> 5979.88]  oh yuck 64 bit memory bus it costs a whopping 200 from evga 169 from other manufacturers nice and
[5979.88 --> 5990.76]  is about 33 percent slower than amd's rx 6400 and the gtx 1650 meaning virtually every other card will get
[5990.76 --> 5998.76]  you more performance per dollar than this meanwhile the 1650 super was released for 10 less back in
[5998.76 --> 6006.84]  2019 this was clearly a solution to yesterday's problem today priced for a different market yeah
[6006.84 --> 6011.80]  there's there's been a lot of that um a lot of a lot of solutions that came like almost exactly too
[6011.80 --> 6018.76]  late it's like it takes lead time and engineering to make things it's crazy um but yeah i think well it's
[6018.76 --> 6024.28]  what card was it back in the house there was a rant video about a graphics card that i believe
[6024.28 --> 6029.96]  was a 30 series graphics card uh it was amd it was the 5450 if i recall correctly let's see if my
[6030.68 --> 6040.84]  hd 54 50 let's see if my uh recall is good card oh no i screwed it up no it's not the 5450
[6040.84 --> 6050.92]  i thought it was like a 70 30 or something um i don't know about that oh ngpu linus
[6052.04 --> 6059.80]  are they still oh oh well there was a second one okay so the first one was an r7 240 that was shot
[6059.80 --> 6063.72]  back at the house okay that's that's the one i'm talking about though not mine i'm not talking about
[6063.72 --> 6069.96]  mine okay but the the that one with the the amd card i already forgot the model whatever yeah uh
[6069.96 --> 6077.96]  very forgettable r7 240 um that one was like i really liked that video and that video for me
[6077.96 --> 6082.28]  was was somewhat affirming of like you know i know i think we're getting pretty good at this
[6083.16 --> 6087.96]  that was that was a that was a pretty key moment for me actually and people are still buying them
[6087.96 --> 6097.00]  yeah a low-end gpu never makes sense and i'm sorry it just doesn't people have been the the comment
[6097.00 --> 6103.88]  section is so mad they're so so mad about that video well what about if you just need more display
[6103.88 --> 6111.80]  outputs for an office monitor pick up something worse a low-end gaming card is always the worst buy
[6111.80 --> 6117.32]  yeah well what if i can't afford something better then buy something second hand or second hand buy
[6117.32 --> 6123.32]  something second hand we're not telling you to we're not telling you to just get more money we're
[6123.32 --> 6128.92]  telling you to spend it like not an idiot yeah and hopefully less of it yeah because that's like
[6128.92 --> 6134.52]  one of the biggest problems is they're they're expensive for what they are i just uh it makes me
[6134.52 --> 6141.48]  so it makes me so angry the performance per dollar is so low can we not just can we not waste money
[6141.48 --> 6149.96]  please we should definitely we should definitely revisit i'm i'm making a note i'm making a note here huge
[6149.96 --> 6157.24]  mistake huge success what's the success yeah um need to re we're just going to redo that video in 8k
[6160.28 --> 6165.88]  redo the low-end gpus video again because people clearly haven't gotten the point i think that'll be
[6165.88 --> 6171.08]  a solid intro i wouldn't have to make this video if you guys got the point the first two times
[6171.08 --> 6180.20]  and yet this product exists so here we are let's go that's actually not bad i should just open it like
[6180.20 --> 6185.00]  that hey hey bell can you can you clip that and just like send it to me i'll just throw that right
[6185.00 --> 6191.40]  in the script that's pretty good pretty solid uh no you didn't miss the telegram thing i think i have
[6191.40 --> 6198.52]  telegram now oh that's test flight sorry i saw i saw t and immediately went for it to be fair like from
[6198.52 --> 6202.28]  here and that screen's really good so i can actually see it pretty well i thought that was telegram as well
[6202.28 --> 6209.08]  your phone i don't know my phone number this is my uh this is my drug dealer is it in the about of your
[6209.08 --> 6215.08]  phone or whatever your settings somewhere i don't know iphones i yeah i don't know gotta be in here somewhere
[6216.52 --> 6218.84]  general about here we go
[6220.04 --> 6223.16]  well definitely got my carrier in there
[6223.16 --> 6231.64]  uh you want to figure that out while i do a topic yeah sony launches pc peripherals i know right
[6231.64 --> 6239.72]  new in zone brand has launched with a monitor and a headset an m9 which is a 900 27 inch 4k 144 hertz
[6239.72 --> 6247.96]  ips monitor which has 96 dimming zones hdr 600 and auto hdr tone mapping m3 which is a 530 27
[6247.96 --> 6255.00]  i'm not going to go through all these but there's a m9 m3 h9 which is their wireless headset uh h7 which
[6255.00 --> 6261.08]  is wireless as well but not as fancy h3 which is wired um i've seen a complaint from a few people i
[6261.08 --> 6267.24]  think this is in the dock as well that the wired headset has too short of a cable which is you know
[6267.24 --> 6273.64]  that can be annoying but you can also extend those so it's not exactly the end of the world either
[6273.64 --> 6278.68]  um and they're like very easy and very cheap and not cumbersome to expand as well or extend as well
[6278.68 --> 6285.32]  i will say that kind of mind-blowing sony didn't do it earlier hey yeah i think it's cool i'm down
[6285.32 --> 6290.92]  with this i don't think it's a bad thing apparently the monitor is really solid i'm not surprised i mean
[6290.92 --> 6296.68]  it's like they know display technology they know audio technology sony is one of those really funny
[6296.68 --> 6304.44]  companies to me where they have all this expertise and then just kind of decide not to use it it feels
[6304.44 --> 6310.36]  like you know yeah like they're actually they're actually surprisingly limited in the in the space
[6310.36 --> 6314.92]  of well less now uh but they have been limited in the in the space of products that they actually do make
[6315.56 --> 6319.56]  um and they used to have like stores they used to have dedicated stores i don't know if they still do
[6319.56 --> 6326.44]  that like they just kind of different approaches to things um but yeah people are reviewing things
[6326.44 --> 6332.36]  so far fairly positively um sondergaard thought the headsets were solid but too short of a cable
[6332.36 --> 6340.20]  yep yep not surprised um ploof likes the m9 for my username nice do it no you should just make it like
[6340.20 --> 6345.56]  linus and be like hey it's me oh what are you doing you want me to do that i thought i think so
[6345.56 --> 6352.28]  i i well i wanted to i wanted to tell them that i like i wanted to ask them what i won
[6352.84 --> 6357.56]  okay yeah i was just going for like straight confrontation oh you want to confrontate well
[6357.56 --> 6362.84]  i don't know but why don't we pull float plane okay okay all right if you guys want to participate
[6362.84 --> 6367.24]  in the poll you better sign up for float plane really fast you're not gonna have extremely quickly
[6367.24 --> 6371.56]  you should sign up for float plane we've had so many amazing behind the scenes over there
[6371.56 --> 6375.32]  don't don't take my word for it float plane subscriptions have been going
[6375.80 --> 6380.52]  stonks lately just because of the awesome content that the social team has been putting up there
[6381.08 --> 6383.96]  it's it's been kind of amazing great job guys
[6388.12 --> 6394.92]  we've got another topic that i can do in the meantime the week of ssd shenanigans featuring
[6394.92 --> 6401.48]  the m2 13-inch macbook pro and the steam deck early reviews of the m2 13-inch macbook pro have shown the
[6401.48 --> 6407.56]  ssd in the base model is half the speed for reads and 30 slower for writes than the same laptop with
[6407.56 --> 6414.20]  an m1 this appears to be due to the m2 version having a single 256 gigabyte nand flash module
[6414.20 --> 6420.44]  instead of two 128 gig ones the latter config can enable reading and writing in parallel across both
[6420.44 --> 6426.04]  chips increasing performance unfortunately the slow ssd also appears to act as a bottleneck thanks to
[6426.04 --> 6432.12]  apple silicon's unified memory so the base 8 gig m.2 model can take close to twice as long to complete
[6432.12 --> 6436.92]  certain intensive tasks compared to the same laptop with 16 gigs of ram this is the kind of thing that
[6436.92 --> 6444.52]  just like apple has no excuse for like they shamelessly just charge a lot which is fine but
[6444.52 --> 6452.44]  then they should just build a lot like it should just be good yeah meanwhile valve also stealthily
[6452.44 --> 6459.48]  downgraded the ssd in new steam deck models lowering bandwidth from pcie gen 3 by 4 to by 2 valve says
[6459.48 --> 6466.52]  there is no impact on performance but that still sucks valve you should still have said something
[6466.52 --> 6473.24]  because people rely on independent reviews to get an idea of how a product is it can be expected to
[6473.24 --> 6481.88]  perform in the real world and you you went you participated in that ecosystem you you seeded review units so now
[6481.88 --> 6488.20]  to maintain your transparency you you have to talk about how the new ones aren't going that how that
[6488.20 --> 6492.76]  wasn't representative of what you've actually delivered now i believe you that there's no impact
[6492.76 --> 6499.96]  on performance because i mean i've seen games launch off of a flipping micro sd card without there being a big
[6499.96 --> 6507.80]  impact on performance so yeah gen 3 by 2 is still flipping a lot more bandwidth than a micro sd card but it
[6507.80 --> 6515.16]  still sucks also also deck a deck designer said uh lawrence lawrence yang i think uh hold on why don't
[6515.16 --> 6521.32]  i just click the thing yeah lawrence yang uh deck designer said please do not do this in response to a
[6521.32 --> 6530.04]  mod that was posted replacing the decks 2230 sized ssd with a larger 2242 size drive as it apparently
[6530.04 --> 6537.24]  affects the cooling situation the original modder apparently agrees which i think is pretty funny that is
[6537.24 --> 6542.44]  mod at your own risk i am taking risk and working on this as a proof of concept that's really funny
[6543.16 --> 6549.96]  uh i mean yeah fair enough it's worth noting that lawrence did not say not to cut a hole in the back
[6549.96 --> 6558.28]  of your steam deck and bolt a cooler to the back of it yeah still going ahead who's the steam deck modder
[6558.28 --> 6567.80]  king now by the way the poll ended uh 43 57 uh 43 57 in favor of direct but i will say
[6568.36 --> 6574.12]  you probably have a higher chance of them responding if you don't go direct yeah i'm gonna go not well
[6574.12 --> 6580.12]  wait so what what did they vote for direct okay well we have to do what float plane says i mean they do
[6580.12 --> 6586.92]  like pay your salary okay so in that regard okay so i'm gonna add a picture allow access i would call
[6586.92 --> 6594.84]  them all photos call them yeah okay so here hold on i'm gonna take a quick picture wait what how does
[6594.84 --> 6601.00]  this this is so stupid what is this interface does this not look like i should be here i click the camera
[6601.00 --> 6606.52]  does this not look like i should be able to take a picture well he does what why am i not hello
[6607.72 --> 6614.36]  i don't understand why are computers hard to use and then go direct what are computers that is that is
[6614.36 --> 6620.12]  the standard the standard is to start fake and then go direct start fake and then go direct well yeah
[6620.12 --> 6628.20]  but i'm not going to be able to i mean if if it's the username right like here let's just they're not
[6628.20 --> 6637.56]  going to respond yeah so i mean so then make it fake okay so bob saget then yeah rest in peace yeah
[6641.48 --> 6641.72]  okay
[6643.88 --> 6648.20]  a bunch of people tried to dude we should do that more often i've still got my own profile picture
[6648.20 --> 6652.52]  though a bunch of people tried to beat the race an error and they signed up for float plane but they
[6652.52 --> 6657.96]  didn't make it in time for the poll oh seriously i told you guys i mean you should sign up anyway
[6657.96 --> 6663.24]  is is bob saget a blocked name like or does someone else already have it bob no that shouldn't matter
[6663.24 --> 6669.56]  it shouldn't matter lots of people have the same name bob mcbobberson this shouldn't be so hard
[6670.52 --> 6679.48]  an error occurred please try it what air by signing up you agree to the terms of what i do i have to put
[6679.48 --> 6685.00]  my real name is it gonna like does it have some way of checking is it checking my phone to see if it's my
[6685.00 --> 6692.52]  real name an error occurred please try that way to go telegram okay for real though maybe i'm an idiot
[6692.52 --> 6700.36]  did i do it wrong you you try it floaty mc float plane i do like that uh in the meantime let's talk
[6700.36 --> 6707.64]  about from a google engineer's perspective why g suite versus the non-business non-paid free versions
[6707.64 --> 6715.24]  of google services don't work the same uh we're not i think this person's anonymous so i'm not going
[6715.24 --> 6723.00]  to name them but everything they said sounded sounded pretty reasonable i will start by saying
[6723.72 --> 6728.28]  i will give you reason i don't think it's a good excuse but it should at least give you some insight
[6728.92 --> 6734.52]  i'm a software engineer working on i'm not going to say exactly what they work on within the workspace
[6734.52 --> 6740.76]  organization and i am a primary privacy advocate for some product so i have first-hand experience
[6740.76 --> 6747.48]  as to why it is so dumb the primary reason that business versus non-business accounts can't share
[6747.48 --> 6752.68]  data is due to the differences in our privacy policy between these accounts a business account
[6752.68 --> 6757.88]  cannot have any of its data used for ads or product development and cannot have any of its data used for
[6757.88 --> 6763.24]  machine learning models that aren't specific to that account fair enough video suggestions is a good
[6763.24 --> 6767.72]  example of an account specific model where each account has a model that is trained for that
[6767.72 --> 6773.16]  account suggestions but for consumer accounts everyone's data feeds into a single model fair
[6773.16 --> 6777.88]  enough the reason this causes problems with sharing data between consumer accounts and business accounts
[6777.88 --> 6784.20]  comes down to laziness lack of effort if a consumer account for example asks for google assistant to do
[6784.20 --> 6789.32]  something the logs and events are used to further train the assistant models if they ask to do
[6789.32 --> 6793.40]  something and the device you're interacting with is owned by a business account we have to take
[6793.40 --> 6799.24]  special precautions not to use that specific data for the models since even the name of the device is
[6799.24 --> 6804.84]  considered personally identifiable information and that chunk of audio can't be used in models oh
[6805.48 --> 6808.84]  that chunk of audio can't be used in models because our systems are so large and complex
[6810.04 --> 6815.00]  and due to the way success is measured for projects doing the necessary work to filter that data is an afterthought and
[6815.00 --> 6820.92]  not typically worth the effort in some engineers minds i disagree with this approach uh google takes
[6820.92 --> 6824.76]  in these case with the approach google takes in these cases but do appreciate that we take users
[6825.48 --> 6831.80]  data privacy seriously within workspace and i can't speak for ads or any other org that's like it's a
[6831.80 --> 6835.48]  good disclaimer right there i just wish we followed through better and i'm constantly filing bugs
[6835.48 --> 6840.20]  internally and advocating for these same things that you rant about it's just a lot of people to
[6840.20 --> 6848.92]  convince and a lot of money at stake so yes that is an explanation but it's yeah it's it's it's an ex
[6848.92 --> 6854.76]  yeah it's a bad excuse and it sucks because i am a paying freaking customer and it doesn't make sense
[6854.76 --> 6860.92]  that my g suite account should have limited functionality compared to a flippin ad supported free account
[6860.92 --> 6866.92]  what is this
[6866.92 --> 6882.68]  uh oh my god well apparently we're supposed to build someone build someone a six-figure computer
[6882.68 --> 6892.12]  nice okay i'm not going to reveal anything other than that so you guys will you figured it out what
[6892.12 --> 6897.48]  did you do i don't know oh did you just keep doing the same things and it just eventually worked or what
[6898.04 --> 6902.60]  i exited out of what you had been doing and then i needed the phone number and i didn't want to bother
[6902.60 --> 6906.44]  you so i just called myself got the phone number put the phone number in and then it just like worked
[6906.44 --> 6913.32]  i don't know okay oh does not have access to your contacts okay for crying out loud let's just
[6913.32 --> 6918.76]  let's go let's go uh okay i i don't actually have any of those up anymore do you have any of those up
[6918.76 --> 6925.40]  anymore uh no no uh okay well it shouldn't be that hard to find oh no never mind i've got one
[6925.40 --> 6929.48]  which which one was it at the linus tech was that the one that we wanted to do
[6929.48 --> 6936.36]  uh it was a telegram linus tech tips official i think it was it is that is that right
[6936.92 --> 6942.44]  i think so can anyone can anyone remember chat what's up who are we how do i even oh okay cool
[6942.44 --> 6947.16]  so you can just search i don't i don't use telegram much but so you can just search for an at there's
[6947.16 --> 6952.92]  at least a couple i searched for at the linus tech and there's at the linus tech tips and at the linus
[6952.92 --> 6962.36]  tech uh at the linus tech appears to be one of the ones that just posted so let's uh wait oh crap i
[6962.36 --> 6973.88]  search for the wrong one here we go uh okay at the linus tech dang it i feel like a boomer right now
[6973.88 --> 6978.92]  at the linus tech oh that is the one no messages here yet okay um
[6978.92 --> 6991.48]  um so i'll go with uh hi i saw i won a prize i'm very excited how can i get should i spell it
[6991.48 --> 6991.80]  price
[6991.80 --> 6999.64]  nice i like it i like it no i'm gonna spell it right i'm gonna spell it right okay how do i how
[6999.64 --> 7004.04]  do i can i just like call someone i do i have to have them as a oh oh i can call them should i call
[7004.04 --> 7010.92]  them sure okay all right i'm gonna call them i'll call them okay telegram would like access to your
[7010.92 --> 7020.68]  microphone okay here we go here we go ladies gentlemen
[7024.76 --> 7026.44]  they hang up oh what
[7029.96 --> 7031.72]  man they canceled the call
[7031.72 --> 7044.36]  what if they like no how do i um get you my my information
[7046.60 --> 7051.80]  okay well oh last seen eight hours ago that makes sense probably in a different time zone
[7053.96 --> 7057.96]  well we could try one of the other ones i mean there's plenty of there's plenty of linus tech tips
[7057.96 --> 7061.72]  is apparently there's definitely more i can hunt for more of them do you want to do some some
[7062.28 --> 7070.12]  merch message yeah sure i'm gonna oh man i'm hunting minus tech oh here's linus oh you're just like
[7070.12 --> 7074.84]  searching for them yeah i saw i won a prize
[7077.16 --> 7085.32]  hold on hold on uh hold up okay come on siri help me out oh crap crap siri help me out it now says
[7085.32 --> 7093.00]  blah i didn't even know i entered the contest period what did i win question mark
[7094.92 --> 7097.80]  oh let's add another let's add another question mark let's add three
[7101.40 --> 7107.24]  last scene yesterday apparently this is edwin not trying to be very convincing here
[7109.24 --> 7115.08]  okay oh man this is such a bummer i was little did you know edsel's just been like working on the
[7115.08 --> 7123.48]  side yeah it's literally ed it's like my alter ego ed win this is the version of me that wins all
[7123.48 --> 7126.12]  the time ed but win like prizes
[7130.12 --> 7136.28]  okay uh sure why don't you hit me with some rich messages bell to confirm did you finish all your
[7136.28 --> 7141.88]  thoughts on the google account types uh yeah that was it it's stupid i hate it but thank you for the
[7141.88 --> 7146.44]  explanation but like yeah it makes your honesty that's sort of yeah i think you come to that
[7146.44 --> 7153.32]  conclusion but just big company doing big company things yeah that suck speaking of big company tim
[7153.32 --> 7158.52]  asks with gpu prices dropping is it a good time to get into vr gaming are there any headsets you would
[7158.52 --> 7169.08]  recommend yes and i know it's facebook but like get a quest 2 sorry man it did nothing else touches that
[7169.08 --> 7175.56]  value per dollar when did that come out quest 2 a couple years ago yeah is there quest 2 rumors
[7176.12 --> 7182.04]  quest 3 you mean that's what i meant sorry um i think so they have been showing off a ton of headsets
[7182.04 --> 7188.20]  from ar to professional ones yeah yeah i was gonna say like it might actually not be the greatest time
[7188.20 --> 7195.56]  you might want to wait until the next next step comes out yeah but it's also like 300 like you're it's
[7195.56 --> 7200.44]  not we're not talking it's not like it used to be where you were spending a thousand dollars 300 is
[7200.44 --> 7204.92]  still a lot of money i know but the depreciation is not going to be what it was you'll it'll still be
[7204.92 --> 7210.76]  worth something like if you were buying a first gen headset and you were spending like six seven
[7210.76 --> 7218.12]  eight hundred us dollars only to have it immediately be worth half as much yeah that is terrible whereas if
[7218.12 --> 7223.72]  you buy something for 300 and something better comes out but that 300 thing is only going to
[7223.72 --> 7230.44]  depreciate by at worst maybe a quarter like it'll still be worth something used it's standalone it
[7230.44 --> 7235.40]  depends how much like it's just not going to hurt you as much extra cash you have going into a
[7235.40 --> 7243.24]  recession and a used quest 2 is still going to be the low bar for entry into vr they're not going to
[7243.24 --> 7248.92]  undercut it i mean i guess it's possible there's there's no way though there's no way they undercut
[7248.92 --> 7255.48]  it so i just don't see it as nearly as i don't see it as as high a risk of maneuver as it used to be
[7255.48 --> 7261.80]  i was trying to read this article about like quest 3 release dates and i landed on pcgamesn.com
[7261.80 --> 7271.00]  and it is just ads there's this like four lines of text and then yeah no that's actually chopped off
[7271.00 --> 7276.68]  there's four lines of text that are not obscured by ads i mean technically this banner up here is
[7276.68 --> 7285.08]  not an ad uh okay that's not sure technically an ad sure and technically this except for once you get
[7285.08 --> 7293.08]  to free games where did my mouse even go there it is i need to get out of here i love it if you don't
[7293.08 --> 7298.12]  want to give facebook your information they do sell uh enterprise one for like 500 more that doesn't
[7298.12 --> 7303.24]  require a meta account but uh i think you lose the value at that point yeah i'm sure they definitely
[7303.24 --> 7309.80]  definitely aren't monitoring i didn't know you could do that yep that's a thing huh uh anonymous
[7309.80 --> 7315.24]  asked about labs any updates on if it's going to be getting its own channel or when it'll be producing
[7315.24 --> 7322.04]  more content now that we've had uh a lot more hires and people are out of uh probation now there will
[7322.04 --> 7331.96]  almost certainly be lab channels but they won't be the priority at the start the priority is get data
[7331.96 --> 7339.56]  and then we will find ways to present that data probably in a text form first and also through
[7339.56 --> 7346.20]  videos on our other channels like short circuit and ltt and from there eventually i would expect labs to
[7346.20 --> 7352.76]  branch out into its own video content because video is just it's the only way to make that kind of
[7352.76 --> 7356.04]  an enterprise profitable you can't you can't do it through text
[7359.88 --> 7367.00]  from rc are any of you guys into space science any updates on the or any thoughts on the voyager
[7367.00 --> 7373.96]  probes powered down and being updated with windows 98 in 2022 it's the mars probe that got the windows 98
[7373.96 --> 7381.00]  update that's super cool it's actually awesome 24 years later i absolutely love it it's it's really
[7381.00 --> 7387.88]  really cool seeing like because you know there's got to be an insane engineering effort that goes into
[7387.88 --> 7393.96]  something that like you're gonna fire in a tube to a different planet and then hope it still works on
[7393.96 --> 7397.88]  the other end yeah like you know there's gonna be this insane effort so then to be able to see these
[7397.88 --> 7404.36]  things work wildly beyond the expected lifespan yeah is just really awesome i don't know that's
[7404.36 --> 7409.16]  very very cool i've been reading about the voyager probes and their impending shutdown and i didn't
[7409.16 --> 7415.00]  even realize for example that they powered down the cameras on them ages ago that this whole process of
[7415.00 --> 7420.12]  slowly shutting down their systems in order to extend their lifetime has actually been ongoing
[7420.12 --> 7427.96]  since very early in the mission yeah yeah very cool stuff really interesting oops someone asked
[7427.96 --> 7433.16]  what's the best and worst thing about the house so far i accidentally just yowed it into the abyss best
[7433.16 --> 7440.12]  thing is having more space and the theater room worst thing is basically nothing being in its final state
[7440.12 --> 7447.56]  so every time you pick something up the place you put it down is not its final resting place because
[7447.56 --> 7454.04]  you don't have your furniture nowhere they're still like contractors crap lying around in places where
[7454.04 --> 7459.88]  you'd like to put things only in a few places there's still some ram board on the floors that like the
[7459.88 --> 7466.76]  the storage room is full of painting equipment from the painters so we can't put anything away so the
[7466.76 --> 7472.76]  living room is still a sea of clutter it's just we're not moved in properly yet and it sucks and
[7472.76 --> 7478.20]  i want to be moved in but obviously champagne problem i'm i'm loving the additional space
[7479.24 --> 7484.12]  we can't go in the backyard because it's all completely dug up it's a disaster there's a
[7484.12 --> 7490.36]  apparently some kind of concrete mixing mixers strike so you can't get concrete um so they can't
[7490.36 --> 7494.76]  shoot the pool so we probably won't swim in it this year which again champagne problem but you know
[7494.76 --> 7498.92]  it's disappointing for the kids right that sucks i'm disappointed the big kids are disappointed too
[7498.92 --> 7505.32]  i'm disappointed i was gonna go swimming it yeah heck yeah from dave any thoughts on amd using
[7505.32 --> 7509.56]  multiple dies or chiplets on the next gen gpus oh it's super exciting i mean we saw what they did
[7509.56 --> 7515.48]  with chiplets with zen this needs to be the direction we saw what apple apple did bolting together two of
[7515.48 --> 7524.52]  their m1 chips to make a gpu that was built and then fused together i don't think i i didn't think
[7524.52 --> 7530.68]  it could be done with complete transparency to the application and to the end user like that if amd can
[7530.68 --> 7539.16]  pull off something similar we could see a legitimate huge improvement in gpu performance yeah thank you
[7539.16 --> 7544.36]  from diego what android phone would you pick if you couldn't pick a samsung
[7546.52 --> 7549.00]  is it crazy to have high hopes for the nothing phone
[7550.68 --> 7557.96]  the nothing one or whatever it's called phone one i know nothing about it i got him hey
[7557.96 --> 7567.32]  i mean we know that oneplus turned worse when carl pay left we know that carl pay left over
[7567.32 --> 7575.00]  creative and management disagreements with the existing oneplus team we know that carl pay is
[7575.00 --> 7581.40]  in charge of this team maybe that helps wasn't there some negative afterthoughts about the headphones
[7582.76 --> 7586.68]  i i don't think the headphones have been a smash hit i think they've done like okay
[7587.96 --> 7595.00]  nothing special hey yeah that's when they discounted the nothing special oh wait is that actually
[7595.00 --> 7600.36]  anything okay that'd be pretty great actually if they did that i don't know yeah uh yeah a lot of
[7600.36 --> 7605.32]  people in the in the chat talking about pixels a lot of people talking about sony phones very
[7605.32 --> 7611.40]  frustrating my issue with sony phones is a super trivial one but i cannot get over it they do not
[7611.40 --> 7620.36]  allow you to reposition the back and the task switcher button sony just do it it's it's it's in like
[7620.36 --> 7627.72]  basic android you you took it out put it back in do they have their small phones still yeah they have
[7627.72 --> 7632.84]  some pretty compact ones like skinny they're skinnier which is really nice yeah i would love to daily
[7632.84 --> 7637.40]  drive a sony phone but i refuse to reach all the way across my screen for the back button yeah that's
[7637.40 --> 7648.44]  really not doing it from michael any plans start selling coffee mugs yeah matter of time i'm amazed
[7648.44 --> 7655.96]  we haven't done it yet it's kind of stupid i i'm yeah i'm pretty surprised it hasn't happened i don't
[7655.96 --> 7661.64]  know question for luke from anon do you have any advice running a software development or engineering
[7661.64 --> 7668.52]  org that's mostly or fully remote uh try to find people who are in the same time zone as you
[7669.16 --> 7676.20]  yeah time zones are more difficult than you might suspect um and if you're going to have someone
[7676.20 --> 7680.28]  that's yeah let's let's make it more about time zones because this is a topic that could go on for
[7680.28 --> 7685.56]  hours so we'll just talk about one one section of it um but time zones are tough uh
[7685.56 --> 7693.24]  if you're going to have someone who's going to be in a drastically different time zone uh you're
[7693.24 --> 7697.08]  going to need to have the right type of person that can work in that drastically different time
[7697.08 --> 7701.80]  so they need to they're going to need to be quite motivated on their own um and the team is going to
[7701.80 --> 7705.80]  need to be ready to work with them and they are going to need to be ready to work with the team and
[7705.80 --> 7714.52]  what i mean by that is both sides need to be uh good actors like if if they need to schedule a meeting
[7714.52 --> 7718.36]  if you need to work with someone because a lot of times you don't to be completely honest
[7718.92 --> 7723.72]  but if you do need to work with someone directly um both sides are going to need to play ball and
[7723.72 --> 7728.20]  play ball in a nice way to try to make it so that you're working around each other as best as possible
[7728.76 --> 7734.36]  if someone has to have a really bad sleep schedule one night maybe you trade off next time um just have
[7734.36 --> 7740.92]  that give and take act in good faith have give and take all that type of stuff um yeah i'll focus on
[7740.92 --> 7746.68]  just the time zones part i wouldn't worry too much about like plus or minus almost like five
[7747.40 --> 7755.00]  but once you start going beyond that it gets pretty pretty rough um and pick a time and try to be very
[7755.00 --> 7760.68]  logical about it for your meetings and then if it's and and then tell people in the interviewing
[7760.68 --> 7765.08]  process that are remote what that meeting time is because if they're just like oh that just like
[7765.08 --> 7770.84]  won't work with my my sleeping schedule or whatever well then guess it won't work
[7770.84 --> 7777.00]  it won't work yeah um but i don't know yeah i could go on for way too long so i'll just keep it to that
[7778.68 --> 7784.44]  question from josiah linus luke what do you think of used server hardware as a home server or nas is it
[7784.44 --> 7785.64]  a good idea do you have any input
[7785.64 --> 7790.28]  i have more things up but you can't see them
[7793.16 --> 7797.64]  yeah it's a good idea you won't get the same kind of power efficiency that you would out of modern
[7797.64 --> 7805.56]  hardware but what you will get is ample access to mountains mountains of discarded hardware from
[7805.56 --> 7813.88]  enterprise companies that it still works and was built to a level of quality where it was it was
[7813.88 --> 7819.48]  intended to function for longer than they ever intended to use it your problem that you might
[7819.48 --> 7824.04]  run into is motherboards yeah i wouldn't buy hard drives yeah hard drives would be a little sketch
[7824.04 --> 7829.48]  motherboards would be a little sketch but like cpus are well you're stuck with used motherboards if
[7829.48 --> 7835.08]  you're going to buy used cpus so no i know i'm just talking about resiliency though like your cpu is
[7835.08 --> 7840.44]  almost guaranteed to just make it but there will be mountains of other motherboards so yeah go for it
[7840.44 --> 7847.72]  yeah and you'll save so much that yeah some stuff will die and then you will go and you'll replace
[7847.72 --> 7851.80]  it and you might even learn something while you do it and you'll still be out ahead in all likelihood
[7853.48 --> 7860.36]  uh dylan didn't get the memo about sending merch messages by buying something on ltt store instead of
[7860.36 --> 7865.32]  sending super chats and sent twenty dollars as a super chat please don't do that anymore i have always
[7865.32 --> 7871.40]  wondered this why does lmg do a probation that prohibits uh video use and i'm assuming other
[7871.40 --> 7877.32]  things within lmg so the reason is that we don't want to create it's not video use it's credits like
[7877.32 --> 7884.20]  public public facing appearances and the reason that we have a probation is that in bc there is a 90 day
[7884.20 --> 7890.60]  period where either the employer or the employee can just say this isn't working out i'm glad we tried but
[7890.60 --> 7896.84]  i think it's time to part ways and as long as there isn't a committed relationship of any sort
[7896.84 --> 7902.12]  it doesn't make sense for us to have people in public facing roles where all of a sudden it's going
[7902.12 --> 7908.60]  to create a bunch of questions about why they departed it's just easier if we just make sure that
[7908.60 --> 7912.68]  someone's a good fit and that they're going to be here for the long term before we introduce them to
[7912.68 --> 7919.08]  the audience just has a lot of potential to create drama that is entirely unnecessary we've we've been
[7919.08 --> 7924.52]  burned by not adhering to the policy in the past and we are certainly never going to be making any
[7924.52 --> 7930.60]  exceptions to it in the future ever again there you go
[7934.76 --> 7940.68]  that's it for merch messages and that's it for the show thank you for tuning into the
[7940.68 --> 7958.12]  wanshow we will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel bye
[7958.12 --> 7975.88]  the show is brought to you by real optics squarespace and secret lab oops i uh hello
[7977.00 --> 7982.36]  how do i can i stop it still is this oh i got it no no i want to do it i want to do it
[7982.36 --> 7987.80]  you're moving my stuff wait it's oh it's just the range is dispen-
