[0.00 --> 7.26]  How you doing everyone and welcome to the WAN show we got a great show lined up for you guys
[7.26 --> 13.02]  today with some big changes new banner our producer Jake Bellavance now has a microphone
[13.02 --> 21.42]  hello everybody hey how about that and we have a lot of great topics for you first up
[21.42 --> 30.60]  the end of the GPU shortage is nigh knock on wood of course because the last thing I want to do
[30.60 --> 40.16]  is jinx this mess also we're definitely going to be talking a little bit about the uh video that went
[40.16 --> 46.84]  up yesterday yeah a lot of people had some questions about how that particular mess came to
[46.84 --> 55.92]  be I have some teasers for you guys we have locked in compensation for the head of LTT labs and we are
[55.92 --> 60.86]  going to be ready to announce a name next Friday on WAN show you guys are going to want to make sure
[60.86 --> 66.92]  you do not miss that I'm going to try to arrange to have this individual on the show to talk to you
[66.92 --> 72.50]  I've got some I've got some hints for you guys and I would love to see if any of you get it right so
[72.50 --> 76.62]  we'll be talking about that a little bit later what else we got today Apple meta discord and
[76.62 --> 83.24]  more tricked into giving user data to hackers posing as law enforcement zero dollars in the chat if
[83.24 --> 89.22]  you're able to guess who it is because you probably can also Sony takes on Xbox game pass with new
[89.22 --> 97.24]  PlayStation plus tears merges with PlayStation now oh yeah and e3 is cancelled oh no
[97.24 --> 124.14]  show is brought to you today by Squarespace Extra and Wealthfront all right obviously we're going to
[124.14 --> 130.76]  have to jump into our first big topic today the end of the GPU shortage that's right good news everyone
[130.76 --> 136.72]  the shortage hellhole that we've been living through may finally be coming to a close it seems
[136.72 --> 144.34]  that there are GPUs available at a number of stores multiple SKUs of GPUs in stock multiple price points I
[144.34 --> 150.08]  mean the pricing is still a little wild but ASUS came out and said they are dropping the MSRPs of their
[150.08 --> 157.64]  GPUs substantially and it would seem like if there are enough GPUs around people are going to stop
[157.64 --> 164.36]  paying exorbitant prices to scalpers which means that that that that that that competition things
[164.36 --> 171.32]  should start to get a little less wild don't take my word for it of course you can see for yourself
[171.32 --> 176.60]  I'm going to fire up microcenter.com here it's going to just do a quick screen share my boober we're
[176.60 --> 181.40]  already seeing the effects both from traditional retailers and from scalpers absolutely look at this
[181.40 --> 190.08]  3090 ti yes 2200 is a freaking lot of money but it's only 200 higher than the MSRP which isn't even that
[190.08 --> 197.24]  unusual for an FTW3 ultra version of a top tier GPU it's already going to be slightly higher than the
[197.24 --> 205.88]  factory version RTX 3070 ti remember this is a card that launched after Nvidia launched the 3000 series
[205.88 --> 215.36]  with MSRPs that were really aggressive so 3070 came in at 500 MSRP now the ti version is going today for
[215.36 --> 225.32]  okay 200 more so is it a little inflated yeah but it's not it's not crazy you know it's not as bad as it has
[225.32 --> 233.60]  been yes exactly it is better exactly man and you know what I feel like there's going to be a lot of
[233.60 --> 241.28]  people out there that are going yeah Linus whatever we know that you're running a 3090 and you can you
[241.28 --> 250.64]  know conjure a card if you feel like it or no I agree with them whatever Linus but here's the thing guys
[250.64 --> 257.78]  okay a we I actually bought more cards during this period than I ever have had to before
[258.92 --> 268.22]  it's true why because we decked out the editing den I actually bought a crap ton of super expensive GPUs
[268.22 --> 276.86]  so that sucked right and number two guys do you have any idea how hard it's been to do our job I've
[276.86 --> 282.62]  actually seen a lot of comments from people that noticed like hey you guys really pivoted your
[282.62 --> 290.00]  content a lot over the last 18 months because when nobody is excited about building PCs you gotta do
[290.00 --> 297.08]  someone else we gotta find we gotta find some way to to engage with people and people enjoy the bling
[297.08 --> 302.72]  content when there's a reasonable down step option that they can buy that is still really cool like
[302.72 --> 309.44]  it's fun to see uh like some halo pride it's fun to go look at some like brand new amazing car when
[309.44 --> 314.12]  you know that you can still afford a car from that brand maybe not the same one exactly when it's like
[314.12 --> 319.58]  basically impossible by anything at all then how why are you even gonna bother being a PC enthusiast for
[319.58 --> 325.28]  people that me where like I didn't used to back when I absorbed this type of content much more
[325.28 --> 330.08]  frequently back when I did that I would do it mostly around when I was making builds exactly I
[330.08 --> 334.58]  wasn't a fan viewer I was I was more like informational viewer informational viewers what you're not
[334.58 --> 338.84]  building computers anyways and like so why are you watching okay what's really cool about seeing the
[338.84 --> 343.64]  latest and greatest is that because especially the way that things have been progressing faster lately
[343.64 --> 349.28]  because of the way that computer technology continues to develop and get more exciting
[349.28 --> 356.96]  whatever you see that's latest and greatest shiny you know halo tier product well that's probably
[356.96 --> 363.56]  going to be available to you yeah as a mid-range product one cycle for two cycles down the road yeah
[363.56 --> 373.94]  and so when everything when even an entry-level enthusiast gaming card was completely unattainable to
[373.94 --> 380.84]  people I it just man it just sucked the fun out of it you know and for us too we're sitting there
[380.84 --> 388.10]  going what is even the point we can't not review a new GPU I'm not gonna be like Anthony don't even
[388.10 --> 392.24]  bother actually we did do that for one card I can't remember which one it was we were just like forget
[392.24 --> 397.58]  but not not for like big halo major releases stuff like that you gotta we can't just ignore them we
[397.58 --> 404.18]  have to we have to talk about them but how boring is it to talk about them and just go yeah everything's
[404.18 --> 412.52]  unreasonable this sucks it's this sucks we can only make a video that says yeah this sucks oh yeah so
[412.52 --> 418.10]  budget build guide this is like bottom of the line stuff it's gonna cost you $1,400 yeah it just it
[418.10 --> 429.92]  pulls the entire life force out of the gaming and the PC enthusiast communities so I I just yeah I'm I
[429.92 --> 437.12]  am so happy this is such a relief for me and the other thing too is like yeah I was able to get a
[437.12 --> 442.76]  card for my personal rig for sure but it's not like I don't have friends or neighbors that are affected by
[442.76 --> 449.72]  this whole situation we had the neighbor kid come over and he's just like hey Linus I got this I picked
[449.72 --> 455.06]  up this used PC on Craigslist he was basically trying to pull a scrapyard worse he picked up a
[455.06 --> 460.28]  used PC on Craigslist that was like pretty decent but didn't have a GPU and he's like and I realized that
[460.28 --> 469.52]  GPUs are totally unreasonable this sucks I'm like yeah man I it does suck because for years we've been
[469.52 --> 475.10]  adjusting people that that they pull their own scrapyard worse essentially go out buy used parts
[475.10 --> 480.38]  try to do all this kind of stuff but the used market is just destroyed yeah like it's it's brutal it's a
[480.38 --> 486.92]  totally really whack when it's technically cheaper to not go to the used market right like that's just oh
[486.92 --> 494.72]  that's an uncomfortable situation I've got a mind-blowing story for you our new our new place
[494.72 --> 504.50]  uh is let's just say could be a little bit challenging because the the road network that
[504.50 --> 510.68]  leads to it could be a little bit challenging to navigate in heavy snow and we don't get a ton
[510.68 --> 518.84]  of snow in Vancouver but for five ten years pretty much every year we've gotten at least one significant
[518.84 --> 524.90]  dump of snow that grinds the whole city to a halt unless you have a very capable vehicle and snow
[524.90 --> 531.92]  tires or chains and not being able to get in and out of my neighborhood is a bit of a problem for me
[531.92 --> 538.82]  so I started to exploit exploit I started to explore vehicle alternatives to our Honda Odyssey okay yeah
[538.82 --> 547.82]  Toyota's latest version of the Sienna their minivan actually has a it's a hybrid but it's weird it's
[547.82 --> 555.08]  like kind of in between a hybrid hybrid and a plug-in hybrid in that you do not plug it in but it can run
[555.08 --> 560.54]  on pure electric for very short periods interesting very strange okay all right so anyway but it's a
[560.54 --> 567.20]  hybrid not a plug-in hybrid but what it does have is it have is it has electric motor assisted selective
[567.20 --> 572.24]  all-wheel drive so if it detects a need for all-wheel drive it can actually go into all-wheel drive mode
[572.24 --> 577.28]  which would be great for being able not only that but we've taken up skiing with the kids
[577.28 --> 581.78]  and getting up and down the mountain I'd be a little more confident in all-wheel drive vehicle
[581.78 --> 588.80]  but I'm not ready to give up that minivan life because sliding doors man oh trust me okay when
[588.80 --> 596.24]  you're a dad you want doors to go like this okay not like this like this yeah can you manually go into
[596.24 --> 602.24]  all-wheel drive as well or is it just automatic I don't know but it's definitely better than not
[602.24 --> 607.28]  being able to do it at all not at all okay uh brutal George and twitch chat says snow tires
[607.28 --> 613.46]  greater than all-wheel drive absolutely we do that too but snow tires plus all-wheel drive definitely
[613.46 --> 620.96]  definitely a thing to do so I went to the Toyota dealership I knew that I was okay a there isn't a
[620.96 --> 624.42]  single Toyota dealership I called literally all of them it's like there's like nine of them in the
[624.42 --> 630.74]  lower mainland not a single one had a 2022 Odyssey on the lot not for sale even on the lot physically on
[630.74 --> 637.24]  the lot nothing not a single one so that's hilarious number two when I went in I was already
[637.24 --> 645.14]  aware of this but I was told that it is anywhere from a six to eight month wait if you get lucky to
[645.14 --> 650.78]  a two-year wait for the top tier model which conveniently wasn't the one I wanted anyway
[650.78 --> 659.36]  and get this the sales guy and he really like had no reason to lie to me about this because he's like
[659.36 --> 665.42]  yeah you're gonna be waiting a very long time um so I understand if you don't want to I had someone
[665.42 --> 670.40]  call in earlier and they they canceled their reservation because they bought a last year's
[670.40 --> 680.06]  model used for ten thousand dollars over MSRP sticker price so vehicle scalping oh that's the new meta okay
[680.06 --> 689.18]  that's what we've come to vehicle scalping imagine paying imagine like what timeline is this where you
[689.18 --> 700.16]  drive off the dealer's lot and your car appreciates 10 grand it's weird man get this it might get worse I
[700.16 --> 706.46]  went to go drive my girlfriend's car the other day mm-hmm and uh Chris Prime she yeah she she expressed
[706.46 --> 714.14]  concern uh because if I crashed it or whatever and I was like if I crashed it'd be my fault like I would
[714.14 --> 719.60]  I'm not gonna just like leave you to try to figure out getting a new car when it's my fault and she's
[719.60 --> 726.02]  like no no no no I'm not worried about that you wouldn't be able to get one and I was like oh so
[726.02 --> 733.94]  when I went shopping for the car for my aunt and uncle uh they settled on the Mitsubishi Outlander
[733.94 --> 739.04]  plug-in hybrid okay and because I told them I was like look I know you're not I know you're not
[739.04 --> 743.42]  comfortable going full electric like Yvonne's parents because we did cars for both of them they've both
[743.42 --> 748.16]  done so much for us over the years and it really felt like it was just the right thing to do that
[748.16 --> 752.90]  both of them have done so much child care uh they'll go shopping they'll spend four hundred dollars on
[752.90 --> 758.30]  groceries for us like load us up on you know school lunch stuff and and you know everything we need and
[758.30 --> 765.08]  they'll like not take money from us so we were just it was time to give back anyway the point is um
[765.08 --> 770.96]  I told them look I understand if you're not comfortable going full electric if you're kind of
[770.96 --> 777.68]  not ready for that paradigm shift yet but trust me you want something plug-in hybrid I'm not going
[777.68 --> 783.62]  to let you buy something that's just gas and I actually I had some people who were quite critical
[783.62 --> 789.12]  of the way that I ultimately steered them and that they steered themselves like we went to see a lot of
[789.12 --> 794.42]  different options of full electric and plug-in hybrid and they settled on the Mitsubishi Outlander
[794.42 --> 803.24]  plug-in hybrid and people like oh a Mitsubishi I tell you what right now they are laughing with gas
[803.24 --> 810.44]  prices being what they are and get this at the Toyota dealership morbid curiosity I asked because this was
[810.44 --> 814.30]  one of the other vehicles they were considering waiting for and they were looking at I asked what's
[814.30 --> 823.66]  the lead time on the RAV4 Prime guess year and a half oh you're not even close mr. Lafreniere way too
[823.66 --> 834.46]  low oh you're way too low three years three to five years what the heck now I I don't I don't think
[834.46 --> 840.22]  that it will actually take five years that seems like it was long enough that they were just like
[840.22 --> 845.50]  whatever just make it a really big number so that people are either buckled in for the extreme long
[845.50 --> 851.56]  term or not at all yeah or they just won't get on the list because we do not need more people on this
[851.56 --> 861.88]  list exactly yeah oh man yeah can you imagine making your car purchasing decision five years in advance
[861.88 --> 873.16]  literally hyper cars do not have lead times like that yeah that's nuts so uh both both my aunt and
[873.16 --> 880.24]  uncle and Yvonne's parents my in-laws their cars the Model Y and the Outlander plug-in hybrid if they
[880.24 --> 885.34]  were to turn around and sell them today they're worth more than what they paid I think Brandon was saying
[885.34 --> 891.82]  his Model X that he bought like four years ago or whatever um he saw one on Facebook Marketplace that
[891.82 --> 900.10]  is like almost exactly what he paid for it oh my goodness right with the similar mileage it's insane
[900.10 --> 905.68]  right now I wonder how long this is gonna last for because like well I've seen pictures a long time ago
[905.68 --> 910.66]  of like a whole bunch of I don't know if I think they're f-150s but it was some type of Ford truck yeah
[910.66 --> 916.24]  there's just fields of them uh and they weren't able to be sold because they were fully built except for
[916.24 --> 922.84]  certain electronics yep um and so like is are they gonna get a big windfall of those electronics and
[922.84 --> 927.04]  then be able to sell these things or like what's actually gonna happen I don't know it's been rough
[927.04 --> 934.12]  I don't know man it's been rough yeah this is if this keeps going for a lot it was it was the F-150
[934.12 --> 938.80]  and the Explorer okay uh if this keeps going for much longer like it's just gonna get worse especially
[938.80 --> 942.22]  with people with the gas prices going how they are and stuff like that people are gonna want to
[942.22 --> 947.02]  file into the electric field and there's even lower production for that overall yeah so it's
[947.02 --> 953.50]  just yeah it's gonna be bad it's gonna be it's gonna be a freaking mess I mean my volts worth almost
[953.50 --> 958.96]  what I paid for it and I bought that thing like five years ago yeah five years ago I I have I've put
[958.96 --> 965.38]  tens of thousands of miles on it and it's still worth pretty much what I paid that's crazy man if
[965.38 --> 974.50]  Chevy was still making the volt they would be I wish they were killing it yeah right now yeah they
[974.50 --> 980.86]  would be killing it do you think it was just like before it's time yeah I do yeah I mean I think I said
[980.86 --> 986.68]  that at the time yeah when I did the review of it I was so bullish on it I was so positive because it's
[986.68 --> 993.16]  got so much of the benefit of ice which is that you could just go on a road trip spur of the moment you
[993.16 --> 999.34]  will up in seconds it's an ice car effectively but it's got so much of the benefit of an electric
[999.34 --> 1007.86]  car off the line it actually you get that immediate response um you go short distances or yeah sense
[1007.86 --> 1013.68]  between yeah between 70 and 100 kilometers on full electric before you even have to turn on the gasoline
[1013.68 --> 1021.54]  engine yeah like it's it's kind of an amazing car and even when the even when your battery is depleted
[1021.54 --> 1027.14]  you'll still get regenerative braking you will still it'll still operate as a hybrid you fuel economy is
[1027.14 --> 1033.96]  like crazy good yeah yeah and I just it drives me so no I don't drive a bolt a bolt with the v that
[1033.96 --> 1044.76]  was such stupid branding that's rough yep yeah I loved I love the mold just ah just sucks and and you don't
[1044.76 --> 1051.48]  need as much lithium to build them so you don't have to do as much damaging lithium mining per number
[1051.48 --> 1055.86]  of cars that you're building because you're not you don't have to build in this gigantic range exactly
[1055.86 --> 1062.28]  yeah exactly I love the idea of hybrids and I know Canada has announced like they want they want a hundred
[1062.28 --> 1067.68]  percent EV sales by I think it's like 2035 this isn't in the doc so I might get something slightly
[1067.68 --> 1072.96]  wrong um and they have like percentage targets moving up to that date and all this kind of stuff and I was
[1072.96 --> 1079.02]  looking at that being like yeah like EV sound really good um that's a lot of production overhaul
[1079.02 --> 1083.82]  to finish and I know there's okay 15 years whatever it's still a lot of production overall
[1083.82 --> 1088.98]  finish yeah fully re-kitting entire factories it's really expensive and really time consuming
[1088.98 --> 1092.82]  and never mind the factories where's all that lithium gonna come from where's all the lithium
[1092.82 --> 1097.62]  I know there's other battery technologies coming up but I haven't seen anything else actually
[1097.62 --> 1102.06]  going into production right battery tech takes a long time to actually get in the field I was
[1102.06 --> 1107.70]  reading about how the copper industry copper mining industry figures they need something like a hundred
[1107.70 --> 1113.70]  billion dollars with a B worth of investment to meet the growing demand for the next eight years or
[1113.70 --> 1120.36]  something like that like it's not trivial you don't just oh yeah today I want to do this now we'd like
[1120.36 --> 1126.12]  to have twice as much copper than yesterday yeah it doesn't work like that these are these are projects
[1126.12 --> 1134.88]  that need to be started with five-year roadmaps to regulatory approvals and build out and completion
[1134.88 --> 1141.84]  and until they're actually online right it's not trivial yeah but I was reading that kind of looking
[1141.84 --> 1146.58]  at it just hope hoping but I don't think so that they're actually including plug-in hybrids with that
[1146.58 --> 1150.96]  but I don't think they are I think they want pure EVs and I'm like I don't that doesn't seem great I'm
[1150.96 --> 1158.22]  far more interested in plug-in hybrid I don't know me too I love it I love it if I was buying a car
[1158.22 --> 1163.02]  right now I would be aiming at a plug-in hybrid yeah when when I was telling Luke I was thinking of
[1163.02 --> 1170.34]  getting myself like something stupid you know get a Taycan or remember the the crazy hyper car we talked
[1170.34 --> 1176.16]  about yeah yeah it had been uh the nevera the name's easy to remember because it's pretty close
[1176.16 --> 1184.14]  to what my wife said to me when I asked if I could have one that's pretty good um uh yeah so Luke was
[1184.14 --> 1191.94]  like hey uh are you getting rid of your whole yeah it's interesting I my the only reason why I didn't
[1191.94 --> 1196.44]  really is that I just drive so infrequently yeah that's fair but that's what the volts perfect for
[1196.44 --> 1201.00]  that's true the maintenance is like way less you don't spin up that gasoline engine except you
[1201.00 --> 1205.74]  just wasn't sure like how much I'd have to pay like if I sell my car and buy that one like how
[1205.74 --> 1212.04]  much is that loss and yeah there's taxation and all that all that ugly stuff uh chasing souls is
[1212.04 --> 1217.98]  remeck never gonna have one yeah pretty much I hear ya I hear ya hey is it not fun to dream though
[1217.98 --> 1224.40]  you know how much that thing goes for too much two million euro too much yeah yeah that's that's
[1224.40 --> 1233.82]  one way of putting it anyway looking at 3dcenter.org we can see there is the biggest availability and
[1233.82 --> 1239.82]  lowest prices on GPUs in two years and the prices will have to drop further for the cards to keep
[1239.82 --> 1246.48]  selling in addition uh the previous American administration stupid tariffs uh were lifted and
[1246.48 --> 1254.34]  asus GPUs are set to drop by 25 percent so here's the discussion question from Alex Clark do you think
[1254.34 --> 1261.54]  the prices will actually stay down I'm a bit concerned that Nvidia AMD and everyone else so
[1261.54 --> 1266.70]  Intel I guess is the everyone else in the GPU market has realized that people will pay much
[1266.70 --> 1274.86]  higher prices for GPUs than they originally thought I think we were I think we were already seeing this
[1274.86 --> 1281.76]  trend I think we've been seeing this trend over the last like four or five years five years I mean I'd
[1281.76 --> 1288.96]  be seeing this trend the first time we saw a thousand dollar GPU if I recall correctly was the 8800 Ultra and
[1288.96 --> 1297.48]  that was over 10 years ago and so the idea of a thousand and remember that was a thousand dollars MSRP so
[1297.48 --> 1302.46]  FTWs and whatever they were eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars what year did Intel do that
[1302.46 --> 1306.86]  massive jump on their extreme editions that was with the
[1306.86 --> 1317.16]  was it the 5000 series I think you might be right I think it might have been the 6000 series so
[1317.16 --> 1323.54]  that's when it felt like it was very heated up for me that's when like prices on a lot of different
[1323.54 --> 1329.60]  things were jumping quite quite heavily um so yeah I don't know I I don't think it's gonna like
[1329.60 --> 1333.68]  fully reset to where it was I do think it's going to come down
[1335.60 --> 1343.82]  could it even come down more could the the less price sensitive consumers have already gone in and
[1343.82 --> 1349.70]  now it's the people who are like oh I'm a wait I think the I think the less price sensitive consumers
[1349.70 --> 1356.60]  are people that go in repeatedly that's fair right so they might just go in again when 4000 series launches which is
[1356.60 --> 1362.60]  going to happen this year so I we're gonna see Intel Arc launch this year we're gonna see uh the next uh
[1362.60 --> 1369.32]  AMD cards launch this year what we might see is that at the very high end there's a less less of a
[1369.32 --> 1375.14]  lowering than on the lower end if that makes sense oh Celsius corrects me the 8800 Ultra wasn't a thousand
[1375.14 --> 1379.40]  dollars the original Titan was you know what that I sorry I screwed that up it was probably a thousand
[1379.40 --> 1384.38]  dollars Canadian because I was working at NCIX at the time so I would have priced a card at a thousand
[1384.38 --> 1388.64]  dollars but uh that would not have been a thousand dollars for our Americans yes thank you very much
[1388.64 --> 1395.00]  yes it was the Titan and the justification for that was the Titan had more workstation like capabilities
[1395.00 --> 1400.10]  and then they just stripped it and then that was when they were like oh it's not a gamer card that's
[1400.10 --> 1405.08]  so expensive it's a Titan card it's different yeah and then that whole thing went completely out the
[1405.08 --> 1408.80]  window they were like for that Nvidia you want the best for gaming by Titan well they figured out
[1408.80 --> 1414.14]  everyone buying them was gamers anyway so and then they could charge more for the professional one so
[1414.14 --> 1424.52]  whatever what was the original Titan Nvidia gonna Nvidia the original Titan was 999 if I recall
[1424.52 --> 1430.70]  yeah yeah trying to look up anything with Titan is so annoying good news then GPUs finally coming
[1430.70 --> 1439.58]  down yeah but there's bad news oh the price of silicon wafers is projected to increase by 25% by 2025 TSMC
[1439.58 --> 1447.02]  has raised prices Intel is coming into the third-party fab game I'm super excited about that but don't
[1447.02 --> 1452.78]  celebrate just yet because part of Intel bringing all those fabs online I mean have you guys seen the way
[1452.78 --> 1458.72]  that Intel is I wouldn't say taking a beating on Wall Street but they are certainly not a Wall Street
[1458.72 --> 1465.86]  darling right now and there's concern that CEO Pat Gelsinger is just you know whoa he's spending so much
[1465.86 --> 1472.46]  on new fabs will there be a return they're gonna have to make that back they're not gonna come in and
[1472.46 --> 1481.16]  undercut everybody right like they're building more fabs because we need more capacity even if prices go up
[1481.16 --> 1490.04]  and I okay okay I do not do stock tips this is not investment advice I think Intel strategy is
[1490.04 --> 1494.30]  awesome and I think they're gonna kill it I think it's just one of those things that's a longer term
[1494.30 --> 1505.58]  play then you know your your investment TV host is prepared to advise based on I'm bullish I own but I own no
[1505.58 --> 1512.34]  Intel stock I have no plans to take an Intel stock position the only investment that I have outside of
[1512.34 --> 1518.66]  Linus Media Group Inc Creator Warehouse Inc float plane media Inc okay like companies that I and Yvonne
[1518.66 --> 1525.56]  control is framework okay so I I own my hundred whatever thousand dollars of framework or two hundred
[1525.56 --> 1529.46]  thousand dollars of framework that should give you some idea by the way how much it's affecting our content
[1529.46 --> 1534.38]  I don't actually remember how much it was that that was a conscious decision I want it to be out of
[1534.38 --> 1539.90]  sight out of mind I don't want it to be about the appreciation I just I hope they've achieved their
[1539.90 --> 1547.88]  mission that's all yeah I mean if I make money great I like making money you know but I'm not thinking
[1547.88 --> 1554.54]  about it but I like I like what Intel's doing that's that's what I have to say about that but fabs online when
[1554.54 --> 1560.06]  there isn't enough capacity to other fabs makes sense it makes sense but it costs a freaking lot
[1560.06 --> 1564.32]  of money yeah uh man this video still hasn't come out yet you know what I'm gonna give you guys a
[1564.32 --> 1570.98]  teaser because those Intel those Intel fab videos they've taken a lot of layers of legal review okay a
[1570.98 --> 1579.02]  lot of a lot of rounds blurring and and small edits but they showed us this is crazy one of the
[1579.02 --> 1585.26]  construction projects that they have going right now they literally built their own concrete factory
[1585.26 --> 1593.02]  on the corner of the lot because that's they were gonna need so much concrete that rather than trucking
[1593.02 --> 1604.94]  it in they just make it there okay big brain big brain okay hey man gas is expensive oh I love it
[1604.94 --> 1610.46]  guys those tours are gonna be wild don't miss them when they finally get uploaded it'll happen
[1610.46 --> 1618.14]  eventually oh uh anyway there's more bad news uh as more foundries are getting built uh in Europe and
[1618.14 --> 1622.70]  the US there's greater demand for wafers but the wafer making companies don't have plans to expand as
[1622.70 --> 1628.94]  quickly as the foundries are being made yep oh that's a big problem right the supply of actual wafers oh
[1628.94 --> 1637.50]  balls currently almost all wafers are sold through 2024 and some suppliers have said that all their
[1637.50 --> 1646.06]  wafers are sold through 2026 so for those not familiar the wafers are cut from the silicon ingots
[1646.06 --> 1652.46]  which are these giant like 150 pound okay that's in the videos too but we actually show a full ingot
[1652.46 --> 1658.38]  it's crazy really cool yeah it's wild um that's sweet so they're sliced from an ingot and there's
[1658.38 --> 1664.22]  these crazy super pure silicon it's not just like yeah just go to the beach you know grind up some
[1664.22 --> 1671.66]  freaking sand there's your silicon boys don't work like that so there's no there's no wafers even if
[1671.66 --> 1678.46]  you have a fab which is great i guess um however even if wafers do go up that should only be a you know
[1678.46 --> 1684.86]  few percent increase in cost but it it does mean it will go up um anthony also says hey don't forget
[1684.86 --> 1691.42]  about neon recent geopolitical events have affected the worldwide supply of neon which is an important
[1691.42 --> 1698.22]  material it's a noble gas okay important material in the production of microprocessors and the biggest
[1698.22 --> 1710.14]  worldwide supplier of neon happens to be ukraine yeah so um i think i speak for everyone i when i say um
[1710.14 --> 1716.86]  you putin putin i like it yeah but you know what i don't even care i don't even care what your name
[1716.86 --> 1722.54]  is i hope history forgets you i don't but that would be great yeah well yeah we should learn from
[1722.54 --> 1728.70]  probably not actually yeah we probably should not yeah we should learn from mistakes but i i yeah i just
[1729.42 --> 1737.50]  yeah right there buddy yeah hell yeah uh and obviously that is the least of the problems being caused by
[1737.50 --> 1743.58]  what's going on over there just it's disgusting is pretty much all i have to say for that i condemn
[1743.58 --> 1748.22]  i condemn aggression in any form so yeah yeah
[1751.42 --> 1757.26]  in other news are we do we have any topics about april fool's day jokes that aren't our own
[1757.90 --> 1762.06]  no i actually usually usually the wan show april fool's day episode has like
[1763.18 --> 1766.78]  reviewing all the other people's april fool's day stuff but i don't think there's like any
[1768.06 --> 1772.30]  i actually didn't look that closely at anyone's other than corsairs because corsairs
[1772.86 --> 1779.82]  uh so funny they actually sent us a working one what so even though what it is it's the one percent keyboard
[1783.10 --> 1788.94]  we have uh we have an ltd short on it i shot it with our our new social i think our
[1788.94 --> 1795.50]  new social guy yeah the k1 rgb our new social guy uh is off probation in like two weeks so you guys will be meeting him very soon
[1795.50 --> 1800.14]  guys will be meeting him very soon i love that it has a wrist rest it totally does
[1801.66 --> 1812.30]  totally does uh this is interesting how do you find a short on the web version of youtube
[1812.30 --> 1819.34]  i don't know i have no i oh here it is okay it eventually shows up here this compact keyboard
[1819.34 --> 1823.26]  is great for gaming ladies and gentlemen we're gonna watch a short together
[1823.26 --> 1827.26]  king of gaming keyboards all right
[1830.30 --> 1832.38]  keyboard for the one percent okay very expensive
[1832.38 --> 1837.58]  i game on it by the way
[1839.74 --> 1845.82]  oh before i game i have to go to corsair.com wait is there no there's no timeline you can't you can't scrub
[1846.94 --> 1851.82]  oh that's so stupid shorts are an amazing feature yeah why can't you scrub
[1852.86 --> 1856.86]  that sucks you missed me going to corsair.com though luke
[1856.86 --> 1862.14]  okay wait for it wait for it i gotta get the drivers i gotta get the drivers okay
[1863.02 --> 1869.18]  okay okay gotta go to corsair.com here we go corsair.com apparently it's here here oh we have
[1869.18 --> 1875.10]  it all right thanks jono yeah here you go luke you can you can witness it in person the only key you'll
[1875.10 --> 1883.02]  ever need wow beautiful absolutely beautiful shorts on float plane win uh i don't think we're
[1883.02 --> 1886.78]  working on that don't think we have pretty much any interest in that actually yeah for the time
[1886.78 --> 1891.34]  being you can just release a short video if you wanted we're not algorithm based so like
[1892.38 --> 1896.86]  just release a short video it doesn't make a difference we probably should like upload them
[1896.86 --> 1900.94]  or something maybe with no notifications so that people don't oh they're asking for you guys okay i
[1900.94 --> 1906.38]  thought they meant like the feature i was like yeah yeah fair enough i don't want to work on i don't
[1906.38 --> 1910.70]  want to work on that we can just we can just have you how do you open this box i'm sure you'll figure
[1910.70 --> 1918.30]  it out eventually in the meantime i want to give you guys some teasers the lab the lab project is
[1918.30 --> 1926.62]  very much underway we have two people that are already in office right now we have deals not maybe
[1926.62 --> 1935.02]  inked but at least penciled with at least two more and the head of the lab i am ready to give you guys
[1935.02 --> 1946.46]  some hints so number one it is not dr ian cutras ian already came out with a video on his channel
[1946.46 --> 1951.42]  uh tech tech potato you guys should go check it out his new venture is called more than moore
[1952.30 --> 1960.86]  and he's in kind of an independent analyst role so that's what ian's up to so i will drop some more
[1960.86 --> 1969.58]  hints though that will hopefully get you guys a little bit closer okay it's a former written media
[1969.58 --> 1976.38]  superstar from like the the mid 2000s i genuinely don't think that's going to help very many people
[1976.38 --> 1979.58]  you don't think that's going to help very many people it will help some people but i genuinely
[1979.58 --> 1986.94]  think most of the audience is not okay white guy nerdy yeah that's probably not that helpful either
[1986.94 --> 1996.22]  yeah no really in the tech industry in the mid 2000s shut up this is amazingly perfectly overbuilt
[1996.22 --> 2007.34]  by the way i know right this is this is great sorry keep going um okay they are a veteran of one of the
[2007.34 --> 2017.90]  the big three tech sites in the u.s uh they are relocating to canada all right they do not have a
[2017.90 --> 2025.50]  prickly personality there's some people guessing someone that has a very prickly personality and it
[2025.50 --> 2031.26]  is not that particular person uh who i have had my disagreements with over the years but i think we're
[2031.26 --> 2039.90]  in a pretty good place now so uh hey if you're out there um i think we chill right buddy it is not
[2040.54 --> 2044.22]  it's not steve from gamers nexus steve's doing his own thing
[2047.02 --> 2053.34]  and i don't think i've seen it i will give one more hint they are currently uh oh no i'm not going
[2053.34 --> 2057.66]  to give that hint yeah that's too much i'm not going to give that hint um so far i think it would be
[2057.66 --> 2063.34]  really hard if you gave that one it's like yeah i i need it to be pretty hard yeah because i think
[2063.34 --> 2070.22]  there are still people that this particular person works with that do not know yet right and and they
[2070.22 --> 2075.42]  should be they should be the one to tell them right they should be the one to tell them i probably
[2075.42 --> 2079.98]  wouldn't go that much further then yeah i'm not going to go any further i'm super excited to tell you
[2079.98 --> 2090.54]  that and guess what next week we will announce it for real i'm hoping to have this person on the show
[2090.54 --> 2095.66]  oh nice yeah which would be really exciting where we can talk a little bit about the vision for
[2095.66 --> 2100.22]  the lab so they wouldn't physically be here right no they'd have to call in i think they're not up here
[2100.22 --> 2107.66]  until uh late this month i should talk to i've got a i've got a buddy who works on this like remote
[2107.66 --> 2110.46]  call thing that's supposed to be better for streaming so maybe i'll talk to him but cool
[2110.46 --> 2115.90]  that would be that would be awesome yeah no i have not given a name before what's the matter
[2117.66 --> 2125.98]  huh oh excited and i don't think i saw people guess which is good yeah all right i mean i don't know
[2125.98 --> 2131.90]  maybe maybe uh maybe he's not as big a heavy hitter as i thought it's just been a while maybe i overpaid
[2131.90 --> 2146.54]  jk we good we good jk uh speaking of uh totally paid the appropriate amount sponsor spots uh let's
[2146.54 --> 2152.62]  do one more topic first okay okay let's do one more topic uh let's do your uh your your social
[2152.62 --> 2159.26]  engineering topic here social engineering topic yeah oh yeah let me find it apple meta discord and more
[2159.26 --> 2166.30]  tricked into giving user data to hackers posing as law enforcement on wednesday bloomborg bloomborg
[2167.74 --> 2174.86]  bloomberg will be assimilated hi i am michael bloomberg i am president of everything now jk i'm not
[2174.86 --> 2182.30]  president of anything what a campaign he ran though but right yeah bloomberg reported that large tech
[2182.30 --> 2188.78]  services companies like apple and facebook gave user data to hackers who forged emergency data requests
[2188.78 --> 2195.18]  or edrs uh edrs are used to bypass warrants and subpoenas orders signed by a judge in cases of
[2195.18 --> 2202.14]  imminent danger to get subscriber information that tech companies hold hackers uh with some now a part
[2202.14 --> 2210.62]  of lapsus wow stunning uh posed as law enforcement submitting edrs using hacked email domains in 2021 the
[2210.62 --> 2216.78]  fake requests are made to appear legitimate of course uh using forged signatures of real or fictional law
[2216.78 --> 2223.90]  enforcement officers data released as a result of edrs include ip addresses phone numbers and home
[2223.90 --> 2230.30]  addresses that's a lot apple in particular is commonly cited as being more privacy focused than other
[2230.30 --> 2236.94]  competitors uh and now has a non-zero amount of egg on its face after heavily advertising uh that what
[2236.94 --> 2243.66]  happens on your iphone stays on your iphone stuff uh it's i mean the second apple agreed to have a data
[2243.66 --> 2251.82]  center where all their chinese user data is stored basically run by the chinese government you knew
[2251.82 --> 2258.54]  that what they were saying was just obvious yeah so why do we even acknowledge apple's privacy messaging
[2258.54 --> 2263.74]  at this phones are not secure devices none of them why do we i don't i don't get it it's like their
[2263.74 --> 2271.90]  environmental messaging just ignore it yeah in one ear out the other ignore it if you like the product buy
[2271.90 --> 2278.30]  the product but understand you're just buying the product that's it life is constant pvp you have to
[2278.30 --> 2284.14]  understand that a lot of these companies like they're they are they are paying an actively large amount
[2284.14 --> 2291.66]  of people to go against what you should probably be wishing for yep and trying to to fight you and and
[2291.66 --> 2297.02]  push you into situations where you think differently uh in in a beneficial way for them anyways moving forward
[2297.02 --> 2304.38]  uh in response to the news meta said we review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced
[2304.38 --> 2310.78]  systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse um although that clearly
[2310.78 --> 2314.46]  didn't work so that's a very interesting statement to follow that up with um
[2317.18 --> 2319.98]  one second no um
[2319.98 --> 2321.98]  um
[2323.66 --> 2328.22]  yeah so there's some discussion questions here how can we trust tech companies you can't to respect the
[2328.22 --> 2333.02]  private information they collect uh if they can be conned into releasing it to anyone who claims to be a cop
[2333.02 --> 2341.34]  well you can't in the first place um because if it's digitally transmitted at all there's there's potential
[2341.34 --> 2347.18]  zero days there's potential whatever they could be like a lot of these companies are actually extremely good at security
[2347.18 --> 2353.82]  just to like just to be completely honest yeah i mean the fact that the that the point of ingress was
[2353.82 --> 2361.42]  social engineering tells you that their digital security might actually be great good but humans
[2361.42 --> 2365.98]  will always humans are always fly in the ointment and this sounds like pretty advanced
[2367.18 --> 2373.50]  social engineering yeah um uh but you just yeah you just shouldn't you shouldn't inherently just trust
[2373.50 --> 2379.42]  anybody with your private information you should you should try to be as careful with it as possible
[2380.06 --> 2387.02]  um should edr's exist whoa do the potential benefits of catching criminals outweigh the risk
[2387.02 --> 2393.90]  for consumers i think that's maybe not the question for us yeah i i i didn't even know about them until
[2393.90 --> 2399.34]  today so i think weighing in on them is i am unprepared i think it's finally time for us to do
[2399.34 --> 2404.14]  the de-google-ify your life video it's going to be a ton of work and i don't think it'll get a ton
[2404.14 --> 2409.42]  of views because by and large people are not interested in it they want convenience but how to
[2409.42 --> 2417.82]  run your own as you know your own dropbox on your own nas on your own network and just have everything be
[2418.54 --> 2424.22]  walled off from big tech i think is just something we need to we need to just kind of
[2424.22 --> 2431.02]  even in those situations i don't want to like those those self-hosted dropbox things that's still
[2431.02 --> 2435.90]  running some form of software people are still going to be able to find zero days for it yeah
[2435.90 --> 2441.26]  okay yes if it's on the internet nothing you can fully say sure there's nothing you can do about a
[2441.26 --> 2447.58]  zero day that's fair enough but when we're talking individuals i think the obscurity of the target is
[2447.58 --> 2455.90]  helps a lot a a great degree of protection it not entirely no no you're right so by that logic nobody
[2455.90 --> 2460.78]  would be looking at people's unsecured webcams but they do yeah exactly so i hear sometimes you
[2460.78 --> 2465.50]  can just sniff out targets and it's not even people actively doing it they'll find a zero day be able to
[2465.50 --> 2469.34]  sniff out targets and they'll just scatter shot and grab everything they can and maybe there's some
[2469.34 --> 2476.86]  banking information maybe there's some other stuff whatever but you know at least you're at least you're
[2476.86 --> 2483.10]  doing your due diligence at least you're doing something yeah you know so yeah i think we
[2483.10 --> 2489.50]  definitely gotta we gotta we gotta tackle that we gotta do that um discussion question number two
[2490.06 --> 2494.70]  this is should we have ever trusted our private info to these companies to begin with no and anthony
[2494.70 --> 2499.90]  actually put his notes in here and that's why i no longer use most big tech services if possible i mean
[2499.90 --> 2506.70]  one thing that i will say from personal experience i'm not going to give too much detail but i i mean
[2506.70 --> 2510.62]  i think i should talk a little bit about this experience i think people not talking about it just
[2510.62 --> 2515.90]  allows scammers free reign i think you shouldn't go into very much okay i won't go into very much detail
[2515.90 --> 2526.22]  but uh my wife and i were recently victims of wire fraud and the point of ingress was a company that we
[2526.22 --> 2533.50]  worked with that uh had just company that you worked with oh yeah i'm not going to say who they what they
[2533.50 --> 2539.58]  do okay but i'm going to say what happened was uh a third party gained access to their email system
[2540.38 --> 2550.94]  full access so what they did was they basically as far as we can tell they chilled in there for an extended
[2550.94 --> 2557.18]  period of time yeah watching yeah once you got access you don't act right away so they chilled in
[2557.18 --> 2565.26]  there they watched incoming things that were happening they watched who the clients were they they when
[2565.26 --> 2574.62]  they reached out to to us it was in the tone and style of writing that we were accustomed to the from
[2574.62 --> 2582.06]  domain was correct because they had full access to the email system our messages going to them were
[2582.06 --> 2590.54]  being diverted and then were being replied to from the correct domain and seemingly from the correct
[2590.54 --> 2598.54]  people even just like which that's going to get past so much like common practices for for for
[2598.54 --> 2603.82]  sniffing these types of things out absolutely because a lot of people will like okay uh this is a little
[2603.82 --> 2608.62]  suspicious in terms of the request or whatever so i'm going to jump in i'm going to check this domain
[2608.62 --> 2613.18]  i'm going to check these keys i'm going to do whatever but they had all that stuff which is crazy
[2613.18 --> 2619.18]  and so you know the conversation that yvonne and i had i'm not even going to say who ultimately was
[2619.18 --> 2627.34]  the one who sent the wire to what was ultimately a fraudulent address uh you know the other of us basically said
[2628.78 --> 2633.42]  could have been me too could have easily been me this is very sophisticated um
[2633.42 --> 2640.38]  apparently this is called business email compromise it has a name so there you go um and
[2641.90 --> 2649.98]  the good news is that through methods that i am not going to get into any detail uh even though some
[2649.98 --> 2659.26]  time passed before we were made aware uh we have been able to freeze the funds and we are currently
[2659.26 --> 2669.10]  working through the fraud team x some fraud team and legal authorities on getting it returned to us so
[2670.14 --> 2677.74]  our sincere hope is that we are going to come out of this without learning a very expensive lesson but i
[2677.74 --> 2684.94]  will also say that we will absolutely be putting more measures in place for any wire that goes out any
[2684.94 --> 2694.86]  payment that goes out because a wire is it's very challenging to recall it's basically like sending cash
[2695.34 --> 2703.74]  yeah effectively so um kevin close in floatplane chat says wife and i work for a bank and we deal with this stuff
[2703.74 --> 2712.38]  more and more recently yeah yeah it's a it's i i basically what i said when the thing happened was that i
[2712.38 --> 2720.62]  you know i've never i've never encountered a scam so convincing this is this is so many tears above
[2721.50 --> 2725.74]  you know i'm a nigerian prince locked in jail all i need is for you to post
[2725.74 --> 2732.94]  post bail for me and i will send you a million dollars right like that this level of sophistication
[2733.50 --> 2739.58]  is incredible and i the reason that i want to talk about it is that i have talked the talk in the past
[2739.58 --> 2747.82]  about how important it is for people who are victims of fraud and and scams to not be ashamed and not
[2748.54 --> 2754.14]  keep it to themselves because it's so important to get the word out there and i feel like even though i
[2754.14 --> 2760.46]  haven't given all of the details because i don't want to i don't want to dox anybody i don't want to
[2760.46 --> 2767.18]  get anybody in any kind of additional hassle you know um i've given you guys enough details that in
[2767.18 --> 2772.86]  your daily dealings and if you share this story with other people that you know hopefully they can
[2772.86 --> 2777.34]  put additional measures in place that will help protect them from it because it was a really
[2777.34 --> 2783.98]  sophisticated attack yeah and this this technically actually does not solve all the problems but
[2783.98 --> 2789.26]  picking up the phone is helpful they can change the phone number in which was done yeah that's
[2789.26 --> 2794.86]  that's a fairly common thing but try to like one digit try to yeah try to have the original phone number
[2794.86 --> 2799.10]  yep don't call the one that's in the email that's right call the original one that you have or the
[2799.10 --> 2803.82]  one that's listed on their website which again can also be compromised yeah and this is this is a crazy
[2803.82 --> 2809.10]  thing because they had access to the email they had access to all their templates yeah so everything
[2809.10 --> 2815.58]  was on proper letterhead yeah and and this was like a multi-dozen email chain going back and forth
[2815.58 --> 2822.54]  negotiating on this wire yeah this type of stuff gets past a lot of the common practices to avoid
[2823.18 --> 2830.06]  social engineering problems it does um trackle says it's not that sophisticated compared to nigerian
[2830.06 --> 2837.26]  print scams coming from some random email domain yeah writing in the style it's pretty sophisticated
[2837.26 --> 2844.14]  writing in the style continuing on with a current thing a current project that is already ongoing
[2844.78 --> 2850.78]  picking up right where it left off with all the right names all the right communication styles email
[2850.78 --> 2858.38]  going back and forth correctly as far as the user can tell it's pretty sophisticated by comparison yeah
[2858.38 --> 2862.70]  what that person's definition of sophisticated is because like ddos isn't very sophisticated
[2864.22 --> 2871.18]  so like where is there zero i don't know i don't know it's uh i think it's just a little bit of sort
[2871.18 --> 2878.86]  of armchair armchair coaching you know yes why did you drop that ball i've done cooler stuff than that before
[2878.86 --> 2889.10]  yeah so it's tough it's tough um killvor says can't you hold the company accountable it's 100 on them
[2889.10 --> 2894.78]  so it's a little complicated right we still need to work with that company for one thing uh for number two
[2895.42 --> 2901.98]  assessing the blame in a situation like this is i think one of those things where it certainly wouldn't be
[2901.98 --> 2910.14]  as simple as full blame here or full blame here we did send the wire um it is my belief that the
[2910.14 --> 2915.18]  notification to us could and should have come sooner but that's something that would have to be settled
[2916.06 --> 2922.06]  in court we could spend so much on lawyers that it ends up ultimately not being worth it yeah and
[2922.06 --> 2928.70]  sometimes you can sue for your legal fees absolutely but what if that's what if this is a this is a situation
[2928.70 --> 2933.82]  where the company just kind of goes well okay well we're bankrupt see you later well now who's gonna
[2933.82 --> 2947.58]  pay our legal fees someone will so it's challenging right yeah yeah uh this guy does stuff you know
[2947.58 --> 2953.50]  what these are words to live by no matter how savvy you think you are you can be had don't be a jerk
[2953.50 --> 2958.54]  sound the alarm absolutely yeah absolutely and that's what i'm that's what i'm trying to do right now
[2958.70 --> 2965.74]  is say look it happened to me and i'm not going to say i'm the i'm the savviest customer in the world
[2967.18 --> 2975.82]  but i'm pretty aware of things to look for and this one it got by my radar there were things that
[2975.82 --> 2982.62]  smelled weird about it and there were times we you know what we we probably knew better between the two
[2982.62 --> 2990.06]  of us but we were in a hurry and actually that's that's a big one just being in a hurry i was just
[2990.06 --> 2993.34]  going to say i think that honestly the biggest problem here is that you guys just have so much
[2993.34 --> 3000.22]  stuff on your plate and i was i was reading up on how people are defeating 2fa these days and a big one
[3000.22 --> 3009.58]  is figuring out what the 2fa device is and there's a way to generate spam login prompts and so once you've
[3009.58 --> 3014.62]  compromised the password you then you know especially in the middle of the night for example
[3015.42 --> 3020.70]  you you do like a a few requests and people they're not thinking right they'll just
[3022.22 --> 3030.22]  return one yeah and then you're in and once you're in you add an alternate recovery email and you you can
[3030.22 --> 3035.26]  do all these things that they might not get a notification for actually a lot of services are
[3035.26 --> 3039.66]  better about giving you a notification when an email is added and things like that but there are
[3039.66 --> 3045.82]  there are still things that can be done that could compromise that could at least give them access and
[3045.82 --> 3055.66]  at worst compromise your access to your own accounts yeah there's also just like i mean while we're talking
[3055.66 --> 3060.86]  about security stuff i was watching um this video recently where someone was talking about war driving
[3060.86 --> 3064.62]  have talked about i've talked about war driving before we're driving i don't know if i'm familiar with the term
[3064.62 --> 3070.62]  war driving used to be more common back when wi-fi passwords were like just incredibly easy to crack
[3071.34 --> 3075.50]  people would walk not walk people would drive around with a laptop in their car
[3076.30 --> 3081.58]  with stuff running to just automatically crack all the wi-fi networks that they drove by
[3081.58 --> 3088.86]  and you could effectively make mobile internet by just setting up a system that would jump onto these
[3088.86 --> 3094.14]  networks that you had previously cracked as you were driving around um someone was talking about
[3094.14 --> 3099.42]  modern versions of that because modern wi-fi encryption kind of defeated that sort of
[3100.78 --> 3108.62]  uh except that a lot of people use extremely defeatable passwords so it's like yes okay you can't
[3108.62 --> 3114.94]  like beat these encryption levels or these like length of passwords in a reasonable amount of time
[3115.82 --> 3121.98]  uh if it's garbly gook probably like yeah there's technically a chance that it'll grab it on the first
[3121.98 --> 3128.14]  attempt but the chance is effectively zero so forget about it but there's a huge amount of people that
[3128.14 --> 3137.02]  just use their phone numbers so this guy drove around war driving but with it only guessing numbers only
[3137.02 --> 3145.34]  numbers and he used the local area code as the first few and just got tons of them like it's ridiculous
[3146.30 --> 3147.34]  so don't do that
[3151.02 --> 3156.86]  so funny goodness gracious yeah i don't know oh all right
[3156.86 --> 3165.02]  security's tough and it's an active activity active activity it's a it's it's an active process that
[3165.02 --> 3170.30]  people have to take part in um yeah and a lot of people won't have a problem it's very boring and
[3170.30 --> 3174.54]  it's very annoying to keep up with yeah and people won't have a problem for a long time so they'll let
[3174.54 --> 3180.14]  it start to slip and then they'll get hit and it hurts and then they gotta figure it out from there
[3180.14 --> 3186.86]  it can hurt real bad one of the things that i want to that i want to add to our data backup strategy
[3186.86 --> 3194.30]  is an air gapped backup yeah one that literally or maybe like oh this would be kind of cool like
[3194.30 --> 3198.06]  because we wouldn't try to do the vault the vault doesn't have any backup i don't care about that but
[3199.02 --> 3207.02]  the real server it would be kind of cool to have like three machines that are like physically air gapped
[3207.02 --> 3212.86]  or like like you uh so you man how would you do this either physically air gapped like with a robot
[3212.86 --> 3219.50]  freaking arm that like pulls the ethernet cable out yeah or like um you know you go into the firmware
[3219.50 --> 3225.58]  of your switch and you do you actually disable the ports so each of them is like physically air gapped
[3225.58 --> 3233.66]  for two out of three days so you actually roll to one oh then it goes air gapped yeah then you go to
[3233.66 --> 3238.22]  the next wow then it goes air gapped then you go to the next then it goes air gapped and this one
[3238.22 --> 3243.58]  comes back on so that if you got hit by like a ransomware attack or something like that you'd lose
[3243.58 --> 3249.58]  that max a day you'd lose at max a day worth of data and you'd have a full air gapped backup because
[3249.58 --> 3255.42]  they can they can encrypt your whole network that wouldn't defeat a super targeted attack but that would
[3255.42 --> 3261.34]  defeat most things yeah yeah because super targeted would just wait until they were loaded on each server
[3263.66 --> 3272.30]  and yeah amazon glacier asks jacks yeah that would be that would be an option
[3274.06 --> 3279.98]  oh keeter says doing an air gap for a fortune 250 company right now the air gap is done through a
[3279.98 --> 3286.30]  firewall randomly automating connectivity oh that's kind of interesting yeah again though that doesn't
[3286.30 --> 3294.62]  there are ransomwares that will look for revolving backup schedules yeah amazing i love it yeah it's
[3294.62 --> 3300.46]  it's not going to stop everything nothing has ever air gaps duxnet proved that says cold do yep okay
[3300.46 --> 3306.38]  yep that's fair yeah if you want to if you if you want an air gap create a gap of air that's that's the
[3306.38 --> 3314.30]  best solution don't plug it in ever there you go solution solved oh man okay i want a really big usb drive
[3314.30 --> 3319.10]  yeah and i will physically stand there and copy it at random intervals
[3321.66 --> 3326.30]  oh no oh yeah that still doesn't solve all the problems because if you're taking data from one
[3326.30 --> 3332.38]  machine to that air gapped machine uh oh it could be a timed it could be timed so they technically
[3332.38 --> 3340.70]  sync up like it's it's it's really rough yeah that's crazy it's crazy town crazy town
[3340.70 --> 3347.66]  someone asked how i activate float plane in float plane chat are you gonna tell them should we say
[3347.66 --> 3354.30]  you should say it's an april fool's joke guys if i remember it's pretty funny by the way it is pretty
[3354.30 --> 3362.38]  i think it's pretty good that's all props to jayden um i had i had no no uh i didn't come up with that
[3362.38 --> 3367.58]  that was a that was a creative day project it's very funny on every float plane video and what's what's
[3367.58 --> 3372.62]  really hilarious is that this is actually a useful feature for a float plane as a service so people
[3372.62 --> 3378.54]  could have a watermark with their branding on the video uh but we used it as just like a silly joke
[3378.54 --> 3385.26]  we just put a watermark to activate the float plane it's not on the video it's down in the corner no oh
[3385.26 --> 3389.98]  never mind down in the corner i misunderstood if i remember correctly if you click on it it like
[3389.98 --> 3396.86]  woohoo and goes away too which is fun okay um oh i thought it was on the videos no i'm done no i was
[3396.86 --> 3402.94]  wondering why i couldn't see it oh yeah i'm an idiot all right are we are we doing that though like a
[3402.94 --> 3410.54]  watermark thing feature i mean we could okay cool yeah i don't know and that is how new features are
[3410.54 --> 3415.82]  born i mean we're not going to do it for a while the backlog is chungus right now yeah and there's going
[3415.82 --> 3421.90]  to be a lot of lab stuff for you guys to be distracted by right it goes away if you mouse
[3421.90 --> 3426.78]  over it okay there you go all right conrad we will acknowledge it we will acknowledge it
[3429.82 --> 3430.86]  r slash place
[3433.02 --> 3441.50]  there's a war there's a war going on ladies and gentlemen it's ltdstore.com versus ltdstore.com
[3445.82 --> 3451.90]  um oh my god i guess that's all i really have to say about that
[3453.98 --> 3459.50]  how does this even work i actually i was not familiar with this until our social media coordinator
[3459.50 --> 3465.58]  told me about it not sure i heard about it back in the day and i was like that's weird and then i
[3465.58 --> 3472.94]  ignored it and then now it's back and it's it's still weird it's cool i mean do whatever but yep all
[3472.94 --> 3480.38]  right yeah it's like an nhs flag is that national health service yeah there's a whole lot of a lot
[3480.38 --> 3487.26]  of things so there's the 90s s sub forums just you know they get in here they they decorate their their
[3487.26 --> 3499.66]  shiz um yeah there's definitely a pepe or five you know you know you know internet you you're internet and
[3499.66 --> 3503.42]  you're not gonna know how much and so if you don't have any idea what the crap this is or how to
[3503.42 --> 3511.02]  participate you know there it is right under the new slash linux okay i'm actually it's
[3512.54 --> 3518.86]  by the way you can use slash linux okay all right we should probably talk sponsors the show is brought
[3518.86 --> 3524.46]  to you today by squarespace that's right squarespace it's no joke we use it both linus
[3524.46 --> 3529.10]  media group.com and ltx expo.com were built quickly using Squarespace. If you haven't heard
[3529.10 --> 3533.00]  already, Squarespace is the all-in-one platform that makes it easy to get your website up and
[3533.00 --> 3536.22]  running quickly. You can choose from tons of different templates to find the one that makes
[3536.22 --> 3540.36]  the most sense for you and run with it. And if you need help, they offer webinars, a full series
[3540.36 --> 3546.06]  of help guides, or you can contact their 24 seven support team to help you build your site. So go to
[3546.06 --> 3551.10]  squarespace.com forward slash when and get 10% off today. I'd like to take a break from sponsors
[3551.10 --> 3557.22]  for a moment to shout out the business team guys. Love you so much. The show wouldn't run without
[3557.22 --> 3564.28]  you, but for crying out loud, I asked you guys to check the copy of all of our sponsor spots.
[3564.28 --> 3571.40]  I was told that it was done and it's not done. You can see here it was not done because this typo
[3571.40 --> 3576.12]  to help you build your sit has been in here for over two years.
[3576.12 --> 3583.32]  I love you business team, but get together.
[3586.08 --> 3592.40]  Number two, the show is brought to you by extra extra is a U S debit card that helps you build
[3592.40 --> 3600.00]  credit. So it connects to your bank. Oh, do I have one? Look at that. Wow. I'm surprised I caught
[3600.00 --> 3604.82]  that. I was going to say that was actually very impressive. It connects to your bank account.
[3605.00 --> 3610.56]  Then it spots you for your purchases and auto pays themselves back the next business day.
[3611.08 --> 3615.20]  Extra will total up all of the purchases you've made with the card each month and submit it to
[3615.20 --> 3620.56]  big credit bureaus, bureaus like Equifax and Experian. This is a great way to build your credit
[3620.56 --> 3624.74]  because it turns your transactions with the card into a series of credit worthy payment.
[3624.74 --> 3629.90]  They go the extra mile by limiting your spending and not letting you spend more than you actually
[3629.90 --> 3635.02]  have. And there are no hidden fees, no interest, and no fear of your data being sold as their
[3635.02 --> 3640.34]  monthly $8 subscription fee covers their costs. You can also sign up for their $12 a month plan
[3640.34 --> 3645.70]  to earn up to 1% in redeemable reward points with every purchase. So they've asked me to tell
[3645.70 --> 3650.48]  a personal credit anecdote. Um, yeah, actually, I guess that does kind of make sense. I have never
[3650.48 --> 3655.52]  been in a situation where something like this would have been what I needed. And the reason for that
[3655.52 --> 3660.62]  was that I had the privilege of having parents that co-signed with me when I got my first credit
[3660.62 --> 3671.00]  card at, I believe I was either 15 or 16. And the way that I used it was actually pretty much exactly
[3671.00 --> 3677.72]  this. I had only a $500 limit because I didn't want to put myself in a bad situation. I was working as
[3677.72 --> 3682.64]  a swimming lesson instructor and lifeguard at the time must've been 16 then because that's when I,
[3682.76 --> 3687.98]  that's when I started lifeguarding. Um, so I only got a $500 limit. They actually offered me more
[3687.98 --> 3696.80]  and I basically would buy something and then I would immediately go home because I didn't have
[3696.80 --> 3701.36]  a smartphone because it was a long time ago. And then I would go home and I would put, I would
[3701.36 --> 3708.14]  usually put a few dollars more just to be sure I would round up and I would put that right back onto
[3708.14 --> 3714.56]  my credit card. If I had to buy something bigger, I would preload it. And then I would go to, it was
[3714.56 --> 3720.88]  always NCIX. And then I would go to NCIX and I would make the purchase and then I would double check
[3720.88 --> 3724.80]  and make sure that it was topped up. I believe there was a one day delay. So maybe I did it the
[3724.80 --> 3731.38]  next day. But the point is that that's pretty much what this is, except that it's not a credit card.
[3731.64 --> 3738.56]  It's effectively just building your credit by constantly performing small transactions and
[3738.56 --> 3744.30]  then paying them back immediately. And I know that for a lot of our viewers, we actually started a new
[3744.30 --> 3749.92]  process for sponsor validation where there's a dedicated forum section now. Did you see it?
[3750.22 --> 3750.30]  Yeah.
[3750.30 --> 3755.34]  Okay. Where we're discussing with our community sponsors that we are interested in working with
[3755.34 --> 3759.74]  or that we do work with where we want to get real people's actual experiences with them, their
[3759.74 --> 3763.90]  thoughts. I already know that there are a lot of members of our community that are not really going
[3763.90 --> 3768.84]  to understand a product like this. And the first thing that I would say to you is you're probably not
[3768.84 --> 3774.16]  North American for one thing. There's a very different culture around credit and credit cards in
[3774.16 --> 3780.40]  other parts of the world. And credit works very differently in North America and in particular
[3780.40 --> 3787.02]  in America compared to a lot of other parts of the world. And for the people that understand what
[3787.02 --> 3794.02]  this is compared to predatory loans and compared to other ways of building up your credit from
[3794.02 --> 3800.00]  nothing, especially if it's bad right now, we were comfortable working with Extra. So that's what I
[3800.00 --> 3804.18]  have to say about them. Start building your credit with debit today. You can learn more at extra.com
[3804.18 --> 3807.00]  or extra.app, excuse me, slash WANshow.

[3868.12 --> 3875.96]  Let's talk about... I was looking for something big and I was like, E3 cancelled. It's not big.
[3875.96 --> 3880.46]  There's some random little things. This NCIX email thing.
[3881.24 --> 3882.42]  NCIX email thing?
[3882.52 --> 3885.22]  I have it highlighted if you scroll down a bunch.
[3886.12 --> 3888.26]  There's two things down here that I don't know what these are.
[3888.26 --> 3889.92]  Yes! I found it!
[3890.70 --> 3897.24]  Remember last WAN show, I was saying somebody contacted me somewhere and showed me the customer
[3897.24 --> 3900.58]  support email that I sent to them. I found it!
[3900.58 --> 3908.86]  It was on LinkedIn. Somebody actually went and found me on LinkedIn to send this to me.
[3909.76 --> 3916.24]  Am I logged into LinkedIn? You know what? I'll just use this screenshot that Riley apparently
[3916.24 --> 3925.30]  uploaded to Imgur for me. What is the easiest... Hey, there you go. So this is from Matt who says,
[3925.30 --> 3930.96]  Hi there. I'm buying most of a new PC from you guys. I'm using some of my old system to make a
[3930.96 --> 3935.16]  new one. I have a few questions. Firstly, would you? And then it's truncated.
[3935.62 --> 3940.16]  Here's my email back. Hi, Matt. I'll try to answer all your questions in order. This is a very Linus
[3940.16 --> 3944.62]  reply. You can actually see. One, just add this item to your cart if you want us to assemble the
[3944.62 --> 3949.26]  system and warrant the parts and labor for one year. Two, yes, we will send all original packaging and
[3949.26 --> 3953.38]  documentation. Three, it adds approximately one week to your order to have us assemble the system.
[3953.38 --> 3958.00]  You know why I was so good at this job? I type really fast, man. It drives me crazy when I
[3958.00 --> 3963.74]  watch people who don't type like 100 plus words a minute because I'm like, how do you even function?
[3964.20 --> 3970.10]  I would not be able to get through my day. Even on mobile, I did a typing test recently. I'm like
[3970.10 --> 3976.62]  70 words a minute on mobile with my current Swift key correction. I think that's pretty fast for mobile.
[3976.76 --> 3981.48]  I don't know. I've always... 70 or 80. I can't remember. It's like pretty fast. And then on
[3981.48 --> 3986.36]  on like a good keyboard that I'm comfortable with, like 115, 120. And I can't live with less.
[3986.36 --> 3991.86]  I've been considering moving away from tall keycaps. I love the 915. I know.
[3992.40 --> 3996.86]  It's like I'm really fast on it. I hate not having a number pad, actually. I want to get a separate
[3996.86 --> 4004.46]  number pad. I like external number pads. And I've known for years that I'm like quite noticeably faster
[4004.46 --> 4011.98]  on low profile keycaps. And I just... It's just... It's not like the thing, right? It's not the
[4011.98 --> 4017.34]  mechanical keyboard guy thing. So I've been resisting it this whole time. But at this point, it's just like...
[4017.34 --> 4018.94]  I hear ya.
[4019.02 --> 4020.52]  I don't know. I might switch over.
[4020.92 --> 4022.02]  I hear ya.
[4022.02 --> 4028.72]  I've been asked to acknowledge, by the way, the MKBHD logo next to LTTstore.com.
[4030.10 --> 4030.94]  Oh, sweet.
[4031.50 --> 4037.02]  Oh, love it. Tech YouTube rep-ra-freaking-zent, ladies and gentlemen.
[4037.78 --> 4039.90]  Okay, where's the...
[4039.90 --> 4044.04]  Where is it? I don't want to... Okay, if I'm screen sharing, I don't want to grab the wrong
[4044.04 --> 4046.00]  tab here. Give me a second, ladies and gentlemen.
[4046.00 --> 4051.28]  Uh... Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
[4052.00 --> 4055.44]  Where... Where the crap is this? Oh, man. I'm... Dumb.
[4055.50 --> 4058.88]  Someone in chat said there's 52 words per minute when they know what they want to type on a keyboard.
[4059.28 --> 4060.24]  You should practice, dude.
[4060.58 --> 4061.22]  Yeah, you gotta practice.
[4061.22 --> 4062.16]  Do some typing practice.
[4062.62 --> 4066.14]  Uh, three. It adds approximately one week to your order to have us assemble the system.
[4066.40 --> 4068.94]  Four. Yes, the parts you've selected will fit in this case.
[4069.18 --> 4074.52]  Five. Actually, the RAM speed that corresponds to a 1066 frontside bus is DDR2 533.
[4074.52 --> 4078.02]  Anything faster than that is icing on the cake or for overclocking.
[4078.38 --> 4082.62]  Six. You will not need a DVI to VGA adapter because there will be one included with your video card.
[4083.04 --> 4086.52]  Seven. Both PCIe slots run at 8x in a dual VGA configuration.
[4086.72 --> 4088.54]  This has zero impact on performance.
[4088.98 --> 4091.12]  Lots of data about this on the web. Don't worry about it.
[4091.36 --> 4093.48]  Eight. Your caviars will run just fine.
[4093.82 --> 4096.44]  Nine. Yeah, the stock fan is fine for stock speeds.
[4096.94 --> 4099.14]  Other general feedback. Make sure you get a sound card.
[4099.14 --> 4102.90]  It makes a huge difference even with the lowest end sound card on the lowest end speakers and headphones.
[4102.90 --> 4106.94]  Anything. That's old advice that is no longer true, but back then it was.
[4106.96 --> 4108.18]  That was a big thing back then.
[4108.22 --> 4113.26]  Two. That PSU is kind of loud. I'd look at the Corsair 620W or the Silverstone Strider series.
[4113.82 --> 4117.88]  And finally, see if you can find the extra money for an NVIDIA 8800 GTS 320MB.
[4118.12 --> 4121.44]  It's a significantly better card. Enjoy your new system. Smiley face.
[4121.86 --> 4125.66]  Mine is Sebastian. NCIX.com. Great technology selection and service.
[4125.90 --> 4127.08]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[4127.98 --> 4128.78]  That's pretty cool.
[4128.78 --> 4135.80]  Apparently, Matt did take my advice and got the 8800 GTS and was very happy he did.
[4136.04 --> 4136.66]  Ha ha ha ha.
[4136.66 --> 4139.76]  So that was my job. I was the PC advisor.
[4139.92 --> 4142.32]  PC at NCIX.com went to me.
[4143.22 --> 4144.20]  Oh, so funny.
[4144.60 --> 4147.90]  And then it was Ivan. Ivan was the PC advisor after me.
[4148.68 --> 4151.16]  Yeah, remember sound card? Says just, Sari, yeah.
[4151.56 --> 4153.58]  It was such a big thing right around that time frame, too.
[4153.58 --> 4158.50]  Yeah, USB external amp DACs are definitely a low way to go now.
[4158.64 --> 4161.32]  But back then, a sound card was a big improvement.
[4161.60 --> 4165.32]  And USB amp DAC combos really had not taken off the way that they have now.
[4167.40 --> 4170.58]  All right. I got logged out of the dock because...
[4171.76 --> 4172.02]  Thanks.
[4172.40 --> 4172.58]  Hey!
[4173.28 --> 4175.86]  You know what? Let's take this opportunity to do some merch messages.
[4175.86 --> 4176.82]  Okay, sure.
[4179.72 --> 4181.18]  I'm trying to find...
[4181.18 --> 4186.40]  We are still taking applications for the back end and front end position.
[4186.74 --> 4190.56]  It was asked before the show if they should leave those things in the dock.
[4190.82 --> 4192.08]  And we said yes.
[4192.82 --> 4194.14]  And now I can't find them.
[4194.28 --> 4194.62]  Genius.
[4195.44 --> 4196.54]  All right, Bellavance.
[4197.22 --> 4198.82]  Our producer has a mic now.
[4198.90 --> 4200.74]  He's been waiting this whole time for his moment.
[4201.40 --> 4204.34]  Why don't you read us some questions from the merch messages?
[4204.68 --> 4205.28]  For sure.
[4205.28 --> 4206.44]  Our first one here is from Jamie.
[4207.56 --> 4207.94]  Hi.
[4208.04 --> 4208.64]  I love your content.
[4208.76 --> 4209.14]  Thanks to you.
[4209.16 --> 4212.36]  I'm a CS engineer and now currently doing a PhD in computer architecture.
[4212.84 --> 4215.12]  Any predictions about the future of CPUs?
[4215.52 --> 4218.66]  100 plus cores, accelerators, better IPC or EPC, etc.
[4218.90 --> 4219.60]  Good gravy.
[4219.76 --> 4223.98]  I mean, the biggest prediction, the most confident prediction that I can make about CPUs
[4223.98 --> 4225.82]  is that we are...
[4226.56 --> 4228.26]  I mean, it's funny how history repeats itself.
[4229.46 --> 4235.16]  In the early days of computing, okay, we didn't have one standard
[4235.16 --> 4236.74]  ISA that everyone used.
[4237.16 --> 4238.74]  X86 was not king yet.
[4239.36 --> 4239.54]  Yeah.
[4239.54 --> 4249.14]  And then over time, the competitors, one by one, got picked off until it was mostly, pretty
[4249.14 --> 4251.46]  much, x86 was the only show in town.
[4251.56 --> 4252.32]  There were exceptions.
[4252.54 --> 4258.64]  I mean, Apple had desktop computers that were power, that were power, like as recently as,
[4259.08 --> 4263.32]  what, the early 2000s, I think, was when power got kicked to the curb.
[4263.32 --> 4263.76]  Right?
[4264.76 --> 4267.42]  But by and large, it all came down to x86.
[4268.58 --> 4270.34]  Well, that's changing now.
[4270.54 --> 4270.78]  Yeah.
[4271.28 --> 4271.72]  Arm...
[4271.72 --> 4272.24]  It's gonna be weird.
[4272.46 --> 4273.92]  Arm has experienced a renaissance.
[4274.12 --> 4277.10]  Arm is no longer just for smartwatches.
[4277.26 --> 4279.60]  And then up and coming is RISC-V.
[4280.60 --> 4283.18]  X86 ain't gonna go gentle into that good night, though.
[4284.26 --> 4287.00]  It's a really incredible, exciting time.
[4287.14 --> 4289.22]  And I think what we're gonna see is we're gonna see more diversity.
[4289.74 --> 4291.06]  We're gonna see more emulation.
[4291.06 --> 4294.30]  I think it's also going to come back down after that, because it's pretty annoying to
[4294.30 --> 4295.28]  have all these different platforms.
[4295.44 --> 4298.08]  But I think we need to diversify to modernize.
[4298.58 --> 4299.16]  And then, yeah.
[4299.56 --> 4299.96]  Exactly.
[4300.14 --> 4305.98]  That would be the most confident prediction that I can make about the CPU space over the
[4305.98 --> 4307.00]  next five to ten years.
[4307.32 --> 4307.54]  Yeah.
[4308.10 --> 4308.72]  Hit me again.
[4308.72 --> 4311.82]  Stefan asked a question, which I'm gonna modify a little bit.
[4312.34 --> 4315.46]  What's your favorite retro tech outside of gaming?
[4316.18 --> 4316.78]  Outside of gaming?
[4316.84 --> 4317.30]  Oh, crap.
[4317.40 --> 4317.56]  Yeah.
[4317.56 --> 4319.58]  So, we got asked this last week.
[4319.70 --> 4322.76]  And I was wondering why that made it into the curated questions.
[4323.44 --> 4325.40]  Outside of gaming?
[4325.88 --> 4326.22]  Man.
[4327.12 --> 4330.42]  Well, I loved my Canon PowerShot A20.
[4332.68 --> 4333.56]  This is...
[4333.56 --> 4336.44]  So, the first digital camera I got was actually a gift.
[4336.44 --> 4339.92]  And I was like, gee, thanks.
[4339.92 --> 4345.66]  Because it was basically like a 240 by 320 toy.
[4346.34 --> 4348.16]  And it was way overpriced.
[4348.22 --> 4348.84]  It was like $200.
[4349.18 --> 4351.92]  I was like, oh, please tell me you kept the receipt.
[4352.02 --> 4357.82]  Because spending like another $200, I could have a real, actual digital camera.
[4357.82 --> 4359.60]  And they did keep the receipt.
[4359.82 --> 4361.28]  And this is what I bought.
[4361.50 --> 4362.28]  Look at this.
[4362.40 --> 4365.38]  Don't you love sites that have actually been around for 20 years?
[4365.38 --> 4370.26]  And still have full reviews up of stuff that has not been a thing for 20 years?
[4370.90 --> 4373.40]  Meet the PowerShot A20.
[4373.74 --> 4376.70]  I got it after the A30 and A40.
[4376.90 --> 4378.98]  Like, the couple of successors had come out.
[4379.14 --> 4380.36]  So, I got it on a deal.
[4380.50 --> 4383.02]  It was like $300 or $400 Canadian.
[4384.02 --> 4384.46]  Okay?
[4384.46 --> 4386.52]  It was 2.1 megapixel.
[4386.76 --> 4393.52]  Which at the time, guys, you got to remember, was the difference between a toy and a picture
[4393.52 --> 4397.34]  you could actually print at 4x6 and it wouldn't look like hot garbage.
[4397.66 --> 4399.96]  It had three times optical zoom.
[4400.54 --> 4401.76]  Took compact flash.
[4401.88 --> 4406.70]  I had me some 64 megabyte compact flash cards.
[4407.14 --> 4407.56]  I eat.
[4409.30 --> 4410.84]  Compact flash type 1.
[4410.84 --> 4414.14]  I had, what was it?
[4414.18 --> 4415.46]  Zoom browser software.
[4415.76 --> 4415.92]  Okay?
[4416.38 --> 4423.88]  So, I could see all of my, I could see all my pictures in this cool zoom view.
[4424.02 --> 4424.94]  Like, zoom in and out view.
[4425.06 --> 4426.98]  I actually have never seen anything quite like it again.
[4428.06 --> 4431.60]  Here we got some, we got a look at how well it maintains shadow detail.
[4431.74 --> 4431.84]  Okay?
[4431.90 --> 4433.62]  Like, that is a usable digital picture.
[4434.06 --> 4435.70]  And at the time, that was pretty rare.
[4435.82 --> 4437.78]  Most people did not, smartphones were not a thing.
[4438.02 --> 4439.24]  Camera phones weren't a thing yet.
[4439.24 --> 4442.86]  Most people did not have a digital camera.
[4443.08 --> 4446.96]  And it was really cool being able to post pictures online.
[4447.12 --> 4448.24]  That was, that was unusual.
[4449.16 --> 4454.28]  It was actually really common back then to scan your developed film pictures.
[4455.04 --> 4458.30]  Like, that was an equally valid approach at that time.
[4458.88 --> 4460.20]  Man, I can't remember.
[4460.60 --> 4461.56]  I'm trying to think.
[4461.68 --> 4462.32]  Double A batteries?
[4462.44 --> 4462.74]  Yeah, yeah.
[4462.74 --> 4465.10]  I never had a camera.
[4465.54 --> 4467.18]  I never had an iPod.
[4468.80 --> 4472.38]  I didn't have a lot of, if it wasn't for gaming, I didn't have a lot of stuff.
[4473.34 --> 4473.74]  Tech.
[4474.36 --> 4474.72]  Yeah.
[4475.58 --> 4479.40]  And like, okay, Conrad, every single time this question comes up, Conrad's like, bicycle.
[4479.70 --> 4480.58]  I think they mean electronics.
[4480.58 --> 4481.18]  Yeah, Conrad.
[4481.92 --> 4482.86]  Yeah, Conrad.
[4484.04 --> 4484.40]  Okay.
[4484.52 --> 4486.14]  But like, Walkman or Discman?
[4487.38 --> 4488.30]  Not of my own.
[4488.78 --> 4489.32]  Yeah, okay.
[4489.82 --> 4492.88]  I was pretty lucky to get a Discman toward the tail end of when those were cool.
[4493.50 --> 4493.72]  Yeah.
[4493.80 --> 4497.52]  Like, when Minidisc was already kind of a thing, I finally got a portable CD player.
[4497.86 --> 4503.98]  Yeah, if we have to make it electronics, which is, I think, the spirit of the question, I
[4503.98 --> 4504.86]  think I'd go back.
[4504.96 --> 4509.10]  I don't remember what model it was, but I had this slider phone in like 2008.
[4509.68 --> 4509.94]  Okay.
[4510.10 --> 4511.48]  And I actually, I loved it.
[4511.54 --> 4511.90]  It was great.
[4512.82 --> 4513.96]  It was very cool.
[4514.80 --> 4515.36]  Like, you know.
[4515.38 --> 4516.16]  Did it have games on it?
[4517.56 --> 4518.64]  I don't really think so.
[4518.64 --> 4520.58]  If it did, it had like Snake and I didn't play it.
[4521.32 --> 4523.00]  I didn't game on it, 100%.
[4523.00 --> 4525.04]  I played a lot of Snake, but carry on.
[4525.24 --> 4525.40]  Yeah.
[4525.58 --> 4527.04]  I didn't game on my phone.
[4527.52 --> 4530.74]  Um, your electric bike is not Retro Tech, Conrad.
[4531.26 --> 4532.88]  Um, what was I going to say?
[4533.00 --> 4539.28]  The, uh, I, I always miss like, you know, when you'd hang up with an old school phone
[4539.28 --> 4540.74]  and you actually clicked it down.
[4540.84 --> 4541.16]  Yeah, yeah.
[4541.16 --> 4541.92]  It was kind of satisfying.
[4542.60 --> 4544.06]  And sometimes you slammed it down.
[4544.24 --> 4544.50]  Yeah.
[4544.62 --> 4545.08]  If you're mad.
[4545.08 --> 4546.16]  Those slider phones, you could.
[4547.14 --> 4548.16]  Oh, yeah.
[4548.16 --> 4548.44]  Okay.
[4548.88 --> 4549.00]  All right.
[4549.00 --> 4549.84]  Even flip phones.
[4549.98 --> 4551.26]  There's a bit of a slap to it.
[4551.36 --> 4552.64]  With modern phones, it's like.
[4554.40 --> 4554.80]  Boop.
[4554.80 --> 4558.58]  Well, you know, Austin's super into the, uh, the Z Flip, right?
[4559.12 --> 4559.46]  Oh, really?
[4559.56 --> 4559.86]  Oh, yeah.
[4560.10 --> 4560.38]  Oh, yeah.
[4560.38 --> 4560.90]  He loves it.
[4560.94 --> 4562.44]  I can't get on board with it.
[4562.60 --> 4562.86]  I need to.
[4562.94 --> 4565.38]  I feel like you don't flip that the same way because you're scared, though.
[4565.40 --> 4566.14]  Want that big screen?
[4566.36 --> 4566.76]  I don't know.
[4567.10 --> 4571.30]  I have a feeling Austin wouldn't be too put out if he needed to replace his phone.
[4571.30 --> 4574.04]  But I don't want to put words in his mouth.
[4574.32 --> 4575.28]  But, uh, all right.
[4575.34 --> 4575.52]  Give it.
[4575.58 --> 4577.26]  Give us one more, Jake Bellavance.
[4577.66 --> 4578.06]  From AJ.
[4578.42 --> 4580.22]  How do you decide who hosts videos?
[4580.84 --> 4582.12]  Oh, that's a wonderful question.
[4582.72 --> 4586.54]  Uh, because everyone here is on the same team.
[4587.18 --> 4592.28]  And at the end of the day, we're trying to optimize everything that we do.
[4592.36 --> 4597.10]  We want a good return for our staff, which means we need to make money.
[4597.10 --> 4602.42]  We want a good return for our sponsors because if they don't make money, then they won't give us money.
[4602.58 --> 4605.32]  And we need a good return for our viewers.
[4605.60 --> 4608.32]  And when I use the word return, I mean like a return on investment.
[4608.46 --> 4617.64]  So every time investment that we make is to get a return, usually in all three of those areas.
[4618.12 --> 4626.64]  That's why Intel Extreme Tech Upgrade, I think, is actually my biggest brain idea in the entire time that I've been running this company.
[4626.64 --> 4631.58]  Because it's, uh, it's a win for the viewer.
[4631.80 --> 4632.36]  They love it.
[4632.72 --> 4635.82]  It's a win for the company because we make money.
[4636.02 --> 4639.40]  It's a win for the sponsor because they love it.
[4639.58 --> 4642.42]  It's just like, yeah, Intel.
[4642.56 --> 4643.02]  Thanks, Intel.
[4643.20 --> 4644.44]  You get to reign your products.
[4644.48 --> 4644.94]  This is awesome.
[4645.14 --> 4646.08]  People enjoy it.
[4646.16 --> 4647.90]  It's, it's very positive sentiment.
[4648.34 --> 4648.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4648.94 --> 4651.20]  And it's a win for, who was the last one?
[4651.28 --> 4652.38]  We've got the, uh.
[4652.64 --> 4654.00]  The person receiving the upgrade.
[4654.08 --> 4655.30]  Yeah, and it's a win for our staff.
[4655.38 --> 4655.56]  Yeah.
[4655.56 --> 4656.38]  It's awesome.
[4656.64 --> 4656.82]  Yeah.
[4656.90 --> 4658.92]  It's like four times win.
[4659.02 --> 4660.08]  They're fun to watch too.
[4660.16 --> 4660.48]  I know.
[4660.56 --> 4661.14]  I love them.
[4661.24 --> 4661.36]  Yeah.
[4661.42 --> 4662.56]  They're really fun to shoot.
[4662.98 --> 4664.50]  They're a blast to shoot.
[4664.58 --> 4667.70]  And they actually include a decent amount of technical information and stuff.
[4667.78 --> 4673.84]  But I find, uh, like friends and family that are not technical will comment about those.
[4673.90 --> 4675.78]  It's the same type of thing with like Scrapyard Wars.
[4676.12 --> 4678.78]  Where friends and family that weren't technical would be like, yeah, I like Scrapyard Wars.
[4678.94 --> 4680.72]  They'll be like, yeah, I like the Extreme Upgrades.
[4681.12 --> 4681.74]  It's like, okay, cool.
[4681.74 --> 4685.82]  Uh, Zetharion asks, how does Intel measure that the upgrade videos are the reason for
[4685.82 --> 4686.26]  a purchase?
[4686.74 --> 4689.00]  Um, there's different, look up the sales funnel.
[4689.20 --> 4689.42]  Okay.
[4689.56 --> 4693.18]  So your marketing might target different layers of the funnel.
[4693.60 --> 4698.56]  Intel does stuff with us that is very targeted at delivering actual sales.
[4698.56 --> 4702.42]  And they do stuff with us that is more about just awareness.
[4702.92 --> 4703.14]  Sentiment.
[4703.44 --> 4703.72]  Yeah.
[4703.86 --> 4704.36]  Sentiment increases.
[4704.66 --> 4705.24]  Yeah, exactly.
[4705.42 --> 4705.84]  Exactly.
[4705.96 --> 4709.18]  About, or about engaging with the community.
[4709.18 --> 4710.54]  Or in some cases.
[4710.66 --> 4711.48]  This is the same thing.
[4711.58 --> 4712.24]  Sorry to cut you off.
[4712.34 --> 4715.20]  This is, this is the same thing back in the day where I would complain so much when,
[4715.28 --> 4720.08]  when conventions were like a thing still, um, about them taking their booths out of conventions.
[4720.38 --> 4721.94]  It's like, yeah, I understand.
[4721.94 --> 4728.56]  It's not a good, uh, form of measurable ROI, but also it's pretty important for you to be there.
[4728.80 --> 4729.00]  Yeah.
[4729.16 --> 4735.28]  And so this is, and one thing that's really cool is that, you know, if I was Intel, I think
[4735.28 --> 4741.58]  one of the biggest values that I would see in it is all the different ways that their tech
[4741.58 --> 4742.26]  gets used.
[4742.36 --> 4742.56]  Yeah.
[4742.72 --> 4747.28]  I bet there are executives at Intel that are like, oh, oh, that's interesting.
[4747.28 --> 4749.00]  I guarantee you they are.
[4749.18 --> 4749.50]  Yeah.
[4749.64 --> 4751.82]  Based on some information that we've had in the past.
[4751.86 --> 4753.32]  And that's really, that's really cool.
[4753.42 --> 4754.70]  So everybody is winning.
[4754.84 --> 4758.60]  That's why I think it's just like one of the most amazing ideas.
[4759.06 --> 4762.78]  A lot of the time, the ideas that are come up with here are not mine anymore, right?
[4762.80 --> 4763.74]  We've got a big team.
[4763.88 --> 4765.18]  We've got a lot of smart people.
[4765.54 --> 4768.92]  We have over a hundred years of YouTuber experience under this roof.
[4769.62 --> 4771.04]  How many people could say that?
[4771.76 --> 4772.64]  It's crazy.
[4772.98 --> 4774.04]  It's crazy, right?
[4774.22 --> 4774.38]  Yeah.
[4774.60 --> 4775.56]  And so, okay.
[4775.90 --> 4777.24]  How do we choose who hosts?
[4777.40 --> 4779.36]  Well, we're all on the same team here.
[4779.54 --> 4781.96]  We're all out to maximize return.
[4782.42 --> 4789.16]  So we know that right now for some of our channels in particular, the host that is going
[4789.16 --> 4793.38]  to perform the best in general is going to be me still.
[4793.50 --> 4797.72]  I mean, it's that I'm the one you guys are most used to for better or for worse.
[4798.00 --> 4803.40]  For some topics, there could be actually an advantage to having someone else do it.
[4803.48 --> 4806.24]  You know, I love it when Anthony hosts a Linux thing.
[4806.82 --> 4812.04]  But we had him co-host a Linux video with James a couple of years ago because we felt
[4812.04 --> 4817.18]  he needed a foil who didn't know much about Linux because otherwise Anthony can kind of
[4817.18 --> 4818.94]  get very technical sometimes.
[4819.12 --> 4820.64]  We have to rein him in a little bit, right?
[4822.14 --> 4822.98]  Love you, Anthony.
[4822.98 --> 4828.00]  So a lot of the time we're trying to figure out how we get the best return.
[4828.20 --> 4829.88]  Sometimes it just comes down to scheduling.
[4830.28 --> 4832.40]  Someone else will host because I'm busy.
[4832.80 --> 4834.66]  Or sometimes it's about development.
[4834.94 --> 4835.86]  Sometimes we'll have...
[4835.86 --> 4842.28]  There's one of the writers in particular that James and I are really wanting to get more
[4842.28 --> 4844.60]  comfortable hosting things on their own.
[4845.30 --> 4850.08]  And, you know, one of the things that I'll go out of my way to do is if I find that person
[4850.08 --> 4855.44]  hanging back when they're kind of on set with me and they're mic'd up, I'll kind of make sure
[4855.44 --> 4859.16]  they're coming into the frame and I'll interact with them more so that they get a little bit
[4859.16 --> 4865.88]  more comfortable, you know, hosting bits and pieces and you guys get more used to them.
[4866.12 --> 4868.98]  And then over time, maybe my involvement is less and less.
[4869.26 --> 4871.92]  Maybe it gets to the point where we're 80% done the video.
[4872.02 --> 4872.64]  And I go, you know what?
[4872.64 --> 4873.22]  I got a meeting.
[4873.48 --> 4875.96]  You close this one out and we kind of do it that way.
[4876.18 --> 4877.02]  You know, there's always...
[4877.02 --> 4878.46]  It's also...
[4878.46 --> 4881.60]  I don't know how much this gets factored in, but there's an ownership to it.
[4882.08 --> 4887.04]  If you write this video, seeing it through to the end is satisfying.
[4887.38 --> 4887.62]  Absolutely.
[4887.86 --> 4890.18]  Might make you care more about future videos, etc.
[4890.74 --> 4891.18]  Absolutely.
[4893.06 --> 4897.54]  NZLION says, Alex was really awkward at first, but I really enjoy his enthusiasm on the videos
[4897.54 --> 4898.06]  he fronts now.
[4898.14 --> 4898.50]  Exactly.
[4898.88 --> 4899.58]  Here's the thing, guys.
[4899.60 --> 4901.16]  What we do is not that easy.
[4901.34 --> 4903.18]  If you think it's easy, try and do it.
[4903.26 --> 4904.14]  It's not.
[4904.14 --> 4911.08]  And even with what I consider to be really excellent internal resources that people can
[4911.08 --> 4912.46]  reach out to for help.
[4912.92 --> 4915.86]  I wish we spent more time on training, to be honest with you.
[4916.46 --> 4918.36]  We want everyone to be their best.
[4919.58 --> 4922.16]  Even with that, it's hard to do.
[4922.32 --> 4923.68]  I mean, Luke can speak to that.
[4924.12 --> 4926.06]  Your early hosting stuff was awkward.
[4926.20 --> 4926.94]  Mine was awkward.
[4927.12 --> 4929.04]  Yeah, I didn't really intend to be a host.
[4929.20 --> 4929.94]  It takes time.
[4930.58 --> 4933.02]  I was not ready for that.
[4933.02 --> 4937.72]  It took quite a while to kind of develop my voice and hosting style and whatnot.
[4938.72 --> 4941.84]  And a big part of it, too, is that, you know what?
[4942.02 --> 4943.30]  I'm not a perfect host.
[4943.80 --> 4945.34]  I kind of yell all the time.
[4946.06 --> 4951.56]  Because sometimes I'm just really enthusiastic or I'm just trying to project energy and I
[4951.56 --> 4952.78]  end up just yelling all the time.
[4952.78 --> 4962.50]  But I feel like when you guys build that relationship or that familiarity with us, you're willing
[4962.50 --> 4964.72]  to overlook a lot of those things in a big way.
[4965.40 --> 4967.84]  And in a big way, that's what's happening with all of us.
[4967.94 --> 4972.96]  And that's why I see the introduction of a new host as something that really just has
[4972.96 --> 4976.18]  to take place over an extended period of time.
[4976.84 --> 4979.14]  So there's some strategy to it.
[4979.22 --> 4982.40]  There's some just logistical elements to it.
[4982.66 --> 4988.46]  There's, you know, sometimes there's people's own motivation.
[4988.96 --> 4989.24]  Right?
[4990.78 --> 4991.78]  There's a lot of reasons.
[4991.78 --> 4992.42]  Yeah.
[4993.72 --> 4994.08]  Okay.
[4994.28 --> 4995.74]  Why don't we do a big topic?
[4996.62 --> 4997.50]  We can talk about Sony.
[4999.56 --> 4999.88]  Oh.
[5000.58 --> 5001.88]  How long have we been streaming?
[5002.98 --> 5003.50]  What?
[5003.60 --> 5004.14]  The gravy?
[5004.96 --> 5007.88]  We've been live on the WAN show for an hour and a freaking half.
[5008.92 --> 5009.60]  Uh, okay.
[5010.18 --> 5011.20]  E322 is...
[5011.20 --> 5012.20]  2022 is cancelled.
[5012.62 --> 5014.46]  Big surprise, says Anthony Young.
[5015.02 --> 5015.84]  Uh, great.
[5016.80 --> 5021.22]  Samsung is the latest company to partner with iFixit to provide official repair tools and
[5021.22 --> 5021.46]  parts.
[5021.58 --> 5022.56]  That's so cool.
[5022.58 --> 5023.14]  Super cool.
[5023.30 --> 5026.98]  Self-repair program that will give Galaxy customers access to parts, tools, and guides
[5026.98 --> 5028.74]  to repair their own devices.
[5029.08 --> 5029.62]  That's awesome.
[5030.00 --> 5033.78]  The program, as with Microsoft Surface devices and Valve Steam Deck before it, will be done
[5033.78 --> 5034.88]  in partnership with iFixit.
[5034.98 --> 5039.56]  And the first phones to have spare parts available are the S20, S21, and Tab S7+.
[5039.56 --> 5044.74]  iFixit is actively writing fixed guides, and the parts list includes, initially, displays,
[5045.06 --> 5048.02]  back glass, and charge ports, but no mention of batteries, initially.
[5048.24 --> 5048.60]  Hmm.
[5048.78 --> 5049.94]  Very interesting.
[5051.22 --> 5055.34]  Uh, Kyle Wiens told The Verge that the display assemblies would come with batteries pre-glued
[5055.34 --> 5058.50]  to them, because without peel tabs, the only way to get them off normally is with a lot
[5058.50 --> 5059.18]  of isopropyl.
[5059.40 --> 5060.12]  Interesting.
[5061.52 --> 5065.64]  Maybe we will continue to see this improve, we hope?
[5066.92 --> 5067.28]  Hmm.
[5067.44 --> 5070.52]  That would have to be on the repairability side of things, I think, though.
[5070.72 --> 5074.90]  Apple rolls out an App Store policy allowing reader apps to link to their website.
[5075.08 --> 5077.02]  This could be pretty good for Floatplane.
[5077.16 --> 5077.52]  Hopefully.
[5078.06 --> 5078.46]  We hope.
[5078.46 --> 5080.62]  We'll see if they just block it anyways, but yeah, hopefully.
[5081.10 --> 5084.94]  And how to build a PC, the last guide you'll ever need, is delayed to next weekend, but
[5084.94 --> 5085.90]  this time it's for real.
[5086.28 --> 5086.90]  It's finished.
[5087.06 --> 5088.26]  The last writer review is done.
[5088.36 --> 5092.12]  It's only missing a final QC pass, but it will not be possible to do before this weekend
[5092.12 --> 5093.26]  because it will take two hours.
[5094.02 --> 5095.02]  Because it's about that long.
[5095.02 --> 5097.48]  Oh.
[5097.48 --> 5097.56]  Oh.
[5097.84 --> 5098.94]  Oh, wow.
[5099.50 --> 5101.16]  You must hear this.
[5101.16 --> 5105.32]  Bell, how much of a producer are you actually?
[5105.48 --> 5108.38]  Do you have a way of muting us?
[5108.38 --> 5110.12]  I can.
[5110.12 --> 5110.52]  Yeah.
[5110.66 --> 5111.16]  You can.
[5111.80 --> 5112.28]  Okay.
[5113.10 --> 5115.10]  This is really funny.
[5118.58 --> 5119.62]  There's a song.
[5120.46 --> 5126.40]  There's a song, and I would like, if you guys have like a Spotify or YouTube Music or Apple
[5126.40 --> 5131.24]  Music subscription or whatever, you guys can listen along with us, but we're going to mute
[5131.24 --> 5131.48]  it.
[5131.80 --> 5132.96]  I'm going to press play.
[5133.06 --> 5134.72]  We're all going to press play at the same time.
[5134.76 --> 5135.00]  Okay.
[5135.40 --> 5137.70]  It's by the Mome Boys.
[5138.12 --> 5140.24]  M-O-M-E Boys.
[5140.86 --> 5142.80]  It's called Still Beat.
[5143.22 --> 5144.88]  I will let you guys look that up.
[5144.98 --> 5149.08]  You got 30 seconds to get your phone or your web browser open or whatever.
[5149.60 --> 5152.70]  We're going to listen to this, and Luke and I are going to listen to it.
[5152.72 --> 5156.42]  We're just going to mute ourselves until we get to the moment, and it'll be very clear
[5156.42 --> 5157.58]  what the moment is.
[5158.14 --> 5160.58]  And then Bell's going to kick our audio back on.
[5160.70 --> 5161.32]  Thank you, Jake.
[5161.96 --> 5164.18]  I think that's been enough 30 seconds.
[5164.34 --> 5166.22]  This is the Mome Boys.
[5166.82 --> 5168.24]  It's called Still Beat.
[5168.60 --> 5169.20]  M-O-M-E.
[5169.40 --> 5169.58]  Yep.
[5170.94 --> 5171.38]  Okay.
[5171.98 --> 5172.50]  Are you ready?
[5172.92 --> 5174.88]  Three, two, one, let's go.
[5174.94 --> 5176.10]  I don't want a copyright strike.
[5191.48 --> 5194.30]  Part of the Mome Boys.
[5194.82 --> 5196.26]  One, two, one, let's go.
[5196.34 --> 5198.44]  I think it's called Weaver.
[5198.50 --> 5200.30]  I think we'll give us the going forward.
[5200.70 --> 5202.92]  We'll give you their universal view.
[5202.98 --> 5203.42]  I'm not going to do that.
[5203.46 --> 5204.20]  I check here.
[5204.28 --> 5204.86]  One.
[5205.22 --> 5206.14]  One, two, one, we'll give you my gospel value.
[5206.20 --> 5207.66]  And then there's a sign you learn to hook up.
[5207.74 --> 5208.62]  Two, one, three, two, three, one.
[5208.64 --> 5209.18]  One, two, three, two, three, four, five, six, six, six, seven, eight, eight, nine, nine, nine,
[5209.22 --> 5210.04]  either.
[5210.14 --> 5211.62]  Two, two, then you can get to the level three, two, four, five, eight, and five, seven, eight, bénka,
[5211.62 --> 5212.72]  Wolf.
[5212.72 --> 5242.70]  Thank you.
[5242.72 --> 5272.70]  Thank you.
[5272.72 --> 5274.28]  Which is kind of amazing.
[5274.52 --> 5275.98]  Like it actually sort of worked.
[5276.58 --> 5279.64]  Is that peak weird champ or what?
[5280.90 --> 5283.42]  Mine just said peak weird champ.
[5283.60 --> 5284.68]  I think that's a new one.
[5287.66 --> 5289.18]  Oh, oh man.
[5289.36 --> 5291.40]  How does it feel to be featured in a rap song?
[5291.46 --> 5294.36]  I mean, I'm glad it wasn't a diss track at least, you know?
[5294.76 --> 5295.12]  Yeah.
[5295.12 --> 5295.52]  Yeah.
[5298.42 --> 5299.98]  So what is the lyric?
[5300.32 --> 5301.84]  She gave me dome.
[5302.08 --> 5303.64]  That's a Linus tech tip.
[5303.64 --> 5304.76]  Let me bring it up.
[5308.42 --> 5309.58]  She gave me brain.
[5309.98 --> 5310.46]  Brain.
[5310.66 --> 5310.94]  Sorry.
[5311.12 --> 5311.36]  Sorry.
[5311.48 --> 5311.92]  Brain.
[5312.36 --> 5313.92]  That's a Linus tech tip.
[5314.14 --> 5315.16]  I got the manners.
[5315.34 --> 5316.32]  I can't double dip.
[5316.54 --> 5317.40]  She gave me brain.
[5317.52 --> 5318.60]  That's a Linus tech tip.
[5324.72 --> 5326.44]  All right.
[5326.64 --> 5326.94]  So.
[5327.86 --> 5328.54]  Hey, man.
[5328.74 --> 5330.40]  That's the thing that happened today.
[5331.60 --> 5337.42]  Someone alerted me to this two days ago and I was saving it so that I could show you on
[5337.42 --> 5338.28]  the web show.
[5338.52 --> 5338.64]  Yeah.
[5338.70 --> 5339.70]  I didn't know what it was.
[5339.80 --> 5343.52]  So I clicked on the Twitter link that's in the doc and then the lyrics just right there.
[5343.52 --> 5349.66]  So this isn't even the first one because you're also there's a Kanye cover or someone used
[5349.66 --> 5352.60]  an AI of your voice to cover a Kanye West song.
[5352.68 --> 5352.96]  Okay.
[5353.00 --> 5353.90]  That's a cover though.
[5354.16 --> 5361.68]  This is an actual song by as far as I can tell an actual artist that has actually published
[5361.68 --> 5363.34]  like multiple albums and stuff.
[5363.96 --> 5365.90]  Like I was listening to this going.
[5366.26 --> 5366.64]  What?
[5366.92 --> 5369.68]  Doesn't this song actually have like, yeah, it has a million views.
[5371.04 --> 5371.52]  Wow.
[5371.52 --> 5371.56]  Wow.
[5373.16 --> 5375.10]  Apparently it's two years old.
[5375.50 --> 5375.62]  Yeah.
[5375.68 --> 5377.10]  Like this is not new either.
[5377.22 --> 5377.90]  I had no.
[5378.02 --> 5380.42]  How did nobody send this to me until now?
[5380.54 --> 5381.26]  Pretty surprised.
[5381.58 --> 5381.74]  Yeah.
[5383.00 --> 5383.52]  Unbelievable.
[5384.98 --> 5385.70]  All right.
[5386.84 --> 5390.66]  It's time to acknowledge the April Fool's video.
[5391.44 --> 5391.96]  Okay.
[5392.12 --> 5396.18]  The biggest question that I think everyone has been asking.
[5396.38 --> 5396.92]  And first of all.
[5396.92 --> 5397.88]  Why there wasn't a cheese sponsor.
[5398.04 --> 5398.72]  First of all.
[5398.84 --> 5399.82]  That's one question.
[5399.82 --> 5407.84]  Let me tell you guys, thank you very much for A, supporting us and B, sharing our deranged
[5407.84 --> 5408.76]  sense of humor.
[5409.12 --> 5409.40]  Yeah.
[5409.44 --> 5412.14]  We did need a lot of support in order to launch that coin.
[5412.30 --> 5414.34]  We thought it was very funny.
[5414.34 --> 5419.88]  But like with any like kind of, you know, April Fool's gag video or whatever, right?
[5420.12 --> 5420.32]  Yeah.
[5420.34 --> 5423.30]  You never know if you've kind of gone too far off the rails.
[5423.30 --> 5428.24]  Especially now that YouTube doesn't show dislikes.
[5428.88 --> 5434.68]  That video looks legit AF because it has 93,000 likes.
[5435.82 --> 5440.44]  People can't see that it also has 9,000 dislikes.
[5440.44 --> 5442.02]  I can see that.
[5442.02 --> 5444.80]  So I wanted to thank you guys for your support.
[5446.52 --> 5449.80]  Sharing our sense of humor and watching the video and enjoying it.
[5450.08 --> 5454.66]  And then I also want to thank you for your support because the answer is yes.
[5455.92 --> 5458.26]  Every sponsor actually paid.
[5458.26 --> 5462.82]  That's a very valuable April Fool's joke.
[5462.82 --> 5469.26]  I think that might have been the most profitable video that we have ever uploaded, which is hilarious
[5469.26 --> 5472.08]  because it was just, it was one of those ideas.
[5472.20 --> 5474.80]  We have a doc of April Fool's ideas.
[5474.80 --> 5482.50]  It is the holiday that as a company, I think we take most seriously from an external point of view.
[5482.66 --> 5485.40]  Like we have a Christmas party every year and stuff like that.
[5485.48 --> 5489.58]  But like we have not missed April Fool's for eight years.
[5489.86 --> 5490.00]  Yeah.
[5490.36 --> 5491.10]  Eight years.
[5491.10 --> 5493.56]  And some of the early ones were pretty low effort.
[5493.78 --> 5497.88]  But I think the last five or six have been freaking hilarious.
[5498.24 --> 5500.12]  We have so much fun making them.
[5500.54 --> 5502.16]  Riley is an evil genius.
[5502.66 --> 5503.96]  He was the writer for that.
[5503.96 --> 5505.46]  James worked with him on it as well.
[5505.60 --> 5512.22]  I made some tweaks, but you got to give Riley, especially Riley and James, just so much credit for it.
[5513.02 --> 5513.88]  So funny.
[5514.24 --> 5519.38]  The number of people that are like, you know, I watched this like first thing when I woke up, like at breakfast.
[5520.38 --> 5525.66]  By the, it wasn't until the cheese that it finally like flew in that this was not just.
[5526.26 --> 5528.36]  There's people that didn't get it as far as I can tell.
[5528.82 --> 5530.32]  That are legit mad.
[5530.56 --> 5530.68]  Yeah.
[5530.84 --> 5532.30]  Think we, you know.
[5532.30 --> 5534.26]  That happens every time.
[5534.26 --> 5544.72]  Like I, I, I've told a few people, but I was talking internally about the two that, that my team did because we did, we did one on linusactips.com, which is the forum.
[5544.94 --> 5545.08]  Yeah.
[5545.08 --> 5546.22]  Changed it to comic sans.
[5546.36 --> 5546.54]  Yeah.
[5546.54 --> 5550.06]  And we did the one on flow plane that we talked about earlier, where it says like your flow plane is not activated.
[5550.06 --> 5551.30]  It's supposed to look like the windows logo.
[5551.52 --> 5555.18]  And I told everybody on the team, like there is going to be bug reports about this.
[5555.46 --> 5557.72]  Like it, that's completely fine.
[5557.98 --> 5558.88]  We can move forward.
[5558.88 --> 5566.86]  But like customer support needs to know, like, we got to give some heads up to, to whoever's going to be involved with answering that stuff.
[5566.86 --> 5574.76]  And like within minutes of the comic sans flipping on, there was like a full properly written up bug report with like browser version and everything.
[5574.76 --> 5577.76]  And it's like, yeah, which I, yeah, that's great.
[5577.84 --> 5581.70]  That's, I mean, it was, it was a very well written bug report if there was an actual problem.
[5581.78 --> 5581.92]  Yeah.
[5581.96 --> 5582.40]  Thank you.
[5582.40 --> 5588.24]  Um, but yeah, sometimes people just forget it's April fools and then they get really confused.
[5588.38 --> 5588.72]  Yeah.
[5588.72 --> 5589.56]  It's pretty good.
[5589.90 --> 5590.74]  It's pretty good.
[5590.92 --> 5592.60]  Uh, there is one exception.
[5593.38 --> 5597.52]  Uh, Zach, uh, Jerry rig, everything did not pay for the knife feature.
[5597.72 --> 5607.14]  We just thought it was hilarious because, uh, we did a short unboxing his, his like box opener and it's got like 3 million views.
[5607.14 --> 5609.92]  It's one of the highest viewed shorts we've ever done as a company.
[5609.92 --> 5618.92]  And it's just me opening a knife and his sales of his sales of, of his box opener and knife thing went like.
[5621.14 --> 5622.68]  With that video, because.
[5622.92 --> 5626.10]  You know, obviously he's talking to a completely different audience, right?
[5626.10 --> 5627.42]  Like we're talking to our audience.
[5627.66 --> 5633.72]  So compared to, you can only mention your own stuff to your own audience so many times before it becomes a little less effective.
[5633.72 --> 5634.02]  Right?
[5634.34 --> 5636.74]  So hitting a completely new audience.
[5636.74 --> 5640.64]  And on a video that got 3 million views, it was about nothing other than the knife, right?
[5640.64 --> 5642.80]  It's not even a mention embedded in something.
[5642.92 --> 5646.28]  So I just thought that was so funny and I just, I loved it.
[5646.28 --> 5650.02]  So they were like, yeah, let's fricking sponsored by Jerry rig everything.
[5650.02 --> 5652.04]  Here we go boys.
[5653.26 --> 5654.38]  Oh, I love it.
[5654.52 --> 5655.34]  Oh, I love it.
[5656.80 --> 5658.14]  Ah, anyway.
[5658.14 --> 5662.66]  I did notice that not even in the sponsor shill video did Floatplane get a shout out.
[5663.60 --> 5664.46]  Sponsor shill video?
[5664.80 --> 5665.04]  Yeah.
[5665.92 --> 5666.58]  April Fool's.
[5669.72 --> 5670.82]  There's no Floatplane shout out.
[5670.90 --> 5672.20]  There's an LTT store one at the end.
[5672.36 --> 5672.72]  All right.
[5672.82 --> 5673.30]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[5673.52 --> 5676.72]  We did a really good shout out for you guys in Million Dollar Unboxing Part 3.
[5677.06 --> 5677.52]  Oh, sweet.
[5677.64 --> 5677.82]  Okay.
[5678.04 --> 5678.22]  Yeah.
[5678.32 --> 5682.08]  And should I tell them?
[5682.22 --> 5682.96]  Not yet.
[5683.22 --> 5685.08]  Let me make sure it's actually going to work.
[5685.24 --> 5685.94]  I'm going to tell them.
[5686.00 --> 5686.62]  You'll make it work.
[5686.62 --> 5689.86]  I haven't even been able to talk to the guy that needs to do the stuff.
[5690.06 --> 5691.00]  What if he can't do it?
[5691.10 --> 5693.12]  And he still has to finish the other thing that he's still working on.
[5693.12 --> 5693.98]  You'll make it work eventually.
[5693.98 --> 5694.26]  It's secret.
[5694.44 --> 5694.64]  Okay.
[5694.74 --> 5694.88]  Yeah.
[5694.90 --> 5695.54]  I won't say when.
[5695.90 --> 5696.40]  How about that?
[5696.56 --> 5696.92]  Compromise?
[5697.30 --> 5699.08]  What if the screwdriver's out before it works?
[5699.42 --> 5700.20]  That won't happen.
[5701.78 --> 5703.26]  Because you'll make it work before then.
[5704.26 --> 5705.00]  Oh boy.
[5705.28 --> 5705.60]  Okay.
[5706.46 --> 5707.52]  Well, are you going to say why?
[5707.64 --> 5709.82]  Because we were going to wait until we could say why.
[5710.90 --> 5712.44]  Because there's like a reason why.
[5712.68 --> 5715.70]  I will say what we are.
[5716.62 --> 5718.36]  Can we just say next week?
[5719.22 --> 5719.60]  Okay.
[5719.60 --> 5736.70]  I am considering opening up pre-orders for the screwdriver to floatplane peeps who I think will be a little more understanding if it does get delayed.
[5736.70 --> 5740.90]  It also depends on whether next week.
[5740.90 --> 5749.76]  I should hear back from engineering about whether our last issue with the ratchet is fully resolved.
[5750.54 --> 5751.22]  So, okay.
[5751.34 --> 5753.34]  Next week might be better timing.
[5755.04 --> 5756.58]  People seem excited.
[5756.64 --> 5757.74]  Oh, this is also floatplane.
[5757.80 --> 5758.56]  But I might be desperate.
[5758.78 --> 5759.44]  Floatplane chat seems excited.
[5759.44 --> 5761.04]  I might be desperate.
[5761.04 --> 5761.14]  I might be desperate.
[5761.34 --> 5771.24]  And I have some reasons that hopefully by next week I will also be able to share with you about why I kind of need the cash right now.
[5771.24 --> 5780.04]  I mean, one of them is that that head of labs is coming and not cheap.
[5780.78 --> 5782.98]  There's a lot of reasons though.
[5783.14 --> 5793.46]  And there's one big one in particular that could mean that I will just definitely need some cash before I am ready to ship.
[5793.46 --> 5797.98]  People are like, a pre-order doesn't mean we get it any earlier.
[5798.12 --> 5798.82]  Yeah, that's true.
[5799.26 --> 5808.60]  So that's one of the reasons that we're locking it to just floatplane because I feel like with you guys, I can make a dedicated video that's like, hey, here's what's going on.
[5808.64 --> 5810.02]  You really need to watch this.
[5810.66 --> 5818.54]  I can trust you guys to actually watch it and listen thoroughly and nicely educate each other if someone didn't get the memo.
[5818.54 --> 5824.68]  Whereas if we just open it up broadly, I feel like we could create a bunch of customer support issues and stuff like that.
[5824.70 --> 5831.14]  We're also trying to figure out how to like make it so that if you do buy the screwdriver, you get like a month or two free on floatplane or something.
[5831.32 --> 5832.34]  Yeah, some kind of benefit.
[5832.82 --> 5835.04]  But yeah, there's some technical hurdles there.
[5835.18 --> 5842.90]  And at least one of the people that would need to work on it is currently slammed working on other stuff and is also sick right now.
[5842.92 --> 5844.16]  So he's actually not working on anything.
[5844.66 --> 5847.64]  So yeah, it's not going to happen right away.
[5847.64 --> 5850.44]  These guys are all like backpack as well, backpack as well.
[5851.10 --> 5852.12]  Here's a problem with the backpack.
[5852.68 --> 5859.74]  We have almost as many registrations for notifications as our entire production.
[5860.30 --> 5865.80]  Not the first wave, not the first and second wave, all three delivery waves.
[5866.62 --> 5869.12]  I am deeply worried about backpack stock.
[5869.12 --> 5875.66]  And the reality of it is we are not going to allow people to jump the queue, not even floatplane.
[5875.66 --> 5878.30]  So people who have signed up for notifications.
[5878.72 --> 5880.92]  I'm less worried about it with screwdriver, though.
[5881.34 --> 5883.70]  In fairness, I don't know if you know these numbers.
[5885.10 --> 5887.76]  I heard them a bit ago, but I haven't heard updates from them.
[5888.34 --> 5891.82]  Interest in them has been extremely high.
[5892.08 --> 5894.56]  Nick sends me updates every few days because he's just like,
[5894.80 --> 5895.70]  Freaking what?
[5895.70 --> 5899.70]  The last update he sent me is...
[5900.82 --> 5901.58]  Where is it?
[5901.76 --> 5902.38]  Come on, Nick Light.
[5902.80 --> 5905.62]  We were chatting so much last night that it's a bit of a problem.
[5907.68 --> 5908.64]  Yeah, here we go.
[5909.00 --> 5916.22]  So we're sitting at over 20,000 for backpack, like somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000.
[5916.44 --> 5919.04]  We have 30,000 backpacks coming, so that's a problem.
[5919.04 --> 5923.72]  And for screwdriver, we're sitting between 35,000 and 40,000.
[5924.24 --> 5931.50]  The only reason I'm not concerned about screwdriver is that we have a lot more inventory and our manufacturing capacity is higher.
[5931.90 --> 5932.00]  Right.
[5932.12 --> 5934.58]  So if we have to ramp, we can ramp.
[5935.12 --> 5937.08]  It'll take time, but we can ramp.
[5937.94 --> 5940.28]  So I don't want to let anyone jump the queue.
[5940.50 --> 5944.58]  The best thing to do for the backpack is get on that notification list if you haven't already.
[5944.58 --> 5948.82]  But for screwdriver, I think we could open it up for float plane to pre-order.
[5949.14 --> 5954.36]  That would help us loosen our cash flow a little bit, and then we can go from there.
[5955.24 --> 5955.36]  Yeah.
[5957.98 --> 5959.42]  First messages and head on out?
[5959.74 --> 5960.38]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[5960.46 --> 5960.94]  We should...
[5960.94 --> 5963.00]  Yeah, I guess you need to go home at some point or something.
[5963.00 --> 5963.78]  I actually do.
[5964.00 --> 5966.46]  Usually, I don't have anything going on on Fridays, but I actually do today.
[5967.58 --> 5969.18]  The answer, anonymous.
[5970.10 --> 5972.78]  The backpack fits perfectly under an airplane seat.
[5972.78 --> 5975.40]  Yes, I have stowed it under a standard economy seat.
[5977.68 --> 5981.08]  Anonymous asks, I've seen you wearing a scan watch in the latest LTT short.
[5981.18 --> 5983.84]  I switched to one for my Samsung watch, and the month-long battery has been life-changing.
[5983.94 --> 5985.08]  Would love to hear your opinion on it so far.
[5985.14 --> 5985.80]  I haven't even set...
[5985.80 --> 5988.64]  Oh, I actually have my Galaxy watch on this morning because I really wanted to know what time it is.
[5988.84 --> 5992.42]  But then I forgot to turn it on because sometimes the battery dies before the end of the day.
[5992.54 --> 5994.96]  I only even use it as a watch, so it's pretty stupid.
[5995.26 --> 5998.94]  Which is why I thought maybe I'll switch to the scan watch, but I haven't even set the time on it yet,
[5998.98 --> 6000.04]  which is why I put this on this morning.
[6000.04 --> 6002.44]  But then I apparently didn't check the time anyway, so that's where I'm at on that.
[6003.56 --> 6004.00]  Kirsten!
[6004.20 --> 6005.36]  Or Kirsten, excuse me.
[6006.30 --> 6011.16]  I'm trying to create a new machine that doubles both as a NAS and as a Windows PC as a media machine.
[6011.58 --> 6012.80]  Any recommendations on software?
[6012.92 --> 6014.00]  Is Unraid still the best choice for this?
[6014.08 --> 6016.28]  Unraid is definitely still the easiest choice for that.
[6016.36 --> 6018.00]  That's probably the route that I would go for that.
[6018.48 --> 6022.42]  Bear in mind that your hardware configuration is going to matter a lot.
[6022.42 --> 6030.10]  Like getting a motherboard that properly supports PCIe pass-through and all of that is really important.
[6030.88 --> 6036.26]  Joshua says, what is that one game that you've spent an obnoxious amount of time in?
[6036.26 --> 6043.24]  I mean, Luke found one of mine when he came over for gaming last weekend.
[6043.44 --> 6044.42]  Dude, I got owned.
[6045.18 --> 6045.98]  What was it?
[6046.10 --> 6046.68]  NHL 96?
[6046.74 --> 6047.76]  NHL PA 93.
[6047.98 --> 6048.54]  PA 93.
[6048.54 --> 6054.28]  I spent like hundreds of hours on that as a kid, and it turns out the muscle memory is still there, baby.
[6054.68 --> 6059.62]  I destroyed him playing as the Hartford Whalers against like All-Stars East.
[6060.76 --> 6062.40]  The boy's a gamer, man.
[6062.40 --> 6069.70]  But okay, to be clear, that was with me playing as Toronto, which was also like a two-rated team.
[6070.30 --> 6072.66]  Or the Senators or something, which were even worse.
[6072.74 --> 6073.40]  They're rated one.
[6073.82 --> 6078.24]  That was the last game where the ratings for the players were absolutely brutal.
[6078.58 --> 6080.88]  There's a player who's rated a one out of a hundred.
[6081.82 --> 6084.52]  And they got a lot more like nice about it later.
[6084.72 --> 6087.10]  So things ended up being kind of actually less realistic.
[6087.54 --> 6089.36]  But that particular player was not realistic.
[6089.48 --> 6091.14]  He's so slow, he like barely moves.
[6091.26 --> 6092.06]  It's hilarious.
[6092.06 --> 6096.20]  Anyway, so that was me playing as I think Ottawa against All-Stars East.
[6096.78 --> 6099.72]  When he said he thought he could beat me the other way around as well,
[6099.78 --> 6102.34]  and I scored like five goals in the first period or something like that.
[6102.34 --> 6104.24]  He's like, okay, you were right.
[6104.64 --> 6108.66]  So he's not actually better than me at the game, but he's better than you at the game.
[6108.72 --> 6108.92]  Yeah.
[6109.26 --> 6111.00]  Because I beat Luke every time.
[6111.12 --> 6112.52]  It was kind of brutal.
[6113.12 --> 6117.24]  If you look at like Steam stats, mine would be Slay the Spire.
[6117.32 --> 6118.90]  I don't think that's actually true, though.
[6118.92 --> 6119.32]  It's mine too.
[6119.92 --> 6120.32]  Yeah.
[6120.32 --> 6120.40]  Yeah.
[6121.66 --> 6126.78]  I'll have Slay the Spire will have a clock in the corner that'll show you how long it takes you to do a game.
[6126.92 --> 6130.60]  If I actually sit there and play it through, I can fly through them because I've played it a lot.
[6131.18 --> 6134.24]  But I've completed games that have been my game time.
[6134.32 --> 6137.34]  It's like many days because it's just like minimized in the background.
[6137.50 --> 6139.34]  It doesn't take like any system resources.
[6139.34 --> 6140.92]  The sound is muted anyways.
[6141.18 --> 6141.22]  Right.
[6141.32 --> 6145.60]  So it just, there's so much time, but it's so incredibly unrealistic.
[6146.30 --> 6146.90]  I don't know.
[6146.94 --> 6151.72]  Like I went on a trip once and I leave my computer on because I need to be able to remote into it sometimes and stuff.
[6151.94 --> 6152.12]  Right.
[6152.12 --> 6156.16]  And I came back from the trip and realized that Slay the Spire was left running the whole time.
[6156.16 --> 6159.60]  So I had one game that took me like a week and a half to beat.
[6159.80 --> 6162.80]  My Steam stats are totally messed up from benchmarking.
[6163.16 --> 6163.84]  That makes sense.
[6163.88 --> 6169.06]  Like according to Steam, I've spent like hundreds of hours in like Crisis or something like that.
[6169.06 --> 6171.26]  Probably a lot in like Far Cry 3 and stuff like that.
[6171.26 --> 6171.82]  Stuff like that.
[6171.90 --> 6172.26]  Exactly.
[6172.84 --> 6173.06]  Yeah.
[6173.06 --> 6176.54]  Wait.
[6176.96 --> 6177.76]  Holy crap.
[6178.20 --> 6179.40]  We didn't announce the new merch.
[6180.86 --> 6182.00]  Oh, yeah.
[6182.44 --> 6184.20]  Elemental is back, ladies and gentlemen.
[6184.74 --> 6186.90]  Is there, is there any like messaging for it or anything?
[6187.58 --> 6188.36]  Uh, there is.
[6188.44 --> 6189.54]  There's a discount code.
[6189.56 --> 6190.66]  Oh, look at that.
[6190.78 --> 6191.12]  Okay.
[6191.26 --> 6191.60]  Hold on.
[6191.62 --> 6192.48]  I'm going to change my shirt.
[6192.60 --> 6193.38]  I'm going to change my shirt.
[6193.70 --> 6194.80]  I'm going to set screen.
[6195.08 --> 6196.40]  I'm going to set screen cap.
[6196.72 --> 6197.22]  Holy crap.
[6197.28 --> 6197.84]  We didn't even.
[6197.90 --> 6199.12]  I also have the variants here.
[6199.24 --> 6202.32]  We didn't even pimp the new merch.
[6202.32 --> 6203.12]  Okay.
[6203.70 --> 6204.56]  Uh, here you go.
[6204.62 --> 6204.86]  There's pink now?
[6204.98 --> 6206.12]  There's never been pink before?
[6206.36 --> 6206.56]  Yeah.
[6206.58 --> 6209.26]  There's two new colors that have never before been seen.
[6210.06 --> 6214.38]  There's pink, yellow, purple, and white.
[6214.66 --> 6216.28]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[6216.70 --> 6218.60]  We have so many different colors.
[6219.28 --> 6221.26]  So much room for color activities.
[6221.92 --> 6226.96]  And if you want them all, you can get four for 50 bucks with the code Elemental4.
[6227.48 --> 6228.28]  No spacing.
[6228.62 --> 6231.26]  And the four is the digit, not F-O-U-R.
[6231.34 --> 6232.26]  It's just the number four.
[6233.32 --> 6234.50]  You can get them all.
[6234.86 --> 6237.92]  Or I think you could just get four of the same color if that's what you really wanted to do.
[6238.06 --> 6239.76]  But yeah.
[6240.34 --> 6241.02]  I'm back.
[6241.64 --> 6250.72]  And I actually, I had someone on the pre-show stream notice that you were wearing an Elemental.
[6250.72 --> 6257.76]  And they were like, isn't that that shirt that you guys said was a huge failure and didn't sell?
[6257.94 --> 6259.46]  And why are you wearing it?
[6259.46 --> 6266.70]  And the answer is because people absolutely love Elemental when it's four for 50.
[6267.06 --> 6277.26]  Because $13 each for the same quality tees as all of our other shirts, just with like the Elemental design is a great freaking deal.
[6277.26 --> 6281.36]  So every time we run the Elemental promo, people love it.
[6281.36 --> 6286.58]  So I actually am super into it because we don't lose money.
[6286.78 --> 6289.24]  We just don't make money at that price.
[6289.66 --> 6291.90]  So you only live once, right?
[6291.90 --> 6292.56]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[6293.78 --> 6295.32]  Each time that we've done it.
[6295.38 --> 6296.58]  This is the third wave now.
[6296.86 --> 6302.00]  We've kept the best-selling colors of the previous wave and introduced two new ones, two new designs.
[6302.24 --> 6303.68]  So Lloyd did up the two new ones.
[6304.32 --> 6305.88]  Guys, go check them out.
[6305.88 --> 6312.58]  We should have lots of stock because we're ready for you guys to absolutely crush the site on this one.
[6313.20 --> 6314.78]  Elemental shirts, they're back.
[6316.26 --> 6322.42]  Johnny Iron asks, are the Elemental shirts printed on the LTT blanks or still the AA shirts?
[6322.54 --> 6324.00]  The answer is American Apparel.
[6324.66 --> 6327.36]  So LTT blanks in black are coming.
[6327.78 --> 6333.50]  But we did a pretty conservative first order on them because you never know, right?
[6333.50 --> 6336.64]  Even if you get really great samples, maybe they're golden samples.
[6337.00 --> 6338.52]  Maybe the production quality is not great.
[6338.88 --> 6340.30]  So we were pretty conservative.
[6340.56 --> 6343.88]  Now that we've seen them and we've seen the community's reaction, they're coming.
[6344.32 --> 6345.52]  They're absolutely coming.
[6346.82 --> 6348.96]  Big time, but they're not here yet.
[6349.38 --> 6350.24]  So these are American Apparel.
[6352.04 --> 6352.44]  Cool.
[6353.70 --> 6354.50]  More merch messages?
[6355.26 --> 6355.66]  Yeah.
[6356.04 --> 6356.54]  Yeah, for sure.
[6356.62 --> 6357.88]  Oh, we should have Bell read them.
[6358.02 --> 6358.48]  Right, right.
[6358.56 --> 6360.40]  So our producer is actually participating in the show.
[6360.48 --> 6360.94]  Bell, hit me.
[6361.38 --> 6362.10]  Hello, I'm back.
[6362.62 --> 6362.90]  Good.
[6362.90 --> 6367.38]  Would you ever consider using a game engine like Unity or Unreal as a part of your benchmarking?
[6367.54 --> 6368.94]  I'm an indie dev and thought it might be useful.
[6369.04 --> 6369.60]  That's from Noah.
[6370.42 --> 6375.86]  We would, but the issue that we have around that is that it's a very niche use case.
[6376.06 --> 6380.94]  And until recently, we didn't have anyone with any experience in that field.
[6381.54 --> 6383.18]  So that's been an obstacle.
[6384.68 --> 6388.38]  Mason asks, who's the most talented gamer you've ever gamed with?
[6388.38 --> 6392.92]  That's interesting because we've done videos with a lot of Twitch streamers.
[6393.30 --> 6393.46]  Yeah.
[6393.56 --> 6394.18]  I mean, Corey.
[6395.70 --> 6396.66]  Corey and Shroud.
[6397.12 --> 6397.52]  Yeah.
[6398.30 --> 6399.30]  Luke wasn't there for that.
[6399.40 --> 6399.58]  No.
[6400.00 --> 6400.76]  So, okay.
[6400.88 --> 6401.32]  How about you?
[6403.70 --> 6406.52]  That nose dude is definitely up there.
[6406.58 --> 6408.48]  He's a Rocket League, ex-Rocket League pro.
[6408.48 --> 6409.60]  I don't think he's playing anymore.
[6411.10 --> 6411.54]  Skara.
[6413.56 --> 6413.96]  Yeah.
[6414.64 --> 6418.80]  I never actually gamed with Ann Munition, but I did do a video with her.
[6422.28 --> 6425.22]  Technically, did I even really game with Corey?
[6425.78 --> 6426.60]  I guess not.
[6426.80 --> 6427.48]  So, Shroud then.
[6428.06 --> 6429.20]  You gamed with him?
[6429.20 --> 6431.92]  We did a challenge head-to-head.
[6432.16 --> 6432.44]  Okay.
[6432.56 --> 6434.48]  Where we tried to snipe each other across the map.
[6434.58 --> 6435.06]  I count that.
[6435.34 --> 6435.48]  Yeah.
[6435.62 --> 6435.98]  That counts.
[6436.04 --> 6436.16]  Yeah.
[6436.48 --> 6436.68]  Yeah.
[6437.04 --> 6438.08]  It's going to be Shroud then.
[6438.52 --> 6443.16]  James asks, do you think Valve might incentivize developers to make more games proton compatible
[6443.16 --> 6449.74]  if they offered a less percentage cut of the game and Steam if they support it for an X amount of time after launch?
[6450.00 --> 6451.48]  I think Valve could do that.
[6451.62 --> 6453.22]  I think Valve will not do that.
[6454.54 --> 6454.98]  Yeah.
[6454.98 --> 6460.48]  They're not going to kill that golden goose until they are legislatively forced to.
[6461.62 --> 6469.70]  Armin asks about the iPad versus Tab S8, but to be more general, how do you feel about the current Android versus iPad tablet space?
[6470.00 --> 6470.86]  You know what?
[6470.92 --> 6473.54]  For me, tablets are just iPads at this point.
[6473.66 --> 6482.02]  I haven't given the latest Tab a fair shake, though, so I don't want to come out and say that necessarily,
[6482.02 --> 6484.62]  but that's where I've been at for a while.
[6485.42 --> 6487.34]  Iron Dog asks, what about Fatality Wendell?
[6487.46 --> 6490.72]  I've met Jonathan Wendell, but I have never gained with him.
[6490.98 --> 6491.14]  Yeah.
[6492.42 --> 6496.36]  I want to make my home smart, and I'm having trouble determining the correct ecosystem.
[6496.76 --> 6498.70]  We use iOS phones, but everything else is Windows.
[6499.22 --> 6500.88]  I also have plans to install cameras on a NAS.
[6501.18 --> 6502.44]  Do you have a recommended ecosystem?
[6502.44 --> 6508.40]  I know a lot of you don't like having to rely on a certain ecosystem, but do you have a preference if you did?
[6509.50 --> 6516.10]  I couldn't answer this question, which is why I ultimately went home assistant, so that I had something to bridge together disparate ecosystems.
[6516.10 --> 6518.14]  That's the only answer I was able to come up with.
[6519.10 --> 6519.50]  Sorry.
[6519.50 --> 6520.10]  Yeah.
[6520.10 --> 6520.50]  Yeah.
[6520.50 --> 6523.58]  It seems like there's not really an easy one to choose nowadays.
[6524.14 --> 6527.40]  I use Google, but I mean, do you trust big tech?
[6528.18 --> 6528.88]  Probably not.
[6529.02 --> 6529.38]  There you go.
[6529.38 --> 6530.70]  Honestly, I don't do any home automation.
[6530.70 --> 6534.72]  My place is very small, so I don't really see a need to.
[6535.38 --> 6542.74]  Dustin asks, do you guys ever think about showing how to network boot systems from a single image, like in all of your LAN center PCs?
[6543.34 --> 6547.64]  That's been on our videos to make list for like five or six years.
[6547.86 --> 6548.76]  We'll do it eventually.
[6549.50 --> 6552.64]  It's just, yeah, we really need to do it.
[6552.70 --> 6553.00]  We know.
[6553.78 --> 6555.44]  And final question here from Cody.
[6555.44 --> 6560.52]  My professor finally played a video from TechQuickie in class discussing heat-assisted magnetic recording.
[6561.12 --> 6563.64]  Any other cool storage tech you can recommend looking up?
[6565.32 --> 6568.42]  Here's some money to make up for her skipping the sponsor read.
[6568.48 --> 6569.06]  That's awesome.
[6569.96 --> 6571.80]  Any other cool storage tech?
[6571.90 --> 6574.82]  Man, that's a good question.
[6575.00 --> 6575.92]  I think there's stuff coming.
[6576.42 --> 6580.84]  Yeah, Hammer's kind of cutting edge for magnetic storage anyway.
[6581.26 --> 6581.52]  Yeah.
[6581.52 --> 6585.76]  And we got one more merch message from Rachel.
[6586.72 --> 6591.50]  Dedicated sound cards gradually became less and less popular because the onboard audio is good enough for most things.
[6591.86 --> 6594.12]  Do you think something similar could happen to GPUs in the future?
[6594.34 --> 6595.56]  If Apple has their way, it will.
[6596.26 --> 6596.48]  Yeah.
[6596.64 --> 6604.92]  I mean, even their studio Mac uses, I mean, it's a big onboard GPU, but it's an onboard GPU.
[6604.92 --> 6606.94]  I think that's the future Apple sees.
[6607.08 --> 6613.74]  Whether that arrives for gaming in our lifetimes, harder to say.
[6614.54 --> 6616.66]  Yeah, the M1 is a great machine.
[6616.78 --> 6622.98]  I use it for editing LMG clips instead of my RTX 2080 Super because it is faster for my rendering.
[6622.98 --> 6626.14]  And it's just a laptop.
[6626.80 --> 6627.46]  That's hilarious.
[6627.76 --> 6628.06]  That's crazy.
[6628.42 --> 6628.78]  Oh, man.
[6628.86 --> 6631.86]  Of course, people are spamming merch messages now.
[6632.16 --> 6634.68]  We waited to promo the new stuff.
[6634.80 --> 6635.30]  I know.
[6635.36 --> 6635.94]  Until the end.
[6636.16 --> 6637.38]  Oh, sorry, guys.
[6637.86 --> 6640.54]  Zachary says, I'm sending this late, so you'll probably not read it.
[6640.88 --> 6643.32]  But will you consider not censoring swearing on Floatplane?
[6643.40 --> 6644.32]  I'll consider it.
[6644.72 --> 6646.18]  But I don't think we're going to do it.
[6646.26 --> 6649.24]  Personally, I just find bleeps more comical anyway.
[6649.98 --> 6652.34]  So that's my personal preference.
[6652.70 --> 6657.82]  And I am still the god king of Linus Media Group until such time as I am not.
[6658.04 --> 6660.68]  There's also a lot of hosts when they are swearing.
[6660.80 --> 6663.64]  They are swearing with the understanding that it is going to be bleeped.
[6663.72 --> 6664.04]  Yes.
[6664.32 --> 6669.42]  So it's a little like there's some stuff that hosts wouldn't necessarily want to say if they thought it wasn't.
[6669.52 --> 6669.86]  For sure.
[6669.86 --> 6672.52]  I mean, a lot of people's mothers watch our videos.
[6672.76 --> 6675.42]  That was Riley's mom, by the way, in the April Fool's video.
[6675.74 --> 6678.20]  I was trying to figure out because I was like, that's not your mom.
[6678.20 --> 6679.40]  That's not your aunt.
[6679.70 --> 6680.80]  So who is this?
[6682.10 --> 6685.84]  I was wondering if it was like an actual representative from that popcorn company.
[6686.76 --> 6686.88]  Nope.
[6687.18 --> 6687.98]  Yeah, that's funny.
[6688.68 --> 6689.28]  Oh, man.
[6689.36 --> 6690.34]  Merch messages, guys.
[6690.42 --> 6690.98]  They're coming in.
[6691.04 --> 6692.64]  They're coming in too hot and too heavy.
[6693.90 --> 6694.22]  Oh.
[6695.98 --> 6697.82]  Whatever happened to the gym bag fan idea?
[6697.96 --> 6699.10]  We haven't done a gym bag.
[6699.20 --> 6700.88]  We should absolutely do one.
[6700.96 --> 6703.34]  I totally forgot about it, to be perfectly honest with you.
[6703.96 --> 6704.28]  Yeah.
[6704.46 --> 6705.12]  Matter of time.
[6705.26 --> 6705.94]  Matter of time.
[6705.94 --> 6706.94]  Okay.
[6707.06 --> 6707.30]  Okay.
[6707.34 --> 6709.40]  We got to cut it off here because Luke has somewhere to go.
[6709.62 --> 6709.74]  Yeah.
[6709.88 --> 6712.68]  Thank you guys very much for tuning into the WAN show.
[6712.78 --> 6713.94]  We will see you again next week.
[6714.28 --> 6715.58]  Same bad time.
[6715.82 --> 6717.44]  Same bad channel.
[6718.34 --> 6720.48]  We're going to have to push this Ubiquity topic.
[6720.60 --> 6721.58]  Remind us next week.
[6721.72 --> 6724.76]  We got to talk about Ubiquity suing Brian Krebs.
[6725.00 --> 6727.62]  It was a big topic for us this week, but we didn't get to it.
[6727.86 --> 6728.12]  Yeah.
[6728.50 --> 6729.34]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[6729.34 --> 6732.70]  We didn't talk about Sony taking on Game Pass, even though that was one of our highlighted
[6732.70 --> 6733.16]  topics.
[6733.32 --> 6734.40]  Maybe we'll talk about it next week.
[6735.12 --> 6737.04]  It's just like actually 7.30.
[6737.34 --> 6737.68]  Yeah.
[6737.74 --> 6738.58]  We need to go.
[6739.80 --> 6740.16]  Bye.
[6740.52 --> 6740.76]  Okay.
[6740.80 --> 6741.14]  Bye.
[6741.14 --> 6741.22]  Bye.
[6746.22 --> 6747.32]  Oh, man.
[6748.18 --> 6749.48]  Elemental's going nuts.
[6750.76 --> 6752.14]  Elemental's going nuts.
[6752.14 --> 6754.84]  Let's see.
[6755.12 --> 6759.44]  Elemental went from zero to...
[6759.44 --> 6761.64]  Let's see if it's already the top selling item today.
[6763.06 --> 6763.68]  Hold on.
[6763.78 --> 6764.40]  I'm curious.
[6765.14 --> 6767.92]  Oh, it's not even close.
[6768.48 --> 6773.26]  We sold more elementals than we've given away free sticker packs today, which doesn't even
[6773.26 --> 6774.04]  make any sense.
[6774.04 --> 6775.04]  Ha ha ha.
