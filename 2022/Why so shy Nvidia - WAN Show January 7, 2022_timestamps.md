[2022-01-09T08:23:12Z] Video: Why so shy Nvidia? - WAN Show January 7, 2022 
Given the amount of time it takes of of the whole WAN show, they should just branch out LTT/LMG news out of WAN show into another same format video. At least there were timestamps this time... I but it's cumbersome to do it like this, I've always put WAN in the background, it's not background if I have to look at timestamps every 5 min, and I can no longer put it in the background on my TV if I want to, it'll be downright annoying to navigate the video in the current state of the app.

Many asked for detailed merch message in the last few stamps, I don't do it since they're 1-2 minutes and change a lot but I did mention key points of it.
