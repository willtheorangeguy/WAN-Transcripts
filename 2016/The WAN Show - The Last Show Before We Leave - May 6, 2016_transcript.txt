[0.00 --> 10.84]  And I think we're live! Welcome friends to the WAN show! I've got an unfortunate...
[10.84 --> 19.12]  I think this might be the least sexy co-host that I've ever had, but he's all like cool and helmeted and stuff.
[19.12 --> 24.40]  So I thought, you know, what the hey, I'll let Darth generic stormtrooper or whatever.
[24.48 --> 29.06]  You know what? Let's just assume this is Finn and not just any stormtrooper.
[29.06 --> 32.74]  So there you go. Finn will be co-hosting the show with me today.
[33.70 --> 35.42]  I just had to ditch the waifu.
[35.68 --> 45.26]  And the fact that Luke is not here is a hint at some insight into one of the topics for today.
[45.70 --> 50.34]  So our main topics are IBM putting a quantum processor in the cloud.
[50.46 --> 56.62]  That is the figurative cloud. They did not put a quantum processor in a cloud, which would be cool too, arguably.
[56.62 --> 61.92]  Lyft is planning to pick you up in a self-driving electric car within a year.
[62.18 --> 63.68]  Not you specifically, but someone.
[64.38 --> 65.52]  What else we got here?
[65.74 --> 72.62]  Oh, China bans erotic banana-eating live streams, which I think basically means that...
[72.62 --> 73.62]  That, uh...
[73.62 --> 74.62]  That, uh...
[74.62 --> 75.62]  That, uh...
[75.62 --> 76.62]  That, uh...
[76.62 --> 77.22]  That, uh...
[77.22 --> 79.26]  The Wancho wouldn't be allowed to be brought...
[79.26 --> 81.18]  Broadcast in China.
[82.30 --> 83.50]  Oh, yeah, ice is cool.
[85.62 --> 87.82]  Ah, okay, ice. Sorry. Bye, ice.
[87.82 --> 96.90]  And NVIDIA's Pascal gaming GPUs are rumored to be announced today at 6pm.
[97.50 --> 98.46]  So, uh...
[98.46 --> 100.80]  That would be where Luke is.
[101.14 --> 105.44]  Yes, friends, we are going to have a pretty good show today.
[105.52 --> 109.34]  But first, the intro with no technical difficulties whatsoever.
[109.34 --> 110.10]  Whatever.
[118.34 --> 119.72]  Perfect.
[119.72 --> 133.72]  Perfect!
[135.86 --> 137.44]  Go with me, blah!
[138.78 --> 140.02]  Linda.com!
[140.08 --> 142.22]  It's like all the OG sponsors today!
[143.40 --> 144.80]  Let's see, who was first?
[145.76 --> 146.42]  I think...
[146.42 --> 147.94]  Oh, I might have even done them in order!
[148.86 --> 150.38]  I'm actually not sure.
[151.64 --> 152.80]  Alright, guys.
[153.18 --> 155.24]  So, welcome to the show.
[155.60 --> 157.14]  I think what we're going to do first...
[157.14 --> 160.38]  I've actually invited just anyone who wants to...
[160.38 --> 161.88]  Except that guy.
[162.10 --> 163.12]  Mark, not invited.
[163.30 --> 164.96]  Not invited to join me on the show.
[165.06 --> 166.84]  You guys are going to meet Mark pretty soon.
[166.94 --> 171.32]  We've got a video coming where I do some cabling upgrades in my house.
[171.32 --> 175.32]  And I have a real live contractor who knows how to use tools...
[175.32 --> 178.16]  Come and help me with it.
[178.20 --> 180.38]  By which I mean I hired him to do it for me.
[180.58 --> 182.80]  And then I pretended I knew what I was talking about.
[183.18 --> 185.14]  And I just repeated what he told me off camera.
[185.30 --> 186.82]  Anyway, the point is...
[186.82 --> 188.16]  You'll meet him soon enough.
[188.24 --> 189.58]  He's getting enough screen time.
[190.00 --> 193.72]  For now, I think he's just coming to take my money for that job that he did.
[193.72 --> 196.84]  But I've invited anyone from LMG to come on to the show.
[196.98 --> 201.84]  So, if you guys have any special requests, you can let me know in the Twitch chat where I will promptly ignore it.
[201.90 --> 209.98]  Because, quite frankly, the Twitch chat is pretty hard for me to monitor at this point.
[210.14 --> 212.16]  It moves so fast these days.
[212.62 --> 214.66]  So, let's start with our first topic here.
[214.66 --> 219.44]  This was posted by Blizzard Angle on the forum.
[219.76 --> 223.72]  And the original source here is from research.ibm.com.
[224.24 --> 226.66]  IBM announced on May the 4th...
[227.24 --> 229.70]  That is to say, Star Wars Day...
[229.70 --> 236.66]  That they're making a superconducting quantum processor available over the internet.
[237.32 --> 240.90]  And, my friends, does it really get much cooler than that?
[241.66 --> 243.02]  I don't think it does.
[243.02 --> 243.54]  It's...
[243.54 --> 244.36]  The point of the...
[244.36 --> 245.10]  Actually, hold on.
[245.20 --> 246.02]  First, but first...
[246.02 --> 249.20]  Oh, I've been waiting for an opportunity to do this for a while.
[249.30 --> 252.58]  But first, don't let me explain quantum computing to you.
[253.02 --> 256.70]  Let's have my Prime Minister explain quantum computing to you guys here.
[256.74 --> 257.00]  Hold on.
[257.02 --> 259.00]  Let me just go back to the timestamp here.
[259.12 --> 260.00]  So, Justin Trudeau.
[260.08 --> 260.72]  This was...
[260.72 --> 263.00]  We actually talked about this on the WAN show a while back.
[263.10 --> 264.10]  This is old news.
[264.18 --> 267.02]  But, for those of you who aren't familiar with quantum computing...
[267.70 --> 268.16]  Here we go.
[268.86 --> 270.30]  But most of you...
[270.30 --> 271.96]  Normal computers work either.
[271.96 --> 273.80]  There's power going through a wire or not.
[273.92 --> 273.96]  If one...
[274.56 --> 276.78]  I realized just now I can't hear him.
[276.92 --> 280.96]  So, I'm going to have to just kind of guess at when he's done.
[281.42 --> 281.48]  So...
[281.48 --> 282.40]  Or a zero.
[282.60 --> 283.72]  They're binary systems.
[284.24 --> 290.80]  What quantum states allow for is much more complex information to be encoded into a single bit.
[291.30 --> 293.66]  Regular computer bit is either a one or a zero.
[293.80 --> 294.52]  On or off.
[294.52 --> 297.46]  A quantum state could be much more complex than that.
[297.62 --> 298.24]  Because, as we know...
[298.24 --> 299.14]  More complex than that.
[299.14 --> 299.44]  That's good.
[299.44 --> 301.00]  ...article and wave at the same time.
[301.12 --> 308.74]  And the uncertainty around quantum states allows us to encode more information into a much smaller computer.
[308.74 --> 311.50]  So, that's what's exciting about quantum computing.
[311.74 --> 311.98]  And that's what...
[311.98 --> 313.40]  That kind of looks like a conclusion there.
[313.48 --> 314.04]  There, I'm sorry.
[314.16 --> 314.42]  All right.
[314.42 --> 315.14]  There you go.
[315.56 --> 316.64]  So, that's...
[316.64 --> 318.06]  Don't get me going.
[318.06 --> 318.28]  If my scene would change.
[318.38 --> 320.12]  That's quantum computing in a nutshell.
[320.40 --> 321.46]  That's why we care.
[321.90 --> 322.96]  Very cool stuff.
[323.08 --> 327.22]  Especially for, you know, complex modeling types of equations.
[327.42 --> 329.70]  Like, they're not going to solve 2 plus 2 equals 4 faster.
[329.70 --> 335.70]  But if you're looking at modeling a weather system, for example, quantum computing is going to be the cat's PJs.
[336.38 --> 347.02]  So, what they're providing here is 5 qubits with the goal today being to get people to start thinking quantum.
[347.24 --> 350.08]  To start thinking about how a quantum computer works.
[350.18 --> 355.04]  Because, sure, you can create all the hardware in the world that you want.
[355.40 --> 358.92]  You can say, okay, we're going to build, you know, like, your Intel or AMD.
[358.92 --> 361.32]  AMD did it first with the dual core processors.
[361.92 --> 366.04]  We're going to build this dual core F1 64X2.
[366.46 --> 368.82]  And then it landed on the scene.
[369.84 --> 371.46]  And no one was ready for it.
[371.80 --> 373.36]  No one was ready for...
[373.36 --> 376.96]  I mean, at that time, you know, we're talking about consumer grade applications.
[377.16 --> 385.28]  No one was ready for a consumer grade application to have more than two processing cores to use power from.
[385.28 --> 397.44]  So, many of the early reviews of AFLON 64X2s, especially because benchmarking was limited to single-threaded benchmarks in most of the case in those days.
[397.68 --> 401.32]  Many of the early reviews said, yeah, like, it's cool, but it's really expensive.
[401.52 --> 404.10]  And the performance benefit doesn't necessarily justify it.
[404.10 --> 413.74]  But the problem, the problem that I've always had with the way that benchmarking is done, and I don't have a solution, unfortunately, is that it's done in a vacuum.
[413.98 --> 415.06]  It's done scientifically.
[415.06 --> 421.76]  It's not done on a dirty operating system that has, you know, McAfee and Norton running in the background.
[421.88 --> 428.10]  You know, the kind of thing where you'd roll into grandma's house and be like, crying out loud, grandma, can you stop installing this stuff?
[428.82 --> 429.30]  Please!
[430.78 --> 435.56]  Where a dual core, even then, would have made a huge, like, enormous difference.
[435.56 --> 449.24]  So, here we're talking about that at a much earlier stage in the game, where not just consumers, because quantum computers are years and years and years and years away from being used by consumers,
[449.24 --> 462.98]  but even, like, even researchers have to start thinking about completely different ways to approach their programs in order for a quantum processor to even perform optimally.
[463.12 --> 464.88]  And we're not even talking optimally yet.
[464.88 --> 467.70]  We're talking about to have any advantage over a classical processor.
[468.10 --> 474.94]  So, moving from single to dual core was enough of a paradigm shift that it's taken, oh, I don't know, 10 years to catch up.
[475.38 --> 477.44]  Quantum, whole other can of beans.
[477.44 --> 481.92]  So, here, I'm just going to pop up the original article here from IBM's website.
[482.38 --> 484.16]  So, here's where they're kind of talking about it.
[484.24 --> 486.40]  Here's where you can sort of learn about stuff, careers.
[487.02 --> 488.64]  They just, they want people thinking about this.
[488.70 --> 489.80]  They want people practicing.
[490.02 --> 491.06]  They want people learning.
[492.56 --> 495.22]  The portal is called the IBM Quantum Experience.
[495.48 --> 499.28]  It includes tutorials and a visual programming interface.
[499.66 --> 504.82]  Users can learn about algorithms and perform real quantum operations on the 5-qubit chip.
[504.82 --> 507.80]  The chip is housed at IBM's Watson facility.
[508.44 --> 512.20]  And IBM's aim is to have the chip available 24-7.
[512.76 --> 521.36]  So, it's part of a family of superconducting quantum processors that have their qubits arranged in lattices instead of a line, which means absolutely nothing to me.
[521.40 --> 521.80]  I'm sorry.
[522.20 --> 524.52]  But that is a little bit, that is a little bit over my head.
[524.52 --> 530.14]  But in a nutshell, this offers better connectivity between qubits for error correction.
[530.70 --> 537.46]  So, instead of having to go, if you need to talk between this one and this one, instead of going through everyone, they're connected in more like a web.
[537.46 --> 543.36]  So, Jay Gambetta, manager of the Theory of Quantum Computing and Information group at IBM, says,
[543.58 --> 548.04]  Access to the chip will be free, but not frictionless.
[548.46 --> 553.18]  We don't want a billion bots launching things and stopping real people from wanting to use it.
[553.34 --> 558.96]  I mean, I don't know anyone who would want to do something like that, but, you know.
[558.96 --> 565.30]  So, the group is developing a system that will assign coins to different types of users to grant access.
[565.88 --> 567.52]  Pretty freaking cool.
[567.94 --> 575.22]  But actually, in terms of what will change your life in the next year in a more sort of dramatic fashion,
[575.80 --> 580.10]  this next bit of news is cooler from like my perspective.
[580.26 --> 581.48]  Like, how does this help me?
[581.96 --> 585.74]  So, the original article here is from jalopnik.com.
[585.78 --> 587.02]  I'll go ahead and pull this up.
[587.02 --> 594.64]  But the plan is to have Lyft be able to pick you up in a self-driving car within a year.
[594.76 --> 599.46]  And as always, the headline is a little bit sensationalist.
[599.56 --> 605.28]  We actually don't have a ton of information in terms of what the rollout is going to look like.
[605.46 --> 613.00]  But what we do know is that GM and Lyft are collaboratively testing a fleet of self-driving Chevy Bolt electric taxis
[613.00 --> 615.84]  and will be doing so within a year.
[615.84 --> 620.08]  So, General Motors invested $500 million into Lyft earlier this year.
[620.54 --> 628.00]  And this program will rely on technology being acquired as part of GM's separate $1 billion planned purchase of Cruise Automation, Inc.
[628.00 --> 631.52]  Many details still to be worked out according to a Lyft executive.
[632.12 --> 636.10]  And will include customers in a yet-to-be-disclosed city.
[636.20 --> 640.20]  So, no, unfortunately, Lyft isn't just like suddenly going,
[640.28 --> 641.68]  Hey, bye-bye, drivers.
[642.08 --> 646.02]  And it was great how you drove those cars for us.
[646.30 --> 647.62]  Thank you very much.
[647.62 --> 651.56]  And, you know, wholesale replacing every single car that they have on the road.
[651.68 --> 653.32]  That is not how it's going down.
[653.60 --> 660.40]  It's going to be a pilot program that they're going to be testing, presumably in a city that will give them a permit to do this.
[660.46 --> 666.06]  I mean, if I had to guess, I would say something like San Francisco, because that's where all of this crap happens.
[666.06 --> 673.92]  You know, where you could get, I think the first grocery delivery service was introduced there.
[674.42 --> 680.74]  If I recall correctly, oh, please don't quote me on this one, but I think Amazon Prime rolled out in San Francisco first.
[681.12 --> 683.08]  I'm sure Twitch chat is going to correct me if I'm wrong.
[683.14 --> 691.36]  But it feels like they get all the cool pilot programs, whereas Vancouver still doesn't have Uber or Lyft at all because of the taxicab mafia.
[691.54 --> 692.40]  Thanks for that, you guys.
[692.40 --> 703.66]  So for more details on the Bolt, in case you guys are curious about it, we actually did a video from the New York Auto Show, 2016 New York Auto Show, a couple of months back.
[704.02 --> 709.72]  But in a nutshell, it'll be priced as low as $30,000 after U.S. federal tax credits.
[710.14 --> 711.38]  It was coming in late 2016.
[711.54 --> 712.98]  It actually looks pretty cool.
[713.26 --> 716.26]  And it's estimated to have more than 200 miles of range.
[716.32 --> 717.04]  So that would be what?
[717.76 --> 720.46]  It's like 1.4 or something.
[720.46 --> 723.72]  So like almost 300 kilometers.
[724.08 --> 725.36]  Don't quote me on that either.
[725.52 --> 727.04]  So more than 200 miles of range.
[727.24 --> 730.44]  It'll fully charge in nine hours with their 240-volt charger.
[730.68 --> 732.94]  And the battery is located under the cabin floor.
[733.10 --> 743.80]  A lot of automakers were showing off their new, different, innovative ways to store the batteries in these cars that would help lower the center of gravity and improve fuel economy.
[743.80 --> 749.06]  So getting it lower or positioning it closer to the middle of the car.
[749.14 --> 750.46]  I believe it was...
[750.46 --> 751.06]  Oh, crap.
[751.16 --> 751.76]  Who was this?
[752.62 --> 753.02]  Volvo.
[753.26 --> 753.46]  Yes.
[753.56 --> 758.58]  Volvo had a car that they were showing that had the battery actually positioned kind of in the center console.
[758.72 --> 760.02]  What would normally be dead space?
[761.36 --> 762.80]  Pretty freaking exciting.
[762.80 --> 763.48]  Exciting.
[763.60 --> 769.00]  I mean, I'm still kind of skeptical.
[769.82 --> 771.80]  Like I don't...
[772.80 --> 780.24]  As much as cool as it is, as you know, that in one city, in one pilot program, some lift cars.
[780.28 --> 782.72]  Which, by the way, you will be able to opt in or out of.
[782.78 --> 784.92]  You can say, hey, no, I want a driver behind the wheel.
[784.92 --> 786.82]  Or, hey, no, it's cool.
[787.84 --> 789.84]  Like as interesting as it is, as some...
[789.84 --> 794.78]  That some of the fleet of one city, probably one, will have these driverless cars.
[794.88 --> 799.44]  I think we're still a long way away from that being rolled out more widely in more cities.
[799.68 --> 805.70]  And even further away from that being something that's feasible for a person to actually buy.
[805.78 --> 807.30]  Or a person to even be allowed to buy.
[807.30 --> 813.20]  Because not only would these electric cars have to be validated for a specific city.
[813.34 --> 817.72]  Where you know they're going to have to be like obsessively updating the maps, for example.
[818.04 --> 822.60]  But they would have to be suitable for driving from a city to another city.
[822.78 --> 825.18]  And in between and not screwing up.
[825.44 --> 828.10]  So, I don't know, man.
[828.40 --> 831.22]  I've seen some pretty impressive cameras on cars.
[831.42 --> 834.06]  But I haven't seen any as good as my eyes yet.
[834.14 --> 835.64]  Which is one thing that worries me a little.
[835.72 --> 837.24]  With that said, my eyes don't have radar.
[837.46 --> 840.84]  So, there's plenty of advantages to a computer as well.
[840.92 --> 844.24]  Maybe I'm just being an old person who is afraid of technology.
[844.76 --> 845.62]  That's a possibility.
[848.32 --> 849.10]  Ah, shoot.
[849.24 --> 853.70]  I had wanted to see if you guys were going to correct me on the whole San Fran.
[853.70 --> 858.96]  Getting all the legit demos here.
[860.22 --> 861.96]  But, no.
[862.08 --> 863.64]  I just see a bunch of comments like,
[863.98 --> 865.22]  Don't quote them on anything!
[865.98 --> 868.80]  It's like, why does anyone even watch this show?
[868.94 --> 870.04]  And what's with all the numbers?
[870.22 --> 871.54]  Like, what are you people even doing?
[872.24 --> 873.78]  People are just posting a bunch of numbers.
[874.12 --> 875.82]  Is it like how old I'm supposed to be?
[875.88 --> 877.02]  I see numbers like 98.
[877.24 --> 878.40]  Which I am not.
[878.84 --> 880.84]  Which I am not that old.
[880.84 --> 882.34]  All right.
[882.34 --> 882.38]  All right.
[882.38 --> 884.88]  Let's move into our next topic here.
[885.44 --> 886.38]  Oh, this.
[886.64 --> 886.94]  Okay.
[888.66 --> 891.60]  Now, there's been a lot of upset.
[892.10 --> 893.64]  And justifiably so.
[893.82 --> 895.24]  From the enthusiast community.
[895.46 --> 897.46]  As well as just general consumers.
[897.46 --> 901.58]  About Microsoft getting more and more aggressive.
[902.00 --> 908.56]  About their push for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 users to upgrade to Windows 10.
[908.56 --> 915.00]  It went from being something that you basically had to force manually with like,
[915.70 --> 919.54]  I forget if it was like registry edits or like command line nonsense.
[919.54 --> 921.08]  But I've done it.
[921.54 --> 925.64]  To something that was pretty easy to access.
[925.96 --> 927.70]  It was just kind of always there in the bottom.
[928.20 --> 932.48]  To something that just installed itself.
[932.82 --> 934.48]  As a normal Windows update.
[934.54 --> 936.38]  Without you really asking for it.
[936.38 --> 941.70]  And now, the free upgrade from Windows 7 and up is going away.
[941.78 --> 942.50]  It is official.
[943.06 --> 947.56]  July 29th is the last day for your Windows 10 free upgrade.
[947.68 --> 950.24]  Which means sometime in the next couple of months here.
[950.36 --> 952.12]  We're going to have to run around the office.
[952.50 --> 955.32]  And find out if there's any machines on shelves anywhere.
[955.54 --> 958.50]  That still are running Windows 7 or Windows 8.
[958.68 --> 960.66]  And make sure that we get those upgrades processed.
[960.66 --> 963.74]  Because starting on July 30th.
[963.74 --> 968.00]  You're going to have to pay $119 US for Windows 10.
[968.08 --> 970.44]  They are going to start asking you to pay for it.
[970.70 --> 971.76]  Which raises the question.
[972.10 --> 975.30]  By then, will they have fixed the fundamental problems with Windows 10?
[975.38 --> 976.50]  Like the start menu not working?
[978.90 --> 980.22]  And the search not working?
[980.36 --> 980.80]  Oh man.
[981.14 --> 984.16]  I posted, this was a post I made on Twitter a while ago.
[984.16 --> 987.22]  Where I searched for, I forget what it was.
[987.28 --> 989.32]  I think it was like, internet.
[989.72 --> 990.86]  Or like, Microsoft.
[991.28 --> 991.50]  Or something.
[991.62 --> 993.86]  It was like, it was like Microsoft's own stuff.
[993.94 --> 999.28]  And as I typed, the suggestions got just completely changed.
[999.78 --> 1000.76]  Completely changed.
[1000.82 --> 1006.94]  Even though the things I was typing in could have easily corresponded to any of the things that it suggested.
[1007.02 --> 1009.14]  It was just, it was just bizarro land.
[1009.24 --> 1010.40]  The kinds of results that I was getting.
[1010.44 --> 1011.26]  And it still does that.
[1011.26 --> 1017.62]  You know, if you type inter, and let's say you have, you know, some old interplay game on your computer.
[1017.68 --> 1018.86]  I don't even know if they made PC games.
[1018.94 --> 1019.42]  Not the point.
[1019.68 --> 1021.26]  Or you have internet explorer.
[1022.22 --> 1024.46]  And when you put in IN, it might bring up one of them.
[1024.54 --> 1026.56]  And you put in the T, it might bring up only the other one.
[1026.64 --> 1028.38]  It's like, what are you even doing?
[1028.38 --> 1041.80]  So, maybe July 29th is the last day that I'll have to deal with clicking the start menu and having it, like, pitch for three seconds before it actually starts up.
[1041.86 --> 1045.18]  So, the original poster of that topic on the forum was Goodbytes.
[1045.62 --> 1049.38]  And the original article here is from the Windows.com blog.
[1049.38 --> 1052.96]  Windows 10, now on 300 million active devices.
[1053.42 --> 1055.84]  Free upgrade offer to end soon.
[1055.92 --> 1058.80]  Because there is some other news to go along with this here.
[1060.16 --> 1060.88]  Let's see.
[1061.36 --> 1068.36]  We're seeing people at homes, at schools, at small businesses, and at large companies and other organizations adopt Windows 10 faster than ever.
[1068.56 --> 1071.20]  And use Windows 10 more than ever before.
[1071.20 --> 1076.52]  Which is a funny statement, because how could you not use Windows 10 more than ever before?
[1076.80 --> 1078.12]  It didn't even exist.
[1080.68 --> 1085.42]  Sometimes I wish this was more like a radio show, where I had, like, sound effects on, like, a soundboard that I could play.
[1085.46 --> 1086.94]  I could be like, crickets sound effects.
[1087.18 --> 1087.34]  Yeah.
[1088.82 --> 1091.04]  Oh, cool.
[1091.58 --> 1091.90]  Okay.
[1092.20 --> 1093.82]  I don't have a close-up camera.
[1093.88 --> 1094.26]  Oh, it's okay.
[1094.30 --> 1095.50]  You guys can kind of see this from here.
[1095.84 --> 1097.88]  So, we actually just got...
[1097.88 --> 1099.00]  Hey, Jakey.
[1099.00 --> 1103.22]  How much was that FLIR sample they sent us?
[1103.30 --> 1103.56]  $3,000.
[1104.00 --> 1104.28]  No, no.
[1104.30 --> 1104.80]  The other one.
[1104.98 --> 1105.94]  Oh, $7,000.
[1106.14 --> 1106.34]  Yeah.
[1106.44 --> 1106.66]  Okay.
[1106.86 --> 1108.22]  So, is it pronounced FLIR?
[1108.52 --> 1108.80]  FLIR.
[1109.00 --> 1109.32]  FLIR?
[1109.62 --> 1110.10]  Okay.
[1110.28 --> 1110.50]  Whatever.
[1110.62 --> 1111.62]  The thermal camera guys.
[1111.72 --> 1112.04]  FLIR.
[1112.48 --> 1115.66]  So, Jake, our part-time intern guy.
[1116.02 --> 1116.42]  It's okay.
[1116.46 --> 1116.94]  I don't need it.
[1116.96 --> 1117.32]  It's fine.
[1117.82 --> 1119.06]  He's not actually an intern.
[1119.30 --> 1120.24]  He's our part-time guy.
[1120.28 --> 1120.70]  He's a student.
[1120.94 --> 1123.60]  Anyway, he has been working on organizing the warehouse.
[1123.60 --> 1128.48]  And more recently, working on some cool concepts for new content.
[1128.48 --> 1132.30]  So, he's like, hey, you guys have never done anything with thermal cameras before.
[1132.42 --> 1134.62]  And I kind of went, uh-huh.
[1135.84 --> 1137.26]  And he's like, we should do that.
[1137.34 --> 1138.84]  I'm like, okay.
[1140.12 --> 1141.80]  So, get on it, man.
[1141.90 --> 1142.38]  Come on.
[1142.40 --> 1142.94]  Let's go.
[1143.28 --> 1144.48]  So, he reached out to...
[1145.40 --> 1146.28]  See, I don't even know.
[1146.76 --> 1147.16]  FLIR.
[1147.28 --> 1147.38]  FLIR.
[1147.38 --> 1147.66]  Thank you.
[1147.88 --> 1152.58]  Reached out to FLIR and got samples of their iPhone thermal camera.
[1152.58 --> 1154.98]  So, um, or, sorry.
[1155.06 --> 1156.24]  They're mobile thermal cameras.
[1156.36 --> 1157.00]  One for iPhone.
[1157.20 --> 1158.00]  One for Android.
[1158.20 --> 1161.58]  So, you can see this is, uh, this is a shot of, uh, is this your laptop?
[1162.28 --> 1165.00]  This is a shot of, uh, Nick's, Nick's laptop.
[1165.10 --> 1165.80]  His work laptop.
[1166.24 --> 1169.02]  Uh, that shows exactly how hot the various parts of it are running.
[1169.56 --> 1172.76]  And FLIR actually agreed temporarily.
[1173.12 --> 1174.28]  They're not letting us keep this one.
[1174.28 --> 1175.60]  So, those are a few hundred bucks a pop.
[1175.66 --> 1180.28]  And we can use them in things like, uh, case reviews, laptop reviews, all kinds of cool stuff.
[1180.40 --> 1187.74]  But they actually sent us, for comparison's sake, their $7,000 professional grade one.
[1188.14 --> 1195.76]  So, Jake's actually going to be working on, like, an overall video talking about their thermal camera sort of ecosystem.
[1196.02 --> 1197.62]  And what these things are used for.
[1197.78 --> 1199.12]  And, like, trying them out.
[1199.22 --> 1201.94]  And it should be actually a pretty cool, pretty cool little piece of content.
[1202.06 --> 1203.04]  I'm pretty excited about it.
[1203.04 --> 1208.12]  And so is he, because he's spending all of his time today with it, instead of actually doing all the crap he needs to do.
[1208.22 --> 1208.70]  Thanks, Jake.
[1211.50 --> 1211.94]  Anyway.
[1212.62 --> 1215.60]  Uh, back to the, back to the Windows 10 not being free anymore.
[1216.02 --> 1219.10]  Um, so, some more examples of Microsoft's, no, I'm just bugging you.
[1219.28 --> 1223.60]  Some more examples of Microsoft's awesome stats on Windows 10 that aren't necessarily that meaningful.
[1224.78 --> 1230.22]  Over 63 billion minutes were spent in Microsoft Edge in March alone.
[1230.22 --> 1234.78]  I mean, were they loading pages in Edge?
[1235.30 --> 1239.22]  Did they accidentally leave it running in the background while they used a real web browser?
[1240.40 --> 1241.56]  I don't know.
[1242.22 --> 1245.76]  There's 50% growth in minutes since the last quarter.
[1245.76 --> 1250.32]  Cortana has helped answer over 6 billion questions since launch.
[1250.94 --> 1254.82]  9 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 since launch.
[1255.62 --> 1261.68]  Apps that come with Windows 10, including photos, groove music, and movies and TV, are seeing millions of active users each month.
[1261.68 --> 1264.08]  Yeah, that's because people accidentally click on them.
[1264.14 --> 1264.30]  Okay.
[1264.94 --> 1269.60]  This actually leads me pretty well into a, into a Windows 10, uh, rant here.
[1269.66 --> 1271.86]  Let's go ahead and, uh, screen share with me.
[1271.96 --> 1272.28]  All right.
[1272.38 --> 1274.04]  So, okay.
[1275.72 --> 1276.72]  Let's open this.
[1277.04 --> 1280.06]  So this is going to open in that stupid, worthless photos app.
[1280.26 --> 1282.36]  Here, I'm just going to move myself out of here.
[1283.14 --> 1284.24]  Uh, oh, did that work?
[1284.42 --> 1284.82]  Hold on.
[1285.92 --> 1286.58]  There we go.
[1286.58 --> 1287.14]  All right.
[1287.36 --> 1289.94]  So this is me creating a, a WAN show thumbnail.
[1290.98 --> 1295.02]  So, scroll wheel doesn't zoom.
[1296.10 --> 1297.90]  Why would scroll wheel not zoom?
[1299.34 --> 1300.58]  Why would that be?
[1301.52 --> 1301.92]  Okay.
[1302.82 --> 1311.92]  Back button and forward button does not go to the previous and the next, and the next picture.
[1311.92 --> 1320.56]  Who thought that that was an improvement?
[1321.70 --> 1322.06]  Who?
[1322.36 --> 1323.58]  I want a name.
[1324.10 --> 1330.30]  I want a name for the person who thought that the back button and forward button on the mouse,
[1330.64 --> 1334.94]  which has existed for 10 years or something like that,
[1335.66 --> 1340.22]  for who thought that that should do nothing in the photos app?
[1340.22 --> 1343.74]  Because they're dumb.
[1344.14 --> 1345.34]  And that's dumb.
[1346.28 --> 1354.14]  It's unbelievably bad design for that to do a completely different thing in the photos app
[1354.14 --> 1357.38]  than it does anywhere else on your computer.
[1358.58 --> 1359.06]  Unreal.
[1362.76 --> 1363.66]  While I'm at it.
[1363.70 --> 1364.12]  You know what?
[1364.22 --> 1364.56]  You know what?
[1364.62 --> 1365.24]  While I'm at it.
[1365.34 --> 1367.40]  I got, I got another Windows 10 rant for you guys.
[1367.44 --> 1367.62]  Okay.
[1367.62 --> 1367.66]  Okay.
[1368.28 --> 1369.86]  This is, this is one.
[1370.00 --> 1370.50]  Oh man.
[1370.54 --> 1372.90]  This one just, this one just grinds my gears.
[1373.74 --> 1379.28]  So, let's say for example, I search for, all right.
[1379.34 --> 1379.50]  Yeah.
[1379.52 --> 1380.66]  Here, let's just do a search.
[1380.74 --> 1384.94]  I'm going to try not to, I'm going to try not to like break anything here.
[1385.02 --> 1385.36]  All right.
[1385.54 --> 1387.42]  So, I got to get rid of myself again here.
[1387.98 --> 1388.22]  Okay.
[1388.22 --> 1389.92]  So, I'm going to search, search for terrible.
[1390.30 --> 1390.56]  Okay.
[1391.06 --> 1392.14]  Let's search for terrible.
[1393.10 --> 1397.74]  And search is like, by and large, pretty function, seems to be trying to function right now.
[1397.88 --> 1401.46]  By and, by and large, I have, I don't have too many complaints about the Windows Explorer
[1401.46 --> 1401.86]  search.
[1402.22 --> 1404.74]  I mean, especially given this is an SSD we're talking about.
[1404.74 --> 1408.36]  I don't necessarily think this should be taking as long as it is, but, uh.
[1413.56 --> 1414.00]  Okay.
[1415.00 --> 1416.96]  This is, this is taking a while.
[1417.34 --> 1419.44]  Um, that was not my intent.
[1420.04 --> 1420.24]  Okay.
[1420.24 --> 1421.14]  Let's just interrupt that.
[1421.20 --> 1422.24]  Let's search for terrible.
[1423.14 --> 1423.56]  All right.
[1425.68 --> 1426.48]  Working on it.
[1427.50 --> 1427.86]  Jeez.
[1429.54 --> 1432.06]  I mean, they're making it too easy for me right now.
[1434.24 --> 1436.54]  Like, this is a solid state drive.
[1436.60 --> 1438.18]  I don't even have that much stuff on here.
[1438.22 --> 1442.66]  I mean, what could possibly have a perfect, a perfect match for, for terrible?
[1442.76 --> 1443.24]  There we go.
[1443.28 --> 1443.68]  There we go.
[1443.74 --> 1444.42]  Terrible selfie.
[1444.54 --> 1444.76]  All right.
[1444.80 --> 1445.22]  There it is.
[1446.04 --> 1446.38]  Okay.
[1448.24 --> 1448.60]  So.
[1450.24 --> 1456.92]  This particularly bothered me the other day when I was searching for a folder name and
[1456.92 --> 1463.48]  it brought up, it brought up like folder, under folders, it brought up things that weren't
[1463.48 --> 1464.12]  folders.
[1464.64 --> 1468.02]  And I was like, oh, that's, that's awful.
[1468.56 --> 1468.76]  Okay.
[1468.86 --> 1470.42]  So, oh, shoot.
[1470.52 --> 1474.08]  This demo isn't going to work because I didn't bring up a, I didn't actually search for a
[1474.08 --> 1474.30]  folder.
[1474.44 --> 1474.64]  Okay.
[1474.70 --> 1474.90]  Okay.
[1474.94 --> 1475.14]  Okay.
[1475.18 --> 1475.46]  Hold on.
[1475.50 --> 1476.34]  I will get this right.
[1476.62 --> 1477.56]  I will get this right.
[1477.98 --> 1478.38]  Okay.
[1478.40 --> 1478.86]  There we go.
[1478.86 --> 1481.70]  So let's, let's search for, let's search there.
[1481.86 --> 1484.24]  Let's search for help, help, help.
[1484.36 --> 1485.16]  That's what I need.
[1485.22 --> 1485.66]  I need help.
[1485.74 --> 1485.98]  Okay.
[1486.60 --> 1487.32]  Here we go.
[1487.50 --> 1493.54]  So if I open up this and I go back, I would expect that to take me to my search results.
[1493.62 --> 1494.94]  That is an expected behavior.
[1495.30 --> 1499.24]  If I open up this folder and I go up folder.
[1499.24 --> 1504.34]  Why would that take me to search results?
[1504.34 --> 1506.98]  So I go back.
[1507.04 --> 1507.72]  That takes me back.
[1507.92 --> 1510.12]  Why would that take me to search results?
[1510.24 --> 1513.16]  I said up directory, not.
[1513.60 --> 1517.80]  So it takes, I think it takes me to a search for help in a higher directory or some stupid
[1517.80 --> 1518.46]  thing like that.
[1518.46 --> 1524.52]  It's unbelievable how non-functional the up directory thing.
[1524.52 --> 1530.54]  So if you find like a folder within a folder somewhere on your computer, you actually have
[1530.54 --> 1536.36]  to right click open folder location and then you can do it.
[1536.36 --> 1541.04]  Why would I open a folder and then want to navigate back to my search result?
[1541.12 --> 1543.52]  If I want to do that, I'd say back, not up directory.
[1543.68 --> 1546.40]  They are distinctly different functions and they should be treated as such.
[1547.00 --> 1550.84]  So there, those, those are my rants.
[1551.22 --> 1557.12]  A search result is not a directory and whatever the last thing I said was that made me really
[1557.12 --> 1557.40]  mad.
[1561.00 --> 1563.94]  Apparently Taryn just showed up on stream.
[1564.00 --> 1564.82]  I didn't even notice him.
[1564.82 --> 1570.44]  I was busy being angry about windows 10 and, uh, and I, I got distracted.
[1570.74 --> 1571.24]  All right.
[1571.26 --> 1576.76]  Well, anyway, um, I guess this is a, this is a very directly related news story.
[1576.84 --> 1580.20]  Originally, uh, the original article is from the verge.com.
[1580.28 --> 1584.64]  Microsoft is removing the nagging windows 10 upgrade notifications soon.
[1584.88 --> 1588.90]  And by soon, I think they mean, uh, July 29th.
[1588.90 --> 1589.36]  Yes.
[1589.76 --> 1591.24]  So there you go.
[1591.24 --> 1596.42]  So basically they're going to end the annoying prompts to upgrade when it is no longer an
[1596.42 --> 1597.14]  option to upgrade.
[1597.24 --> 1602.10]  I think we could have probably figured that out on our own, but thank you, the verge, um,
[1602.26 --> 1603.60]  for, for that little article.
[1604.18 --> 1604.82]  Thank you.
[1604.98 --> 1606.14]  That was much appreciated.
[1606.62 --> 1608.30]  39 comments on that article.
[1608.80 --> 1609.48]  That's, that's good.
[1609.48 --> 1610.92]  Okay.
[1611.46 --> 1615.12]  So speaking of comments, I'm sure you guys are going to have a lot of comments on this
[1615.12 --> 1615.58]  next one.
[1615.64 --> 1618.42]  The original article here is from the BBC.com.
[1619.30 --> 1623.14]  Actually, I think technically it's BBC.com, not the BBC.com.
[1623.20 --> 1628.38]  I take no responsibility if the BBC.com is like the bare butt club.com or something like
[1628.38 --> 1628.58]  that.
[1628.58 --> 1631.98]  I can't prevent you from going there, but I also won't recommend it.
[1632.24 --> 1637.50]  So China bans erotic banana eating live streams.
[1638.80 --> 1645.14]  The Chinese authorities do not want suggestive banana eating to be featured online.
[1645.24 --> 1653.28]  Now I remember the outrage slash relief when Twitch got, hold on a second.
[1653.28 --> 1656.68]  Why am I streaming at 720, 60 FPS?
[1657.82 --> 1659.92]  I changed it before the stream to 10, whatever.
[1660.18 --> 1661.18]  Nothing I can do about that now.
[1661.26 --> 1670.84]  Anyway, I remember the outrage slash relief when Twitch banned, I think it was cleavage,
[1671.84 --> 1674.30]  cleavage, and I think, uh, bare shirts.
[1674.38 --> 1678.82]  Anyway, they, they, they, they tightened up their, their sort of what constitutes nudity
[1678.82 --> 1679.34]  guidelines.
[1679.34 --> 1683.24]  But this, this raises a lot of questions.
[1683.36 --> 1689.76]  I mean, how do you, how do you determine the difference between erotically eating a banana
[1689.76 --> 1691.44]  and eating a banana?
[1691.78 --> 1695.72]  Does the rule apply to eating, I don't know, say a raw potato?
[1696.46 --> 1705.22]  Like if I were to, you know, seductively, you know, chew on this phone, like, is that,
[1705.40 --> 1707.12]  is that not okay in China?
[1707.30 --> 1708.56]  I, I have no idea.
[1708.56 --> 1710.78]  Apparently just shirtless is banned.
[1710.92 --> 1711.96]  So cleavage is still okay?
[1712.12 --> 1712.78]  I, I don't know.
[1713.42 --> 1716.22]  Um, I, I'm actually, I'm not sure what the rules are on Twitch.
[1716.28 --> 1718.84]  I just keep all my clothes on and we don't have any problems.
[1719.44 --> 1720.18]  I don't have them.
[1720.56 --> 1725.90]  I, my old, like, uh, partner, partner manager contact is apparently like a VP now.
[1726.00 --> 1730.88]  So either I would get away with it or he'd come down on me super hard and be like, yo,
[1731.50 --> 1734.06]  dude, you don't even stream games on your account.
[1734.06 --> 1735.54]  Like what the hell?
[1735.66 --> 1737.82]  I have stuck my neck out for you enough times.
[1737.82 --> 1739.64]  Just get off my site once and for all.
[1740.28 --> 1744.48]  Um, so anyway, these new regulations, and this is, this is crazy.
[1744.88 --> 1749.56]  Cause you think about like how huge streaming is, especially becoming in China.
[1749.56 --> 1756.32]  Live streaming sites have to monitor their output around the clock, keeping an eye out for
[1756.32 --> 1758.06]  any erotic banana eating.
[1758.54 --> 1759.06]  All right.
[1759.12 --> 1759.56]  What are we doing?
[1759.72 --> 1761.44]  Oh man, that video again.
[1761.70 --> 1766.70]  We're streaming live on Twitch.tv and it's too late to add this to that video.
[1766.78 --> 1768.40]  So I have no idea what this clip is for.
[1768.40 --> 1775.04]  Ah, I see how this is.
[1775.96 --> 1776.58]  All right.
[1778.02 --> 1784.10]  Um, so those of you who didn't watch it, I actually thought it was pretty entertaining.
[1784.32 --> 1788.82]  Ed and I did a vlog, uh, when we were on our, when we were on our trip to San Francisco
[1788.82 --> 1795.34]  a little while ago where we were basically just like selfie camera-ing periodically throughout
[1795.34 --> 1795.98]  the whole trip.
[1796.06 --> 1803.98]  So you guys get, I think a pretty good feel for what, what attending one of these conventions
[1803.98 --> 1808.52]  with us is pretty much like, I thought it was actually a really neat way for us to do
[1808.52 --> 1808.62]  it.
[1808.66 --> 1814.04]  So every sort of, you know, every half an hour to a couple hours or so it's like whip
[1814.04 --> 1814.68]  out the selfie cam.
[1814.72 --> 1815.40]  Hey, what are we doing?
[1815.40 --> 1818.96]  Like here we are, we're at a dance party where no one's dancing.
[1819.22 --> 1820.68]  We're interviewing Flowrider.
[1820.78 --> 1821.66]  We're doing this, we're doing that.
[1821.90 --> 1824.54]  So I thought it was actually a pretty cool way to, to do it.
[1824.56 --> 1825.20]  You should check it out.
[1825.36 --> 1829.40]  We actually kind of stomped on that video release because it was sort of an experimental format
[1829.40 --> 1832.80]  and we didn't want to position it as like a full daily release.
[1832.80 --> 1834.78]  So we released another video like two hours later.
[1835.10 --> 1836.48]  Uh, but you should go back and check it out.
[1836.64 --> 1839.44]  It's, um, the selfie vlog with Linus and Ed.
[1839.46 --> 1840.74]  I don't remember what we called it anyway.
[1840.74 --> 1844.86]  Um, so back to, back to China banning erotic banana live streams.
[1845.40 --> 1848.72]  Um, the paper adds.
[1848.72 --> 1853.24]  So this article adds that wearing stockings and suspenders while hosting a live stream
[1853.24 --> 1854.32]  is also now forbidden.
[1854.74 --> 1860.88]  So this is the authority's latest attempt to clamp down on inappropriate and erotic online
[1860.88 --> 1861.54]  content.
[1861.54 --> 1869.10]  And I got to tell you, if eating a banana qualifies as erotic content in China, I'm glad I don't
[1869.10 --> 1869.70]  live in China.
[1870.32 --> 1875.22]  Um, so in April, the Ministry of Culture announced that it was investigating a number of popular
[1875.22 --> 1879.90]  live streaming platforms for allegedly hosting pornographic or violent content that harms
[1879.90 --> 1881.34]  social morality.
[1881.34 --> 1885.90]  And despite these governmental concerns, such sites are attracting more and more users in
[1885.90 --> 1886.30]  China.
[1886.30 --> 1891.66]  New Express Daily cites data showing that 26% of live streaming viewers are under 18, 60%
[1891.66 --> 1895.94]  of those creating the content are under 22, and three quarters of those watching are male.
[1895.94 --> 1896.66]  Surprise, surprise.
[1897.52 --> 1901.76]  News of the banana ban has prompted thousands to chime in on Chinese social media.
[1902.76 --> 1907.22]  Um, one person asks, how do they decide what's provocative when eating a banana?
[1907.22 --> 1908.52]  Okay, I also asked that.
[1908.58 --> 1912.36]  And another asks, are male live streamers still allowed to eat them?
[1912.70 --> 1919.32]  Which is a great question because I don't think there's any way to answer that question
[1919.32 --> 1927.60]  without upsetting LGBTQ activists or feminist activists.
[1927.86 --> 1930.50]  And I'm not even saying they're unjustified in that way.
[1931.14 --> 1936.18]  Like, because if they're not allowed, then you're saying, what, you know, homosexuality is
[1936.18 --> 1938.80]  wrong, and if they are allowed, then you're saying it's a double standard.
[1939.62 --> 1940.40]  You can't win, China.
[1940.92 --> 1941.88]  Sorry, China, you can't win.
[1941.92 --> 1945.46]  I mean, you can win just by, like, being more oppressive, I guess.
[1945.62 --> 1951.54]  And there's that whole gamifying, gamifying your, you know, being a good citizen thing that's
[1951.54 --> 1952.80]  coming and it's super scary.
[1953.54 --> 1954.68]  Maybe you'll win after all.
[1955.14 --> 1955.52]  All right.
[1956.12 --> 1961.66]  Speaking of winning, Luke drew the, I don't know, is it a short straw or a long straw?
[1961.66 --> 1964.00]  He definitely drew a straw.
[1964.22 --> 1970.28]  And he is in Texas right now attending an NVIDIA event that is rumored.
[1970.62 --> 1970.98]  I don't know.
[1971.04 --> 1972.70]  Is it still a rumor at this point?
[1973.76 --> 1976.16]  Surely it must be basically established.
[1976.16 --> 1983.40]  So there's the order of 10 countdown doodad we got going on here that there was much,
[1983.98 --> 1985.76]  much speculation about.
[1985.80 --> 1986.40]  Yeah, there we go.
[1986.48 --> 1988.76]  So it has a link to the NVIDIA special event now.
[1988.76 --> 1992.12]  So we actually got one of these order of 10 packages.
[1993.60 --> 1995.02]  But it's funny.
[1995.32 --> 1995.86]  It's really funny.
[1995.98 --> 1997.28]  I've been really busy lately.
[1997.94 --> 2003.84]  So where other publications went and, like, solved all these puzzles and, like, posted the
[2003.84 --> 2004.20]  results.
[2004.28 --> 2005.66]  And I'm like, yeah, we think it's NVIDIA.
[2005.78 --> 2007.84]  We think it uses the NVIDIA font.
[2007.96 --> 2011.56]  And, like, 10 is probably, like, GeForce 10 series.
[2011.92 --> 2013.28]  And, like, they did all this stuff.
[2013.28 --> 2016.86]  And I was like, yeah, I'm really busy.
[2017.00 --> 2018.54]  This doesn't have a return address.
[2019.08 --> 2021.40]  And I put it back on the shelf and completely forgot about it.
[2022.72 --> 2025.48]  So anyway, that's happening tonight.
[2026.04 --> 2029.36]  I think they're just saying special event.
[2029.64 --> 2032.94]  Yeah, tune in to watch the live stream of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.
[2032.94 --> 2039.84]  So Nick just took my co-host.
[2040.84 --> 2043.92]  Jensen Huang, as he shares the very latest about the future of gaming.
[2044.08 --> 2046.18]  So Luke is at an NVIDIA event.
[2046.42 --> 2048.90]  He is going to presumably be attending that.
[2049.26 --> 2049.54]  Wow.
[2049.64 --> 2052.02]  That's I'm sure this would not be allowed in China.
[2052.02 --> 2054.98]  I was looking around to see if anyone in the office had a banana.
[2055.70 --> 2059.06]  Yeah, I actually had meant to bring a banana into the office today.
[2059.30 --> 2061.58]  But, so that I could eat it provocatively on WAN Show.
[2061.62 --> 2062.50]  But, you know what?
[2062.58 --> 2065.44]  The worst thing about that is, is I've done it on WAN Show before.
[2065.62 --> 2068.32]  So it wouldn't even be, I wouldn't even be breaking new ground.
[2068.42 --> 2069.80]  You've done it on YouTube too.
[2069.88 --> 2070.10]  Yeah.
[2070.30 --> 2071.60]  Oh, have I done it on YouTube too?
[2071.64 --> 2072.64]  On what?
[2072.98 --> 2073.34]  Fractal.
[2073.98 --> 2074.36]  On what?
[2074.92 --> 2075.54]  Oh, yeah.
[2075.70 --> 2076.18]  Oh, yeah.
[2076.46 --> 2076.82]  Josh.
[2076.82 --> 2079.86]  Josh from Fractal had me eat a banana provocatively.
[2080.10 --> 2080.90]  I remember that too.
[2081.32 --> 2081.66]  Vaguely.
[2082.02 --> 2085.32]  I was kind of intoxicated by his manliness at the time.
[2085.38 --> 2087.42]  See, now Nick broke my thing.
[2087.50 --> 2089.92]  And it's not standing up and sitting up anymore.
[2090.48 --> 2091.18]  Dang it, Nick.
[2091.28 --> 2091.76]  There we go.
[2091.88 --> 2092.14]  All right.
[2092.18 --> 2093.14]  I have my co-host back.
[2094.48 --> 2096.64]  So we don't really know much.
[2096.78 --> 2099.00]  Other than that they're going to reveal a bunch of stuff.
[2099.14 --> 2104.70]  Though WCCF Tech has posted that the cooler shrouds are confirmed.
[2104.96 --> 2107.52]  So they're going to have this new kind of angular design.
[2108.08 --> 2109.94]  It's cool that they're going to be doing the stream on Twitch.
[2110.02 --> 2110.48]  That's neat.
[2110.48 --> 2114.36]  When they did the 980 launch, I don't remember what they were streaming on, but it wasn't
[2114.36 --> 2114.68]  Twitch.
[2114.76 --> 2116.74]  And I was like, oh, I wonder why it's not on Twitch.
[2116.84 --> 2117.50]  So now it is.
[2117.98 --> 2121.10]  I mean, it seems like a pretty relevant platform for gamers.
[2121.98 --> 2123.96]  I guess that's it?
[2124.32 --> 2128.62]  That's all I can really say other than that Jonathan13 was the original poster for that
[2128.62 --> 2130.82]  over on the forum.
[2132.82 --> 2133.54]  All right.
[2135.88 --> 2140.52]  Just going to take a quick beverage break here and a quick sponsor break.
[2140.52 --> 2147.02]  So we have a bunch of OG sponsors on the WAN show today.
[2147.02 --> 2151.72]  For our regular viewers, you guys are going to know who they are, but maybe you've never
[2151.72 --> 2152.68]  tried them before.
[2152.90 --> 2154.40]  Starting with Dollar Shave Club.
[2154.40 --> 2159.90]  DollarShaveClub.com delivers amazing razors right to your door for a third of the price
[2159.90 --> 2160.66]  of what the...
[2161.34 --> 2162.24]  It's really funny.
[2162.38 --> 2165.54]  Their advertising copy says greedy razor companies.
[2165.80 --> 2168.66]  But why don't I say traditional razor companies?
[2169.24 --> 2174.14]  Traditional in the sense that they have higher prices and that the blades are locked behind
[2174.14 --> 2178.24]  a padlock in stores because people steal them because they're expensive.
[2178.24 --> 2184.28]  Joining DollarShaveClub.com means you can afford to shave with a fresh blade anytime you want,
[2184.36 --> 2189.72]  which is fantastic because they send fresh shaving supplies directly to your door once
[2189.72 --> 2190.12]  a month.
[2190.46 --> 2194.28]  And for the smoothest shave ever, they've got other shaving accessories as well.
[2194.38 --> 2195.74]  They've got their Dr. Charvers...
[2195.74 --> 2196.98]  Dr. Charvers...
[2196.98 --> 2198.74]  Dr. Carver's Shave Butter.
[2199.08 --> 2202.70]  They've got their Dollar Shave Club Aftershave.
[2202.84 --> 2206.50]  They've got their Peppermint Scented Butt Wipes for Men, their One Wipe Charlies, which actually
[2206.50 --> 2207.76]  are not for shaving your face.
[2208.26 --> 2211.26]  But I feel obligated to bring up that...
[2212.26 --> 2215.20]  Did I say Peppermint Scented Butt Wipes for Men?
[2215.32 --> 2216.38]  Women could use them too.
[2216.52 --> 2217.94]  That's what I feel obligated to bring up.
[2218.02 --> 2223.02]  Dollar Shave Club's razors, even though they don't necessarily come in, you know, pink sparkle
[2223.02 --> 2227.20]  color or whatever, are equally effective on men and women.
[2227.36 --> 2232.76]  In fact, one of the biggest comments that we ever got on these Dollar Shave Club spots
[2232.76 --> 2234.30]  was when we first kind of thought of it.
[2234.32 --> 2237.26]  And we were like, we're always pitching this, like, for dudes.
[2237.26 --> 2239.76]  Get a subscription for your lady.
[2240.52 --> 2240.76]  Not because...
[2240.76 --> 2242.98]  Not because, like, not to send a message.
[2243.30 --> 2244.04]  To be very clear.
[2244.12 --> 2245.98]  This is not about sending a message.
[2246.64 --> 2252.08]  If she shaves already and she is spending too much on shaving supplies, what a cool gift.
[2252.08 --> 2256.30]  For just a few bucks a month, she can have fresh blades, which when you're doing that amount
[2256.30 --> 2261.48]  of area, like legs and armpits and all that stuff that they shave that is like, oh, I'm
[2261.48 --> 2263.96]  glad I don't have to do that at all, which is great.
[2264.76 --> 2267.00]  You can dull a razor pretty freaking quickly.
[2267.00 --> 2269.24]  So it's available in the US, Canada, and Australia.
[2269.66 --> 2274.66]  And all you got to do is go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to join the club.
[2276.00 --> 2282.86]  Speaking of joining the club, you should join the club of people who use Squarespace, like
[2282.86 --> 2285.02]  us, on our linusmediagroup.com website.
[2285.02 --> 2289.84]  As well as I know there are multiple employees here who actually have Squarespace sites either
[2289.84 --> 2292.12]  for their family or for themselves personally.
[2292.78 --> 2297.14]  They're simple, powerful, beautiful web templates.
[2297.34 --> 2298.32]  Did I call them web templates?
[2298.44 --> 2304.14]  Website templates allow you to build a site that looks great, is functional, and scales
[2304.14 --> 2308.00]  according to the device that it's being viewed on, whether it's a computer or a phone or whatever
[2308.00 --> 2309.04]  else the case may be.
[2309.08 --> 2311.04]  It's called responsive design.
[2311.04 --> 2315.52]  And they've got a lot of other great features as well, all through this pleasing web interface.
[2315.74 --> 2318.06]  So you can make more advanced modifications to your site.
[2318.16 --> 2319.32]  You can add pictures.
[2319.52 --> 2324.18]  You can have a cover page, which is just like a simple, beautiful one-page web presence.
[2324.56 --> 2326.08]  They've got commerce built in.
[2326.18 --> 2328.92]  They've got their logo designer.
[2329.16 --> 2333.12]  And you can start a trial with no credit card required and start building your website today.
[2333.40 --> 2334.92]  Head over to squarespace.com.
[2335.16 --> 2339.80]  And if you use offer code Linus, you can save 10% off your first purchase.
[2340.32 --> 2340.52]  Woo!
[2341.04 --> 2344.68]  And if you buy it for the year, they'll actually throw in a domain for you as well.
[2344.80 --> 2347.68]  So Squarespace, you should build it.
[2347.76 --> 2348.86]  Simple, powerful, beautiful.
[2349.08 --> 2352.42]  I think I just integrated three separate Squarespace slogans.
[2352.50 --> 2354.02]  I can't wait until they throw another one at me.
[2354.80 --> 2361.82]  I wonder, would Squarespace have like a crazy, stupid slogan just to see if they can trip me up?
[2361.88 --> 2365.32]  Like, Squarespace, Linus sucks, or something like that.
[2365.40 --> 2366.58]  Like, see if they could get me to say it.
[2367.16 --> 2368.00]  I don't think so.
[2368.00 --> 2369.92]  I think they're a little more professional than that.
[2370.12 --> 2371.34]  But that is worth a shot.
[2371.82 --> 2375.22]  Speaking of being worth a shot, lynda.com is worth a shot.
[2375.28 --> 2380.84]  If you're looking to take your hobby or your career even to the next level, check out lynda.com.
[2381.00 --> 2387.74]  There are over 3,000 courses that are available, are used by millions of people around the world who are looking to better themselves.
[2387.74 --> 2394.16]  They've got topics like web development, photography, visual design, business, software training like Excel, WordPress, and Photoshop.
[2394.76 --> 2400.98]  And their courses are taught by industry experts who are passionate about teaching with new courses added every week.
[2401.24 --> 2409.32]  So whether you're setting new financial goals for yourself, you just want to like, let's say you're commuting two hours to work every day and back.
[2409.32 --> 2414.62]  And you just kind of go, what if I could just like work from home and you want to develop a new skill set?
[2414.96 --> 2415.60]  Try it out.
[2415.84 --> 2422.32]  They've got lots of great tools like being able to skip ahead to any point in the, so you can read the transcript of the course.
[2422.40 --> 2423.70]  You can go, oh, that part looks interesting.
[2423.80 --> 2425.08]  It'll skip to that point in the video.
[2425.30 --> 2428.86]  You can download to your iOS or Android device and you can view on the go.
[2428.86 --> 2436.46]  And you can share like playlists of career development or learning paths with your friends so you can learn together.
[2436.60 --> 2439.38]  It's freaking awesome and plans start at only 25 bucks a month.
[2439.44 --> 2444.14]  So head over to lynda.com slash wancho for an all-you-can-eat free 10-day trial.
[2447.54 --> 2451.04]  Which I guess leads us into our next topic here.
[2451.84 --> 2458.14]  Next Gen AI Vive to be debuted at an industry conference Monday, May the 9th.
[2458.14 --> 2461.20]  So this was originally posted by Gingernator on the forum.
[2462.20 --> 2467.64]  Is that like a ginger persecutor or like a powerful ginger?
[2468.24 --> 2469.06]  I'm actually not sure.
[2469.14 --> 2470.30]  I'm hoping for the second one.
[2471.42 --> 2477.74]  Series creators say they've made something better that will take care of everything for you.
[2478.54 --> 2480.36]  Dun, dun, dun.
[2481.14 --> 2482.88]  I already hate the way it's being marketed.
[2483.48 --> 2486.06]  Five, the global brain.
[2488.14 --> 2489.18]  That is terrifying.
[2489.26 --> 2490.28]  They should just call it Sky.
[2490.36 --> 2492.48]  I'm actually like would.
[2493.46 --> 2495.64]  Yeah, I guess it would be trademarked.
[2495.70 --> 2496.12]  I guess.
[2496.24 --> 2496.82]  Or copyright.
[2497.52 --> 2498.96]  Yeah, it would be copyright, I guess.
[2499.18 --> 2501.90]  So you actually couldn't call your AI Skynet.
[2501.98 --> 2506.50]  But if someone could, I'm sure they would in spite of the fact that it's really not that funny.
[2506.50 --> 2508.92]  So here's the quote.
[2509.06 --> 2510.00]  It's the global brain.
[2510.78 --> 2516.30]  Viv or Vi, I'm just guessing, radically simplifies the world by providing an intelligent interface to everything.
[2516.72 --> 2525.10]  It's been in the works for approximately four years and is planned as an open system like Siri was prior to being purchased by Apple in 2010.
[2525.10 --> 2531.20]  So an example of how it works would be a group of engineers sat down to order a pizza in an entirely new way.
[2532.10 --> 2537.62]  Get me a pizza from Pisa, Chicago near my office, one of the engineers says into his smartphone.
[2538.00 --> 2541.42]  A text from Viv might pop up saying, would you like toppings with that?
[2541.42 --> 2543.30]  So the eight engineers all jump in.
[2543.36 --> 2544.84]  Pepperoni, half cheese, Caesar salad.
[2545.66 --> 2546.88]  Emboldened by the result.
[2547.06 --> 2548.18]  Wow, this is hilarious.
[2548.72 --> 2550.18]  They peppered Viv with more commands.
[2550.32 --> 2550.96]  Add more toppings.
[2551.06 --> 2551.54]  Remove toppings.
[2551.66 --> 2552.38]  Change medium to large.
[2552.70 --> 2556.68]  40 minutes later, the driver shows up with four made-to-order pizzas.
[2557.60 --> 2561.62]  Viv had confused the office address, but they addressed the issue.
[2561.78 --> 2567.58]  So the engineers had managed to order a pizza start to finish without placing a phone call using Google search or opening an app.
[2568.36 --> 2570.90]  Many in Silicon Valley believe this could be the next step in computing.
[2570.90 --> 2572.02]  And commerce.
[2572.92 --> 2574.58]  So, wow.
[2578.58 --> 2581.10]  That is pretty freaking cool.
[2582.78 --> 2585.68]  So one of the founders basically said,
[2586.32 --> 2591.08]  the idea is taking the way that humans have naturally interacted with each other for thousands of years
[2591.08 --> 2595.88]  and applying that to a way that they can interact with services.
[2597.80 --> 2598.72]  I'm excited.
[2598.72 --> 2605.34]  I mean, it's one of those things where I am sort of excited, actually, would be a better way of saying that,
[2605.40 --> 2607.96]  because this is always being claimed.
[2608.46 --> 2611.78]  Like when Apple launched Siri, it's like, oh, Siri will make interacting with your phone.
[2611.84 --> 2613.62]  I almost never use Siri.
[2613.62 --> 2617.06]  I like Siri for certain things like, hey, Siri, play some music.
[2617.82 --> 2620.58]  Oh, I don't have Apple Music.
[2620.98 --> 2622.08]  So, okay, whatever.
[2623.18 --> 2624.16]  Or for navigation.
[2624.32 --> 2625.10]  Sometimes it's great.
[2625.22 --> 2627.12]  But I remember 201...
[2627.12 --> 2628.68]  20162?
[2628.96 --> 2629.42]  No, no.
[2629.52 --> 2630.46]  It wasn't...
[2630.46 --> 2631.66]  No, it was a different address.
[2632.02 --> 2633.40]  It was the street of a different...
[2633.40 --> 2633.60]  Okay.
[2634.80 --> 2635.64]  70A Avenue.
[2637.18 --> 2638.20]  Siri can't do it.
[2638.68 --> 2640.08]  Neither can Google now, for that matter.
[2640.20 --> 2641.50]  They just can't.
[2641.96 --> 2644.02]  70A Avenue is impossible.
[2644.02 --> 2647.44]  It comes up as 70...
[2647.44 --> 2652.66]  17, or it comes up as 70-something.
[2652.78 --> 2656.22]  Anyway, it actually cannot do it.
[2656.52 --> 2657.78]  And it's very, very frustrating.
[2657.94 --> 2659.54]  So this is always being promised to us.
[2659.64 --> 2660.76]  It's never actually being delivered.
[2660.90 --> 2664.20]  If this turns out to actually be awesome, then I'm super stoked.
[2664.20 --> 2669.86]  Because between that and self-driving cars that just, like, show up where I need them and take me to where I need to go,
[2670.74 --> 2673.58]  I can't actually figure out what I will need to do anymore.
[2673.88 --> 2675.56]  I'll just spend all my time making videos.
[2675.68 --> 2678.40]  Which, speaking of videos...
[2678.40 --> 2679.68]  Dun, dun, dun!
[2680.24 --> 2681.70]  I'm going to post this in the Twitch chat.
[2681.78 --> 2685.82]  We have released another episode of Nerd Sports exclusively on Vessel.
[2685.92 --> 2690.02]  Actually, the first episode is available on the free Vessel platform.
[2690.02 --> 2693.54]  So all you have to do is sign up for our Vessel account.
[2693.54 --> 2695.80]  And you can watch the volleyball episode.
[2696.02 --> 2698.38]  Let's go ahead and pull this up.
[2698.66 --> 2701.52]  But the dodgeball episode was just released two days ago.
[2701.60 --> 2704.54]  So, so far, we've got volleyball, lacrosse, and dodgeball.
[2704.90 --> 2709.28]  Vessel does offer a one-week free trial if you sign up for the platform with your credit card.
[2709.36 --> 2712.12]  So you can watch all of those and the next one coming.
[2712.20 --> 2715.52]  So we've got hockey coming in five more days.
[2715.52 --> 2718.74]  And then we've actually got curling coming a week after that.
[2718.74 --> 2723.30]  So at that point, the five initial episodes of this miniseries will be released.
[2723.30 --> 2724.88]  I highly recommend you check them out.
[2724.88 --> 2726.26]  They're actually pretty funny.
[2726.68 --> 2729.12]  The editing is done by Nick Van Burkle.
[2729.40 --> 2731.40]  The shooting was done by the entire team.
[2731.48 --> 2735.60]  This is actually a very challenging but very rewarding project for us.
[2735.94 --> 2740.52]  And yeah, it's one of the coolest things we've ever done, for sure.
[2740.68 --> 2742.44]  So you guys are going to want to check that out.
[2742.50 --> 2746.88]  If you're on Vessel or if you're not on Vessel, then check it out.
[2746.98 --> 2748.58]  We have a one-week free trial, if nothing else.
[2748.58 --> 2751.62]  All right.
[2752.00 --> 2753.28]  Oh, crap.
[2753.76 --> 2755.92]  I wore the wrong shirt on Wancho.
[2756.38 --> 2757.82]  Nick Light is going to kill me.
[2758.20 --> 2761.66]  Because we actually have new Linus Techchips shirts.
[2767.24 --> 2768.50]  That are like...
[2768.50 --> 2771.56]  I don't actually know if they're limited edition or what.
[2771.64 --> 2773.74]  But they are freaking sick.
[2773.74 --> 2777.86]  I hosted a couple of videos recently that aren't due to be released in a little while.
[2778.40 --> 2778.80]  But that...
[2778.80 --> 2779.76]  Here, on top of the wardrobe.
[2779.88 --> 2780.22]  To your right.
[2780.74 --> 2781.12]  There you go.
[2781.20 --> 2781.54]  Black one.
[2781.88 --> 2782.52]  That should be one.
[2782.92 --> 2783.22]  Check.
[2783.98 --> 2784.52]  Is that it?
[2785.66 --> 2785.98]  Yay.
[2786.08 --> 2786.54]  That's fine.
[2786.72 --> 2787.04]  That's fine.
[2787.12 --> 2788.38]  The other one's like at home or something.
[2788.52 --> 2789.04]  Don't even try.
[2790.06 --> 2791.32]  I thought he was going to throw it at me.
[2791.40 --> 2792.20]  He is going to throw it at me.
[2792.26 --> 2793.18]  He's planning to throw it at me.
[2793.32 --> 2793.50]  Oh.
[2793.66 --> 2793.84]  Oh.
[2793.96 --> 2794.28]  Okay.
[2794.40 --> 2794.56]  Yeah.
[2794.58 --> 2795.02]  That's fine.
[2795.02 --> 2805.54]  So I will be using my laptop here to avoid violating Twitch's no nips policy here.
[2806.16 --> 2807.94]  Hopefully there's no Twitch staff in the chat.
[2808.88 --> 2809.94]  I'm watching the stream.
[2810.52 --> 2810.84]  Hold on.
[2810.94 --> 2811.78]  Get my headphones off.
[2811.88 --> 2812.04]  Okay.
[2812.60 --> 2813.34]  Hold on.
[2813.52 --> 2814.10]  Should be fine.
[2815.98 --> 2816.46]  Yeah.
[2816.62 --> 2817.20]  Should be fine.
[2817.40 --> 2817.80]  Hold on.
[2818.60 --> 2819.30]  No nips.
[2819.30 --> 2820.66]  Are bare shoulders okay?
[2821.34 --> 2824.30]  I mean, this is really no different from wearing like spaghetti straps and...
[2824.30 --> 2826.52]  And, you know, whatever.
[2826.52 --> 2827.00]  What do you do?
[2827.06 --> 2827.74]  We're pink top.
[2827.98 --> 2829.74]  Does anyone find bare shoulders sexy?
[2830.48 --> 2832.44]  No one finds my bare shoulders sexy.
[2832.52 --> 2833.04]  That's for sure.
[2833.14 --> 2833.62]  That's true.
[2833.72 --> 2834.16]  All right.
[2834.66 --> 2835.50]  There we go.
[2835.58 --> 2836.40]  Oh, yeah.
[2837.40 --> 2838.72]  See that shine?
[2839.46 --> 2839.98]  Shiny.
[2841.00 --> 2844.36]  Shiny Linus Tech Tips shirts are coming, my friends.
[2844.74 --> 2848.24]  We're going to have them in gold as well as silver.
[2848.44 --> 2850.94]  I personally like the silver one better.
[2851.04 --> 2851.94]  I think it looks better.
[2851.94 --> 2856.66]  But the gold one is definitely that bling, so to speak.
[2857.48 --> 2859.00]  So, oh, man.
[2859.16 --> 2865.94]  The entire Twitch chat is just full of people finding my shoulders sexy, which is awesome.
[2866.64 --> 2867.00]  Thank you.
[2867.78 --> 2869.12]  Oh, the links are live.
[2869.28 --> 2869.80]  Oh, awesome.
[2869.90 --> 2870.02]  Yeah.
[2870.06 --> 2871.94]  So, these are actually available now.
[2873.40 --> 2874.80]  For 30 days, limited edition.
[2875.00 --> 2876.50]  They are limited edition, apparently.
[2876.76 --> 2878.76]  See, I don't even know any of these things.
[2878.76 --> 2882.34]  So, there's the gold one, and here's the silver one.
[2882.84 --> 2887.30]  Teespring just got the capability recently to print in these foils.
[2887.74 --> 2891.20]  So, here, I'm going to bring up the store link here, and I'll show this to you guys here.
[2891.74 --> 2892.14]  Check it out.
[2892.20 --> 2893.02]  Actually, the pictures.
[2893.14 --> 2893.32]  Wow.
[2893.40 --> 2894.72]  The pictures are sort of awful.
[2895.40 --> 2897.22]  Sorry, Teespring, but the pictures are awful.
[2897.22 --> 2900.92]  It looks way better than that in person.
[2901.52 --> 2902.72]  Let's go to the gold one.
[2902.78 --> 2905.50]  So, you can actually see on camera here.
[2905.68 --> 2908.14]  See, that looks so dull compared to this.
[2908.26 --> 2909.28]  You can see the shine.
[2910.60 --> 2910.80]  Ugh.
[2911.50 --> 2915.88]  They need to do better pictures for the gold and silver print stuff.
[2915.94 --> 2917.04]  But that's sort of their problem.
[2917.80 --> 2919.70]  We can show off the shirt ourselves.
[2920.10 --> 2922.22]  I should just have Dennis model everything from now on.
[2922.28 --> 2923.56]  Everyone likes it better when he does it.
[2923.70 --> 2924.70]  Should have had him come on the show.
[2924.70 --> 2926.52]  All right.
[2926.62 --> 2928.18]  Moving on to some more topics here.
[2928.26 --> 2931.48]  This was originally posted by Wizard Sa on the forum.
[2931.58 --> 2933.18]  The original article here is from Gizmeg.
[2938.18 --> 2939.72]  My son did that the other day.
[2939.78 --> 2940.58]  He took a sip of something.
[2940.68 --> 2942.34]  He was like, ah.
[2943.00 --> 2944.40]  I'm like, who taught you that?
[2944.66 --> 2944.96]  You know?
[2945.84 --> 2951.50]  Like, you just want to keep kids from learning this crap.
[2951.68 --> 2952.00]  All right.
[2952.00 --> 2959.08]  So, Frankie Zapta's awesome flyboard air redefines the concept of a hoverboard.
[2959.18 --> 2960.72]  Let's fire up some of these pictures here.
[2961.28 --> 2966.12]  So, we can navigate the gallery with right and left arrow keys or we can just click these buttons.
[2967.48 --> 2971.22]  It looks absolutely bananas though.
[2971.22 --> 2973.40]  How cool is that?
[2974.60 --> 2978.54]  How sketched out would you be flying around on that thing trying to take, like, pictures?
[2978.74 --> 2982.76]  Like, you can tell why the angle isn't perfect on it.
[2982.84 --> 2985.98]  That is freaking amazing.
[2986.14 --> 2991.46]  You can tell they still don't have the faith in this system to fly over land.
[2991.46 --> 2993.18]  So, they're over water.
[2993.32 --> 3007.84]  But, it appears to have a jet engine powering the device with autonomous flight up to 10,000 feet, a top speed of 150 kilometers an hour, 10 minutes of autonomy, and won't be on the market in 2016.
[3008.18 --> 3008.96]  That is for sure.
[3008.96 --> 3017.70]  I mean, it's funny because when I was a kid, the best thing we could come up with, kind of, was flying cars.
[3017.80 --> 3022.84]  Because, like, you're bound by the paradigms that already exist around you somewhat in terms of your imagination.
[3023.70 --> 3025.70]  And there were all these issues with flying cars.
[3025.80 --> 3026.62]  Like, they would be big.
[3026.68 --> 3028.66]  You would eventually have traffic again.
[3028.80 --> 3032.00]  Collisions would be just disastrous.
[3032.00 --> 3035.28]  Whereas, this.
[3036.00 --> 3037.16]  This looks awesome.
[3037.80 --> 3038.76]  Oh, yeah, another thing.
[3038.98 --> 3045.46]  Like, you know, you'd have to have either VTOL or you'd have to have, like, landing strips everywhere.
[3046.02 --> 3049.60]  And VTOL is really inefficient and landing strips take up a lot of space.
[3049.72 --> 3053.74]  And, like, so if people were legitimately commuting on them, there were going to be a lot of things to overcome.
[3054.58 --> 3055.78]  Personal vehicles like this?
[3056.12 --> 3059.88]  If it can go up to 150 kilometers an hour, they've got 10 minutes of flight already.
[3059.88 --> 3061.88]  That.
[3063.64 --> 3066.78]  That is potentially all the solution that we need.
[3067.60 --> 3068.84]  Like, I could get to work.
[3069.08 --> 3070.94]  And let's say they can double the flight time.
[3071.10 --> 3078.18]  I can get to work in, you know, 15 minutes at, you know, 80 kilometers an hour or something along those lines.
[3078.22 --> 3078.76]  That's for sure.
[3078.90 --> 3080.80]  I charge it up throughout the day and go home.
[3081.28 --> 3082.74]  That is freaking awesome.
[3083.62 --> 3086.70]  And actually quite practical if it's small and compact.
[3086.70 --> 3089.16]  Here, let's fire up the video of them flying in here.
[3089.16 --> 3090.80]  Sorry, I'll turn this down a little bit.
[3092.88 --> 3094.34]  Here we go.
[3094.96 --> 3096.00]  Check this out.
[3096.62 --> 3097.22]  This is unreal.
[3103.62 --> 3104.14]  Man.
[3116.14 --> 3116.80]  So cool.
[3116.80 --> 3116.82]  So cool.
[3119.16 --> 3120.16]  Yeah.
[3120.16 --> 3147.22]  Like, beyond words.
[3147.22 --> 3147.76]  All right.
[3148.90 --> 3153.64]  AMD Polaris will support up to 240 hertz displays.
[3153.84 --> 3156.24]  This was literally posted by Atex on the forum.
[3156.62 --> 3160.38]  And the original article here is from oc3d.net.
[3161.06 --> 3164.12]  This really isn't that surprising.
[3166.02 --> 3173.64]  DisplayPort 1.3 has higher bandwidth than DisplayPort 1.2 by a significant margin.
[3173.64 --> 3177.58]  So it should come as no surprise that you can do any number of things with that.
[3177.58 --> 3178.72]  You can increase resolution.
[3178.72 --> 3181.36]  You can increase color depth.
[3181.36 --> 3184.92]  You can increase refresh rate.
[3184.92 --> 3187.60]  Or you can do some combination of the three.
[3187.60 --> 3194.74]  So what DisplayPort 1.3 will enable is 1080p up to 240 hertz high dynamic range.
[3195.20 --> 3199.90]  1440p up to 170 hertz high dynamic range.
[3199.90 --> 3206.52]  3440 by 1440 up to 144 hertz high dynamic range or 190 hertz standard dynamic range.
[3206.52 --> 3212.68]  And of course, this is the first time I'm actually hearing about HDR on PC graphics cards as well.
[3212.74 --> 3213.52]  That's pretty exciting.
[3213.60 --> 3222.28]  I have a video coming with a Samsung TV as sort of the focal point of it where I talk a lot about HDR standards, where they're at, where the content's at.
[3222.28 --> 3228.20]  And then we'll have support for up to 5k 60 hertz standard dynamic range.
[3229.32 --> 3238.56]  So guys, make sure you guys tune in because the whole high dynamic range thing in video is not the same as HDR photography.
[3238.78 --> 3242.58]  It is like not even, not really related.
[3242.70 --> 3251.96]  In the way that HDR is sort of used as an artistic statement, high dynamic range in video is actually just more about being able to see more of the image.
[3251.96 --> 3256.34]  Which, to be clear, I do know HDR is used in stills for that purpose.
[3256.84 --> 3266.00]  But unlike for stills, where HDR is achieved by taking multiple exposures of the same subject and then stitching them together after the fact,
[3266.30 --> 3272.82]  high dynamic range in video is actually just able to use more of the information that was already captured by the camera.
[3272.82 --> 3282.06]  that current standard dynamic range standards do not allow.
[3282.50 --> 3288.94]  So for example, a top of the range camera like an Arri Alexa, whatever the variant of it is, that's the flagship right now,
[3289.44 --> 3293.14]  can handle something along the lines of I think 14.5 stops of dynamic range.
[3293.20 --> 3293.60]  Brandon?
[3294.60 --> 3296.30]  Alexa, 14.5 stops?
[3296.30 --> 3297.30]  Yeah.
[3297.30 --> 3299.46]  Yeah, 14.5 stops of dynamic range.
[3300.06 --> 3303.10]  Standard dynamic range is somewhere in the neighborhood of like six.
[3303.64 --> 3309.70]  So when the filmmaker captures all this information in the highlights, like a burning candle or the low lights, like a shadow,
[3310.64 --> 3315.68]  when they adapt that to be viewed on your PC monitor or on your TV at home,
[3316.12 --> 3321.08]  you are getting a fraction of the information that was captured in those highlights and low lights.
[3321.08 --> 3329.18]  They have to kind of compress that into this much narrower range of brightest to darkest that can be displayed by,
[3329.36 --> 3331.28]  well, standard dynamic range televisions.
[3331.96 --> 3336.46]  High dynamic range is going to increase that to somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 stops,
[3336.62 --> 3340.40]  which will make a huge difference, especially when viewing in the dark.
[3340.52 --> 3342.56]  So I'm pretty excited about it.
[3342.66 --> 3345.24]  With that said, there's really not a lot of content right now.
[3345.30 --> 3348.66]  There's like Marco Polo on Netflix and I think Amazon Prime Video has a couple.
[3348.66 --> 3349.90]  Everything can just be redone.
[3349.90 --> 3352.58]  Yeah, everything can be redone in HDR.
[3352.80 --> 3357.40]  You can buy all your damn movies again.
[3358.74 --> 3366.96]  Now with HDR and 4K, Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[3367.18 --> 3368.36]  They call it that now.
[3368.44 --> 3369.16]  Can you believe that?
[3369.22 --> 3371.02]  They renamed Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[3371.22 --> 3372.54]  I bought the Blu-ray pack.
[3372.62 --> 3374.40]  I think I ranted about this recently, actually.
[3374.84 --> 3376.14]  Maybe it was on Wancho last week.
[3376.14 --> 3376.48]  Uh-oh.
[3376.48 --> 3379.86]  Anyway, well, it upset me enough that I had to rant about it again.
[3379.96 --> 3383.84]  They renamed Raiders of the Lost Ark to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[3383.90 --> 3384.80]  You can't do that.
[3386.02 --> 3388.48]  Might as well replace all the guns with walkie-talkies.
[3388.48 --> 3392.10]  All right.
[3392.10 --> 3395.06]  So this was originally posted by Pig Hammer on the forum.
[3395.56 --> 3399.42]  Original article here is from blogs.wallstreetjournal.com.
[3399.48 --> 3400.54]  Actually, WSJ.
[3401.20 --> 3406.56]  Apple loses an iPhone trademark battle in China.
[3406.56 --> 3415.84]  So it's actually a leather accessories company that has won the right to use the iPhone name in China.
[3416.04 --> 3423.22]  Now to be clear, they're iPhone like this with all capitals, whereas Apple is small I, big P, small hone.
[3423.22 --> 3431.64]  But the Chinese court that ruled on this did not differentiate between capital and non-capital letters.
[3433.64 --> 3439.78]  And basically threw out Apple's appeal in a trademark dispute that's been in Chinese courts for the last four years.
[3439.78 --> 3445.48]  So Apple actually applied for the iPhone trademark back in 2002, but it wasn't granted until 2013.
[3447.30 --> 3454.22]  Zintang Tiandi Technology Co. Ltd. applied for the trademark in the category of leather goods in 2007, securing it in 2010.
[3454.92 --> 3459.16]  So the court's ruling reflects the free market system in China.
[3459.80 --> 3462.78]  I've got some pictures here of iPhone-branded bags.
[3463.36 --> 3463.84]  There you go.
[3464.12 --> 3464.84]  So that's an iPhone.
[3467.06 --> 3467.62]  Okay.
[3467.62 --> 3467.72]  Okay.
[3469.78 --> 3470.50]  Sure.
[3472.50 --> 3478.14]  Elon Musk says the production deadline for the Model 3 is impossible.
[3478.56 --> 3481.60]  This was posted by DJDWASC97 on the forum.
[3481.72 --> 3484.00]  Original article here is from CNET.com.
[3484.66 --> 3492.08]  And so during their quarter one 2016 earnings call, he set a deadline of July 1st, 2017 to begin Model 3 production,
[3492.44 --> 3496.92]  then said that it would likely be an impossible goal to meet.
[3496.92 --> 3499.92]  Okay, then.
[3501.64 --> 3506.54]  He said the Model 3 was designed to be much less complicated to manufacture than the S and the X.
[3506.54 --> 3515.08]  But the process of developing the parts necessary from suppliers and integrating them into the line would set the actual production back.
[3515.46 --> 3520.48]  So estimating initial production at 100,000 to 200,000 cars for the Model 3 in 2017,
[3520.88 --> 3525.04]  and said that they could be producing 500,000 cars a year in 2018.
[3525.04 --> 3527.42]  Okay.
[3527.42 --> 3527.48]  Okay.
[3528.04 --> 3528.36]  Sure.
[3529.04 --> 3535.78]  I'm hoping for the best here, because I want people to buy Model 3s and then get tired of them, and that's when I will buy an electric car.
[3537.04 --> 3537.76]  So there you go.
[3537.76 --> 3538.94]  Microsoft.
[3539.16 --> 3542.42]  This was posted by JasonNR22 on the forum.
[3542.54 --> 3548.68]  Microsoft to stop allowing Cortana to function in other browsers, which is sort of a bummer,
[3548.76 --> 3556.06]  because it is going to be a cold day in hell before they get me to use Edge, at least if it doesn't dramatically improve.
[3556.06 --> 3557.52]  And the same goes for Bing.
[3557.64 --> 3558.82]  Bing is so awful.
[3559.28 --> 3562.32]  I give it a chance every time I do a fresh Windows install.
[3562.46 --> 3568.08]  I'm like, okay, Bing, hit me with your best Windows default option shot here.
[3568.10 --> 3569.66]  And I do a lot of fresh installs.
[3569.70 --> 3572.18]  I'm working on a review of the LG Gram right now.
[3572.44 --> 3575.30]  Every computer I touch has a fresh install of Windows on it.
[3576.16 --> 3579.08]  And it's awful.
[3579.26 --> 3579.76]  It's terrible.
[3579.88 --> 3580.60]  It can't find anything.
[3580.60 --> 3585.46]  The goal is to provide a better search experience, which I wish them much luck with.
[3586.06 --> 3590.32]  Let's see.
[3590.48 --> 3591.66]  What else do we got here?
[3593.12 --> 3596.34]  Buttonless fingerprint sensors coming to phones this year.
[3596.42 --> 3600.64]  This was originally posted on the forum by Strider72-something.
[3600.76 --> 3601.48]  I lost track of it.
[3601.52 --> 3603.50]  The original article here is from The Verge.
[3604.18 --> 3605.00]  Very cool.
[3605.62 --> 3611.78]  So right now, basically, the only way to have a fingerprint sensor is to have, like, a button.
[3611.78 --> 3616.20]  But, here we go.
[3616.62 --> 3622.86]  The positioning of the button can make a phone much more pleasant to use or much less so.
[3622.94 --> 3628.18]  For example, the Z5 Compact has the fingerprint sensor in the side lock button.
[3628.18 --> 3633.34]  Which, for me, when I'm pulling out my phone and unlocking it, is so natural.
[3633.44 --> 3635.38]  It's not a very good fingerprint sensor.
[3635.44 --> 3636.44]  I talked about this in the review.
[3636.90 --> 3641.02]  Every time you reset it, it's, like, really fast and, like, really functional again.
[3641.28 --> 3643.32]  And then it just, over time, gets worse.
[3643.78 --> 3645.66]  Anyway, really great place for it.
[3645.80 --> 3647.72]  You just go click, hold it there, boom.
[3648.36 --> 3648.84]  You're rocking.
[3648.84 --> 3653.46]  Again, whereas on the LG G5, when I publish my review of this, I'm going to talk about
[3653.46 --> 3657.40]  how the position of the fingerprint sensor button on the back makes it kind of a drag
[3657.40 --> 3660.20]  when the phone is on the table in front of me and I want to unlock it.
[3660.24 --> 3663.24]  I actually have to use the passcode or pick it up in those cases.
[3664.12 --> 3673.22]  So, the idea here is to have LG Initec join fingerprint cards in announcing this fingerprint
[3673.22 --> 3677.18]  module that can be integrated under the same glass cover as a phone's display, which takes
[3677.18 --> 3679.28]  out the need for the button you just touch anywhere on the screen.
[3679.76 --> 3683.78]  So, they're expecting devices with the new technology before the end of the year.
[3684.68 --> 3689.04]  And they point out that waterproofing a smartphone will become significantly easier without a discreet
[3689.04 --> 3690.30]  button for the fingerprint reader.
[3691.54 --> 3692.20]  Very cool.
[3692.80 --> 3693.22]  Very cool.
[3693.28 --> 3696.44]  They promise to maintain the accuracy of current implementations.
[3697.86 --> 3698.26]  Okay.
[3698.80 --> 3700.16]  This is kind of a bummer.
[3700.88 --> 3707.16]  Originally posted by Wander Away on the Forum, Best Buy is going to have the opportunity
[3707.18 --> 3710.12]  Oculus Rift for sale on store shelves.
[3711.06 --> 3714.84]  This was posted later this week on May 2nd, so sometime it may have even happened already.
[3717.56 --> 3718.08]  Okay.
[3718.86 --> 3723.04]  One small problem, and the original post on the Forum, which was made by Wander Away,
[3723.16 --> 3728.02]  I think I already said that, had someone post their invoice for the Oculus Rift, their order
[3728.02 --> 3734.42]  confirmation from January that has a shipping, estimated shipping date of like July or something,
[3734.42 --> 3735.44]  June or July.
[3736.98 --> 3739.98]  So, this is another case like that.
[3740.04 --> 3746.32]  I think it was like the ultimate beer cooler or something, where they were fulfilling orders
[3746.32 --> 3748.60]  on Amazon before fulfilling Kickstarter orders.
[3749.08 --> 3754.32]  Well, this is Oculus taking online pre-orders, getting ultimately more than they could produce,
[3754.32 --> 3760.66]  and shipping to a big box store instead of fulfilling orders in a FIFO manner.
[3761.26 --> 3763.76]  First in, first out is what FIFO means.
[3763.82 --> 3763.96]  Sorry.
[3764.94 --> 3769.64]  So, while I get that they might be contractually obligated to do this,
[3770.06 --> 3774.32]  and they're saying it's an extremely limited supply of rifts that will be available for purchase,
[3774.32 --> 3780.22]  this is such a kick in the teeth, and is such bad PR, especially when you consider that,
[3780.36 --> 3785.70]  according to Luke's recent polls, where he had it at 50-50, I think, at the beginning of the year,
[3785.78 --> 3791.36]  and something like 80-20 in favor of people saying they prefer the Vive to the Oculus Rift right now
[3791.36 --> 3793.36]  for what they lean towards purchasing.
[3793.84 --> 3798.12]  This is such bad PR when HTC is kicking their ass right now.
[3798.12 --> 3801.98]  So, yeah, wow.
[3803.64 --> 3808.62]  So, they're going to let potential visitors search for locations to demo the rift.
[3808.70 --> 3811.66]  I mean, that's one good thing about having it in a big box store, but with that said,
[3812.10 --> 3815.02]  people don't need to demo it until you actually have something to sell them, really,
[3815.26 --> 3818.52]  and they'll let them schedule demos up to a month in advance.
[3818.80 --> 3822.02]  So, the experiences will include Dream Deck and The Climb.
[3825.54 --> 3828.10]  So, I think that pretty much wraps up the WAN show today.
[3828.12 --> 3835.08]  I don't want to bleed too far over 6 o'clock, because I believe Luke is intending to livestream,
[3836.08 --> 3841.98]  da-da-da-da, livestream from the NVIDIA livestream with commentary or something like that.
[3842.06 --> 3846.56]  So, I want to just find out what his plan is before I get off the stream here.
[3847.52 --> 3849.56]  To livestream the livestream.
[3850.40 --> 3853.08]  Should I get off LAN show?
[3853.44 --> 3854.34]  I am ready.
[3854.34 --> 3862.80]  So, he might be popping right back on with live coverage of the live coverage of the NVIDIA event,
[3862.88 --> 3864.32]  though I'm not actually sure.
[3864.72 --> 3869.40]  I do know that he's been working on a video of what they've had going on at the event so far today,
[3869.64 --> 3875.68]  and then he'll be releasing another one tomorrow, sort of recapping all of the official information
[3875.68 --> 3881.84]  from the Polaris, Polaris, excuse me, Pascal launch.
[3882.16 --> 3883.92]  So, I haven't heard from him, so I'm going to roll the outro,
[3884.14 --> 3887.66]  and then if I don't hear from him, I'll end the stream, but stay tuned.
[3887.86 --> 3888.86]  Stay tuned, my friends.
[3888.86 --> 3918.84]  Stay tuned.
[3918.84 --> 3919.74]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[3919.98 --> 3920.86]  See you next week.
[3921.30 --> 3923.58]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3924.52 --> 3925.30]  Screw off, Nick.
