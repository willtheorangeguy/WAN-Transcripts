[0.00 → 6.66] because you know there's nothing quite like a good sneeze you now and then when you don't you
[6.66 → 13.64] just have kind of like that kind of itchy runny nose feeling it's not very pleasant
[13.64 → 23.74] not a fan, but you know what I am a fan of the wan show and that my friends is what you're
[23.74 → 29.54] watching right now welcome to the wan show it's Friday we're live for the whole nose thing yeah
[29.54 → 35.44] okay that's okay all right don't worry don't worry the nose is live I almost sang me it's Friday
[35.44 → 40.48] song and then I started to hate myself so much that I stopped wow that literally just happened
[40.48 → 45.86] I was like I was like going to sing it and then I just had like a crushing personal defeat and i
[45.86 → 56.98] stopped probably a good thing yeah yeah that's fair um all right we have news today one of them is that
[56.98 → 61.62] in the Philippines there was a massive leak of data and if you're from there you should probably
[61.62 → 69.00] care yeah pretty much also a thing that hosted zeroth was shut down and if you're from there
[69.00 → 73.90] do you care if you're from zeroth you care actually you could be from earth, and you might care too
[73.90 → 78.36] that's true you have to spend a lot of time in your basement on earth that's also true that's a
[78.36 → 85.92] stereotype literally accurate for me stereotypes hurt ever hurt us all that's right though uh Microsoft
[85.92 → 93.76] is suing the U.S. government over their gag orders and uh and their requests to effectively invade
[93.76 → 104.96] Microsoft's users privacy and the helicopter is the first certified manned multi-copter
[104.96 → 112.40] more on this at 11. Now my understanding is the intro doesn't have music right now for some reason
[112.40 → 116.96] why I'm not sure why every once in a while it just does that, but it's okay
[116.96 → 120.08] do do do no I don't feel like it today
[120.08 → 123.90] you don't even know what the song sounds like do you
[123.90 → 127.76] don't sing that we could get a copyright strike
[127.76 → 137.12] changing the song wait a minute go I don't want to get a copyright strike from where the heck
[137.12 → 144.60] mass drop okay mass drop drawed ups slash you should there you go be fresh I heard
[144.60 → 150.60] they might be changing it again what really yeah it wasn't me a screenshot is it because of us
[150.60 → 156.66] maybe I don't know I saw an ad today that was you should like I saw a banner ad today that was you
[156.66 → 164.64] should um speaking of you should um you should be a fantastic mono that is to say if you were the
[164.64 → 171.44] one who posted this original article from Tom's hardware on the forum what a segue Microsoft says
[171.44 → 179.98] secret data requests are now the norm sues everyone in the country named Norman a very
[179.98 → 186.00] unusual and unexpected response to such a thing no actually they sue the U.S. government and if you
[186.00 → 192.70] can read you already knew that because it says it right on my screen over there basically in a
[192.70 → 198.60] nutshell Microsoft oh no I was pointing to I know I went the wrong way I pointed this way then it's like
[198.60 → 208.08] oh wait oh dang I pointed at the screen's there no, no no, no um all right so yeah
[208.08 → 212.86] so what do we get what do we get for our notes here let me bring them up so Microsoft filed a lawsuit in
[212.86 → 218.88] federal court against the U.S. government over its expanding use of gag orders for data requests which
[218.88 → 228.02] effectively means that Microsoft sends a data request but then also often with no expiry date
[228.02 → 234.54] tells Microsoft that they are not allowed to inform the person whose personal information they are
[234.54 → 241.80] disclosing to the government that any request was made which is ridiculous because I mean if
[241.80 → 249.90] the if the police want to enter your home unless they have a search warrant they have to knock on the
[249.90 → 257.34] door and be like you are you in there you can be like yo I'm not and then they, and then they leave
[257.34 → 263.84] in theory unless they do it illegally unless they do it illegally yeah but for some reason this has
[263.84 → 270.56] been going on for years now so basically Microsoft believes that these orders violate the first
[270.56 → 275.86] amendment so the freedom of speech and of the press by disallowing the company to talk to its customers
[275.86 → 280.74] and they have requested that the department of justice immediately issue a new policy restricting the
[280.74 → 287.58] out of control gag orders from law enforcement if that doesn't happen they request congress to amend
[287.58 → 294.98] the electronic communications protection act to require government notice for warrants so um I think
[294.98 → 301.02] that should be a thing yeah I mean they're like basic rights this isn't the first time that Microsoft
[301.02 → 305.60] has filed a lawsuit against the United States government to protect their customer privacy
[305.60 → 311.46] um, but they have only done so when they considered the government's requests to be out of bounds
[311.46 → 316.50] and I think the out of bounds here is just the sheer fact that it's its probably it's normal now
[316.50 → 322.06] and that being normal is kind of insane yeah because it's one thing for the government to be like
[322.06 → 328.12] yo there's like uh you know ongoing investigation who killed a lot of people, and we can't unlock his phone
[328.12 → 336.12] say for example yeah just an example yeah um that's one thing but what Microsoft is objecting to here
[336.12 → 343.90] is that they're basically just a data collection service for the government when damn it that's
[343.90 → 350.60] their data to exploit yeah they need to sell ads yeah the FBI can't be selling ads how are they going
[350.60 → 356.32] to target us with the services and products that we so desperately need to imagine the FBI decided to start
[356.32 → 364.24] funding themselves by starting an ad agency sometimes I just come up with the worst ideas
[364.24 → 367.98] and if people did them everything would just be terrible
[367.98 → 377.34] oh my it's like can can you be slightly less terrible it's like why do we give people these ideas
[377.34 → 384.24] it's not the first time it's happened on this show no the Sony and Microsoft uh drive bay things
[384.24 → 390.00] what was it I don't actually remember that one you get a module for Xbox One or PlayStation 4
[390.00 → 395.76] that looks like an optical drive you install it in your computer it's an encrypted locked down system
[395.76 → 399.66] oh yeah, and it makes it so you can play those games but powered by your computer's hardware
[399.66 → 404.12] right on your computer that's actually a perfect idea though I do want that and the and the bay
[404.12 → 409.18] should just cost as much as a console, so there's literally no drawback for them
[409.18 → 414.50] and you should like to have to water cool it or something that'd be yeah that'd be cool the reason
[414.50 → 422.30] to water cool again yes uh on the subject of Microsoft this was posted by trick starry on the
[422.30 → 430.02] forum original article here is from CNN money trick starry so it's probably Microsoft builds new AI bot
[430.02 → 437.90] designed specifically to ignore Hitler because we all know what a disaster it was last time uh they
[437.90 → 445.82] released an AI bot on Twitter who became a sex fiend Hitler lover within a matter of mere hours i
[445.82 → 449.26] actually thought that was a very interesting social experiment I thought it was very interesting too
[449.26 → 455.42] I think it super hardcore backed up uh musk and everyone else in that realm that is like we should
[455.42 → 461.66] probably be a little bit careful about AI stuff yeah, yeah so this one is pretty different um it's
[461.66 → 467.98] actually called damn it I forget what it's called caption bot that's right so caption bot which sounds
[467.98 → 473.90] way more boring lets you upload an image it doesn't know what this is though you know it should just
[473.90 → 479.90] say cover of time magazine you know there's a workaround, so caption bot allows you to upload an
[479.90 → 485.58] image and their examples work pretty well so oh okay well there you go, and it will analyze the image and
[485.58 → 490.78] say what it is oh I think it's a young man jumping in the air on a skateboard let me see if I can
[490.78 → 495.66] get this so you guys can actually see the whole dang caption here yay touch screen okay so that's
[495.66 → 502.30] pretty good let's try another not a canned one I created some examples' oh so we'll start with an uh
[502.30 → 508.22] wan show thumbnail oh my god analyzing image have you done this yet I'm not really confident but I think
[508.22 → 515.02] it's a stuffed animal, and he seems oh that's not too bad uh actually last time it said
[515.02 → 520.46] it was a man and a stuffed animal oh I wasn't sure which of us was the man and which was the uh cuddly
[520.46 → 533.34] bear oh my god let's try another shall we hmm a mouse is it I think it's a cell phone actually a fairly
[533.34 → 538.22] fair guess that would be okay based on that it does have a number pad on the side for some freaking
[538.22 → 548.86] reason yeah that's with that said I've never dialled a 12. Okay good call try another upload no I don't
[548.86 → 555.10] want to use your photos shut up obviously your photos are going to work all right what else we got here
[555.10 → 559.34] okay, okay so I picked up some picked out some thumbnails I'm trying to figure out how good our
[559.34 → 566.46] thumbnails are I think it's a picture of a car all right good job caption bot let's try it
[566.46 → 574.94] it needs to be more confident yeah it's a picture of a car I mean okay this really feels like you should
[574.94 → 585.66] get this right because it does literally say Apple Watch literally not a cell phone Apple Watch I see why
[585.66 → 591.10] it's grabbing cell phone I don't think it should also look at like dimensions like it's grabbing
[591.10 → 598.86] a cell phone because the screen and stuff yeah oh I see relative dimensions of the items on the screen
[599.42 → 603.74] and because there's not that many aspect ratios it could just be like Samsung in easy mode
[604.30 → 609.82] like grandpa mode you know they have that right okay so I got one more for you guys I think this is my
[609.82 → 614.94] favourite one twitch plays Pokémon is in the stream oh apparently twitch plays Pokémon is in the stream
[614.94 → 619.02] hi oh it gave me a different answer last time, but this is good too
[622.38 → 630.38] what a clock that's on a surfboard yeah okay, okay caption bot uh last time it told me it was a sign
[630.38 → 636.22] attached to a lamp post try it again sees what it does like in rapid succession
[636.22 → 642.78] so is it learning then is it trying to get better basically the answer is that ed's artwork is
[642.78 → 648.78] terrible can you tell it what it actually is can you do this what are you doing it's just
[648.78 → 657.10] like no what are you doing caption bot what what what caption bot what are you doing upload photo
[657.66 → 664.94] no this one open oh I broke it I officially broke caption bot it's done no Linus couldn't it's over and it
[664.94 → 670.46] didn't even take the Hitler pictures this time it was a picture that animated you and me
[670.46 → 676.22] that's kind of that's unfortunate we broke caption bot it was like no these people are far too evil
[676.94 → 678.78] HTC announces
[681.50 → 683.82] the HTC one billion
[685.58 → 692.46] because numbers have no meaning any more first we had the one then we had the one
[692.46 → 697.58] followed by the one, and now we've got the 10
[699.58 → 705.98] okay though but seriously the one m7 m8 and m9 were the predecessors so now we've done away with the m
[705.98 → 710.94] we've done away with the one, and we're just the 10. So this was originally posted by doc swag on the
[710.94 → 718.94] forum the original article here is from Anand tech posted by a monsieur Joshua ho who has a hands-on with
[718.94 → 728.22] the HTC 10 calling it a fresh start look at these pictures taken outside so pretty good job joshua
[728.22 → 733.82] is like a photo dork so I suspect anything he did with respect to the exposure was done on purpose
[733.82 → 739.42] for art purposes I believe personally that nothing is good until Brandon says that it is
[739.42 → 748.54] that is the kind of steeple thinking that if batman versus superman is said to be bad by everyone
[749.50 → 754.30] if Brandon did that's to say it was good I don't know but if Brandon says that it's good Brandon
[754.30 → 760.30] therefore it is good it was batman versus superman good he says therefore it is
[760.30 → 767.90] eh, but it can't be bad it's just eh that is how motion picture and still photo works no because
[767.90 → 773.98] no because Brandon's personal biases are very real and very existent I mean he would go into the
[773.98 → 782.22] revenant and say it's the most amazing thing ever because he loves the director even if the even is
[782.22 → 790.70] even if the premise well even if the entire movie was basically unwatchable for me for the same reason
[790.70 → 798.62] that the Thomas covenant series of books just gets to the point where it's like what because when the
[798.62 → 810.06] writer can't do anything other than he was closer to the brink of death than he had been before but then
[810.06 → 815.02] he pulled through it didn't like to happen, and then he became even closer to the brink of death but like
[815.02 → 820.46] I think it is like and then yeah but happened is relative I was watching a great documentary on
[820.46 → 828.70] curiosity stream um where the guy who finds the holy lance okay when they're like trapped in some
[828.70 → 837.26] city or some nonsense and inspires the Christian crusader army to fight back against the hordes of
[837.26 → 842.46] enemies outside the wall who they did defeat that definitely did happen from accounts on both sides
[842.46 → 850.86] of the conflict says he's going to prove that the lance is real with a trial by ordeal okay he says he's
[850.86 → 860.22] going to walk through a bonfire and if he survives then you know god says the lance is real and no trial by
[860.22 → 864.94] ordeal is a thing just like trial by combat like if you won you were right i I wouldn't want
[864.94 → 869.42] a trial by combat against this guy it wouldn't matter if I was right anyway I think that's kind
[869.42 → 875.74] of how that stuff worked back then yeah pretty much so he volunteers to do a trial by ordeal where
[875.74 → 883.42] he walks through a bonfire there are eyewitness accounts that he walked through completely unscathed
[883.42 → 891.18] untouched by the flame and lived there are other eyewitness accounts that he was covered in burns and
[891.18 → 901.18] all the accounts agree he died shortly afterwards you can't have it both ways I mean he died from
[901.18 → 908.06] something completely unrelated is that how it happened so basically anything that's word of mouth
[908.70 → 915.90] I'm kind of looking at going you know what screw off because that didn't happen you weren't being carried on
[915.90 → 927.42] a board and like unable to move to save your son who is being i I don't know if is that a
[927.42 → 932.06] is that a spoiler it happens within like the first 10 minutes I mean I just ruined it so well yeah so
[932.06 → 937.74] basically I'm we made you the bad guy so you don't go from not able to move at all and like full of
[937.74 → 943.90] infection you also said those things to no, but that also happens like very early on to the things that
[943.90 → 950.46] happen later in that period of time that not is not a thing so especially wasn't a thing
[950.46 → 955.10] with medicine being what it was there so my suspension of disbelief only goes so far you have
[955.10 → 961.26] to you have to exist within whatever world it is okay I'm going to derail this a little bit for a second
[961.26 → 965.90] fine because one thing we have to move on there are no trains in the movie we have a billion topics
[965.90 → 972.06] you can't derail it someone in the chat was like trial by twitch that would actually be amazing
[972.06 → 978.70] so you have you know how roasts were like a thing for a little while yeah they should just scratch
[978.70 → 984.46] that whole concept and then just start having celebrity roasts where someone just sits in front
[984.46 → 994.06] of a camera and just gets wrecked by twitch chat oh no one would survive it no that's not even a roast
[994.06 → 1001.98] that's just evil murder yeah yeah that's just mean well that's kind of like trial by ordeal all right
[1001.98 → 1009.02] so let's get back, back on topic here back to the HTC 10. They wanted to oh you know what I'm not going
[1009.02 → 1013.74] to talk about with the name because there is no logic I don't care what their reasoning was uh it's
[1013.74 → 1022.14] got a snapdragon 820 4 gigs of Ladd r4 memory 32 or 64 gigs of Nan plus micro SD expansion oh nice um
[1022.14 → 1029.98] it is not a SSD or like mime SSD based storage solution it is still using uh whatever it's called
[1029.98 → 1034.70] it's not in my notes I was reading an article about eMMC, but it's like gen whatever it's better
[1034.70 → 1039.82] it's faster up to 150 megabytes per second sequential rights which sequential doesn't necessarily tell us
[1039.82 → 1043.66] everything we need to know, but that is significantly faster than eMMC solutions from the past
[1044.22 → 1051.18] so HTC claims that the storage is not going to significantly harm the uh the 10s performance
[1051.18 → 1058.38] it's got a 5.2 inch 1440p super LCD 5 display no AMOLED which should allow them to skirt the issues
[1058.38 → 1063.34] of burn-in but have to face head-on the issues of increased power consumption though they claim it
[1063.34 → 1068.62] is more power efficient than the Galaxy S7 with the same 3000 William hour non-replaceable battery
[1068.62 → 1074.30] it has a 12 megapixel rear-facing camera which optical image stabilization good job Colton
[1076.78 → 1080.54] also have you noticed just to rank on Colton for a second the last two weeks
[1080.54 → 1085.98] is just like the very beginning of both docs it's like Microsoft, and then we go into other things
[1086.54 → 1091.90] it's almost like he's trying to create a crappy one show doc because honestly I felt like he's letting
[1091.90 → 1096.14] the quality slip consistently over the last little while like this is the worst one we've seen in
[1096.14 → 1101.98] at least a month yep so basically horrible uh he did manage though I'll give him this to include that
[1101.98 → 1107.50] the five megapixel front-facing camera has optical image stabilization as well he bought you lunch and
[1107.50 → 1112.22] you still ragged on him, you acquired you're a bad person I paid um it's got a capacitive fingerprint
[1112.22 → 1118.38] sensor that they claim responds in as little as 200 milliseconds features Qualcomm quick charge 3.0 USB
[1118.38 → 1123.18] 3.1 over USB type c which is pretty freaking cool because if you pull pictures off of your phone
[1123.18 → 1130.94] manually like I still do just because I don't know it helps me keep organized um then that's a really nice
[1130.94 → 1137.26] thing to have, and they're claiming 92 NTSC colour reproduction for the display which is about 96 of adobe RGB
[1137.74 → 1146.38] they have abandoned however the front-facing dual speaker setup no yes they have oh so it does still
[1146.38 → 1152.14] have two speakers one is a sort of highs and mids tuned front-facing speaker that also acts as your
[1152.14 → 1155.98] handset speaker when you have the phone against your head hello you know talking to people like this
[1155.98 → 1160.78] and the other one is a more bass tuned rear-facing one this reduces the bezel size, but they claim
[1162.14 → 1167.42] that they have been able to retain the front-facing audio quality that HTC users have come to expect
[1167.50 → 1176.46] so I guess we'll find out um yes uh in response to all the bazillion of you asking in my galaxy
[1176.46 → 1183.58] s7 review which finally went live last night I will be doing a review of the HTC 10 however you will
[1183.58 → 1189.42] have to wait because I just wrapped up my iPhone SE video which I'm going to film probably Monday
[1189.42 → 1194.78] morning so I'm switching to the lgg5 I'll have to use that for a couple of weeks and then I will do
[1194.78 → 1201.50] the HTC 10 I know it makes my phone videos much later than everyone else who is already posting
[1201.50 → 1206.78] they're like hands-on first impression unboxing and then probably a couple of days from now we'll have
[1206.78 → 1211.66] their reviews up but I like to think that the difference between my phone reviews and everyone
[1211.66 → 1216.94] else's is that while I do not pretty much touch on like performance numbers at all there's a lot of
[1216.94 → 1223.02] things that I really don't do as well as anyone else um I like to think that I try to capture the
[1223.02 → 1228.70] experience of using it for an extended period of time which requires me to actually use it so there
[1228.70 → 1234.78] you have it I will be switching to it as my daily driver once I'm done with the g5 uh so we don't
[1234.78 → 1241.50] have an original poster from the forum on this one but the Philippines data breach election hack thing
[1241.50 → 1251.10] this was posted by jams temper ton over at wire.co.uk is that I quote freaking huge he's from the UK i
[1251.10 → 1257.66] would have thought it would be like bloody massive yeah that's more something I would say yeah freaking
[1257.66 → 1262.86] huge is like literally about as American as it gets I basically wrote this time jams maybe he is
[1262.86 → 1270.94] American look at this guy look at this guy he's a hipster dude I do appreciate his beard though
[1270.94 → 1276.46] the beard is pretty majestic it's pretty fantastic yeah and like the I like the hair too he's got
[1276.46 → 1282.06] good hair he's he's got good hair overall I mean he got me the shirt's on so I can't tell if it's like
[1282.06 → 1289.58] overall good hair but right you know yes maybe another maybe in another dentist like moaning I don't
[1289.58 → 1302.30] know maybe it hurts oh yeah purple these girth parks right oh can you not wow in front of the children
[1303.66 → 1310.14] brand is not a child that's true child um all right so multiple small people
[1312.70 → 1321.82] this is kind of a big deal um if you participated in the election in the Philippines then um yeah
[1321.82 → 1331.50] your fingerprint records are basically leaked things are bad, so 228 605 email addresses 1.3 million
[1331.50 → 1337.66] passport numbers and 15.8 fingerprint records I'm just going to read off yours looking down my maybe I am
[1337.66 → 1343.10] maybe that's where I got all the information from he's got a tattoo of all of that information
[1343.82 → 1349.42] uh if you lose a passport you can change it you like things can be solved, but one of the problems is
[1349.42 → 1356.78] that the passport numbers and expiry dates for overseas Filipino workers have leaked as well which is like
[1357.50 → 1363.42] not great so it's probably not going to be 1.3 million passport numbers for overseas Filipino workers
[1363.42 → 1370.70] which like to get this fixed I wouldn't be super surprised if you had to physically go back uh 15.8
[1370.70 → 1377.42] million fingerprint records um which is like this is this is great security expert troy hunt
[1377.42 → 1385.74] told wired um short of using a belt sander you can't change a fingerprint and even that doesn't work by the
[1385.74 → 1397.82] way uh so losing a password big deal losing fingerprint data huge deal uh apparently Chris Johnson said that
[1397.82 → 1403.42] it's the data not the image itself yeah so it's more like uh it's more like a mathematical representation
[1403.42 → 1409.42] of the fingerprint not the actual image of the fingerprint hashtag who cares helps a little bit you
[1409.42 → 1413.98] should be able to rebuild it in theory you should be able to rebuild the parts of matter in theory someone
[1413.98 → 1419.90] could potentially rebuild it, but it would be more difficult to use that information for identity
[1419.90 → 1426.22] fraud or anything else like that although it here comes an open source tool that maps a fingerprint to
[1426.22 → 1432.22] your mathematical data of a fingerprint the leaked database was a mess apparently file names suggesting
[1432.22 → 1437.82] hasty copying and pasting of old versions and the attack took place on March 27th the group describing itself
[1437.82 → 1443.10] as anonymous which basically doesn't mean anything yeah I know a surprising number of people that think
[1443.10 → 1452.22] anonymous is a group which it kind of sort has done sort maybe for some things sometimes right except
[1452.22 → 1457.50] that also not really also not really because it's usually like small groups that all band together
[1457.50 → 1465.02] and then say that they are or don't or don't yeah yeah so like but no like like like I've talked to
[1465.02 → 1471.42] people who are who think that anonymous like has like a know a leader and like and like everyone
[1471.42 → 1480.62] like knows each other and stuff but who is this for Chan yeah exactly that's what I want to know back at 11.
[1480.62 → 1491.18] so the data has been since mirrored and widely shared um yeah so there you go correct
[1492.86 → 1498.30] on a more amusing note this was originally posted by duck dodgers that the UK government has set up an
[1498.30 → 1508.46] international Olympics of esports the first two-day e-games competition set for Rio alongside the actual
[1509.02 → 1515.42] Olympics now I think instead of like instead of like carrying a torch through your country you carry
[1515.42 → 1521.42] like a minecraft torch you go like a huge minecraft map where is our minecraft run for like a
[1521.42 → 1529.02] week we had one it used to be I don't know where it is did you find it no it used to be right here
[1529.02 → 1533.50] like a week ago oh someone moved our minecraft torch I totally want it now
[1536.94 → 1541.98] okay that's that's a shame anyway um so we do have some more information about that
[1541.98 → 1551.34] not much mind you um it's a medal only competition any nation is welcome to field an e-team in the e-games
[1551.34 → 1556.22] four countries are confirmed so far as of last week or the week before whenever this was actually in the
[1556.22 → 1563.50] doc this is not a new article Britain Canada Brazil and the USA, and it is unknown exactly which games
[1563.50 → 1574.78] um will be featured so there you go the thing that offends me though about this headline offends me yeah
[1578.06 → 1583.02] excuse me why is the physical Olympics the actual Olympics
[1583.02 → 1592.70] is this not an equally valid Olympics I'm just kidding um yeah no that's cool I mean I don't
[1592.70 → 1598.62] necessarily think that with all the issues there are around the structure of the Olympics that we
[1598.62 → 1606.30] actually that esports needs an equivalent to the Olympics um especially at the pace that esports moves
[1606.30 → 1611.50] I mean can you imagine only having like a grand competition every four years yeah it would be
[1611.50 → 1617.66] completely different games being played completely different sets of athletes probably e-athletes
[1617.66 → 1625.98] excuse me sorry um completely different sets like it wouldn't even like you'd go from one where like
[1625.98 → 1630.86] everything is played on like controllers to one where everyone has clued in and uses a keyboard and
[1630.86 → 1636.86] mouse to one where everyone is using motion controllers and VR headsets and that could realistically
[1636.86 → 1643.10] happen in eight years yeah completely oh my goodness one thing okay just to talk about Olympics for a
[1643.10 → 1647.02] very short period of time one thing I don't understand there's massive like financial problems with the
[1647.02 → 1653.50] Olympics why don't they hold it in the same place twice in a row and then move on because that would be
[1653.50 → 1662.14] smart I've never understood that or just like you don't have to rebuild or revisit like past locations but
[1662.14 → 1673.10] very recently past locations well china's hosting it again but not in Beijing so okay yeah cool
[1674.38 → 1678.70] why do we have to spend money on these buildings all the time china's crazy I've been watching a lot
[1678.70 → 1684.46] of documentaries lately I was watching one about china's economy and how it is basically made out of
[1684.46 → 1693.82] matchsticks and tinder and flamethrowers, but it works not for long um yeah the like the way
[1693.82 → 1699.10] they're building right now is completely unprecedented in history like there's one city that I think is
[1699.10 → 1705.90] spending something like 60 billion pounds over a span of eight years or something like that pretty much
[1705.90 → 1713.50] completely rebuilding like like the number of new bridges and skyscrapers and roadways going up is
[1713.50 → 1721.26] it's completely unfathomable and um meanwhile all the state run uh all the state-run suppliers
[1721.26 → 1727.90] of raw materials like steel are kind of just operating at a loss or just barely staying afloat and like
[1728.54 → 1734.30] it yeah it's basically very precarious over there which like I'm talking about it really casually but
[1734.30 → 1738.38] it's actually sort of a disaster waiting to happen to be fair a lot of places are currently sort of a
[1738.38 → 1742.94] disaster waiting to happen if you look at them at a documentary level yeah like a lot of countries are just
[1742.94 → 1750.06] like wow like look at camp what are we going to do about what how are we going to make money we just lost
[1750.06 → 1758.62] oil um like that was actually like a massive percentage of our income we like man like
[1758.62 → 1764.78] we're actually in a lot of trouble so I was our economy based on wood and oil we have wood issues
[1764.78 → 1769.34] selling them to the states there's like sanctions there so we like can't really do it very well so the
[1769.34 → 1775.42] American like forestry economy can stay strong that's a thing and oil not really a thing anymore
[1775.42 → 1785.42] well we have water yeah which like actually the economy of water is an fascinating problem
[1785.42 → 1790.54] the problem with Canada's Canada's exportable resources is that they're the kind of thing
[1790.54 → 1796.78] that someone's more likely to conquer you for yeah because they're it's not that practical to like
[1797.74 → 1802.86] ship water and which isn't to say it isn't done yeah like you said the economics of
[1802.86 → 1807.50] water are very they actually really super are if you're is you're interested in a topic that
[1807.50 → 1811.66] sounds boring, but it's actually quite, quite interesting bottled water economy of water yeah
[1812.70 → 1819.66] speaking of things that sound boring and are interesting to him um Pauline oh you know what we'll use the
[1819.66 → 1826.62] uh the BBC article yes, yes yes um I will try to restrict my amount of time talking about this
[1826.62 → 1832.46] um so a server that I'm going to pronounce wrong because my last name is French but I'm not actually
[1832.46 → 1837.98] French called Nostradamus which just means nostalgia in French apparently someone told me that I could be
[1837.98 → 1845.50] wrong that doesn't sound like was shut I don't know man um was shut down sorry, sorry I will let you
[1845.50 → 1851.82] continue but captions whenever you know you're on a mainstream site when you read a caption like this
[1852.78 → 1861.58] gamers can play as mythical characters in World of Warcraft thank you BBC thank you okay with a
[1861.58 → 1868.62] cinematic screen carry on um so they've been doing this for about a year it got kind of insane you
[1868.62 → 1874.14] haven't said what they were doing right anyway I'm trying to condense it and I'm skipping over massive
[1874.14 → 1879.18] important things anyway this group called Nostradamus was running a private World of Warcraft
[1879.18 → 1885.10] server so basically they took like cached versions of code and reprogrammed things on their own like
[1885.10 → 1891.18] re-scripting boss events and doing all this crazy stuff even working on code in order to attempt to
[1891.18 → 1898.62] cluster servers together and like it was pretty nuts to be clear yes it's game software piracy oh yeah
[1898.62 → 1903.98] yes it infringes blizzard's copyright definitely carry on blizzard definitely 100 has the right to
[1904.62 → 1909.42] completely crap all over them, they definitely have the right to do that um let's pick up on they've
[1909.42 → 1914.78] been doing this for about a year they've been doing this for about a year yeah they have 800 000
[1914.78 → 1923.74] registered accounts and about 150 000 active players which is a huge amount of people and there's been
[1923.74 → 1929.50] tons of private wow servers over the years this one stood out the reason why this one stood out is for
[1929.50 → 1934.22] a few different reasons one of the main ones is that they are non-profit essentially they don't
[1934.22 → 1939.50] take any form of donations and there was no way to give them any money they were just doing it because
[1939.50 → 1944.62] they wanted the server to be up all of their game masters all of their admins all of their everything
[1944.62 → 1950.30] for everyone that worked on the server at all or helped anyone were not allowed to have like normal
[1950.30 → 1954.30] characters in the game like a game master was not allowed to have a character that was a raider
[1954.30 → 1959.82] because that could be seen as unfair because they could help themselves right so like it was
[1959.82 → 1963.02] very balanced in that way they were very aggressive at going after people that were
[1963.02 → 1968.06] hacking they were very aggressive at going against people that were batting or are selling gold or
[1968.06 → 1974.14] selling accounts or everything they handwaved people all the time it was this kind of sanction and
[1974.14 → 1978.94] to be completely honest I played on it my brother played on it my dad played on if it was super cool
[1978.94 → 1984.22] because the current version of World of Warcraft sucks in terms of social interaction everyone just
[1984.22 → 1988.62] sits in something called a garrison which is their own little private area does everything from there
[1988.62 → 1992.94] teleports everywhere that they need to go doesn't talk to anyone never needs to talk to anyone it's
[1992.94 → 1998.14] terrible that's why their subscriber numbers are tanking, and they decided to stop reporting subscriber
[1998.14 → 2004.06] numbers you probably wouldn't I solo I sold everything when I played wow I didn't want to talk to anyone
[2004.06 → 2012.22] oh yeah I was one of those like jackass like mage solo everything people did you get to max level
[2012.22 → 2020.30] no I didn't because I like I had to did you enjoy the amount of difficulty in the game yeah it's
[2020.30 → 2028.94] excessively easy now oh, oh okay like ridiculously yeah you basically couldn't skip an area if you wanted
[2028.94 → 2033.10] to solo yeah, and you have to like grind through things and things are actually relatively hard actually
[2033.10 → 2037.10] for a mage they're usually a little bit easier but for other stuff is like kind of difficult and
[2037.10 → 2041.98] blah blah blah blah blah blah there's no like that's why mages have high intelligence ratings
[2041.98 → 2049.02] because they're smart enough to be a mage wow there was area of effect wow area of effect yeah that's
[2049.02 → 2053.74] what it's all about someone made a video about how stupid the current version of wow is
[2053.74 → 2058.22] by picking a healer going into an instance and refusing to ever heal, and they made it through the
[2058.22 → 2064.14] entire thing without stopping oh it was a relatively low level instance but like still you should have
[2064.14 → 2071.02] to actively play your class, and you just don't anyway um it started to actually become a threat
[2071.02 → 2075.34] because that server was getting bigger than actually hold on you didn't clarify that nostrils was
[2075.34 → 2083.26] running vanilla wow not the current wow that he doesn't like yeah from like 2004 2006 is the like very
[2083.26 → 2088.70] the oldest form of World of Warcraft, and they were going along a patch schedule that was very similar
[2088.70 → 2092.94] to blizzard's patch schedule so if you played from the start it was like the beginning of world of
[2092.94 → 2098.70] warcraft with like no raids and all this kind of stuff and then like MC gets added and ZG gets added
[2098.70 → 2103.58] and like on courage was just about to come out, and it was super cool and people were doing owl and
[2103.58 → 2111.98] whatnot anyway it was great blizzard's like no closes everything down uh cease and desist OVH were
[2111.98 → 2119.82] the people that were hosting them sent the cease and desist to OVH so OVH was like okay well we have
[2119.82 → 2124.06] to shut your server off give them a little bit of time I didn't even know that they didn't just send
[2124.06 → 2127.10] it to the guys that were running it directly it's not like they're hard to get in touch with I think
[2127.10 → 2131.82] they did both I'm not really sure i know they also sent it to OVH um so they gave them a little
[2131.82 → 2136.94] bit of time they had from like I think it was Thursday to Sunday or something so they had a few
[2136.94 → 2142.86] more days with the server up um I was there for the last like half an hour I recorded I can't
[2142.86 → 2146.62] send give it anywhere because if it goes anywhere they're just going to take it down but I recorded
[2146.62 → 2150.22] like the last few minutes just outside grammar where there's like thousands and thousands of
[2150.22 → 2155.82] people my computer usually gets over 200 fps in that game it was getting two wow there was like
[2155.82 → 2160.14] actually thousands of people all standing in one pile and people were just spamming spells and stuff it
[2160.14 → 2167.90] was kind of nuts um it was kind of cool but nuts uh there was like the GMs were teleporting into
[2167.90 → 2171.98] cities and people were forming like giant circles around them and everyone was like thanking them
[2171.98 → 2176.86] and stuff it was super weird it was super weird anyway it sounds like the nerdiest yet like kind
[2176.86 → 2182.62] of coolest thing yes yeah server shutdowns are usually kind of like that um anyway there's a there's a
[2182.62 → 2188.22] change.org petition which I don't think I have the uh link for right now because I'll go find it
[2188.22 → 2193.90] go ahead and get it in the dock it has almost 100 000 signatures I think last time I looked it was
[2193.90 → 2199.74] above 90 000 it might have been above 80 000 I don't remember which one it was um but the petition
[2199.74 → 2206.22] isn't even necessarily like let's have our server back because honestly that's probably not what should
[2206.22 → 2213.34] happen because especially a server of this magnitude with this many people trying to play a single game
[2213.34 → 2220.94] it probably shouldn't be a private server run by people for no profit it should probably that's
[2220.94 → 2225.50] you're going the wrong direction captain yeah I can't, I can't go to website
[2227.98 → 2229.66] it should be relatively easy to find there
[2233.26 → 2237.34] I don't know where it's going to be anyway um it should be run by blizzard
[2237.34 → 2242.94] that's what should happen whether they hire all the guys that ran Australia and
[2243.90 → 2248.94] get them to run an official version or whatever that's probably what should happen and the petition
[2248.94 → 2256.62] was largely just about like hey guys do something there's a massive community of people that want to
[2256.62 → 2262.30] play this game your current game is shit keep the current game going whatever no one cares
[2262.30 → 2268.70] also open well I'm sure some people care I don't care um also open vanilla or progressive servers or
[2268.70 → 2273.50] whatever one of the team leads I don't remember his name right now of the original World of Warcraft
[2273.50 → 2278.86] the like one of the most infamous versions of the game has signed this petition and has
[2278.86 → 2285.18] set an letter to mike moraine blizzard CEO being like dude you guys are doing it wrong one of the
[2285.18 → 2290.22] the biggest things that people are frustrated about right now is this petition has a hundred and four
[2290.22 → 2297.18] thousand freaking signatures 105 almost more accurately um and blizzard has said nothing
[2297.18 → 2306.30] publicly about it at all what are you doing don't know don't want to I don't want to play basically
[2306.30 → 2310.70] everyone that I talked to in that game my entire guild my dad my brother everyone I talked to about
[2310.70 → 2315.10] it doesn't really want to play on a private server it's sketchy you don't know if it's going
[2315.10 → 2320.14] to continue to exist you kind of want your character to continue to be a thing I would love to
[2320.14 → 2329.18] pay for the freaking game let all of us give you money be greedy the CEO of Activision is like
[2329.18 → 2336.54] one of the most notoriously greedy dudes ever be greedy open vanilla or progressive servers take
[2336.54 → 2346.38] our money millions you'll make tons just do it just do it one of their excuses one of their excuses is that they
[2346.38 → 2355.58] lost the source code for vanilla which is obscene for one and for two these guys are literally building
[2355.58 → 2362.06] it from the ground up and it 100 felt perfect there were glitches and stuff but like are you kidding me
[2362.06 → 2368.46] classic wow had glitches up the butt don't don't try to like rose-tinted glasses that that game was
[2368.46 → 2375.58] broken it's okay like I almost think their version was better to get these guys to script it they'll do
[2375.58 → 2382.38] it right there are people out there that have tons of videos on all the fights there 's's exact
[2382.38 → 2387.66] data from databases that were run back in the day like bowhead and a few other ones that I don't
[2387.66 → 2394.78] remember um that have exact drop percentages for different items like it can very easily be rebuilt and
[2394.78 → 2402.06] the source code is gone is a bullshit excuse there we go all right fine I will acknowledge it people
[2402.06 → 2408.38] are telling us the stream is breaking periodically we know I already replied in the chat we know we
[2408.38 → 2414.86] got to continue the show we are not dropping frames we can't make a show about how twitch's server is
[2414.86 → 2419.50] glitching out because I'm pretty sure it's on their side they're asking me to fix it there is nothing I can
[2419.50 → 2427.02] do because we are encoding frames we are transmitting frames there you go um all right so lets uh
[2427.02 → 2434.30] actually we should probably do our sponsors first up is mantra so you can head over to draw it up slash
[2434.30 → 2441.90] when dash k7 xx dash y and the reason you might want to do that aforementioned thing is actually
[2441.90 → 2448.46] because they've got a drop running on a pretty good product right now red edition what now the red
[2448.46 → 2454.94] yeah it's the red edition of uh this product right here that I actually reviewed very similar
[2454.94 → 2461.98] to the Sennheiser HD 600s in terms of the sound signature uh very comfortable large very large ear
[2461.98 → 2469.98] cups um kind of hard foam, but it should mould to your head over time um very open design
[2469.98 → 2476.62] really nice headphones, and they've got them over on mass drop for a pretty wicked price so all you got to
[2476.62 → 2482.46] do is head over to drawdown slash when dash k7 xx dash why we really got to clean up those vanity URLs
[2483.42 → 2489.02] and you can check that out mass drop has all kinds of cool deals whether it's on knives did I tell you
[2489.02 → 2496.78] I lost my uh really yeah but that's really oh crap the black one yeah the um uh, uh Henshaw yeah it was a
[2496.78 → 2501.26] Henshaw knife yeah anyway that was one that they had a while back they have like keyboards keycaps
[2501.26 → 2507.10] is it like gone oh it's like I accidentally tried to take it through airport security yeah so they
[2507.10 → 2512.54] did not want me to do that yeah yep um one of the airport security guys probably has a cool knife
[2512.54 → 2519.98] now no he throws it in the garbage they have to yeah yeah yeah until the end of the day yeah that's okay
[2519.98 → 2527.02] yeah i had flipped it like so many times but it kind of stuck a lot so you can okay yeah so if it's
[2527.02 → 2533.42] too loose you can tighten them up no it's like yeah even oiling it didn't help yeah like the spring
[2533.42 → 2540.14] we're out this is a spring assisted one yeah um all right we've also got Squarespace
[2541.98 → 2547.74] so if you're not familiar with our talking points for Squarespace you should watch the wands
[2547.74 → 2556.62] show more often yeah that's right Squarespace allows you to build the website you want to build so whether
[2557.02 → 2561.82] you should find yourself wanting to make a website about an art project that you completed or uh
[2561.82 → 2569.02] you should sport to I failed or a sports team that you participate in or some uh oh I don't
[2569.02 → 2576.70] know like Etsy type craft products that you want to sell online Squarespace has got you covered you can
[2576.70 → 2582.14] pick from any one of their beautiful templates and oh no I'm not going to be able to say it while he's gone
[2582.14 → 2593.42] you should and if and you should, I found a square what that takes up space what also known as a cube
[2598.38 → 2600.54] you should probably leave okay
[2602.54 → 2608.46] so Squarespace has 24 7 tech support it starts at only eight dollars a month, and you get a free domain if
[2608.46 → 2616.14] you buy Squarespace for a year you can start a trial with no credit card required so go ahead and do it
[2616.14 → 2622.54] you should start building your website today and if you use offer code Linus to get 10 off your first
[2622.54 → 2631.50] purchase then uh you will save some money Squarespace you should build it beautiful yeah these are getting
[2631.50 → 2638.38] more and more awkward speaking of awkward you know what's awkward doing work and not getting paid for it
[2638.46 → 2644.54] not because people weren't willing to pay you but because you forgot to send the bill were you that
[2644.54 → 2651.18] kid in high school who got a zero on your assignments because you completed it and never handed it in
[2653.18 → 2659.58] I do that sometimes not that often but sometimes have you done it more than five times probably yeah
[2659.58 → 2664.46] so you have to put your hand up yeah that's you get that hand up there get it right up in there
[2664.46 → 2672.86] oh uh sorry what are we talking about right uh fresh books is all about tracking the time
[2672.86 → 2680.70] spent the materials required the expenses incurred on projects for small business owners so whether you
[2680.70 → 2689.18] run a dance studio a plumbing operation uh you know small office it maintenance sort of business or uh
[2689.18 → 2695.50] uh um you know you uh no fires put out fires well no I think they're mostly city workers I don't
[2695.50 → 2700.70] think they have to use fresh books but no they weren't originally if you are self-employed fresh books
[2700.70 → 2708.54] let you lets you keep track of all that business accounting nonsense that people don't necessarily
[2708.54 → 2712.94] want to deal with and puts it all in one place so that it is easy for you to do so you don't have to
[2712.94 → 2717.18] spend all of your time in front of your computer at the end of the day when you're tired doing accounting
[2717.18 → 2724.06] instead of working on making your business grow so if fresh books sounds good to you visit freshbooks.com
[2724.06 → 2730.14] slash when and enter when in how did you hear about us section the link will be in the video
[2730.14 → 2734.94] description assuming of course that you're watching this on YouTube and not on twitch TV
[2736.70 → 2742.30] so way back you used to pay the fire department and then the fire department would give you like a sign
[2742.30 → 2746.22] or a sticker or something that you put on your house, and you did not get your fire put out if you didn't
[2746.22 → 2750.30] have one you didn't have it your scared wow this is like way back and only in certain areas or
[2750.30 → 2755.34] whatever yeah like that was actually like a thing that's pretty cool yeah speaking of things that were
[2755.34 → 2763.26] a thing in the past texting while walking could be banned in New Jersey under new rules being proposed
[2763.26 → 2770.54] by U.S. officials the number of people dying while walking according to this independent.co.uk article
[2770.54 → 2777.50] is swiftly increasing and thousands of people are being injured while walking with their phone
[2778.94 → 2785.10] what that is hilarious I mean it's not funny when people get hurt, but it's hilarious that it is a
[2785.10 → 2792.30] problem for people to walk while but some of this data is like a little weird like okay 11 of all
[2792.30 → 2799.02] fatalities in 2005 involved pedestrians 15 of all fatalities in 2014 involved pedestrians could that not be
[2799.02 → 2808.14] because of other things now is that only tied to this you know it'd be fascinating
[2808.14 → 2815.02] to see if you could find articles from the 80s proposing like banning no newspapers while walking
[2815.98 → 2820.94] no I was thinking more along the lines of Walkmans like earphones since that was sort of a thing that
[2820.94 → 2826.22] happened in the 80s yeah that's probably a thing, but newspapers is good too because you know what if you
[2826.22 → 2831.10] can think of something someone somewhere has probably tried to propose a law to ban it so
[2832.22 → 2833.50] anyway Mr owes
[2836.14 → 2839.26] that law already existed and makes perfect sense it does actually
[2839.98 → 2846.62] they definitely have 100 of a right to do that um so the there's a bill pending in Hawaii that will
[2846.62 → 2851.02] find someone 250 dollars if he or she crosses the street with an electronic device
[2851.02 → 2856.30] no states have enacted a law specifically targeting distracted cyclists or pedestrians
[2856.86 → 2862.22] but violators in New Jersey would apparently face fines of up to 50 us dollars 15 days of
[2862.22 → 2868.62] imprisonment which is ridiculous or both which is the same penalty as jaywalking wow
[2869.82 → 2875.66] interesting i those guys that like ride the bikes and have the things behind it that like
[2875.66 → 2883.66] can tell you they'll get way more business now rickshaws sure oh no they run like a rickshaw bike
[2885.02 → 2889.90] like have you not seen those uh like just cyclists with like carriages behind yeah yeah yeah it would
[2889.90 → 2894.62] be like having a horse except a bike right yeah, yeah okay I get it yeah I feel like they get way more
[2894.62 → 2897.98] work because there 's's actually points in time where like I have to walk for a little while and
[2897.98 → 2903.42] like I really need to do something on my phone and I don't have time to not do one of them
[2905.66 → 2910.38] like anytime at CES oh my god this thing's kind of cool this is the helicopter
[2911.58 → 2919.26] or as I'm going to call it from now on the helicopter yeah because it has I don't 13 rotors
[2919.26 → 2928.14] I don't know how many it has it's not an 18 propeller spinning rotors 18 propeller spinning rotors
[2928.78 → 2936.38] it holds a person and a joystick and not a whole oh yeah and a massive battery and not a lot
[2936.38 → 2942.14] else, and it is the world's first certified multi-copter that lifts off in I'm not even
[2942.14 → 2951.58] going to try Germany marking a new era for aerial transportation it is electrically powered which is
[2951.58 → 2959.26] pretty cool it's apparently super easy to fly with three redundant autopilots that will basically hover
[2959.26 → 2966.94] as soon as the pilot lets go of the joystick and um can reach a speed this is the v200 we're looking at
[2966.94 → 2973.18] by the way can reach a speed of 15 miles per hour with the team determined to increase the speed to
[2973.18 → 2981.42] 60 miles per hour on follow-up flights much like your DJI phantom copter computer on a stick
[2981.42 → 2987.58] uh that you fly with a little you know a couple of sticks in your chest mounted neck hang scrappy thing
[2988.86 → 2996.86] multi multi-rotor or drone yeah um much like that the helicopter sorry excuse me the helicopter
[2997.26 → 3005.02] is directed by increasing or decreasing the speed of its propellers rather than by altering the pitch
[3005.02 → 3011.42] so uh I actually don't know if pitch is technically the correct term so the aircraft this is pitch
[3011.42 → 3013.82] this is yaw strafe
[3016.70 → 3025.82] um so but okay so but basically yeah so the but but but so unlike a helicopter you don't actually
[3025.82 → 3031.34] move the spinning rotors they just the speed at which they're spinning changes um the
[3031.34 → 3036.30] propeller system is designed to fold up and fit on a towable trailer for easy transport, and they're
[3036.30 → 3040.62] working on certification to produce the helicopter in large quantities
[3040.62 → 3052.54] and 60 miles an hour like as birds as the crow flies yeah is really fast yeah that would be pretty darn
[3052.54 → 3063.10] freaking cool pitch yaw rotation what no, no this is yaw is the same as rotation
[3063.10 → 3069.34] or is this yeah roll's a different thing because remember
[3070.54 → 3076.94] pitch yaw isn't this yaw no I don't think so and then this is rotation I could be wrong that's
[3076.94 → 3082.86] possible pitch yaw and raffle love it that's the kind of copter I want to ride in all right
[3083.74 → 3091.58] Canadian police it's wall and ruffle okay according to this uh according to this article
[3091.58 → 3097.02] posted by s girly on the forum original article here is from the verge have apparently had a master
[3097.02 → 3102.30] key to blackberry's encryption since 2010, and it was used to intercept and read messages
[3102.30 → 3111.90] well okay then Canada has something called a spy palace we can pretty much just like stop this whole
[3111.90 → 3121.10] topic there spying in Canada is brutal so a high level surveillance probe shows that Canada's federal
[3121.10 → 3126.22] policing agency has had a global encryption key for blackberry since 2010 according to documents
[3126.22 → 3131.98] by the RCMP filed in court law enforcement decrypted roughly one million pin-to-pin blackberry
[3131.98 → 3138.38] messages in connection with the probe from 2010 to 2012. It doesn't show where this key came from
[3138.38 → 3142.62] and government lawyers spent two years fighting in a Montreal courtroom to keep the information
[3142.62 → 3149.18] out of the public record neither the RCMP nor blackberry confirmed if this is true but crown
[3149.18 → 3154.62] prosecutors confirmed the federal police had access to the key just in case people were wondering
[3154.62 → 3161.90] about the Canadian spy palace I posted it in the twitch chat um there are new rumors about the Nintendo
[3161.90 → 3167.42] no uh this was posted by master disaster on the forum the original article here is from screen
[3167.42 → 3174.86] rent and to be clear a lot of the rumours lately about the no have been uh have seemed to be
[3174.86 → 3179.34] coming from like some Subreddit where people have been posting complete nonsense
[3179.34 → 3190.30] but this round of rumours is according to john Castile more believable than some so take it for what it is
[3190.30 → 3197.42] more believable than rumours that john Castile says are more believable than some this is a more
[3197.42 → 3203.82] believable torch than some of them yeah and some than the actual digital representations yeah um
[3203.82 → 3212.06] um so do the no will apparently feature an x86 architecture it will apparently back up data to
[3212.06 → 3217.10] Nintendo servers which is huge because the current ones don't and if your Wii U dies you lose all of
[3217.10 → 3226.70] your digital purposes uh purchases which is bullshit isn't that terrible it's so bad oh my gosh it's like
[3226.70 → 3234.94] like it's like actually worse than the Super Nintendo which at least stored your data on the game yeah
[3234.94 → 3242.62] yeah yeah yeah you know that should even be a feature like we'll feature it's like we'll have fixed you
[3242.62 → 3248.62] know what surprises me that no one ever created i you know it probably existed at some point but that
[3248.62 → 3257.42] no one ever mainstreamed semi-rewritable discs so if you could have a game that had a mostly read-only
[3257.42 → 3265.90] media layer on the outside but had just a very, very small rewritable layer on the inside don't do super
[3265.90 → 3271.90] great with mass rewrites though um there are discs that could handle a lot, and it wouldn't be the kind
[3271.90 → 3275.66] of thing that you would save every time you hit a save point it would be the kind of thing that you
[3275.66 → 3281.50] save every time you eject that could actually make a ton of sense don't you think I think so
[3282.06 → 3285.34] I think that would be that would be a really cool way to handle it I mean obviously that's like
[3285.34 → 3292.86] that's like a PS2 era like technology proposal but um yeah I just think that would have been kind
[3292.86 → 3296.06] of a neat way to do I'm sure twitch chat is full of people telling me all the reasons it couldn't
[3296.06 → 3300.62] happen this won't work because xyz yeah or someone tried it, and you know what this is my show
[3300.62 → 3308.06] so um it'll apparently have support for an additional screen which is going to lead to um
[3308.06 → 3314.86] companies like say for example rocket fish producing the most fabulous TV wall mounts the
[3314.86 → 3320.14] world has ever seen I'm sure if the configuration is expected to be anything like the DS's dual screen
[3321.74 → 3328.06] I mean can you imagine I mean two TVs on your wall it's like why do you have two TVs on your wall oh yeah
[3328.06 → 3333.82] i have to play games on my no so yeah you got my mini map the bottom one's touch screen
[3333.82 → 3339.58] everyone's all you have to like to get up and run over to it be like yeah got my 52 inch uh got my 52 inch
[3339.58 → 3346.46] uh touch screen uh you know stereoscopic mini map you know no big deal whatever
[3347.02 → 3355.58] awesome um can handle ports of current gen games I should certainly hope so um well it's x86 they are being
[3355.58 → 3364.46] such jerks about retro games um and everyone is blizzard um that's a completely different issue i
[3364.46 → 3372.14] don't care I'm talking about how the latest 3ds how the latest 3ds is getting i I can't remember
[3372.14 → 3379.74] it's either Game Boy Advance or Super Nintendo games when like you could literally with an emulator on like
[3379.74 → 3385.90] like the vanilla DS emulate SNES games, and they're claiming the previous generation 3ds wasn't
[3385.90 → 3394.06] powerful enough it's like you know what lose the attitude Nintendo it almost makes me feel not bad
[3394.06 → 3399.26] about emulating their games which I've never done of course you didn't of course I haven't
[3400.46 → 3407.50] speaking of which I am I'm kind of torn right now I am not sure if I'm going to buy a CRT anymore
[3407.50 → 3416.14] because I was playing games on um the 65-inch OLED TV, and it was like Super Mario world's
[3416.14 → 3420.54] unplayable just completely unplayable like the delay was ridiculous I posted a video
[3420.54 → 3424.94] that I recorded at 240 fps of like pressing a button, and then it's like
[3428.78 → 3435.26] Mario Jones like come on like the pixel response time is good but the processing delay on that TV is
[3435.26 → 3445.58] horrendous um but I was using a computer monitor like a gaming grade computer monitor predator monitor
[3445.58 → 3450.94] and like it was fine like LCD is good enough as long as you've got one with low input lag so as much
[3450.94 → 3456.78] as like and I had actually I had I was died hard zs and ES for a long time just because I knew how to use
[3456.78 → 3461.98] if it's like yeah it's SDS works, and he was emulating games not that i not that I've ever
[3461.98 → 3467.26] emulated he just wanted to emulate the console to be clear I do own a copy of Super Mario world
[3467.26 → 3471.66] does that make it okay no technically no but I don't care okay it's its one of those things where
[3471.66 → 3479.18] like technically I cannot copy my self-park DVDs to my server and stream them to my phone but I don't
[3479.18 → 3484.78] care that I'm going to do that anyway um, and you can put me in jail if you really think that that makes a
[3484.78 → 3491.58] ton of sense, but that is like looks bad on you um be fair it's Nintendo, and they probably don't care
[3491.58 → 3497.74] yeah they probably don't it's like the letter is literally in the mail right now yeah
[3499.02 → 3503.90] um so yeah I'm kind of torn right now I might just I might just because the other thing too is
[3503.90 → 3511.26] like I had kind of forgotten how small CRTs were and if they're big how ridiculous they are yeah
[3511.26 → 3516.46] like there's a there's actually a 40 inches for free on Craigslist a 40 inch 4x3 apparently one of
[3516.46 → 3521.90] the best ones out there um even though the larger ones tended to have geometry issues around the
[3521.90 → 3526.30] corners I'm actually even if whether I buy one or not with all the research I've done over the last
[3526.30 → 3532.06] little bit I may do a video like so you want to buy, or you want to pick up a used CRT for retro that
[3532.06 → 3540.70] is that bad badass we should get it and replace mine it's like 300 pounds my brother right he could
[3540.70 → 3547.58] probably lift it on his own yes, and he has a truck that can move it uh i can i can link you the
[3547.58 → 3551.82] post that would actually be sick i we will go get it but the other and I can get it so the ones that
[3551.82 → 3557.18] I was looking at were closer to the like 32 inches to 34 inch range but the thing to remember about
[3557.18 → 3564.86] that is that a 32 inch CRT is basically equivalent to like a 30 or excuse me yeah 30 or 29 inch LCD
[3564.86 → 3569.26] because of the way they were measured they were actually measured differently you could factor out
[3569.26 → 3575.10] about two inches of size on a CRT at least for computer monitors wow I want to see this video
[3575.10 → 3581.58] nope don't tell me make the video yeah um so that's that that was the general rule for pc monitors
[3581.58 → 3587.42] it may not be true for TVs so you know please avoid correcting me because I will do the research
[3587.42 → 3591.82] before I make the video um so anyway I'm yeah I'm kind of torn because like I want to make like a
[3591.82 → 3597.82] little gaming room in the one side oh, oh this is a great upcoming video um some people had asked me
[3597.82 → 3603.50] when I went and put all my computers in the closet next to my um next to the room in my house like
[3603.50 → 3608.62] what I was going to do for ventilation oh yeah that room got upgraded this week, so there's a video
[3608.62 → 3613.34] coming, but there's one on the other side so I had kind of wanted to drywall that in and like put like
[3613.34 → 3617.10] a beanbag chair like wire up some electrical outlets because it sits right above the breaker
[3617.10 → 3624.46] box down in my garage and like to make like a cool little gaming nook um, but you can use a gaming
[3624.46 → 3629.02] one maybe I'll just use an LCD yeah maybe I'll just throw a gaming monitor in there because s right
[3629.02 → 3634.54] SNES 9x coming back to you know being as at SNES die hard but having issues with Windows 10.
[3634.54 → 3639.18] SNES 9x is like perfect and there are a lot of really cool filters that you can put on that
[3639.18 → 3644.94] make it look pretty good you can yeah you can kind of do a lot yeah it's actually up sampling on old
[3644.94 → 3651.02] school games is yeah hey yeah whoa like certain like PlayStation 1 games have you seen that stuff
[3651.02 → 3658.14] I have not I actually haven't played around with PlayStation 1 emulation since else and like bleed
[3658.14 → 3665.26] were cool like does bleed even exist I don't I don't do this stuff I have no idea what the words
[3665.26 → 3671.74] are that you're saying do you know what bleed is though for serious no okay bleed exclamation mark
[3671.74 → 3682.38] uh commercial was a commercial PlayStation emulator what um for I know was for IBM compatible pcs and
[3682.38 → 3693.90] dream cast in 1999 dream cast um yeah apparently ran on dream cast what the shit it was released in
[3693.90 → 3698.06] three other versions called bleed cast to play popular PlayStation games gran tourism 2 metal
[3698.06 → 3705.26] gear solid and taken 3 on the dream cast what legacy although Sony's litigation against bleed
[3705.26 → 3711.74] led the company to bankruptcy Sony did not manage to win a decisive victory against blame and to have
[3711.74 → 3715.82] the product removed from shelves after their demise which is a legal precedent for the commercial
[3715.82 → 3724.14] viability of emulators what the hell very interesting huh as of 2005 two members of the team were working
[3724.14 → 3735.02] for Sony okay well anyway so 1999 to like 2001 like yeah I was never in the emulator game I always had real
[3735.02 → 3740.46] copies like even fairly recently I bought fable one because a bunch of people said it was great I bought
[3740.46 → 3746.46] fable one for Xbox have you played people original no I haven't what yeah we were I think it was you
[3746.46 → 3750.62] and me talking about it wasn't it maybe because fable one's awesome I think we're talking about it on
[3750.62 → 3756.30] the show so I went and picked it up okay one for Xbox original or whatever we want to call it oh okay
[3756.30 → 3765.74] I don't know um yeah Xbox black edition I got GTA three oh no black 360s yeah black Xbox ones yeah crap i
[3765.74 → 3771.82] failed yeah I got GTA three for like three bucks so I was like screw it whatever and then I got uh
[3771.82 → 3777.02] need for speed most wanted black edition speaking of black edition nice like the old like super sick
[3777.02 → 3782.70] most wanted with that blue and silver BMW at the start it's a great game, and it was the whole thing
[3782.70 → 3789.50] was like nine dollars nice it's like okay sure yeah fable is perfect you'll enjoy it um i probably
[3789.50 → 3794.06] will back to the Nintendo no rumours which we will make our way through eventually in fact we're almost at
[3794.06 → 3799.82] the end of the show here it's already after six um according to Nintendo life a number of Wii U ports
[3799.82 → 3806.86] are in development I mean can Nintendo at least remake properties that are actually old
[3809.66 → 3818.70] oh no ports ports ports not really I see what you're saying yeah they're Wii U remasters apparently
[3818.70 → 3824.46] remasters actually yeah we knew remasters, so the new console will apparently be as allegedly more
[3824.46 → 3830.06] powerful than the current PS4 uh which I guess is good because you'll be able to play in full HD
[3830.62 → 3836.06] uh Wii U games or something no because they already run at 1080p so I don't I don't actually
[3836.06 → 3845.26] know it's good yeah it's not a bad thing so cool um moving on the op here was convicted pillowcase and
[3845.26 → 3851.50] the original article is from the verge Logitech buys audio device maker jaybird for 50 million in cash
[3852.38 → 3858.22] um continuing their trend of buying up companies like oh I don't know this is a good
[3858.22 → 3867.02] example ultimate ears to uh to own more audio brands very interesting yeah um apparently if they
[3867.02 → 3873.74] hit some growth projections and targets over the next couple of years they can earn an additional 45
[3873.74 → 3882.22] million uh Logitech does not expect the acquisition to impact its fiscal year 2017 guidance wow good
[3882.22 → 3888.22] job I guess Logitech yeah good for you, you made a cool mouse yeah although I realize that the market
[3888.22 → 3894.06] probably doesn't want this, and you probably shouldn't do it but if you guys made a g900
[3894.06 → 3899.50] that instead of having a plug-in cable on the front and instead of having like a properly placed really
[3899.50 → 3905.50] good battery in the back had replaceable batteries like the g7 that was a pretty cool hot swap system
[3905.50 → 3910.62] there that was so good yeah it was pretty cool I saw it again in the mineral video when I was doing
[3910.62 → 3914.78] research for the other video that I just shot and I saw the battery sitting there and I was like oh that
[3914.78 → 3919.98] was sick they also need to bring back the g9 v9x shell yeah um like because they sell for like a
[3919.98 → 3926.22] lot look go on Amazon look up g9 whoa sometimes those are just broken listings, but he brought up that
[3926.22 → 3931.42] there was also a g9 one bay for like 150 bucks or something yeah and there's like multiple ones
[3931.42 → 3937.66] on Amazon for like huge amounts of money, so developers are adapting Oculus Rift exclusives
[3937.66 → 3942.30] to work on the HTC vibe which is great news for people like me who plan to buy a five and do not plan
[3942.30 → 3949.50] to buy a rift to be clear I have bought a five, but that belongs to minus media group it's complicated
[3949.50 → 3955.66] like you have bought a rift uh five and a five and a rift yeah yeah but Linus media group bought
[3955.66 → 3962.22] those they actually don't belong to me like people who don't run their own businesses might not know
[3962.22 → 3967.98] this but like Linus media group is its own legal entity and I am my own legal entity, and we are not
[3967.98 → 3976.62] the same thing and this is important for tax purposes um so yeah in the past month the consumer versions have
[3976.62 → 3985.02] been released I think released is a strong word for what the rift has done well hold up 219gaming.com
[3985.02 → 3989.66] said in the twitch chat well I want to support you guys but I can't seem to get an answer so thanks
[3989.66 → 3998.54] anyway twitch chat is not the right place to try to contact us just for your information and for the
[3998.54 → 4005.66] information of anyone else watching yeah don't go to twitch chat yeah and a lot of people try to tweet me
[4005.66 → 4012.46] during wan show don't do that bad idea I'm here you can actually see that I'm not looking at my phone
[4013.34 → 4019.50] just yeah uh, so there's that I didn't see any of the other stuff you said but I saw that
[4019.50 → 4024.22] I always see the useless I know you know i it's like the worst thing ever when I'm like when I have
[4024.22 → 4028.78] some time like I'm sitting on the can right and I'm scrolling through like twitter mentions and
[4028.78 → 4034.62] someone's like hey can I ask you a question yeah it's like and I'm like if you had asked
[4034.62 → 4038.06] you would have been able to ask me a question now the odds of me seeing your because the odds of
[4038.06 → 4043.26] me seeing the follow-up very slim yeah because when your feed gets like so full and the problem
[4043.26 → 4048.86] is that the Twitter app it doesn't allow you to filter, so mine's just full of whoever liked
[4048.86 → 4055.34] this video retweeted did whatever no not that liked videos even if I filter down to just mentions
[4055.34 → 4060.94] it's just full of people liking the videos which is not bad thank you for liking the videos I appreciate
[4060.94 → 4065.66] that I get it, but it makes it really, really difficult to use anyway, so there's a program
[4065.66 → 4071.42] called libber slash review that allows rift exclusive like lucky's tale and oculus dream deck
[4071.42 → 4077.34] to play on the vibe the code was posted to redder by Reddit by user cross VR, and it could be used to
[4077.34 → 4087.26] port other titles dun dun don't boom that's huge because honestly right now the main thing rift kind of had
[4087.26 → 4093.34] going for it was its games' library because the experience on five currently is just better the
[4093.34 → 4099.66] touch controllers are fascinating and currently non-existent at least for consumers so
[4101.90 → 4110.46] pictures leaked of NVIDIA's pascal based GP 104 and 106 GPUs this was originally posted on the forum by Mr
[4110.46 → 4122.54] underscore troll and uh basically yeah so it looks like NVIDIA has hardware if this rumour is to be
[4122.54 → 4131.18] believed um for their next generation probably gaming GPUs because while big pascal so GP 100 has only
[4131.18 → 4139.58] surfaced as the tesla p100 um smaller pascal is likely to emerge as according to the rumour
[4140.46 → 4148.30] a GTX 1080 and 1070 using the GP 104 GPU with something like a 1060 likely to use the 106
[4148.30 → 4152.62] if they stick with the naming conventions that they have been using for the last couple of generations
[4152.62 → 4156.94] and this is something that kind of drives me crazy NVIDIA what's with all the cloak and dagger nonsense
[4157.58 → 4163.10] if you're going to be cloak and dagger why don't you use code names that like anyone who's been
[4163.10 → 4169.66] following you for more than you know 18 months won't understand like if you're actually going to keep
[4169.66 → 4175.34] like they won't tell me anything because obviously they have pascal hardware if they have the tesla
[4175.34 → 4182.54] so yo hey what's going on they won't tell me anything, but they use code names that I understand
[4182.54 → 4188.38] as soon as a rumour leaks somewhere which it always do I don't know just make up your mind that's all
[4188.38 → 4195.90] um I actually don't understand how like I will be in team speak with someone who's a viewer like a
[4195.90 → 4202.30] friend on the forum or something like that, and they will tell me things about hardware tech because
[4202.30 → 4207.58] of rumours that end up being completely accurate that I haven't heard of yet even though I'm in
[4207.58 → 4211.74] communication with those companies, and they're actively telling me that there's nothing going on
[4211.74 → 4219.10] and I'm like what how do you guys suck this much like apple doesn't really leak things I know they're just
[4219.10 → 4226.46] leaked their renaming of mac macOS and that's probably because no one cared like other important
[4226.46 → 4231.34] things they just don't knowing apple they probably treated it like it was important to be fair but
[4231.34 → 4236.78] someone probably couldn't fathom how we could care yes and accidentally yeah yeah um so we've got some
[4236.78 → 4242.86] rumoured specs the GTX 1080 is rumoured to have eight billion transistors so about equivalent to the 980ti
[4242.86 → 4249.26] 2560 Cuba course eight gigs of gddr5 memory on a probably 256 bit bus that's a question mark but
[4249.26 → 4254.70] that's been a pattern for the last little while um question mark single eight pin power connectors
[4254.70 → 4260.54] question mark two display port that would be a shame uh with a question mark no they're apparently
[4260.54 → 4268.54] pretty confident about the June 2016 uh release time that would make sense right near computer yep so
[4269.18 → 4276.94] much like last time around where we got a 980 that was pretty similar to the 780ti which was based on
[4276.94 → 4285.42] big uh crap I'm losing track of my uh losing track of my code names big Kepler um so about equivalent
[4285.42 → 4291.74] in terms of performance so it looks like we're going to see a mid-tier chip that's probably about similar
[4291.74 → 4298.14] to performance to the last gen big chip um, and then we will actually have to wait another product refresh
[4298.54 → 4307.18] to get big um big pascal on the consumer side in the form of probably a titan boo yah edition or whatever
[4307.18 → 4318.54] the case may be so I guess that's pretty much it for important things uh purple did posted on the forum
[4318.54 → 4324.62] that the first 10 core smartphone has arrived from menu oh my god
[4324.62 → 4331.42], and thank you for watching the Sancho have you ever had a performance problem with your phone
[4331.42 → 4338.38] in terms of compute in the last two years um that's a good question and not one that more cores would
[4338.38 → 4349.42] solve roll the outro yeah see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[4349.42 → 4355.98] no one's like titan triple x no they will not do that although knowing NVIDIA they did introduce
[4355.98 → 4363.90] mph antialiasing so I mean they apparently just don't give any cares
[4365.90 → 4372.62] so there's that let's be fair mass drop AXX drop go check it out Squarespace you should
[4372.62 → 4379.10] fresh books we should do an entire Sancho books that are fresh through like a text to speech thing
[4379.10 → 4385.02] no we shouldn't that's a terrible idea for like April fools that was like literally two weeks ago
[4385.58 → 4388.46] in the future I said we should do like not now
[4392.14 → 4398.30] it's like a twitch thing it's a bad idea because donators like on some twitch channels
[4398.30 → 4403.98] donators that donate enough money get their message sent text to speech to everyone watching
[4403.98 → 4409.90] the stream because apparently those massive disruptions are just totally okay if enough
[4409.90 → 4415.66] people watch you it reminds me of uh like billy that Chinese site that we upload our videos to
[4415.66 → 4420.94] have you ever watched our videos on there uh I did when we were deciding if it was a good idea or not
[4420.94 → 4427.82] that comments stream across the video yeah and I think it's at the point in the video that the
[4427.82 → 4432.62] person was watching when they made that comment, and it's like all over the video it's like how do you
[4432.62 → 4440.78] watch this it's awful cultural differences I guess all right bye guys bye
