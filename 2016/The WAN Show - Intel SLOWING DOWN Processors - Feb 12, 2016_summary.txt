• Baltimore police obtained an arrest warrant for Karen Andrews in 2014 and used a cell phone to track her location.
• They used a "hailstorm" device to intercept her phone's data without disclosing it to the defense.
• The device is similar to a stingray, covertly intercepting mobile phone conversations in real-time.
• Police have used this technology 4,300 times since 2007, raising concerns about privacy and the potential for innocent bystanders' information to be scooped up.
• A judge concluded that police intentionally withheld this information from the defense, violating legal disclosure obligations.
• The use of cell phones can be seen as voluntarily sharing location information with third parties, but critics argue that police should not exploit this for surveillance purposes.
