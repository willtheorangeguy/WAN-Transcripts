[0.00 --> 1.92]  Oh, that's a good one.
[1.92 --> 2.92]  There we go.
[2.92 --> 4.04]  Hey, I'm still on time.
[4.04 --> 5.28]  It's still 4.30.
[5.28 --> 8.92]  So instead of being one minute early, I'm on time.
[8.92 --> 10.32]  OK, hold up.
[10.32 --> 10.82]  Hold up.
[10.82 --> 13.20]  Now I got to see if it's working.
[13.20 --> 15.06]  Dun-da-da-da-da.
[15.06 --> 16.52]  Dun-da-da-da-da.
[16.52 --> 17.14]  Dun-da-da.
[17.14 --> 19.76]  Oh.
[19.76 --> 20.62]  It is.
[20.62 --> 22.12]  There we go.
[22.12 --> 25.34]  So instead of being 10 minutes early, I was then one minute
[25.34 --> 27.40]  early, and then instead of being one minute early,
[27.40 --> 30.12]  I was basically exactly on time.
[30.12 --> 32.64]  So that kind of worked out.
[32.64 --> 35.54]  Ah.
[35.54 --> 36.48]  Hello, everyone.
[36.48 --> 37.62]  Welcome to the WAN Show.
[37.62 --> 40.70]  You might notice that today I am acting as Linus.
[40.70 --> 42.54]  I'm pretty bad at acting as Linus,
[42.54 --> 45.32]  so I'm just going to revert exactly back to acting as Luke.
[45.32 --> 47.82]  He's over there building a thing.
[47.82 --> 49.62]  Can they know about the thing?
[49.62 --> 50.52]  Ah.
[50.52 --> 51.40]  Ah, what the hell.
[51.40 --> 52.02]  Sure.
[52.02 --> 54.52]  OK, so he's building a Linus Tech Tips themed computer,
[54.52 --> 57.40]  which- Oh, that's not what I'm doing today.
[57.40 --> 57.90]  What?
[57.90 --> 59.44]  This is 7Gamers, one CPU.
[59.44 --> 61.58]  Oh, it super looks like it's Linus Tech Tips themed.
[61.58 --> 63.30]  Yeah, it kind of did that too.
[63.30 --> 63.80]  OK.
[63.80 --> 66.86]  So he's building a kind of not really the point of the video,
[66.86 --> 69.48]  but also slightly Linus Tech Tips themed computer,
[69.48 --> 71.98]  which is 7Gamers, one CPU.
[71.98 --> 73.16]  They can know that?
[73.16 --> 73.66]  Sure.
[73.66 --> 75.00]  And can they know where it's being shown off at?
[75.00 --> 76.00]  Sure, yeah.
[76.00 --> 77.40]  Hey, they're WAN Show viewers.
[77.40 --> 78.28]  They're the loyal ones.
[78.28 --> 78.88]  Where is it?
[78.88 --> 79.38]  Where is it being shown off?
[79.38 --> 81.22]  It's going to be at Kingston's thing.
[81.22 --> 81.72]  Kingston?
[81.72 --> 82.22]  Oh.
[82.22 --> 82.72]  At CES.
[82.72 --> 83.22]  OK.
[83.22 --> 85.48]  It's going to be shown off at CES, at Kingston's booth,
[85.48 --> 89.10]  or whatever it is that they have.
[89.10 --> 89.94]  We'll be there.
[89.94 --> 91.10]  We'll be covering that.
[91.10 --> 94.66]  Be sure to check out youtube.com slash Linus Tech Tips
[94.66 --> 95.72]  for all of our CES coverage.
[95.72 --> 96.90]  There's going to be tons of it.
[96.90 --> 99.30]  I think it's like over 60 videos this year
[99.30 --> 100.76]  that we're planning to do.
[100.76 --> 102.52]  So yeah.
[102.52 --> 104.40]  And if some of the rumors turn out to be true,
[104.40 --> 105.70]  some cool things could be happening.
[105.70 --> 109.60]  I think Asus and is it Gigabyte?
[109.60 --> 111.82]  I'm going to have to check into my dock here real quick.
[111.82 --> 114.28]  But they might both be jumping into the headset space.
[114.28 --> 115.78]  I don't know if they're going to have.
[115.78 --> 122.50]  Yeah, Asus and Gigabyte might both be launching VR devices
[122.50 --> 123.52]  in 2016.
[123.52 --> 125.08]  This is a rumor topic.
[125.08 --> 126.20]  I'm going to drop that into the chat.
[126.20 --> 126.94]  No, I'm not.
[126.94 --> 130.12]  We're going to intro the video, which I totally forgot to do.
[130.12 --> 131.18]  Welcome to the WAN Show.
[131.18 --> 132.40]  I think I already said that part.
[132.40 --> 133.58]  We have some cool topics.
[133.58 --> 137.12]  Apple is kind of, I don't know, possibly being dicks.
[137.12 --> 138.24]  And they're being sued for it.
[138.24 --> 139.30]  Lawsuit, whatever.
[139.30 --> 141.72]  China is being really weird and creepy and weird.
[141.72 --> 143.82]  And it's probably not fine.
[143.82 --> 147.62]  Valve is losing grace a little bit, especially with Total Biscuit.
[147.62 --> 150.74]  And TP Link is apparently going to be making phones
[150.74 --> 153.78]  because I actually have no idea why.
[153.78 --> 154.70]  Anyways, intro.
[163.58 --> 166.18]  I also hope you're not in all of myometers necessary.
[166.18 --> 169.42]  I think I agree אם of Nevermind, but it's just .
[183.92 --> 184.88]  Pretty cool.
[184.88 --> 185.38]  Yeah.
[185.38 --> 186.18]  Okay.
[186.18 --> 186.96]  And we're back.
[186.96 --> 189.36]  Yeah, it's just me today.
[190.20 --> 191.84]  So that's cool.
[192.16 --> 193.94]  I was trying to emulate the guy from Fallout 4 there,
[194.00 --> 195.12]  but I don't think I did a very good job.
[195.44 --> 197.14]  Anyways, I'm going to share this topic in the doc.
[197.20 --> 201.66]  We're going to talk about Apple being hit with a lawsuit
[201.66 --> 204.18]  over iOS 9's performance on older phones.
[204.18 --> 208.36]  I think particularly the iPhone 4,
[208.58 --> 211.40]  because of how bad it performs with iOS 9.
[211.80 --> 213.42]  iPhone 4 doesn't have iOS 9.
[213.42 --> 218.02]  That's literally what the topic is about.
[218.78 --> 219.16]  Really?
[220.32 --> 220.62]  Yeah.
[222.26 --> 224.14]  This topic might have a problem.
[224.64 --> 226.80]  My 4 didn't get the update.
[227.10 --> 228.34]  It's literally, okay.
[229.38 --> 230.44]  Hashtag blame Colton!
[230.44 --> 234.56]  The title of the topic is Apple hit with a lawsuit
[234.56 --> 236.54]  over iOS 9's performance on older iPhones.
[237.00 --> 239.70]  And then the third note is after upgrading software,
[239.84 --> 241.88]  iPhone 4's have apparently become so slow
[241.88 --> 243.72]  they are unusable for day-to-day conditions.
[251.30 --> 254.06]  We're going to pretend that topic didn't happen moving forward.
[254.18 --> 255.86]  A new law forces Chinese companies
[255.86 --> 257.64]  to provide encryption keys.
[257.64 --> 260.40]  So I'm going to post that in the chat really quick.
[261.10 --> 263.56]  We're going to just pretend for now
[263.56 --> 266.74]  that I guess Apple isn't having a lawsuit
[266.74 --> 268.68]  being shot against them.
[269.10 --> 270.52]  I guess that's fine.
[270.52 --> 272.36]  I'm going to show you guys the article,
[272.68 --> 274.68]  but it's really boring because it's literally just text.
[274.84 --> 275.86]  So we're going to jump back here.
[277.02 --> 279.78]  Basically, as far as I can tell,
[279.94 --> 282.16]  you don't have to submit all of your passwords
[282.16 --> 284.48]  and encryption keys all the time.
[284.58 --> 286.64]  It's just if they ever ask for them,
[286.70 --> 288.54]  you have to immediately give them over.
[288.68 --> 290.60]  Encryption keys, passwords, whatever.
[290.76 --> 291.84]  It's part of a new legislature.
[292.24 --> 294.46]  Apparently, Kazakhstan is the only other nation
[294.46 --> 295.74]  that has done this.
[295.74 --> 297.42]  and they're claiming that the only other nation
[297.42 --> 299.54]  that has compromised encryption for citizens' data,
[300.06 --> 301.94]  compromised encryption of citizens' data
[301.94 --> 302.90]  for the sake of the state.
[304.50 --> 306.20]  I think some people would argue
[306.20 --> 308.72]  that that is happening elsewhere as well,
[308.84 --> 310.10]  but, you know, I don't know.
[310.32 --> 312.08]  They're claiming that, oh, no, no, no,
[312.08 --> 313.88]  we're not installing any back doors,
[314.32 --> 316.62]  but in my opinion, it's not any better
[316.62 --> 318.86]  to forcibly take the key for the front door.
[318.86 --> 321.46]  So, I don't know.
[322.38 --> 324.96]  For those of you in chat wondering where Linus is,
[325.04 --> 326.18]  he's literally right there,
[326.30 --> 328.10]  but he's a little bit too busy to be on WAN Show.
[328.44 --> 330.28]  I'm going to reiterate what I talked about earlier.
[330.46 --> 333.46]  He's building a computer that is for seven people
[333.46 --> 334.98]  to play on one computer.
[335.16 --> 337.10]  You guys might have seen a video that,
[337.28 --> 338.96]  wow, I'm really used to pointing
[338.96 --> 341.08]  in the top right-hand corner whenever I reference videos,
[341.24 --> 342.66]  but you guys might have seen a video
[342.66 --> 344.82]  where he built one computer for two people.
[345.56 --> 346.78]  He's scaling that up a bit.
[346.78 --> 349.10]  I'm not going to tell you all the hardware exactly included.
[350.40 --> 354.04]  I actually only know probably one type of the components
[354.04 --> 355.84]  of the hardware that's included, but that's fine.
[356.80 --> 358.34]  And there's, yeah, it's pretty cool.
[358.42 --> 359.02]  It's orange and black.
[359.10 --> 361.10]  It looks LTT-themed, but that's not really the point.
[361.18 --> 362.34]  He just really likes those colors.
[362.66 --> 363.52]  And it's going to be shown off
[363.52 --> 366.98]  at the Kingston HyperX area at CES,
[367.10 --> 371.42]  where we're going to be covering a huge amount of videos.
[371.54 --> 374.04]  Over 60, I think, is what Nick said
[374.04 --> 375.14]  in the meeting I just had with him.
[375.14 --> 377.08]  And I think it's like over 60 minimum.
[378.08 --> 380.18]  So we'll see how that goes.
[380.36 --> 381.48]  Anyways, back to China.
[383.40 --> 383.80]  Yeah.
[384.18 --> 386.06]  They're required to hand over encryption keys and passwords
[386.06 --> 387.30]  when requested by the government.
[387.38 --> 389.88]  So like I said, it's not like a constant thing.
[389.96 --> 391.10]  Anytime you set an encryption key,
[391.16 --> 392.68]  you don't have to constantly hand it over,
[392.78 --> 395.88]  but it's not like that's really any better.
[396.32 --> 397.74]  They're claiming that it won't damage
[397.74 --> 399.60]  people's freedom of speech or religion,
[399.60 --> 402.30]  but it's China.
[403.02 --> 405.56]  So I don't really want to get into politics.
[405.64 --> 406.92]  I think that's all I'm going to say about that.
[407.36 --> 409.26]  Government also says that it won't violate
[409.26 --> 411.84]  anyone's intellectual property rights,
[412.32 --> 415.12]  and it's going to be coming into effect January 1st.
[415.12 --> 416.12]  So you have...
[416.98 --> 418.84]  Is it January 1st in China already?
[418.84 --> 419.84]  Yeah.
[420.62 --> 422.84]  So good luck with that.
[422.94 --> 423.64]  If you're in China,
[423.78 --> 424.80]  I think that's already applied.
[425.40 --> 425.98]  So GG.
[426.90 --> 427.70]  Although if you're in China
[427.70 --> 429.02]  and you're able to watch this stream,
[429.54 --> 431.74]  and yeah, that's pretty good, I guess.
[432.82 --> 435.52]  Total Biscuit apparently tears Valve a new one,
[435.58 --> 436.44]  and I watched the video,
[436.52 --> 437.44]  and he definitely does.
[437.50 --> 438.46]  And to be completely honest,
[438.52 --> 439.68]  they kind of deserve it.
[440.32 --> 443.58]  I'm going to post the Linus Tech Tips topic for this,
[443.66 --> 445.32]  if the forum's even up right now.
[446.78 --> 448.54]  It's a little slow, but it's working.
[448.78 --> 449.92]  Oh, that's good enough.
[450.06 --> 451.16]  I'm going to post that in the chat.
[452.24 --> 455.16]  Basically, what he talks about isn't necessarily...
[456.56 --> 458.20]  He says that it's bad that it happened,
[458.20 --> 460.24]  but the main thing that he's saying
[460.24 --> 464.90]  is that it's bad how they responded to it.
[464.96 --> 466.32]  They didn't tell people very quickly.
[466.74 --> 468.10]  They didn't even respond to it,
[468.10 --> 470.08]  I think until after Total Biscuit's video,
[470.76 --> 472.30]  and a lot of people are speculating
[472.30 --> 474.22]  that that's the reason why they responded to it,
[474.26 --> 478.20]  because that was a huge PR nightmare for them.
[479.52 --> 481.12]  Anyways, on December 15th,
[481.12 --> 483.46]  Steam found that the network had malfunctioned.
[483.48 --> 484.90]  That's a weird way of saying
[484.90 --> 487.86]  that their caching started having issues.
[488.62 --> 489.82]  They used an external service,
[489.90 --> 491.66]  an external company, to manage their caching.
[492.04 --> 493.34]  It lasted for about an hour
[493.34 --> 496.62]  before Valve had to shut down Steam to fix it.
[496.62 --> 498.64]  Valve didn't release a statement
[498.64 --> 499.82]  until December 30th,
[499.82 --> 501.54]  so that happened five days later.
[501.62 --> 503.44]  Seems like in a fairly excessive amount of time.
[503.96 --> 505.56]  It was a configuration error.
[505.84 --> 507.98]  There was, I think, 2,000 times
[507.98 --> 510.54]  the average traffic on the store
[510.54 --> 511.42]  than there normally is,
[511.46 --> 512.38]  largely due to the sale,
[512.50 --> 514.02]  and also because of a DDoS,
[514.14 --> 515.56]  or a DDoS attack that hit them.
[516.02 --> 517.44]  So they tried to set up
[517.44 --> 518.88]  a different caching configuration
[518.88 --> 520.00]  to help manage that,
[520.34 --> 522.06]  and that actually helped a little bit,
[522.12 --> 522.56]  but not enough,
[522.62 --> 523.78]  so they applied another one,
[523.78 --> 525.16]  a second caching configuration.
[525.34 --> 526.48]  That one had problems,
[526.90 --> 529.78]  and basically 34,000 users were affected.
[529.92 --> 532.12]  If you didn't log in at that point in time,
[532.16 --> 532.90]  if you didn't go to the store
[532.90 --> 533.56]  at that point in time,
[533.60 --> 534.06]  you're fine.
[534.84 --> 535.68]  It wasn't you.
[536.64 --> 539.20]  The contents that were on those pages
[539.20 --> 540.44]  varied quite heavily,
[540.44 --> 542.62]  but it was some personal information,
[542.78 --> 543.52]  which is not great.
[543.86 --> 544.58]  Billing addresses,
[544.88 --> 546.52]  last four digits of phone numbers,
[547.06 --> 548.08]  purchase histories,
[548.32 --> 550.06]  last two digits of credit card numbers,
[550.06 --> 551.68]  full names,
[552.34 --> 553.74]  all of that kind of stuff.
[554.26 --> 555.12]  Valve was working with,
[555.20 --> 555.60]  like I said,
[555.62 --> 556.40]  a web caching partner
[556.40 --> 558.80]  to help mitigate stuff,
[558.86 --> 560.22]  and they're working with that same partner
[560.22 --> 562.48]  to try to identify the individual victims
[562.48 --> 565.08]  of this problem.
[565.40 --> 566.74]  One of the things was,
[566.84 --> 567.18]  as well,
[567.22 --> 567.96]  that it wasn't like
[567.96 --> 570.92]  someone found a day zero way
[570.92 --> 572.22]  to get through a problem.
[572.66 --> 574.56]  It was anyone that was using the store.
[574.78 --> 576.52]  If you navigated to another page,
[576.56 --> 578.02]  you might just randomly get dumped
[578.02 --> 579.70]  on another user's session.
[580.16 --> 580.84]  That being said,
[580.90 --> 582.58]  everything was in more or less
[582.58 --> 583.72]  a read-only mode,
[583.80 --> 585.28]  because if you tried to change anything,
[585.60 --> 586.56]  it would realize
[586.56 --> 588.08]  that you weren't in the right session,
[588.18 --> 589.06]  and then nothing would happen.
[589.26 --> 590.68]  So there were some people online
[590.68 --> 592.72]  claiming that they were white-knighting
[592.72 --> 595.46]  and deleting people's customer information
[595.46 --> 596.40]  to help protect them.
[597.32 --> 597.60]  No.
[598.18 --> 599.34]  There's absolutely no evidence
[599.34 --> 599.98]  of that happening,
[600.06 --> 601.70]  and it doesn't actually make any logical sense
[601.70 --> 602.58]  that it could have happened.
[602.94 --> 603.76]  So no,
[603.90 --> 604.82]  that wasn't a thing.
[604.82 --> 609.42]  What TotalBiscuit was trumpeting here
[609.42 --> 611.00]  was that it's a giant problem
[611.00 --> 612.42]  people being able to see
[612.42 --> 613.36]  other people's information
[613.36 --> 615.74]  because of stuff like swatting
[615.74 --> 617.26]  that has happened lately.
[617.74 --> 619.08]  And if this information
[619.08 --> 621.12]  got dumped into a big website or something,
[621.34 --> 622.66]  and someone pissed you off online,
[622.78 --> 623.74]  and you looked up their name,
[623.78 --> 624.34]  and you happen to be able
[624.34 --> 626.28]  to get all of their information,
[626.90 --> 628.18]  like their address,
[628.42 --> 629.46]  their full billing address,
[629.56 --> 630.90]  which is probably where they live,
[630.90 --> 632.82]  you would be able to swatch them,
[632.96 --> 635.42]  which is very true.
[635.82 --> 637.20]  It hurts me to talk about this
[637.20 --> 639.30]  because we had our security breach
[639.30 --> 641.48]  not even that long ago?
[641.98 --> 643.20]  Four months ago?
[643.32 --> 644.02]  Five months ago?
[644.10 --> 645.24]  Really bad with time frames.
[645.56 --> 646.56]  Maybe less than that?
[646.78 --> 647.78]  Three months ago?
[647.90 --> 648.78]  Two months ago?
[649.30 --> 650.18]  I don't know.
[650.70 --> 651.08]  Whatever.
[651.46 --> 652.58]  We had a security breach.
[652.86 --> 653.78]  It was not good.
[654.06 --> 655.94]  But in our defense,
[655.94 --> 657.76]  I think we responded quite quickly
[657.76 --> 658.60]  and quite heavily.
[658.60 --> 661.22]  We sent a PM to every single user on the forum.
[661.40 --> 662.90]  We tried to send an email
[662.90 --> 664.20]  to every single user on the forum,
[664.34 --> 666.06]  but randomly, surprisingly,
[666.24 --> 667.40]  sending out that many emails
[667.40 --> 668.46]  kind of got us detected
[668.46 --> 669.82]  by a few spam services,
[669.82 --> 671.56]  so they didn't necessarily hit everybody,
[671.64 --> 672.12]  unfortunately.
[672.76 --> 674.74]  And we put like big red banners
[674.74 --> 675.50]  all over the place
[675.50 --> 677.38]  telling people that bad things were going on.
[679.36 --> 679.84]  Yeah.
[680.14 --> 682.28]  Valve's response was less than satisfactory.
[682.74 --> 684.16]  They responded to,
[684.16 --> 687.16]  I think, Kotaku or someone,
[687.40 --> 688.36]  GameSpot or something,
[688.36 --> 689.86]  like a while afterwards
[689.86 --> 690.70]  and didn't address
[690.70 --> 691.96]  any of the individual users.
[692.42 --> 693.22]  And then finally,
[693.40 --> 694.74]  I'm going to post this in the chat,
[695.14 --> 696.70]  they posted a statement
[696.70 --> 699.72]  as a all games news update,
[700.08 --> 702.40]  which like when they're interesting,
[702.66 --> 704.96]  I find these things on like Reddit
[704.96 --> 705.70]  or the forum.
[706.40 --> 707.58]  And outside of that,
[707.76 --> 709.26]  basically never see them
[709.26 --> 710.04]  because I don't know
[710.04 --> 710.86]  why I would go there.
[711.36 --> 712.34]  So they posted this.
[712.34 --> 714.60]  It's called Update on Christmas Issues.
[714.60 --> 716.60]  And this is where they talk about
[716.60 --> 717.48]  everything that happened,
[717.60 --> 718.36]  how it happened,
[718.52 --> 719.24]  yada, yada, yada.
[721.56 --> 722.90]  It's just bad form.
[723.32 --> 724.32]  And one thing that Total Biscuit
[724.32 --> 725.18]  talks about as well
[725.18 --> 726.46]  is that
[726.46 --> 729.16]  Steam and Valve
[729.16 --> 730.26]  kind of have more or less
[730.26 --> 731.18]  of a cult following
[731.18 --> 732.34]  considering we,
[732.56 --> 733.54]  you know,
[733.70 --> 734.56]  we've talked about
[734.56 --> 736.18]  making a bronze statue of Gaben.
[736.18 --> 737.24]  I think I would have to agree
[737.24 --> 738.02]  that that is true.
[738.54 --> 740.06]  A lot of our Christmas songs
[740.06 --> 741.58]  were directly to Gaben
[741.58 --> 744.04]  because we replaced
[744.04 --> 745.78]  Deity's names with Gaben.
[746.10 --> 747.38]  So I don't know,
[747.84 --> 749.00]  might have some truth there.
[749.50 --> 750.40]  And he's saying
[750.40 --> 750.92]  that they might be
[750.92 --> 752.34]  falling out of grace lately
[752.34 --> 753.10]  with a few things
[753.10 --> 753.62]  that they've done.
[754.48 --> 755.48]  And yeah,
[755.64 --> 756.10]  I don't know,
[756.18 --> 757.06]  having literally
[757.06 --> 758.34]  one of the world's worst
[758.34 --> 759.46]  customer support systems
[759.46 --> 761.08]  for a company of this size
[761.08 --> 763.28]  and doing things like this
[763.28 --> 764.56]  is not helping them.
[766.18 --> 767.62]  It's Gabe Newell
[767.62 --> 769.02]  for like the two people
[769.02 --> 769.70]  in chat that are
[769.70 --> 770.64]  legitimately confused
[770.64 --> 771.94]  and the 18 people in chat
[771.94 --> 772.54]  that are trolls.
[774.44 --> 775.54]  Yeah, anyways,
[776.14 --> 777.00]  moving onwards.
[777.68 --> 778.58]  TP Link is apparently
[778.58 --> 779.90]  making a smartphone
[779.90 --> 781.16]  next year
[781.16 --> 782.28]  under the Nephos
[782.28 --> 784.12]  line of branding.
[786.46 --> 787.88]  Why are they going to do this?
[788.18 --> 788.66]  Personally,
[788.82 --> 789.60]  I don't really know.
[789.84 --> 790.54]  But I'll tell you
[790.54 --> 791.32]  why they think
[791.32 --> 792.08]  they're going to do this
[792.08 --> 792.56]  in a moment.
[793.18 --> 795.20]  There's the article
[795.20 --> 796.22]  right there.
[797.12 --> 798.02]  So TP Link claims
[798.02 --> 798.34]  that they hold
[798.34 --> 800.00]  42.9% market share
[800.00 --> 801.30]  on Wi-Fi products.
[801.40 --> 802.10]  That doesn't necessarily
[802.10 --> 802.74]  mean you're going to be
[802.74 --> 803.80]  good at making smartphones.
[804.60 --> 805.44]  That's not part
[805.44 --> 806.00]  of their notes.
[806.34 --> 807.22]  But that's just something
[807.22 --> 807.94]  I wanted to say.
[808.18 --> 808.54]  They're saying
[808.54 --> 809.28]  that their brand
[809.28 --> 809.72]  will offer
[809.72 --> 810.88]  a user-friendly design
[810.88 --> 811.70]  that is smart
[811.70 --> 812.74]  and simple.
[813.88 --> 814.94]  I guess they didn't
[814.94 --> 816.02]  really look into
[816.02 --> 817.24]  the Firefox OS
[817.24 --> 818.06]  line of phones
[818.06 --> 819.68]  or else they'd realize
[819.68 --> 820.10]  that that,
[820.42 --> 820.58]  one,
[820.64 --> 821.60]  isn't a new angle
[821.60 --> 822.12]  and two,
[822.34 --> 822.90]  I don't know
[822.90 --> 823.76]  if anyone's asking
[823.76 --> 824.54]  for that because
[824.54 --> 825.68]  Samsung child mode
[825.68 --> 827.02]  is actually surprisingly
[827.02 --> 827.38]  good.
[827.98 --> 828.70]  If you want an
[828.70 --> 830.64]  ultra spun-down phone,
[830.72 --> 831.56]  you can just try that,
[831.62 --> 831.98]  I guess.
[833.30 --> 833.64]  Yeah,
[833.86 --> 836.72]  I honestly don't
[836.72 --> 837.62]  understand why
[837.62 --> 838.24]  they think this is
[838.24 --> 838.74]  a good idea.
[838.86 --> 839.50]  Not only is the
[839.50 --> 840.54]  smartphone market
[840.54 --> 841.86]  right now super,
[841.98 --> 842.74]  super saturated,
[843.16 --> 844.18]  but if you've watched
[844.18 --> 845.08]  anyone that's reviewed
[845.08 --> 846.74]  smartphones lately,
[846.84 --> 847.40]  and I think Linus
[847.40 --> 848.10]  has even said this
[848.10 --> 848.48]  himself,
[848.82 --> 849.40]  there isn't a lot
[849.40 --> 849.98]  of differentiation
[849.98 --> 850.78]  between them.
[852.40 --> 853.26]  Everyone's just like,
[853.34 --> 853.50]  well,
[853.64 --> 854.64]  this is a new version
[854.64 --> 855.06]  of Android
[855.06 --> 855.94]  that'll get outdated
[855.94 --> 856.74]  as you use your phone
[856.74 --> 857.34]  because updates
[857.34 --> 858.24]  for Android are terrible.
[858.60 --> 860.46]  It has X processor
[860.46 --> 861.62]  and Y whatever
[861.62 --> 862.64]  just like the same
[862.64 --> 863.70]  as everybody else does,
[863.86 --> 864.82]  and that's about it.
[865.28 --> 865.72]  Hooray.
[866.58 --> 867.36]  So what are you
[867.36 --> 867.76]  going to do?
[867.82 --> 868.74]  Make a not as good
[868.74 --> 869.16]  smartphone?
[869.32 --> 869.78]  Is that what
[869.78 --> 871.08]  simple and easy to use
[871.08 --> 871.72]  actually means?
[871.80 --> 872.42]  Smart and simple?
[872.68 --> 873.60]  Is that a not as good
[873.60 --> 874.00]  smartphone?
[874.34 --> 874.68]  I don't know
[874.68 --> 875.30]  if anyone's asking
[875.30 --> 875.70]  for that.
[877.02 --> 877.80]  I don't know.
[877.80 --> 883.78]  I like reading
[883.78 --> 884.50]  this article.
[884.72 --> 885.46]  I actually had
[885.46 --> 886.50]  to do fact checking
[886.50 --> 887.02]  to make sure
[887.02 --> 887.76]  that it was real
[887.76 --> 889.06]  and someone wasn't
[889.06 --> 890.16]  just like trying
[890.16 --> 891.26]  to make a hype train
[891.26 --> 892.22]  thing because CES
[892.22 --> 892.96]  is coming soon
[892.96 --> 893.44]  and they're like,
[893.52 --> 894.42]  let's just make
[894.42 --> 895.08]  all the rumor
[895.08 --> 895.98]  announcements we can
[895.98 --> 897.02]  to get all the traffic
[897.02 --> 897.76]  that we can.
[898.06 --> 898.48]  But no,
[898.60 --> 900.18]  it seems to be real,
[900.36 --> 901.42]  which is weird.
[902.30 --> 902.66]  Yeah.
[902.82 --> 903.80]  They haven't commented
[903.80 --> 904.48]  on whether or not
[904.48 --> 905.18]  they'll be targeting
[905.18 --> 906.60]  budget or mid-segment
[906.60 --> 907.50]  or high-segment
[907.50 --> 908.06]  smartphones.
[909.54 --> 910.54]  I'm going to assume
[910.54 --> 911.10]  it's going to be
[911.10 --> 912.34]  budget or mid-segment
[912.34 --> 913.20]  smartphones because
[913.20 --> 913.94]  of the smart
[913.94 --> 915.32]  and simple side
[915.32 --> 915.64]  of things.
[915.74 --> 916.26]  I love that they're
[916.26 --> 916.76]  saying that they're
[916.76 --> 917.34]  going to be making
[917.34 --> 918.20]  smart smartphones.
[918.42 --> 919.06]  That's kind of funny.
[919.92 --> 921.14]  President of TP-Link
[921.14 --> 922.32]  Jeff Chow says
[922.32 --> 923.22]  that the intention
[923.22 --> 924.44]  of Nephos is
[924.44 --> 925.40]  establishing a
[925.40 --> 926.32]  seamless connection
[926.32 --> 927.42]  between people
[927.42 --> 928.60]  and devices.
[931.06 --> 932.12]  So basically,
[932.30 --> 934.08]  TP-Link Jeff Chow,
[934.28 --> 934.84]  the president,
[935.16 --> 936.18]  said literally nothing.
[937.50 --> 939.24]  So that was really
[939.24 --> 939.96]  helpful, Jeff.
[940.22 --> 941.24]  Thank you for saying
[941.24 --> 941.54]  that.
[942.18 --> 943.82]  New York is finally
[943.82 --> 944.96]  installing its
[944.96 --> 946.40]  promised public Wi-Fi.
[946.96 --> 947.50]  Apparently,
[947.60 --> 948.30]  they announced this
[948.30 --> 949.04]  in 2014,
[949.04 --> 949.88]  so I don't know
[949.88 --> 951.06]  if the finally is
[951.06 --> 952.66]  necessarily really
[952.66 --> 953.28]  needed there
[953.28 --> 954.96]  because it's going
[954.96 --> 955.82]  to be two years
[955.82 --> 957.40]  in a few hours
[957.40 --> 958.16]  if you live where
[958.16 --> 958.54]  I live.
[959.08 --> 959.60]  And that's not
[959.60 --> 960.66]  that bad for
[960.66 --> 962.50]  establishing massive
[962.50 --> 963.54]  Wi-Fi across an
[963.54 --> 964.92]  entire massive city
[964.92 --> 965.60]  like New York.
[966.46 --> 966.86]  Apparently,
[967.00 --> 967.70]  they're going to be
[967.70 --> 968.74]  oh, did I share this?
[968.84 --> 969.84]  I think I shared this.
[970.50 --> 971.24]  I'm going to try
[971.24 --> 971.88]  to share this.
[972.44 --> 973.52]  I did not share this.
[973.62 --> 974.30]  I will share the
[974.30 --> 975.02]  thingy in the
[975.02 --> 976.30]  chat thingy
[976.30 --> 977.62]  in a second thingy.
[977.62 --> 978.64]  It's from The Verge,
[978.78 --> 980.28]  so that's cool.
[981.40 --> 981.86]  I guess,
[982.08 --> 982.94]  if you like The Verge.
[983.08 --> 983.92]  The Verge is pretty cool.
[983.92 --> 988.26]  I should have had
[988.26 --> 989.06]  a mouse for this,
[989.28 --> 989.88]  but I didn't.
[990.20 --> 990.94]  That's probably fine.
[991.78 --> 992.16]  So,
[992.74 --> 993.94]  they have to establish
[993.94 --> 995.24]  7,500 hubs
[995.24 --> 996.04]  throughout the city.
[996.94 --> 998.34]  On December 28th,
[998.34 --> 999.06]  workers began
[999.06 --> 999.92]  installing the first
[999.92 --> 1001.60]  Link NYC access points.
[1001.70 --> 1002.40]  The idea here
[1002.40 --> 1003.06]  is replacing
[1003.06 --> 1004.48]  telephone booths
[1004.48 --> 1005.16]  with these things.
[1005.26 --> 1006.02]  They have giant
[1006.02 --> 1007.82]  ad screens on the side.
[1007.92 --> 1008.24]  What side?
[1008.30 --> 1009.32]  Like 55-inch
[1009.32 --> 1009.96]  ad screens.
[1010.30 --> 1010.94]  That note has
[1010.94 --> 1011.82]  apparently been taken
[1011.82 --> 1012.62]  out of the dock.
[1012.62 --> 1013.52]  It was here at one
[1013.52 --> 1014.10]  point in time.
[1014.22 --> 1014.76]  I don't know why.
[1014.84 --> 1015.26]  There it is.
[1015.30 --> 1015.64]  Never mind.
[1015.70 --> 1016.14]  I'm lying.
[1016.24 --> 1016.74]  Sorry, Colton.
[1017.24 --> 1018.14]  Hubs will include
[1018.14 --> 1019.12]  USB charging ports,
[1019.46 --> 1020.48]  touchscreen web browsing,
[1020.62 --> 1021.18]  which how long
[1021.18 --> 1022.14]  is that going to work for,
[1022.38 --> 1024.18]  and two 55-inch
[1024.18 --> 1024.94]  ad displays.
[1025.24 --> 1025.98]  The city is estimating
[1025.98 --> 1026.56]  that they will make
[1026.56 --> 1027.96]  $500 million
[1027.96 --> 1029.56]  in revenue
[1029.56 --> 1030.90]  over the
[1030.90 --> 1032.28]  next 12 years.
[1032.82 --> 1033.00]  So,
[1033.46 --> 1035.16]  that's pretty significant,
[1035.30 --> 1036.02]  although I'm sure
[1036.02 --> 1037.20]  it will cost a fair amount
[1037.20 --> 1038.16]  to get gigabit
[1038.16 --> 1038.86]  Wi-Fi,
[1038.98 --> 1039.44]  which is what they're
[1039.44 --> 1039.76]  claiming,
[1040.10 --> 1040.58]  basically,
[1041.04 --> 1041.72]  all over the place.
[1041.72 --> 1042.36]  There's been some
[1042.36 --> 1042.90]  controversy.
[1043.20 --> 1043.98]  This part was taken
[1043.98 --> 1044.40]  out of the dock,
[1044.50 --> 1045.66]  but I requested
[1045.66 --> 1046.20]  for part of it
[1046.20 --> 1046.70]  to be taken out,
[1046.76 --> 1047.24]  so I understand
[1047.24 --> 1047.84]  why it happened.
[1048.16 --> 1048.84]  There's been some
[1048.84 --> 1049.62]  controversy that
[1049.62 --> 1052.48]  smaller bourbon,
[1052.62 --> 1053.28]  I think is what they
[1053.28 --> 1053.60]  call it.
[1053.96 --> 1054.36]  Suburban?
[1054.52 --> 1054.76]  Bourbon?
[1054.88 --> 1055.16]  I don't know.
[1055.24 --> 1056.24]  Smaller bourbon areas
[1056.24 --> 1057.12]  are not getting
[1057.12 --> 1058.10]  the reported speeds
[1058.10 --> 1058.86]  that they were promised.
[1059.18 --> 1060.02]  That sucks.
[1061.58 --> 1062.36]  I'm sorry,
[1062.52 --> 1063.74]  while you pat your tears
[1063.74 --> 1064.38]  with your free
[1064.38 --> 1065.26]  public Wi-Fi,
[1065.46 --> 1066.14]  that it's not quite
[1066.14 --> 1067.26]  as fast as they promised.
[1067.26 --> 1068.80]  I would definitely
[1068.80 --> 1069.76]  complain if I lived
[1069.76 --> 1070.28]  in New York,
[1070.38 --> 1071.52]  but I don't really
[1071.52 --> 1072.54]  feel that bad for you
[1072.54 --> 1073.84]  when I live out here,
[1074.48 --> 1075.32]  and that's never
[1075.32 --> 1075.96]  going to be a thing.
[1076.74 --> 1077.08]  Anyways,
[1077.34 --> 1078.18]  I think it's pretty cool.
[1078.26 --> 1078.84]  I'm happy that they
[1078.84 --> 1079.84]  found a way to profit
[1079.84 --> 1080.26]  off of it,
[1080.32 --> 1081.36]  because if I was someone
[1081.36 --> 1082.24]  who lived in that city,
[1082.24 --> 1083.00]  I wouldn't want this
[1083.00 --> 1083.82]  to just necessarily
[1083.82 --> 1085.00]  be a giant financial
[1085.00 --> 1085.90]  burden on the city,
[1086.06 --> 1087.42]  and having two 55-inch
[1087.42 --> 1088.44]  advertisement displays,
[1088.96 --> 1089.80]  while you might not
[1089.80 --> 1090.44]  like advertisements
[1090.44 --> 1091.00]  in your city,
[1091.10 --> 1091.84]  you live in New York,
[1091.92 --> 1092.32]  they're probably
[1092.32 --> 1093.06]  everywhere anyways,
[1093.06 --> 1093.76]  so I don't really
[1093.76 --> 1094.14]  think it's that
[1094.14 --> 1094.56]  big of a deal.
[1096.04 --> 1096.80]  Google is trying
[1096.80 --> 1098.12]  to ditch passwords.
[1098.40 --> 1099.96]  This is kind of
[1099.96 --> 1100.96]  super weird
[1100.96 --> 1102.20]  and also interesting.
[1102.44 --> 1102.96]  I'm going to post that
[1102.96 --> 1103.88]  in the chat for a second
[1103.88 --> 1104.94]  and maybe actually
[1104.94 --> 1105.64]  show this one up
[1105.64 --> 1106.12]  on the screen,
[1106.46 --> 1108.44]  although keeping
[1108.44 --> 1109.38]  a trend going
[1109.38 --> 1110.68]  might not be a bad idea,
[1110.76 --> 1111.24]  so I could just
[1111.24 --> 1112.02]  have you guys stare
[1112.02 --> 1112.56]  at my face
[1112.56 --> 1113.52]  while I look at the screen
[1113.52 --> 1114.12]  down below me
[1114.12 --> 1114.78]  this whole time.
[1115.12 --> 1115.60]  It sounds like
[1115.60 --> 1116.28]  a great idea.
[1117.20 --> 1117.56]  Basically,
[1117.78 --> 1118.40]  what they're planning
[1118.40 --> 1120.22]  on doing is using
[1120.22 --> 1122.04]  your smartphone
[1122.04 --> 1125.28]  as your login device.
[1125.40 --> 1125.86]  A lot of people
[1125.86 --> 1126.46]  are using
[1126.46 --> 1127.82]  the Google Authenticator
[1127.82 --> 1128.26]  already,
[1129.28 --> 1130.22]  but what this will do
[1130.22 --> 1130.90]  is make it so that
[1130.90 --> 1131.88]  say you want to log
[1131.88 --> 1133.78]  into your email
[1133.78 --> 1134.78]  on a laptop.
[1135.22 --> 1135.78]  You would type
[1135.78 --> 1136.48]  in your email,
[1136.62 --> 1137.60]  attempt to log in,
[1137.86 --> 1138.80]  then it would push
[1138.80 --> 1139.38]  a notification
[1139.38 --> 1140.42]  to your phone.
[1140.82 --> 1141.40]  You would pull
[1141.40 --> 1142.46]  that notification down,
[1142.60 --> 1143.64]  press the yes button,
[1144.04 --> 1145.46]  possibly select a number,
[1145.88 --> 1146.58]  and then it would
[1146.58 --> 1147.38]  log you in
[1147.38 --> 1148.32]  on the desktop.
[1149.26 --> 1149.64]  Actually,
[1149.76 --> 1150.40]  kind of interesting.
[1150.76 --> 1151.90]  No need for passwords
[1151.90 --> 1152.32]  anymore.
[1152.50 --> 1153.24]  The idea is actually
[1153.24 --> 1154.18]  removing passwords,
[1154.58 --> 1155.58]  and then your password
[1155.58 --> 1156.48]  would more be
[1156.48 --> 1157.38]  a fallback.
[1157.66 --> 1158.64]  So if, say,
[1158.74 --> 1159.96]  someone stole your phone,
[1160.26 --> 1161.56]  you could use your password
[1161.56 --> 1163.28]  to remove your phone
[1163.28 --> 1164.58]  as a login device,
[1164.82 --> 1166.20]  which is actually
[1166.20 --> 1166.96]  kind of interesting.
[1167.42 --> 1168.40]  There isn't a ton
[1168.40 --> 1169.48]  of information out
[1169.48 --> 1169.92]  right now
[1169.92 --> 1171.54]  as to how it works,
[1171.66 --> 1172.90]  exactly what it's doing,
[1173.32 --> 1174.30]  any of that kind of stuff.
[1174.38 --> 1175.90]  I'm going to try to find...
[1175.90 --> 1177.40]  Did you not put it in here?
[1177.64 --> 1178.52]  Oh, I think you did.
[1179.30 --> 1179.74]  Awesome.
[1180.16 --> 1180.82]  Yay, Colton.
[1181.26 --> 1182.16]  Thank you, Colton.
[1183.12 --> 1184.82]  So once this loads...
[1184.82 --> 1185.76]  Okay, so this is
[1185.76 --> 1186.78]  what you would see.
[1187.64 --> 1188.34]  So you see
[1188.34 --> 1189.60]  your Google sign-in page.
[1190.26 --> 1191.14]  I don't know why
[1191.14 --> 1192.72]  he put his email in here
[1192.72 --> 1193.54]  where it's easy to see.
[1193.62 --> 1193.88]  For everyone,
[1193.96 --> 1195.14]  this is not Colton's email,
[1195.70 --> 1197.18]  but anyways,
[1197.30 --> 1197.76]  that's fine.
[1198.00 --> 1198.74]  So you go to log in,
[1198.80 --> 1199.50]  but as you can see,
[1199.56 --> 1200.58]  there's no password field.
[1200.66 --> 1201.52]  You just click next.
[1201.92 --> 1202.74]  It tells you to check
[1202.74 --> 1203.40]  your phone,
[1203.70 --> 1204.22]  tap yes,
[1204.22 --> 1205.18]  and then tap 21
[1205.18 --> 1206.40]  on your phone to log in.
[1206.48 --> 1206.96]  So I'm assuming
[1206.96 --> 1208.72]  it will have a yes button,
[1208.84 --> 1209.50]  which you press
[1209.50 --> 1210.66]  in your notification tray.
[1211.06 --> 1211.76]  And then I'm assuming
[1211.76 --> 1212.38]  that it will give you
[1212.38 --> 1213.30]  a grid of numbers
[1213.30 --> 1214.52]  and you then select
[1214.52 --> 1215.22]  the correct one
[1215.22 --> 1216.00]  and it lets you log in
[1216.00 --> 1216.52]  in your desktop.
[1218.18 --> 1219.30]  This is the trying
[1219.30 --> 1220.80]  to sign in notification
[1220.80 --> 1221.52]  that you would see
[1221.52 --> 1222.12]  on your phone.
[1223.62 --> 1224.74]  Here's the yes button
[1224.74 --> 1225.96]  for signing in
[1225.96 --> 1226.52]  on another computer.
[1227.40 --> 1228.16]  Oh, there we go.
[1228.40 --> 1229.16]  I hadn't actually seen
[1229.16 --> 1229.60]  these before.
[1229.60 --> 1230.18]  He showed me these
[1230.18 --> 1231.26]  right before I went live.
[1231.26 --> 1232.10]  So what number
[1232.10 --> 1232.92]  do you see on your screen?
[1233.14 --> 1234.50]  It's asked for 21.
[1234.72 --> 1236.08]  So you press 21
[1236.08 --> 1237.34]  and then boom,
[1237.62 --> 1238.20]  you're logged in.
[1238.62 --> 1239.18]  I actually think
[1239.18 --> 1239.80]  it's pretty neat.
[1240.36 --> 1241.24]  Right now,
[1241.38 --> 1242.26]  I'm just using
[1242.26 --> 1243.62]  crazy ridiculous passwords
[1243.62 --> 1244.44]  for all my things
[1244.44 --> 1246.26]  that I can't remember anyways
[1246.26 --> 1247.60]  and I have a password manager
[1247.60 --> 1248.42]  remember them.
[1248.90 --> 1251.74]  So this seems fine,
[1252.06 --> 1253.42]  actually, for me.
[1253.64 --> 1254.62]  I like the idea
[1254.62 --> 1256.02]  of having that fallback password
[1256.02 --> 1256.78]  that they were talking about
[1256.78 --> 1257.56]  where you can quickly
[1257.56 --> 1258.84]  remove the ability
[1258.84 --> 1259.60]  to do this
[1259.60 --> 1262.16]  from whatever phone
[1262.16 --> 1263.46]  you may or may not have lost
[1263.46 --> 1264.84]  because that is extremely important.
[1265.00 --> 1266.28]  Having something set up
[1266.28 --> 1267.34]  so that you can remove
[1267.34 --> 1268.78]  the easy to log in things
[1268.78 --> 1269.50]  that are out there
[1269.50 --> 1270.46]  that should be secured
[1270.46 --> 1271.10]  because they should be
[1271.10 --> 1272.30]  on your person all the time
[1272.30 --> 1273.68]  is a very good idea.
[1273.96 --> 1274.68]  The only thing
[1274.68 --> 1275.64]  that worries me here
[1275.64 --> 1278.08]  is if you're, say,
[1278.14 --> 1278.80]  in a foreign country
[1278.80 --> 1279.82]  and you lose your phone
[1279.82 --> 1280.56]  while you're out
[1280.56 --> 1281.22]  and about somewhere
[1281.22 --> 1282.06]  and can't get back
[1282.06 --> 1283.06]  to a computer very quickly
[1283.06 --> 1283.62]  and someone's able
[1283.62 --> 1284.76]  to steal all your stuff
[1284.76 --> 1285.64]  quickly,
[1286.30 --> 1287.14]  that kind of sucks.
[1287.26 --> 1287.94]  But at the same time,
[1287.94 --> 1288.58]  you should have security
[1288.58 --> 1289.04]  on your phone
[1289.04 --> 1289.64]  in some degree,
[1289.72 --> 1290.78]  whether that's a passcode
[1290.78 --> 1291.42]  or a fingerprint
[1291.42 --> 1291.92]  or whatever,
[1292.08 --> 1292.94]  preferably a fingerprint.
[1293.14 --> 1293.56]  Those have been
[1293.56 --> 1294.70]  pretty badass lately.
[1298.38 --> 1299.36]  This is a little bit
[1299.36 --> 1300.46]  of a controversial topic,
[1300.72 --> 1301.44]  so I'm going to have
[1301.44 --> 1303.24]  to two-step this one
[1303.24 --> 1303.72]  and make sure
[1303.72 --> 1304.92]  that I don't do it horribly
[1304.92 --> 1306.16]  so that literally
[1306.16 --> 1307.20]  everyone in Twitch chat
[1307.20 --> 1309.34]  tries to stab me
[1309.34 --> 1310.42]  or doesn't try to stab me.
[1310.58 --> 1311.20]  So give me a moment.
[1311.76 --> 1312.64]  Dumped that in chat.
[1313.04 --> 1314.00]  I'm now going to give you guys
[1314.00 --> 1315.52]  the controversial title.
[1317.26 --> 1318.56]  To handle VR graphics,
[1318.68 --> 1320.00]  gaming PCs have to be
[1320.00 --> 1321.34]  seven times more powerful.
[1321.64 --> 1322.38]  Okay, that's not
[1322.38 --> 1323.30]  a controversial title
[1323.30 --> 1324.16]  at all.
[1324.32 --> 1325.30]  Let me jump back here
[1325.30 --> 1326.66]  and read the controversial title
[1326.66 --> 1327.34]  that's in the top,
[1327.52 --> 1328.42]  the doc.
[1328.72 --> 1330.10]  NVIDIA says GameWorks VR
[1330.10 --> 1331.26]  will help adoption.
[1331.98 --> 1333.78]  Expects 25 million PC gamers
[1333.78 --> 1334.82]  to adopt VR.
[1335.50 --> 1336.98]  And jumping back
[1336.98 --> 1337.54]  to the article.
[1338.68 --> 1341.74]  Okay, so NVIDIA GameWorks VR
[1341.74 --> 1343.36]  does have some really cool
[1343.36 --> 1344.28]  technologies in it,
[1344.60 --> 1346.00]  but as everyone
[1346.00 --> 1347.04]  in the tech space
[1347.04 --> 1348.50]  has probably known
[1348.50 --> 1349.50]  for a long time now,
[1350.12 --> 1351.18]  NVIDIA GameWorks
[1351.18 --> 1352.72]  is not the easiest thing
[1352.72 --> 1354.42]  for AMD to work with ever.
[1355.04 --> 1355.86]  There's arguments
[1355.86 --> 1357.20]  that go on both sides.
[1357.78 --> 1359.34]  There is people looking
[1359.34 --> 1360.06]  at Tomb Raider
[1360.06 --> 1361.06]  and showing TressFX,
[1361.24 --> 1361.88]  which was open,
[1362.10 --> 1362.86]  and NVIDIA's performance
[1362.86 --> 1363.74]  being a little bit lower,
[1363.86 --> 1364.34]  and then they were able
[1364.34 --> 1365.50]  to patch up and fix it.
[1365.74 --> 1366.34]  And then they're showing
[1366.34 --> 1367.10]  GameWorks titles
[1367.10 --> 1369.94]  where AMD was doing fine
[1369.94 --> 1370.88]  compared to NVIDIA,
[1370.88 --> 1371.66]  but then GameWorks
[1371.66 --> 1372.70]  gets added last minute
[1372.70 --> 1374.10]  and then AMD doesn't do as well.
[1374.64 --> 1375.16]  Blah, blah, blah.
[1376.00 --> 1377.04]  I think it's a little bit
[1377.04 --> 1379.12]  strong-fisted to say
[1379.12 --> 1380.84]  that GameWorks VR
[1380.84 --> 1383.44]  will help overall adoption.
[1384.66 --> 1386.80]  I like some ideas behind it,
[1386.90 --> 1387.94]  like being able to make
[1387.94 --> 1389.52]  VR games more efficient
[1389.52 --> 1390.36]  and run better
[1390.36 --> 1391.00]  and all this kind of stuff.
[1391.10 --> 1392.64]  Those are good ideas.
[1393.20 --> 1394.54]  But if you're trying
[1394.54 --> 1396.22]  to help overall adoption
[1396.22 --> 1397.92]  and closing off
[1397.92 --> 1398.98]  performance windows
[1398.98 --> 1401.38]  to part of the potential audience,
[1401.60 --> 1403.60]  that might not end up
[1403.60 --> 1404.40]  helping adoption.
[1404.84 --> 1405.28]  I don't know why
[1405.28 --> 1406.36]  Taryn is standing behind it.
[1406.40 --> 1407.38]  You can just join me, Taryn.
[1407.50 --> 1408.00]  What are you doing?
[1408.36 --> 1409.16]  This is WAN Show.
[1409.44 --> 1409.58]  Yeah.
[1410.30 --> 1411.02]  Is this live?
[1411.18 --> 1411.36]  Yeah.
[1413.44 --> 1414.50]  But it's not Friday.
[1414.68 --> 1414.90]  Wait.
[1415.56 --> 1416.24]  This is like,
[1416.38 --> 1417.04]  no, because
[1417.04 --> 1418.36]  tomorrow's New Year's.
[1418.84 --> 1419.92]  Are you coming into work
[1419.92 --> 1420.38]  tomorrow, Taryn?
[1420.62 --> 1421.06]  Yes.
[1421.22 --> 1421.84]  Are you?
[1422.08 --> 1422.44]  Yes.
[1422.52 --> 1423.02]  You are too?
[1423.52 --> 1423.88]  Yes.
[1424.76 --> 1425.86]  All three of us.
[1425.96 --> 1426.68]  Why didn't we just do
[1426.68 --> 1427.36]  the WAN Show tomorrow
[1427.36 --> 1428.22]  if you're all going to be here?
[1428.60 --> 1429.82]  Because I'm going to be doing this.
[1430.14 --> 1430.64]  All day?
[1431.02 --> 1431.34]  Wait.
[1431.34 --> 1431.80]  I have another one.
[1431.94 --> 1432.36]  You're not...
[1432.36 --> 1432.58]  What?
[1432.76 --> 1433.30]  Oh, wow.
[1433.42 --> 1434.38]  What do you mean you have another one?
[1434.44 --> 1435.70]  You mean your personal build, Reg?
[1435.90 --> 1436.90]  There's two builds.
[1437.02 --> 1438.70]  I thought that was the last build.
[1438.80 --> 1439.82]  Do I have to edit both of them?
[1439.96 --> 1440.80]  I don't know yet.
[1440.94 --> 1441.78]  I'm working on it.
[1441.96 --> 1442.82]  Oh, no.
[1443.34 --> 1444.80]  I've been editing all day.
[1445.80 --> 1446.64]  Every day.
[1446.72 --> 1446.88]  Forever.
[1446.88 --> 1447.50]  Is this your, like,
[1447.80 --> 1449.02]  need to walk around and break
[1449.02 --> 1449.96]  because you're going crazy?
[1450.42 --> 1450.76]  Yes.
[1451.06 --> 1451.36]  Okay.
[1452.02 --> 1452.96]  You can just take that.
[1453.58 --> 1454.56]  I can be yours now.
[1454.74 --> 1456.08]  Oh, but you're putting it on you.
[1456.66 --> 1460.36]  So what are we talking about here?
[1460.40 --> 1462.02]  We're talking about GamesWorks VR
[1462.02 --> 1464.74]  and VR market adoption
[1464.74 --> 1467.20]  and how NVIDIA thinks that their platform
[1467.20 --> 1468.96]  will help overall adoption
[1468.96 --> 1471.08]  up to 25 million users.
[1471.38 --> 1472.72]  They don't actually give a date
[1472.72 --> 1474.98]  at which time there will be
[1474.98 --> 1476.32]  25 million VR users.
[1476.68 --> 1478.50]  So that could be 2050
[1478.50 --> 1479.78]  for all we know.
[1479.78 --> 1481.18]  What's their VR?
[1481.32 --> 1482.04]  Have we seen it yet?
[1482.08 --> 1483.32]  Is that the Oculus?
[1484.40 --> 1485.32]  NVIDIA are the guys
[1485.32 --> 1486.58]  that make the graphics cards.
[1486.92 --> 1487.94]  Oh, well, okay, okay, okay.
[1488.00 --> 1489.02]  But they don't have their own.
[1489.14 --> 1489.32]  No.
[1489.58 --> 1489.84]  Okay.
[1490.08 --> 1490.80]  I was like, whoa,
[1490.86 --> 1491.80]  is there something I haven't heard of?
[1491.80 --> 1491.90]  No.
[1491.90 --> 1492.94]  Okay, so GameWorks VR
[1492.94 --> 1495.62]  is like a software platform
[1495.62 --> 1499.30]  that can help developers of games for VR
[1499.30 --> 1501.72]  to make their games run better
[1501.72 --> 1503.36]  on basically NVIDIA cards.
[1503.80 --> 1507.76]  And part of it is like VR SLI,
[1508.06 --> 1510.10]  which is being able to run two graphics cards
[1510.10 --> 1511.70]  and have one of them render for one eye
[1511.70 --> 1512.84]  and one of them render for the other eye.
[1512.84 --> 1514.00]  Now that makes a lot of sense.
[1514.10 --> 1514.32]  Yeah.
[1514.60 --> 1516.64]  Because 3D can be pretty brutal.
[1517.14 --> 1519.12]  I'm super down with VR SLI.
[1519.22 --> 1520.78]  The whole GameWorks VR thing
[1520.78 --> 1521.68]  does sketch me out
[1521.68 --> 1524.20]  because I want VR to work
[1524.20 --> 1525.46]  more than I want
[1525.46 --> 1528.06]  the fact that my computer
[1528.06 --> 1529.24]  has NVIDIA graphics cards
[1529.24 --> 1530.28]  to run it slightly better.
[1530.84 --> 1531.18]  Right.
[1531.18 --> 1534.54]  So I don't know.
[1534.64 --> 1535.44]  I also don't like it
[1535.44 --> 1536.14]  when people are like,
[1536.26 --> 1537.76]  there will be this many users
[1537.76 --> 1538.64]  of this platform.
[1538.76 --> 1540.06]  We will help it get to that.
[1540.20 --> 1541.00]  And it's like, okay,
[1541.36 --> 1542.94]  by when exactly?
[1543.62 --> 1546.50]  I was at a conference, VRX,
[1546.58 --> 1547.36]  not that long ago.
[1547.46 --> 1548.82]  Some people saw my stupid vlog.
[1548.82 --> 1549.14]  I saw it.
[1549.14 --> 1550.34]  Thank you, Taryn.
[1551.70 --> 1552.94]  And there was quite a few
[1552.94 --> 1553.70]  interesting speakers.
[1553.88 --> 1555.64]  One of them went up on stage
[1555.64 --> 1556.66]  and fully admitted
[1556.66 --> 1558.66]  that he basically knew nothing about VR,
[1558.86 --> 1561.04]  which was a really interesting way
[1561.04 --> 1562.54]  to start your talk.
[1562.78 --> 1564.06]  But then after that,
[1564.44 --> 1565.36]  talked about how he was
[1565.36 --> 1566.46]  a financial analyst
[1566.46 --> 1567.70]  and has done a lot of stuff
[1567.70 --> 1568.56]  behind smartphones
[1568.56 --> 1570.10]  and 3D TVs
[1570.10 --> 1571.60]  and all of these
[1571.60 --> 1572.42]  other different kind of things,
[1572.52 --> 1573.80]  which he also doesn't really
[1573.80 --> 1574.52]  know a lot about,
[1574.78 --> 1575.82]  but knows a lot about
[1575.82 --> 1576.72]  how much people
[1576.72 --> 1577.86]  are going to invest into it,
[1577.90 --> 1578.74]  how long it's going to take
[1578.74 --> 1579.60]  for people to adopt
[1579.60 --> 1580.78]  these emerging technologies,
[1581.26 --> 1582.40]  barrier to entry,
[1582.54 --> 1583.52]  all this different kind of stuff.
[1584.06 --> 1585.70]  And he gave a whole bunch
[1585.70 --> 1587.30]  of different stats and ideas
[1587.30 --> 1588.40]  and possibilities
[1588.40 --> 1590.48]  as to the trending growth of VR.
[1591.04 --> 1592.18]  And it was interesting
[1592.18 --> 1593.48]  coming from the PC space,
[1593.56 --> 1594.66]  hearing everyone talk
[1594.66 --> 1596.64]  about the Oculus Rift
[1596.64 --> 1598.02]  and hearing him go,
[1598.62 --> 1599.88]  that doesn't matter as much
[1599.88 --> 1600.64]  in terms of overall
[1600.64 --> 1601.34]  market adoption
[1601.34 --> 1603.08]  because stuff like the Gear VR
[1603.08 --> 1604.38]  is going to be given away
[1604.38 --> 1605.84]  for free like crazy
[1605.84 --> 1606.96]  and then more people
[1606.96 --> 1607.86]  will be using that.
[1607.98 --> 1608.62]  Wait, Gear VR
[1608.62 --> 1609.62]  is being given away for free?
[1609.84 --> 1610.28]  What is that?
[1610.30 --> 1611.50]  He speculated that
[1611.50 --> 1612.38]  and then yes,
[1612.50 --> 1613.38]  that is starting to happen.
[1613.64 --> 1615.04]  Why is it being given away for free?
[1615.12 --> 1616.06]  When people buy a phone,
[1616.14 --> 1617.48]  they're getting the Gear VR with it,
[1617.48 --> 1619.00]  which is exactly
[1619.00 --> 1619.92]  what he said would happen.
[1620.46 --> 1621.14]  Smart dude.
[1621.30 --> 1621.74]  Interesting.
[1622.20 --> 1623.34]  Didn't know anything about VR.
[1623.46 --> 1625.16]  Here's the question for Luke.
[1625.82 --> 1626.92]  Can VR be used
[1626.92 --> 1628.60]  for anything other than gaming?
[1629.00 --> 1629.80]  Yeah, for sure.
[1629.94 --> 1631.20]  Like what kinds of things
[1631.20 --> 1632.04]  would it be most useful?
[1632.44 --> 1633.80]  There's already been people
[1633.80 --> 1636.08]  speculating on VR movies.
[1636.64 --> 1637.34]  Have you read Dune?
[1637.76 --> 1639.10]  I have not read Dune.
[1639.18 --> 1639.98]  I should read Dune.
[1639.98 --> 1640.62]  Okay, well,
[1640.70 --> 1642.08]  I'm not going to spoil anything in Dune.
[1642.74 --> 1643.88]  If you've seen the front cover,
[1643.98 --> 1644.72]  you know this much.
[1645.46 --> 1646.18]  There's sand.
[1646.94 --> 1648.18]  A lot of it has to do with sand.
[1649.44 --> 1650.58]  And they made a movie.
[1650.70 --> 1651.04]  Yeah, okay.
[1651.14 --> 1651.88]  Did you like the movie?
[1652.02 --> 1652.68]  I thought it was okay.
[1652.80 --> 1653.96]  Most people didn't like the movie.
[1654.02 --> 1654.26]  Oh, yeah?
[1655.34 --> 1656.44]  Because they've read the book?
[1656.66 --> 1657.56]  I don't know.
[1657.60 --> 1657.96]  I'm not sure.
[1658.04 --> 1659.06]  I haven't seen the movie.
[1659.20 --> 1659.30]  I thought the movie was fine.
[1659.32 --> 1660.12]  I've only read the book.
[1660.14 --> 1660.44]  It was fine.
[1661.26 --> 1661.96]  Okay, well,
[1662.08 --> 1663.18]  one thing that I've thought of
[1663.18 --> 1665.06]  is when a lot of people
[1665.06 --> 1665.70]  are saying porn.
[1665.84 --> 1666.06]  Yep.
[1666.86 --> 1667.62]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[1667.78 --> 1668.62]  That makes sense.
[1668.62 --> 1669.58]  Yep, the porn industry
[1669.58 --> 1670.82]  is super behind this.
[1671.14 --> 1672.24]  They're already making, like,
[1672.32 --> 1673.72]  devices to make it more fun.
[1673.78 --> 1673.98]  Right.
[1674.08 --> 1674.84]  They're behind it.
[1674.90 --> 1675.92]  They're on top of it.
[1676.00 --> 1676.78]  They're all over it.
[1676.78 --> 1678.02]  They're between two of them.
[1678.04 --> 1678.68]  They're spraying over it.
[1678.68 --> 1679.64]  Linus, why don't you just
[1679.64 --> 1680.76]  join the WAN show
[1680.76 --> 1681.42]  if you're going to have
[1681.42 --> 1683.00]  some comments from over there.
[1683.10 --> 1683.58]  He's work.
[1683.68 --> 1684.08]  I know.
[1684.18 --> 1684.96]  On other things.
[1685.66 --> 1686.00]  Anyways,
[1686.30 --> 1687.62]  yeah, so,
[1687.86 --> 1688.60]  that's one of them.
[1688.74 --> 1689.94]  I think Dune would make
[1689.94 --> 1690.90]  a better VR movie
[1690.90 --> 1691.34]  than it would make
[1691.34 --> 1692.02]  a normal movie.
[1692.06 --> 1692.48]  Oh, yeah.
[1692.58 --> 1693.38]  Because a big problem
[1693.38 --> 1694.42]  that I see with Dune
[1694.42 --> 1695.48]  is that the landscape
[1695.48 --> 1695.92]  is probably going to be
[1695.92 --> 1696.36]  super boring.
[1696.36 --> 1697.36]  It's just...
[1697.36 --> 1698.60]  lots of sand.
[1698.74 --> 1699.34]  Lots of dunes.
[1699.40 --> 1700.18]  And it's lots of sand
[1700.18 --> 1700.88]  and people wearing
[1700.88 --> 1702.24]  full suits that cover themselves.
[1703.08 --> 1703.84]  So you can't really, like,
[1703.88 --> 1704.26]  see them.
[1704.40 --> 1705.34]  And that sounds super boring.
[1705.44 --> 1706.48]  But if you put someone, like,
[1706.90 --> 1707.80]  in one of those suits
[1707.80 --> 1708.62]  so it feels slightly
[1708.62 --> 1709.38]  claustrophobic
[1709.38 --> 1710.96]  and they're actually
[1710.96 --> 1712.04]  surrounded in every way
[1712.04 --> 1712.98]  that they look by sand,
[1713.08 --> 1713.90]  they might understand
[1713.90 --> 1714.70]  the, like,
[1714.80 --> 1716.86]  helplessness idea of it
[1716.86 --> 1717.46]  and all that kind of stuff.
[1717.48 --> 1717.70]  I can get that.
[1717.78 --> 1718.18]  But of course,
[1718.22 --> 1719.52]  you can't really walk around
[1719.52 --> 1720.94]  unless you're on a
[1720.94 --> 1722.36]  XTD treadmill.
[1722.68 --> 1723.76]  Or something else
[1723.76 --> 1724.58]  that they might potentially
[1724.58 --> 1725.28]  invent in the future.
[1725.46 --> 1726.18]  But yeah, right now,
[1726.26 --> 1727.24]  like an Omni or something.
[1727.58 --> 1728.60]  Yeah, but we'll see.
[1728.80 --> 1729.46]  But VR movies
[1729.46 --> 1730.14]  is one of them.
[1730.28 --> 1730.46]  Yeah.
[1731.34 --> 1732.84]  There's exploration experiences.
[1733.18 --> 1733.86]  So golf courses
[1733.86 --> 1734.88]  are already trying to do this.
[1734.92 --> 1736.18]  Oh boy, golf course.
[1736.18 --> 1736.90]  So you can walk
[1736.90 --> 1737.54]  the golf course.
[1737.54 --> 1737.98]  In 3D.
[1738.12 --> 1739.58]  What I'm more interested in is,
[1739.64 --> 1740.32]  this is going to sound
[1740.32 --> 1740.96]  a little bit grim,
[1741.32 --> 1742.70]  but, like,
[1743.34 --> 1745.54]  deathbed bucket list experiences.
[1746.90 --> 1747.86]  So if you're, like,
[1747.94 --> 1749.36]  on your way out
[1749.36 --> 1750.20]  and you're like,
[1750.24 --> 1751.00]  I still got some things
[1751.00 --> 1751.78]  on my bucket list.
[1751.98 --> 1753.14]  I want to skydive.
[1753.24 --> 1754.42]  I want to view the pyramids
[1754.42 --> 1755.42]  and I want to see the Coliseum.
[1756.82 --> 1758.02]  There can be, like,
[1758.06 --> 1758.80]  VR setups.
[1759.20 --> 1760.16]  Let's say you want to skydive.
[1760.22 --> 1760.60]  They set, like,
[1760.60 --> 1761.66]  a fan up above you
[1761.66 --> 1762.78]  and put you in a VR setup.
[1762.78 --> 1763.14]  You know,
[1763.26 --> 1764.38]  Sword Art Online
[1764.38 --> 1765.94]  touched on a lot of that.
[1766.04 --> 1766.88]  A big thing with
[1766.88 --> 1767.38]  Sword Art Online
[1767.38 --> 1768.30]  is that would be
[1768.30 --> 1770.30]  way ahead of where we are now.
[1770.30 --> 1770.56]  Yeah, like,
[1770.62 --> 1771.36]  that's actually going
[1771.36 --> 1772.02]  into your brain.
[1772.02 --> 1772.40]  Because it's tapping into neural stuff.
[1772.46 --> 1773.10]  Yeah, which,
[1773.28 --> 1774.66]  that's super not happening right now.
[1774.88 --> 1775.82]  I wouldn't be surprised if it did.
[1776.38 --> 1777.02]  I would be.
[1777.10 --> 1777.58]  Super not.
[1777.68 --> 1778.74]  You'd be surprised if it did?
[1778.82 --> 1779.12]  Oh, yeah.
[1779.28 --> 1780.14]  That kind of VR,
[1780.24 --> 1781.22]  I don't think it's possible.
[1782.82 --> 1783.92]  Not that level.
[1786.52 --> 1787.80]  But I wouldn't be surprised,
[1787.90 --> 1788.52]  because they're already
[1788.52 --> 1789.30]  trying to do this
[1789.30 --> 1789.86]  to a certain degree.
[1789.86 --> 1790.60]  I wouldn't be surprised
[1790.60 --> 1791.94]  if they had muscle impulses
[1791.94 --> 1793.40]  be transmitted into a computer.
[1793.84 --> 1794.22]  Oh, yeah.
[1794.40 --> 1794.96]  But I don't think
[1794.96 --> 1795.78]  it'll take it over.
[1796.12 --> 1796.54]  And also,
[1796.66 --> 1797.82]  you could definitely have
[1797.82 --> 1800.38]  the computer sending signals
[1800.38 --> 1802.20]  to you to simulate feeling.
[1802.46 --> 1803.54]  Yeah, I can totally believe that.
[1803.58 --> 1804.68]  And that'll be super cool.
[1804.72 --> 1805.50]  Yeah, that'll be cool.
[1805.80 --> 1807.30]  And probably abused horribly,
[1807.42 --> 1807.94]  horribly, horribly.
[1808.28 --> 1808.52]  Oh, yeah.
[1809.56 --> 1810.32]  VR porn!
[1811.64 --> 1812.38]  As well.
[1813.04 --> 1814.08]  A lot of it comes back
[1814.08 --> 1814.64]  to VR porn.
[1815.24 --> 1816.16]  Well, you know,
[1816.26 --> 1817.36]  porn has been
[1817.36 --> 1819.22]  the frontrunner
[1819.22 --> 1819.82]  for like VHS.
[1819.82 --> 1820.94]  Of a lot of technologies.
[1821.40 --> 1821.52]  Yeah.
[1821.66 --> 1822.84]  And that's the only one
[1822.84 --> 1823.66]  that I know of.
[1823.70 --> 1824.12]  Camera gear?
[1824.56 --> 1825.20]  Yeah, sure.
[1825.94 --> 1826.96]  That sounds correct.
[1827.24 --> 1828.30]  I totally believe it.
[1828.34 --> 1830.42]  Like low,
[1830.96 --> 1832.58]  not insanely high level
[1832.58 --> 1833.20]  camera gear.
[1833.34 --> 1833.58]  Yeah.
[1833.92 --> 1834.64]  Like kit that,
[1834.72 --> 1835.04]  honestly,
[1835.14 --> 1835.76]  we would buy.
[1836.86 --> 1838.00]  Probably often driven
[1838.00 --> 1838.80]  by the porn industry.
[1839.80 --> 1840.70]  Outside of that,
[1840.78 --> 1841.88]  there's like social stuff.
[1842.04 --> 1843.28]  People are already doing
[1843.28 --> 1845.30]  social movie viewing.
[1845.98 --> 1846.80]  So they set up
[1846.80 --> 1847.96]  like a virtual movie theater
[1847.96 --> 1848.84]  and you get a seat.
[1849.18 --> 1849.58]  Oh, yeah.
[1849.58 --> 1850.08]  And like everyone
[1850.08 --> 1850.74]  sits in the same.
[1850.78 --> 1851.56]  Or you can like watch
[1851.56 --> 1852.44]  a movie on the moon
[1852.44 --> 1853.50]  with some friends.
[1853.62 --> 1853.88]  That's funny.
[1853.88 --> 1854.82]  There's like a big projector
[1854.82 --> 1855.58]  that goes off the moon
[1855.58 --> 1856.52]  and you're sitting on the moon.
[1856.60 --> 1857.06]  Oh, no, no.
[1858.04 --> 1859.34]  The idea of meetups.
[1859.50 --> 1860.30]  So you have like family
[1860.30 --> 1861.34]  gatherings in VR
[1861.34 --> 1862.88]  where you get like
[1862.88 --> 1863.60]  a 3D scanner
[1863.60 --> 1864.64]  to scan in your body.
[1864.64 --> 1865.52]  Better than a webcam,
[1865.86 --> 1866.34]  basically.
[1866.90 --> 1867.56]  I can do that.
[1867.80 --> 1867.96]  Yeah.
[1868.36 --> 1869.00]  That's cool.
[1869.38 --> 1869.60]  Yeah.
[1869.72 --> 1870.64]  That's cool.
[1871.08 --> 1871.48]  I don't know.
[1871.64 --> 1872.14]  Some people are saying
[1872.14 --> 1872.60]  the internet,
[1872.74 --> 1873.24]  there is going to be
[1873.24 --> 1874.04]  VR browsers.
[1874.26 --> 1874.80]  I don't know how good
[1874.80 --> 1875.36]  it's going to be.
[1876.08 --> 1877.36]  I know other people
[1877.36 --> 1878.04]  have talked about
[1878.04 --> 1879.68]  the idea of not having
[1879.68 --> 1880.86]  like a huge crazy
[1880.86 --> 1881.84]  multi-screen setup.
[1882.34 --> 1882.58]  Yeah.
[1882.64 --> 1883.68]  But just having a VR headset.
[1883.92 --> 1884.10]  Right.
[1884.36 --> 1884.88]  Well, as long as
[1884.88 --> 1885.96]  the resolution's good enough.
[1886.10 --> 1886.46]  Yes.
[1886.64 --> 1887.64]  Which it's not.
[1887.68 --> 1888.56]  Not right now.
[1888.56 --> 1889.00]  Right now.
[1891.08 --> 1892.44]  Maybe eventually, right?
[1892.98 --> 1893.48]  I don't know.
[1893.80 --> 1894.18]  Anyways,
[1894.26 --> 1894.74]  I'm going to move on
[1894.74 --> 1895.34]  from this topic.
[1895.46 --> 1896.40]  VR troopers!
[1897.16 --> 1897.96]  VR troopers?
[1898.92 --> 1899.76]  That was a show.
[1899.76 --> 1902.30]  You've never heard
[1902.30 --> 1902.88]  of VR troopers?
[1903.04 --> 1903.24]  No.
[1903.24 --> 1903.56]  I've never heard
[1903.56 --> 1904.12]  of VR troopers.
[1904.36 --> 1905.32]  What's VR troopers?
[1906.30 --> 1907.10]  It's kind of like
[1907.10 --> 1908.20]  a Power Rangers knockoff.
[1908.62 --> 1908.92]  Oh.
[1910.38 --> 1911.40]  I'd probably prefer
[1911.40 --> 1912.08]  Power Rangers.
[1913.02 --> 1913.64]  Oh, I definitely
[1913.64 --> 1914.54]  prefer Power Rangers.
[1914.66 --> 1915.22]  It was just on
[1915.22 --> 1915.74]  after sometimes.
[1915.74 --> 1916.54]  Watch the chat.
[1916.54 --> 1917.02]  Talking about
[1917.02 --> 1918.12]  preferring things,
[1918.26 --> 1918.92]  Ashley Madison
[1918.92 --> 1920.30]  has added 4 million
[1920.30 --> 1920.98]  new members
[1920.98 --> 1921.70]  since the hack
[1921.70 --> 1922.26]  that exposed
[1922.26 --> 1923.10]  the user's identities.
[1923.34 --> 1923.60]  Cool.
[1923.60 --> 1924.76]  So apparently people
[1924.76 --> 1926.28]  don't care
[1926.28 --> 1927.12]  for one
[1927.12 --> 1928.32]  and two
[1928.32 --> 1929.26]  probably
[1929.26 --> 1929.92]  were never
[1929.92 --> 1930.76]  really using
[1930.76 --> 1932.24]  fully true identities.
[1933.38 --> 1933.82]  Okay,
[1933.96 --> 1934.86]  I do have something
[1934.86 --> 1935.66]  to add to this one.
[1935.66 --> 1936.48]  Are you on Ashley Madison?
[1936.48 --> 1937.82]  I am on Ashley Madison.
[1938.16 --> 1939.30]  So I've been on
[1939.30 --> 1939.98]  Ashley Madison
[1939.98 --> 1940.82]  since shortly
[1940.82 --> 1942.02]  after the hack
[1942.02 --> 1942.76]  when we talked
[1942.76 --> 1944.42]  about Ashley Madison
[1944.42 --> 1945.20]  and
[1945.20 --> 1945.78]  Me too.
[1945.94 --> 1947.06]  how I'm not on it.
[1947.16 --> 1947.50]  Me too.
[1947.70 --> 1948.92]  Because Ashley Madison
[1948.92 --> 1950.04]  does not require
[1950.04 --> 1951.18]  email validation
[1951.18 --> 1951.98]  to create
[1951.98 --> 1952.72]  a free account.
[1952.72 --> 1953.68]  So the fact
[1953.68 --> 1954.02]  that they have
[1954.02 --> 1955.14]  4 million new members
[1955.14 --> 1957.06]  means nothing.
[1957.54 --> 1958.06]  Oh.
[1958.96 --> 1959.38]  I thought
[1959.38 --> 1960.54]  everybody requires
[1960.54 --> 1961.42]  email validation
[1961.42 --> 1961.84]  these days.
[1961.84 --> 1962.60]  Not these guys.
[1962.70 --> 1963.24]  Not these guys.
[1963.26 --> 1963.88]  Which is probably
[1963.88 --> 1964.52]  part of their
[1964.52 --> 1965.42]  marketing campaign
[1965.42 --> 1966.32]  because this
[1966.32 --> 1967.12]  has probably
[1967.12 --> 1967.90]  increased people's
[1967.90 --> 1968.94]  confidence in the company.
[1969.48 --> 1970.44]  So they probably
[1970.44 --> 1971.76]  told people
[1971.76 --> 1972.42]  that they have
[1972.42 --> 1973.38]  4 million new members
[1973.38 --> 1974.66]  not just a random statistic.
[1974.88 --> 1975.22]  They were like
[1975.22 --> 1975.62]  hey,
[1976.02 --> 1976.28]  hey,
[1976.46 --> 1977.22]  we have 4 million
[1977.22 --> 1977.76]  new members.
[1978.06 --> 1978.26]  Hey.
[1978.50 --> 1979.10]  And then they posted
[1979.10 --> 1980.08]  a news article about it.
[1980.40 --> 1980.78]  Interesting.
[1981.16 --> 1981.36]  You know,
[1981.42 --> 1981.84]  I heard about
[1981.84 --> 1982.44]  this other dating
[1982.44 --> 1982.96]  website
[1982.96 --> 1984.80]  where it's only
[1984.80 --> 1985.14]  for like
[1985.14 --> 1986.14]  really attractive people
[1986.14 --> 1987.80]  and they force you
[1987.80 --> 1988.58]  to always put
[1988.58 --> 1989.46]  new pictures up
[1989.46 --> 1990.28]  like every month
[1990.28 --> 1990.66]  or so
[1990.66 --> 1992.04]  and they got
[1992.04 --> 1992.52]  rid of,
[1992.62 --> 1993.32]  they like
[1993.32 --> 1994.10]  blocked a whole
[1994.10 --> 1994.64]  bunch of users
[1994.64 --> 1995.46]  off the website.
[1995.62 --> 1996.26]  Because they're too ugly?
[1996.40 --> 1996.68]  No,
[1996.78 --> 1997.62]  because they got fat
[1997.62 --> 1998.38]  over the holidays.
[1999.08 --> 1999.92]  This was like
[1999.92 --> 2000.78]  a couple years ago
[2000.78 --> 2001.42]  and then
[2001.42 --> 2002.82]  there was an outpour,
[2002.90 --> 2003.56]  there was a flood
[2003.56 --> 2004.52]  of new people coming
[2004.52 --> 2005.68]  in who heard about this.
[2006.14 --> 2006.54]  Right?
[2006.66 --> 2007.92]  So similar situation
[2007.92 --> 2009.04]  to Ashley Madison.
[2009.70 --> 2009.96]  Right?
[2010.16 --> 2010.68]  Because they're like
[2010.68 --> 2011.02]  oh,
[2011.28 --> 2012.78]  I want to be on this site
[2012.78 --> 2014.54]  that bans ugly people.
[2017.14 --> 2018.06]  That's horrible.
[2018.28 --> 2019.06]  Do you know what it is?
[2019.48 --> 2019.86]  No,
[2019.94 --> 2020.82]  I don't remember at all.
[2020.86 --> 2021.48]  That's hilarious.
[2021.96 --> 2022.66]  I don't really care
[2022.66 --> 2023.50]  to be completely honest.
[2023.56 --> 2024.16]  I just thought that was really good.
[2024.16 --> 2025.02]  That is funny.
[2025.34 --> 2026.12]  Oh my goodness.
[2028.36 --> 2029.82]  Beautiful people only.
[2029.82 --> 2032.06]  So Taren,
[2032.14 --> 2033.14]  did they let you on the site?
[2034.82 --> 2035.54]  I would have.
[2035.94 --> 2036.78]  I would have too.
[2038.60 --> 2039.64]  But that's probably why
[2039.64 --> 2040.78]  we're not allowed on the site.
[2042.24 --> 2042.64]  Yeah.
[2044.88 --> 2045.32]  Yeah.
[2045.80 --> 2046.44]  I'm the sheriff.
[2047.52 --> 2048.20]  I'm the sheriff.
[2049.58 --> 2051.10]  What else should we talk about here?
[2051.54 --> 2052.80]  You are the sheriff, Taren.
[2053.52 --> 2054.50]  Rise of the Tomb Reader
[2054.50 --> 2056.66]  has a tentative PC release date.
[2057.46 --> 2059.18]  LDLC.com reports
[2059.18 --> 2060.34]  it's 29th of
[2060.34 --> 2062.12]  the first month of 2016.
[2062.52 --> 2062.92]  So like
[2062.92 --> 2064.26]  in basically a month.
[2065.34 --> 2066.36]  Amazon France
[2066.36 --> 2067.64]  reported the same thing
[2067.64 --> 2068.48]  although it's not
[2068.48 --> 2069.44]  technically confirmed.
[2069.60 --> 2070.60]  Square Enix did say
[2070.60 --> 2072.14]  that the game would launch
[2072.14 --> 2073.36]  early 2016.
[2073.74 --> 2074.64]  So hopefully it is coming.
[2075.00 --> 2075.44]  Which game?
[2075.96 --> 2076.48]  Tomb Raider.
[2076.58 --> 2077.30]  Rise of the Tomb Raider.
[2077.30 --> 2078.22]  Rise of the Tomb Raider.
[2078.30 --> 2079.20]  How many Tomb Raiders
[2079.20 --> 2080.62]  games are there?
[2080.66 --> 2081.40]  Lots of now.
[2081.76 --> 2082.88]  Recently just two.
[2083.06 --> 2083.40]  I see.
[2083.42 --> 2084.68]  But over the whole course
[2084.68 --> 2085.04]  of everything
[2085.04 --> 2085.70]  tons of them.
[2085.90 --> 2087.00]  Do you remember Traffic Cone,
[2087.22 --> 2087.44]  Boob?
[2088.10 --> 2088.68]  Did you hear that story?
[2088.68 --> 2089.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2089.18 --> 2089.96]  Is that technically
[2089.96 --> 2090.52]  complete?
[2090.60 --> 2091.20]  Like are we sure
[2091.20 --> 2091.70]  that's true?
[2092.72 --> 2093.00]  Wait.
[2093.00 --> 2093.46]  I told me.
[2094.12 --> 2094.56]  Oh, yeah.
[2094.66 --> 2095.06]  Wait, wait.
[2095.20 --> 2096.12]  I don't think I've heard
[2096.12 --> 2096.52]  the whole thing.
[2096.58 --> 2097.40]  I know that the very first
[2097.40 --> 2097.84]  Tomb Raider
[2097.84 --> 2098.78]  like there was such
[2098.78 --> 2099.68]  low polygons.
[2100.00 --> 2101.08]  What I've heard
[2101.08 --> 2103.14]  I don't know if this is true.
[2103.22 --> 2103.64]  I don't know if it's
[2103.64 --> 2104.56]  been confirmed.
[2105.12 --> 2105.88]  Twitch chat can probably
[2105.88 --> 2106.96]  tell me if it's true
[2106.96 --> 2107.56]  or not.
[2107.56 --> 2109.14]  But what I've heard
[2109.14 --> 2109.16]  but what I've heard
[2109.16 --> 2110.26]  is that there was
[2110.26 --> 2111.04]  investors coming
[2111.04 --> 2111.70]  into the studio
[2111.70 --> 2112.66]  for the first Tomb Raider
[2112.66 --> 2113.12]  game that they're
[2113.12 --> 2113.58]  trying to make
[2113.58 --> 2114.92]  and one of the designers
[2114.92 --> 2116.16]  was trying to touch up
[2116.16 --> 2118.58]  the what's her name?
[2118.66 --> 2119.46]  The Tomb Raider chick.
[2120.12 --> 2120.70]  Laura Croft.
[2120.70 --> 2121.52]  Laura Croft was trying
[2121.52 --> 2122.52]  to touch up her design
[2122.52 --> 2123.70]  and accidentally like
[2123.70 --> 2124.80]  deleted her boobs
[2124.80 --> 2125.28]  or something
[2125.28 --> 2126.02]  on accident.
[2126.02 --> 2127.18]  So it was like
[2127.18 --> 2128.60]  and tried to fix it
[2128.60 --> 2130.08]  and put in traffic cones
[2130.08 --> 2131.52]  and then the texture
[2131.52 --> 2132.72]  just wrapped over them.
[2132.90 --> 2134.18]  So it was kind of fine.
[2135.70 --> 2137.92]  And he admitted the mistake
[2137.92 --> 2138.54]  while they were there
[2138.54 --> 2139.02]  but he's like
[2139.02 --> 2140.28]  this is just a representation
[2140.28 --> 2140.80]  or whatever.
[2141.22 --> 2141.90]  And then they were like
[2141.90 --> 2143.16]  actually we like it.
[2143.50 --> 2143.88]  Keep it.
[2145.04 --> 2146.78]  So I don't know.
[2146.78 --> 2147.74]  That sounds like a myth.
[2148.10 --> 2148.78]  It does.
[2148.88 --> 2149.62]  That's why I'm like
[2149.62 --> 2151.86]  when I first heard
[2151.86 --> 2153.02]  that they just reused
[2153.02 --> 2154.04]  the traffic cone one
[2154.04 --> 2154.48]  I was like
[2154.48 --> 2155.02]  oh okay
[2155.02 --> 2155.84]  that might be a thing
[2155.84 --> 2156.46]  because that actually
[2156.46 --> 2157.08]  happens a lot
[2157.08 --> 2157.60]  in older games.
[2157.66 --> 2158.14]  Look at Mario.
[2158.74 --> 2159.64]  The bush and the cloud
[2159.64 --> 2161.18]  is the same actual thing.
[2161.30 --> 2162.10]  They just recolor it.
[2162.18 --> 2162.66]  So I was like
[2162.66 --> 2163.72]  okay that might make sense
[2163.72 --> 2164.44]  for memory reasons
[2164.44 --> 2164.78]  or whatever.
[2165.00 --> 2165.76]  When I heard like
[2165.76 --> 2166.62]  the investors coming
[2166.62 --> 2167.50]  to the office thing
[2167.50 --> 2167.90]  I was like
[2167.90 --> 2169.32]  this sounds pretty hoaxy to me.
[2170.66 --> 2171.20]  I don't know.
[2174.68 --> 2175.46]  No one's like
[2175.46 --> 2176.40]  really saying
[2176.40 --> 2179.26]  yeah.
[2180.04 --> 2180.76]  I don't know.
[2184.56 --> 2184.92]  Eh.
[2185.84 --> 2187.04]  People are posting
[2187.04 --> 2187.86]  little emoticons
[2187.86 --> 2188.62]  that look like boobs.
[2188.88 --> 2189.44]  That's kind of fun.
[2189.50 --> 2190.08]  That's fine.
[2190.46 --> 2190.88]  I'm going to do
[2190.88 --> 2191.72]  sponsor spots.
[2191.84 --> 2192.40]  Traffic cones.
[2193.02 --> 2193.38]  No.
[2194.00 --> 2194.70]  They should just texture
[2194.70 --> 2195.62]  them like traffic cones.
[2195.80 --> 2196.12]  No no.
[2196.20 --> 2196.78]  They need to be
[2196.78 --> 2197.76]  posting traffic cones.
[2197.90 --> 2198.30]  You got to get
[2198.30 --> 2199.56]  a traffic cone picture
[2199.56 --> 2199.94]  in there.
[2200.08 --> 2200.58]  That's true.
[2200.66 --> 2200.84]  Now.
[2201.30 --> 2201.74]  Yeah.
[2202.00 --> 2202.64]  That's very true.
[2203.28 --> 2203.70]  Anyways.
[2204.04 --> 2204.44]  Squarespace.
[2204.94 --> 2205.44]  They're simple
[2205.44 --> 2206.32]  powerful and
[2206.32 --> 2207.08]  I think
[2207.08 --> 2208.10]  that they're beautiful.
[2208.52 --> 2208.94]  I don't know.
[2209.72 --> 2210.54]  That's an opinion.
[2210.54 --> 2211.64]  I think they would
[2211.64 --> 2212.52]  make it on that website.
[2212.64 --> 2213.02]  Oh yeah.
[2213.32 --> 2214.26]  But I'm not really sure.
[2214.54 --> 2216.26]  24-7 live chat support
[2216.26 --> 2217.98]  and email.
[2218.46 --> 2219.06]  It's only
[2219.06 --> 2219.86]  eight bucks a month.
[2219.98 --> 2220.52]  You get your
[2220.52 --> 2221.60]  domain for free
[2221.60 --> 2222.08]  if you sign up
[2222.08 --> 2222.98]  for an entire year.
[2223.04 --> 2224.32]  It has responsive design.
[2224.82 --> 2225.42]  So if you
[2225.42 --> 2226.36]  look at it
[2226.36 --> 2227.24]  on a laptop
[2227.24 --> 2228.64]  or a desktop
[2228.64 --> 2230.12]  or that desktop
[2230.12 --> 2231.18]  or your phone
[2231.18 --> 2232.68]  it'll look fine.
[2232.88 --> 2234.38]  It has a commerce module
[2234.38 --> 2235.32]  that every website
[2235.32 --> 2236.00]  comes with
[2236.00 --> 2236.96]  which is like
[2236.96 --> 2237.92]  an online store
[2237.92 --> 2239.04]  so you can sell stuff
[2239.04 --> 2240.10]  like little
[2240.10 --> 2241.04]  stormtrooper lights
[2241.04 --> 2241.98]  that go on your keys.
[2242.40 --> 2243.18]  Pretty cool.
[2243.54 --> 2244.44]  You can spread the feet
[2244.44 --> 2245.26]  and it glow
[2245.26 --> 2245.90]  in different directions.
[2246.10 --> 2246.42]  Anyways.
[2246.62 --> 2247.14]  This is a gift
[2247.14 --> 2247.68]  from my girlfriend.
[2247.80 --> 2248.28]  It's very nice.
[2250.12 --> 2251.52]  There's a cover page module
[2251.52 --> 2252.00]  just in case
[2252.00 --> 2252.46]  for some reason
[2252.46 --> 2253.02]  you only want to have
[2253.02 --> 2254.04]  one page on your website
[2254.04 --> 2255.00]  with a resume
[2255.00 --> 2255.94]  or something like that.
[2256.04 --> 2256.72]  Everything's fine.
[2257.28 --> 2258.30]  You can start a trial
[2258.30 --> 2259.70]  with no credit card required
[2259.70 --> 2260.50]  and start building
[2260.50 --> 2261.36]  your website today.
[2261.74 --> 2262.16]  When you sign up
[2262.16 --> 2262.58]  for Squarespace
[2262.58 --> 2263.48]  make sure that you
[2263.48 --> 2264.50]  use offer code Linus
[2264.50 --> 2264.84]  and you'll get
[2264.84 --> 2265.52]  10% off
[2265.52 --> 2266.24]  of your first purchase
[2266.24 --> 2266.96]  so if you sign up
[2266.96 --> 2267.26]  for a year
[2267.26 --> 2267.92]  get a free domain
[2267.92 --> 2268.80]  and get 10% off
[2268.80 --> 2269.42]  that's pretty cool.
[2269.60 --> 2269.96]  Squarespace!
[2270.92 --> 2271.68]  Build it beautiful.
[2272.74 --> 2273.38]  That's the part
[2273.38 --> 2273.80]  that I know.
[2273.96 --> 2274.46]  I gotta go.
[2274.56 --> 2275.22]  I gotta finish editing.
[2275.42 --> 2275.94]  I wanted to do
[2275.94 --> 2277.30]  like the surprise thing.
[2277.46 --> 2277.94]  Bye.
[2278.30 --> 2279.06]  Bye Taren.
[2281.44 --> 2282.26]  Do do do.
[2282.68 --> 2283.74]  Do do do do do.
[2284.32 --> 2285.50]  I didn't put the thing up.
[2286.74 --> 2287.10]  Ah.
[2287.48 --> 2288.20]  There we go.
[2289.80 --> 2290.56]  Sorry Nick.
[2290.68 --> 2291.18]  I didn't put
[2291.18 --> 2292.16]  the lower third on.
[2293.20 --> 2293.76]  Does that mean
[2293.76 --> 2294.50]  I need to redo it?
[2295.30 --> 2295.62]  Okay.
[2295.94 --> 2296.56]  So the lower third
[2296.56 --> 2297.20]  is down here.
[2297.48 --> 2298.74]  That's where the off code is.
[2298.94 --> 2299.40]  I had to like
[2299.40 --> 2300.36]  home my fingers in.
[2300.52 --> 2301.40]  I went too far one way
[2301.40 --> 2302.26]  then too far the other way
[2302.26 --> 2303.36]  but it's there.
[2304.24 --> 2305.12]  Now I'm gonna switch
[2305.12 --> 2305.86]  to FreshBooks
[2305.86 --> 2306.54]  and the lower third.
[2306.54 --> 2306.70]  Oh.
[2306.70 --> 2310.16]  I don't think that's how
[2310.16 --> 2310.98]  that's supposed to work.
[2310.98 --> 2311.74]  You got this bro.
[2313.66 --> 2315.18]  I didn't set this part up.
[2315.30 --> 2316.24]  I don't know what to do.
[2316.88 --> 2318.76]  I'm gonna put this here.
[2320.44 --> 2322.54]  So there we go.
[2323.68 --> 2324.12]  FreshBooks!
[2326.64 --> 2327.58]  FreshBooks is the easy
[2327.58 --> 2328.60]  to use invoicing software
[2328.60 --> 2329.70]  that helps small businesses
[2329.70 --> 2330.88]  look professional
[2330.88 --> 2331.82]  and get paid faster.
[2331.82 --> 2332.86]  You can even do things
[2332.86 --> 2334.38]  like receive deposits
[2334.38 --> 2335.88]  so you can get a little bit
[2335.88 --> 2336.98]  of the money for your work
[2336.98 --> 2338.08]  before you go do your work
[2338.08 --> 2338.68]  so you know that
[2338.68 --> 2339.28]  they're actually gonna
[2339.28 --> 2340.30]  want you to do it
[2340.30 --> 2341.16]  and they'll actually show up
[2341.16 --> 2342.16]  for their side of the appointment
[2342.16 --> 2342.82]  and stuff like that.
[2342.88 --> 2343.58]  It's actually really helpful
[2343.58 --> 2344.80]  especially if you're
[2344.80 --> 2345.58]  a small business.
[2346.06 --> 2347.04]  It's completely free
[2347.04 --> 2347.92]  for 30 days
[2347.92 --> 2348.38]  if you go to
[2348.38 --> 2349.18]  freshbooks.com
[2349.18 --> 2349.98]  slash WAN
[2349.98 --> 2350.72]  as you can see
[2350.72 --> 2352.88]  in this awkwardly placed box
[2352.88 --> 2354.80]  that happens to be right there.
[2355.80 --> 2356.46]  Da-da-da-da-da.
[2356.78 --> 2358.58]  It does a lot of stuff.
[2358.58 --> 2359.50]  It can track the amount
[2359.50 --> 2361.28]  of hours that you do
[2361.28 --> 2362.46]  at what job,
[2362.64 --> 2363.30]  when, where,
[2363.40 --> 2364.16]  all that kind of stuff
[2364.16 --> 2365.12]  so you don't have to worry
[2365.12 --> 2366.04]  about any of that kind of stuff.
[2366.32 --> 2367.12]  If you have purchases
[2367.12 --> 2368.02]  that need to be made
[2368.02 --> 2368.82]  you just take a picture
[2368.82 --> 2369.42]  of the receipt
[2369.42 --> 2370.96]  and they can log that for you
[2370.96 --> 2371.52]  so that it's easy
[2371.52 --> 2372.84]  to expense later on.
[2373.14 --> 2374.46]  It has a timesheet function.
[2374.82 --> 2375.20]  You can manage
[2375.20 --> 2376.50]  your expenses overall
[2376.50 --> 2377.62]  in terms of whatever
[2377.62 --> 2378.64]  you need to manage.
[2379.82 --> 2380.74]  It can even tell you
[2380.74 --> 2382.46]  if your clients
[2382.46 --> 2383.98]  have looked at the invoice
[2383.98 --> 2384.92]  that you have served them
[2384.92 --> 2385.82]  which is nice
[2385.82 --> 2386.68]  because if they're like
[2386.68 --> 2387.68]  you never sent me that
[2387.68 --> 2388.24]  you can be like
[2388.24 --> 2390.28]  look, dude, I did.
[2390.74 --> 2391.88]  You even looked at it, man.
[2392.68 --> 2393.58]  Come on, aren't we friends?
[2394.08 --> 2394.80]  You can do that
[2394.80 --> 2395.38]  which is helpful.
[2395.74 --> 2396.56]  If you have any questions
[2396.56 --> 2397.22]  you can feel free
[2397.22 --> 2397.72]  to reach out
[2397.72 --> 2398.82]  to their support staff
[2398.82 --> 2399.36]  where you'll speak
[2399.36 --> 2400.24]  to real human
[2400.24 --> 2401.26]  which is cool.
[2401.76 --> 2402.76]  No phone tree,
[2402.88 --> 2403.54]  no escalations,
[2403.66 --> 2404.50]  no return calls,
[2404.94 --> 2405.68]  just answers
[2405.68 --> 2406.54]  which is actually
[2406.54 --> 2407.44]  kind of nice.
[2407.98 --> 2408.98]  So like I said
[2408.98 --> 2409.88]  go to freshbooks.com
[2409.88 --> 2410.60]  slash WAN
[2410.60 --> 2411.76]  and enter WAN
[2411.76 --> 2412.90]  in the how did you hear
[2412.90 --> 2413.66]  about us section.
[2414.16 --> 2414.78]  They also just got
[2414.78 --> 2415.72]  a mobile card reader
[2415.72 --> 2416.86]  or mobile.
[2417.12 --> 2418.14]  They also got a mobile
[2418.14 --> 2420.32]  card reader.
[2420.68 --> 2421.24]  There we go.
[2421.38 --> 2421.92]  I think you can plug it
[2421.92 --> 2422.54]  into your phone
[2422.54 --> 2423.86]  scan cards or something.
[2424.16 --> 2426.56]  There's a 3% charge on it
[2426.56 --> 2427.78]  and I think it costs 20 bucks
[2427.78 --> 2430.62]  but the 3% charge
[2430.62 --> 2432.04]  includes the already there
[2432.04 --> 2433.08]  credit card charge
[2433.08 --> 2434.16]  so it's like
[2434.16 --> 2434.90]  half a percent
[2434.90 --> 2436.30]  or a percent
[2436.30 --> 2436.80]  or something.
[2436.80 --> 2439.18]  yeah it's not bad.
[2439.48 --> 2440.28]  There's a lot of credit card
[2440.28 --> 2441.02]  readers that are worse
[2441.02 --> 2442.96]  so there you go.
[2443.04 --> 2443.62]  And it's kind of cool
[2443.62 --> 2444.28]  to be able to be like
[2444.28 --> 2445.00]  here's my phone
[2445.00 --> 2445.86]  that has a thing
[2445.86 --> 2447.50]  and you can swipe it
[2447.50 --> 2448.86]  and then everything's fine.
[2449.48 --> 2449.82]  It's nice.
[2449.88 --> 2450.66]  You can take charges
[2450.66 --> 2451.42]  while you're there
[2451.42 --> 2451.98]  so you don't have to wait
[2451.98 --> 2453.18]  like 30 million years
[2453.18 --> 2454.96]  to get someone to pay you.
[2455.08 --> 2455.94]  If I sound salty
[2455.94 --> 2456.46]  it's because I've been
[2456.46 --> 2457.10]  in that situation.
[2457.24 --> 2457.56]  Anyways,
[2457.66 --> 2458.40]  jumping back to the normal
[2458.40 --> 2458.92]  part of the show.
[2459.14 --> 2459.40]  What?
[2459.54 --> 2460.14]  Not from you.
[2460.14 --> 2462.20]  Actually,
[2462.34 --> 2463.08]  you've been pretty good.
[2464.44 --> 2465.50]  I meant when I was doing
[2465.50 --> 2466.64]  like odd jobs for people.
[2468.98 --> 2469.78]  I told you I used to do
[2469.78 --> 2470.58]  like IT work
[2470.58 --> 2471.32]  for random like
[2471.32 --> 2472.36]  offices and stuff.
[2472.52 --> 2472.66]  Yeah.
[2472.96 --> 2474.04]  That would sometimes
[2474.04 --> 2474.66]  take forever.
[2475.00 --> 2475.38]  They would always
[2475.38 --> 2476.36]  conveniently forget
[2476.36 --> 2477.84]  or conveniently not see it.
[2478.30 --> 2478.58]  So,
[2478.80 --> 2479.08]  yeah.
[2479.64 --> 2480.32]  I would have
[2480.32 --> 2481.32]  probably legitimately
[2481.32 --> 2482.08]  used FreshBooks
[2482.08 --> 2482.66]  back in the day.
[2484.54 --> 2484.98]  Anyways,
[2485.38 --> 2486.32]  let's see what more
[2486.32 --> 2487.14]  topics we have.
[2488.24 --> 2489.22]  I'm going to do
[2489.22 --> 2489.86]  a
[2489.86 --> 2491.80]  straw poll thing
[2491.80 --> 2492.90]  actually real quick.
[2493.42 --> 2494.30]  I want to see
[2494.30 --> 2495.48]  what you guys
[2495.48 --> 2497.66]  are excited.
[2497.74 --> 2498.42]  I don't know what
[2498.42 --> 2501.80]  is happening
[2501.80 --> 2502.96]  in that room.
[2506.02 --> 2506.62]  Straw poll.
[2506.80 --> 2507.14]  Okay.
[2507.40 --> 2508.58]  I'm asking you guys
[2508.58 --> 2509.28]  what
[2509.28 --> 2510.52]  what did you guys
[2510.52 --> 2511.04]  just do?
[2512.78 --> 2513.74]  What did they do?
[2514.34 --> 2515.46]  Why are they freaking out?
[2515.50 --> 2515.94]  What did they do?
[2518.14 --> 2518.58]  What?
[2518.58 --> 2521.02]  The mouse thing.
[2523.58 --> 2525.04]  Oh my god.
[2525.04 --> 2525.08]  Oh my god.
[2525.08 --> 2525.18]  Oh,
[2525.36 --> 2526.14]  cheap upcoming
[2526.14 --> 2526.76]  super fun.
[2526.88 --> 2527.60]  You can kind of,
[2527.64 --> 2528.46]  I think you can kind of
[2528.46 --> 2529.16]  tease the prank
[2529.16 --> 2530.10]  because we'll introduce it
[2530.10 --> 2530.60]  right at the beginning
[2530.60 --> 2531.24]  of the video, right?
[2532.08 --> 2532.36]  Hey,
[2532.42 --> 2532.74]  Burkle.
[2535.14 --> 2535.94]  Can you get Burkle
[2535.94 --> 2536.36]  to come out here?
[2536.36 --> 2541.38]  What has,
[2541.38 --> 2541.40]  what has,
[2543.40 --> 2548.14]  what are you excited
[2548.14 --> 2548.94]  about at CES?
[2549.28 --> 2549.60]  Wow,
[2549.68 --> 2550.52]  I can't straw poll this.
[2550.62 --> 2551.08]  I'm going to Twitter
[2551.08 --> 2551.62]  blitz this.
[2551.80 --> 2552.30]  Why was I going to
[2552.30 --> 2552.90]  straw poll this?
[2552.94 --> 2554.20]  That was a horrible idea.
[2555.06 --> 2556.24]  You can't input your own
[2556.24 --> 2557.10]  opinions at all.
[2558.14 --> 2559.32]  Twitter.com.
[2559.48 --> 2560.28]  So what I'm going to ask
[2560.28 --> 2561.32]  you on the Twitter blitz,
[2561.64 --> 2562.26]  which we're,
[2562.42 --> 2562.56]  I think,
[2562.60 --> 2563.32]  going to use mine
[2563.32 --> 2564.54]  because I don't have
[2564.54 --> 2565.28]  Linus's login.
[2565.64 --> 2566.24]  Do you want to talk
[2566.24 --> 2566.80]  about what you just did
[2566.80 --> 2567.18]  on the wine show
[2567.18 --> 2567.42]  or no?
[2567.56 --> 2567.74]  Oh,
[2567.82 --> 2568.00]  sure.
[2568.20 --> 2568.42]  Okay,
[2568.50 --> 2568.68]  cool.
[2569.04 --> 2569.30]  Well,
[2569.40 --> 2569.68]  should I?
[2569.76 --> 2569.92]  Yeah.
[2570.10 --> 2570.60]  It's up to you.
[2570.70 --> 2571.92]  I don't know if that's a,
[2572.46 --> 2573.74]  so maybe don't like
[2573.74 --> 2574.56]  explain the whole thing.
[2574.68 --> 2574.96]  I don't know.
[2574.96 --> 2575.06]  Okay.
[2575.74 --> 2576.00]  Well,
[2576.00 --> 2577.60]  I'll explain it.
[2577.66 --> 2579.06]  I'll explain it very briefly.
[2580.38 --> 2581.10]  So here,
[2581.20 --> 2582.00]  long story short,
[2582.38 --> 2583.36]  I've been periodically
[2583.36 --> 2584.14]  pranking Taren
[2584.14 --> 2584.88]  for one year.
[2586.18 --> 2587.40]  Basically since CES
[2587.40 --> 2588.08]  last year.
[2590.02 --> 2590.58]  And I,
[2590.78 --> 2592.42]  the video I'm trying
[2592.42 --> 2593.18]  to do for today
[2593.18 --> 2593.76]  wasn't working.
[2593.86 --> 2594.18]  So I'm like,
[2594.20 --> 2594.62]  you know what?
[2594.92 --> 2596.26]  I did not know about this.
[2596.48 --> 2597.38]  There is no way
[2597.38 --> 2598.38]  that I would have approved
[2598.38 --> 2599.60]  you to do something like this.
[2599.68 --> 2599.86]  Yeah,
[2599.90 --> 2600.40]  you did.
[2600.78 --> 2601.74]  You definitely did.
[2601.80 --> 2602.60]  I told you about it
[2602.60 --> 2603.76]  and you're always asking me,
[2604.06 --> 2604.22]  hey,
[2604.26 --> 2604.72]  how's that thing
[2604.72 --> 2605.36]  with Taren going?
[2605.54 --> 2607.50]  So I guess,
[2607.56 --> 2608.64]  I guess that's today.
[2608.74 --> 2609.62]  I guess that's going to be
[2609.62 --> 2610.78]  coming up on Superfund
[2610.78 --> 2611.94]  because I didn't actually
[2611.94 --> 2612.92]  plan on doing it yet,
[2613.14 --> 2615.22]  but we just went
[2615.22 --> 2615.98]  through the windows.
[2616.12 --> 2616.68]  So that's for,
[2616.84 --> 2617.34]  we went through
[2617.34 --> 2617.92]  a certain prank
[2617.92 --> 2618.86]  that didn't actually work
[2618.86 --> 2620.20]  because Taren's too logical.
[2620.76 --> 2621.70]  He did too logical
[2621.70 --> 2622.20]  of a thing
[2622.20 --> 2623.70]  when he experienced it.
[2624.02 --> 2624.04]  So.
[2624.82 --> 2626.10]  What prank was that?
[2626.86 --> 2628.00]  You'll have to find out.
[2628.38 --> 2628.62]  Oh.
[2628.78 --> 2629.12]  On channel.
[2629.12 --> 2629.22]  No,
[2629.28 --> 2630.36]  the one that he experienced
[2630.36 --> 2631.66]  that wasn't good.
[2631.76 --> 2632.40]  Is that coming out?
[2632.52 --> 2632.76]  Yeah.
[2632.90 --> 2633.02]  Yeah.
[2633.18 --> 2633.38]  Oh,
[2633.44 --> 2633.60]  okay.
[2633.86 --> 2634.04]  Okay.
[2634.04 --> 2635.78]  But that's it.
[2636.82 --> 2637.64]  It's just a prank,
[2637.74 --> 2637.86]  dude.
[2637.94 --> 2638.32]  Calm down.
[2638.52 --> 2638.74]  Oh,
[2638.84 --> 2639.30]  my God.
[2639.36 --> 2640.12]  It's just a prank,
[2640.56 --> 2640.76]  dude.
[2640.82 --> 2641.94]  I just stepped on your shoes.
[2643.24 --> 2643.90]  I hate those ones.
[2643.90 --> 2644.30]  It's funny.
[2644.40 --> 2644.90]  It's a prank.
[2645.30 --> 2645.60]  Oh,
[2645.66 --> 2646.12]  my God.
[2646.16 --> 2646.82]  If someone stops,
[2646.86 --> 2647.30]  and like sometimes
[2647.30 --> 2648.44]  they stomp on their foot.
[2648.68 --> 2648.88]  Luke,
[2648.92 --> 2649.62]  I just poured water
[2649.62 --> 2650.10]  on your laptop.
[2650.20 --> 2650.84]  It's a prank,
[2650.96 --> 2651.12]  though,
[2651.18 --> 2651.36]  dude.
[2651.46 --> 2652.54]  Don't get mad.
[2654.02 --> 2654.72]  It's a prank.
[2654.86 --> 2655.04]  Okay,
[2655.12 --> 2655.30]  bye.
[2655.40 --> 2655.66]  Bye,
[2655.72 --> 2656.04]  Wancho.
[2656.22 --> 2657.10]  Makes me so sad.
[2657.42 --> 2657.66]  Okay,
[2657.74 --> 2658.30]  so you guys actually
[2658.30 --> 2659.42]  do have to tweet Linus.
[2659.50 --> 2660.00]  I figured out how
[2660.00 --> 2660.92]  to make that work.
[2661.42 --> 2661.78]  So,
[2662.00 --> 2662.94]  at Linus Tech
[2662.94 --> 2663.50]  on Twitter.
[2664.04 --> 2666.18]  And hit him up
[2666.18 --> 2667.32]  with what you're excited
[2667.32 --> 2668.84]  for us to cover
[2668.84 --> 2669.66]  at CES
[2669.66 --> 2670.62]  or what you're excited
[2670.62 --> 2671.60]  to be at CES
[2671.60 --> 2672.96]  in general at all
[2672.96 --> 2674.64]  if you don't really care
[2674.64 --> 2675.48]  if we cover or not.
[2675.64 --> 2676.04]  But you probably,
[2676.38 --> 2676.52]  like,
[2676.98 --> 2677.64]  that would be nice
[2677.64 --> 2679.04]  if you cared.
[2679.88 --> 2680.64]  I'm going to cover
[2680.64 --> 2681.62]  where I normally sit.
[2682.36 --> 2682.38]  Oh,
[2683.34 --> 2684.28]  there we go.
[2685.34 --> 2685.64]  Okay,
[2685.76 --> 2686.40]  so hit me up on Twitter
[2686.40 --> 2687.12]  there for a while.
[2687.22 --> 2688.00]  I'm going to go talk
[2688.00 --> 2688.96]  about something else
[2688.96 --> 2689.62]  for a little bit
[2689.62 --> 2690.50]  if there is even
[2690.50 --> 2691.32]  any more topics.
[2692.52 --> 2693.14]  Do-do-do.
[2693.14 --> 2694.60]  Do-do-do-do.
[2694.60 --> 2695.28]  Do-do-do.
[2695.28 --> 2696.28]  Do-do-do-do.
[2696.28 --> 2697.64]  Do-do-do-do.
[2701.76 --> 2702.36]  Apparently,
[2702.54 --> 2703.24]  CSGO
[2703.24 --> 2704.92]  is the best-selling game
[2704.92 --> 2705.78]  on Steam
[2705.78 --> 2706.82]  in 2015.
[2707.24 --> 2707.88]  It beat out
[2707.88 --> 2708.90]  GTA 5
[2708.90 --> 2709.70]  and it beat out
[2709.70 --> 2710.72]  Fallout 4.
[2711.14 --> 2712.26]  I'm not super surprised
[2712.26 --> 2712.76]  that it beat out
[2712.76 --> 2713.32]  Fallout 4
[2713.32 --> 2714.24]  considering Fallout 4
[2714.24 --> 2714.88]  was only out
[2714.88 --> 2715.76]  for, like,
[2717.02 --> 2717.52]  two months
[2717.52 --> 2718.52]  games
[2718.52 --> 2718.74]  or something.
[2719.40 --> 2719.80]  So,
[2720.10 --> 2720.48]  I don't know.
[2720.62 --> 2720.94]  I don't think
[2720.94 --> 2721.58]  that's that surprise.
[2722.10 --> 2722.50]  Also,
[2722.74 --> 2723.46]  I'm going to speculate
[2723.46 --> 2723.84]  here.
[2723.90 --> 2724.18]  I don't know
[2724.18 --> 2724.90]  if everyone's been
[2724.90 --> 2725.78]  speculating about this
[2725.78 --> 2726.10]  or not,
[2726.36 --> 2726.90]  but I'm going to
[2726.90 --> 2727.56]  speculate here
[2727.56 --> 2728.70]  that a lot of that
[2728.70 --> 2729.76]  was
[2729.76 --> 2732.66]  not necessarily
[2732.66 --> 2733.76]  purchases that they
[2733.76 --> 2734.54]  well,
[2734.70 --> 2735.26]  it's money,
[2735.48 --> 2736.06]  so they're probably
[2736.06 --> 2736.84]  happy about it,
[2736.94 --> 2738.02]  but not necessarily
[2738.02 --> 2739.02]  purchases that you
[2739.02 --> 2739.56]  want.
[2740.00 --> 2741.24]  I played CSGO
[2741.24 --> 2742.00]  for
[2742.00 --> 2744.00]  quite a bit
[2744.00 --> 2744.68]  in the first,
[2744.82 --> 2745.16]  I'd say,
[2745.22 --> 2746.12]  half of this year
[2746.12 --> 2747.46]  and every single time
[2747.46 --> 2748.42]  that there was a sale,
[2749.14 --> 2750.02]  everyone that I knew
[2750.02 --> 2751.06]  that played actively
[2751.06 --> 2752.86]  would lessen the amount
[2752.86 --> 2753.56]  that they played
[2753.56 --> 2754.48]  because the amount
[2754.48 --> 2755.38]  of people that hacked
[2755.38 --> 2756.70]  would just
[2756.70 --> 2757.62]  absolutely
[2757.62 --> 2758.78]  skyrocket.
[2759.16 --> 2759.78]  The amount of new,
[2759.88 --> 2760.04]  like,
[2760.14 --> 2761.52]  basically brand new
[2761.52 --> 2762.30]  accounts that would
[2762.30 --> 2763.62]  just randomly have CSGO
[2763.62 --> 2764.84]  and randomly be
[2764.84 --> 2766.38]  destroying in games
[2766.38 --> 2767.78]  in completely
[2767.78 --> 2769.06]  ridiculous ways
[2769.06 --> 2770.02]  that would show up
[2770.02 --> 2771.28]  right around sales
[2771.28 --> 2771.82]  and then would
[2771.82 --> 2772.44]  disappear
[2772.44 --> 2774.20]  within maybe
[2774.20 --> 2774.90]  two weeks
[2774.90 --> 2776.14]  was insane
[2776.14 --> 2776.94]  and would still
[2776.94 --> 2777.80]  count into their
[2777.80 --> 2778.52]  sales records.
[2779.12 --> 2779.32]  So,
[2779.96 --> 2780.66]  yeah.
[2781.26 --> 2781.74]  Also,
[2781.94 --> 2782.68]  I think this is
[2782.68 --> 2783.64]  best-selling
[2783.64 --> 2784.78]  as in amount
[2784.78 --> 2785.42]  of sales,
[2786.46 --> 2787.36]  not best-selling
[2787.36 --> 2787.92]  as in,
[2787.98 --> 2788.12]  yeah,
[2788.26 --> 2788.92]  it's owners,
[2789.18 --> 2789.74]  so it's amount
[2789.74 --> 2790.28]  of sales,
[2790.46 --> 2791.90]  not revenue
[2791.90 --> 2792.70]  from the sales,
[2792.90 --> 2793.60]  so when you just,
[2793.68 --> 2793.80]  like,
[2793.90 --> 2794.66]  kill the cost
[2794.66 --> 2795.46]  of a really popular
[2795.46 --> 2795.82]  game,
[2795.92 --> 2796.60]  people are probably
[2796.60 --> 2797.36]  going to buy it.
[2797.36 --> 2799.22]  yeah,
[2799.40 --> 2799.92]  I don't know.
[2800.10 --> 2800.28]  So,
[2800.48 --> 2801.08]  it went,
[2801.42 --> 2802.58]  first place was
[2802.58 --> 2803.16]  Counter-Strike Global
[2803.16 --> 2803.56]  Offensive,
[2803.70 --> 2804.04]  then it was
[2804.04 --> 2805.04]  Grand Theft Auto 5,
[2805.38 --> 2806.48]  then Fallout 4,
[2806.80 --> 2808.08]  then Ark Survival
[2808.08 --> 2808.80]  Evolved,
[2809.22 --> 2810.04]  Rocket League,
[2810.46 --> 2811.26]  Garry's Mod,
[2811.62 --> 2812.74]  Left 4 Dead 2,
[2813.16 --> 2814.00]  Elder Scrolls 5,
[2814.14 --> 2814.82]  Skyrim,
[2815.04 --> 2815.58]  Terraria,
[2815.84 --> 2817.02]  and then Witcher 3,
[2817.48 --> 2818.22]  The Wild Hunt,
[2818.36 --> 2819.24]  in number 10.
[2819.32 --> 2820.50]  It goes down to 25.
[2820.50 --> 2822.76]  Yeah,
[2823.00 --> 2823.98]  I don't think
[2823.98 --> 2825.40]  I'm that surprised,
[2826.14 --> 2826.52]  but,
[2826.84 --> 2829.06]  I don't know.
[2829.32 --> 2830.16]  I think a lot of it's
[2830.16 --> 2830.84]  not necessarily
[2830.84 --> 2832.06]  the most genuine
[2832.06 --> 2832.64]  of sales.
[2833.20 --> 2833.68]  Let's see what you
[2833.68 --> 2834.52]  guys are excited for.
[2838.28 --> 2839.86]  Joakim Johansson,
[2839.96 --> 2840.64]  I hope I'm saying
[2840.64 --> 2841.18]  that right.
[2841.36 --> 2842.24]  Can you guys see this?
[2843.28 --> 2843.58]  Yeah,
[2843.66 --> 2844.60]  that's kind of not
[2844.60 --> 2845.64]  small enough.
[2845.98 --> 2846.74]  Let me get a better
[2846.74 --> 2847.64]  view for you guys.
[2847.70 --> 2847.92]  Sorry,
[2848.02 --> 2848.48]  one second.
[2848.48 --> 2853.02]  Screen capture.
[2853.84 --> 2854.42]  I'm just going to do
[2854.42 --> 2855.86]  like two blocks.
[2856.94 --> 2859.44]  There we go.
[2859.52 --> 2860.20]  I think that's better.
[2862.22 --> 2862.52]  So,
[2862.74 --> 2863.76]  Joakim Johansson,
[2863.86 --> 2864.42]  hopefully I'm saying
[2864.42 --> 2864.80]  that correctly,
[2864.90 --> 2865.04]  says,
[2865.14 --> 2865.94]  I would love to see
[2865.94 --> 2866.68]  some home automation
[2866.68 --> 2867.00]  stuff.
[2867.32 --> 2868.18]  I would too,
[2868.66 --> 2869.60]  if it's like
[2869.60 --> 2871.42]  actually new and good.
[2871.84 --> 2873.08]  I've seen a lot
[2873.08 --> 2873.64]  of home automation
[2873.64 --> 2874.52]  stuff at these shows,
[2874.68 --> 2875.52]  which is really
[2875.52 --> 2876.38]  not that impressive
[2876.38 --> 2877.72]  and kind of
[2877.72 --> 2878.46]  generally crap.
[2878.98 --> 2879.10]  So,
[2879.18 --> 2879.66]  hopefully there's
[2879.66 --> 2880.26]  better ones.
[2880.50 --> 2881.38]  Not that long ago
[2881.38 --> 2882.02]  on Kickstarter,
[2882.36 --> 2883.42]  I saw one that I think
[2883.42 --> 2883.98]  was called the
[2883.98 --> 2884.90]  Gecko Switch.
[2885.34 --> 2886.26]  And the idea was
[2886.26 --> 2887.38]  that you would
[2887.38 --> 2888.60]  take out a current
[2888.60 --> 2889.32]  switch that was
[2889.32 --> 2889.86]  in your home,
[2890.22 --> 2892.16]  put the home base
[2892.16 --> 2893.36]  of that switch's
[2893.36 --> 2894.56]  Gecko Switch there,
[2894.78 --> 2895.72]  and then basically
[2895.72 --> 2897.22]  a wall sticker switch
[2897.22 --> 2898.18]  somewhere else,
[2898.30 --> 2898.88]  and then that would
[2898.88 --> 2899.82]  essentially move
[2899.82 --> 2900.60]  where the switch is.
[2901.46 --> 2902.12]  That's actually
[2902.12 --> 2902.72]  kind of cool,
[2903.00 --> 2903.44]  because then you
[2903.44 --> 2903.94]  could have like a
[2903.94 --> 2904.60]  bank of switches
[2904.60 --> 2905.30]  somewhere that can,
[2905.44 --> 2906.00]  you can basically
[2906.00 --> 2906.72]  move them around,
[2906.72 --> 2908.12]  because the amount
[2908.12 --> 2908.86]  of times that like
[2908.86 --> 2909.60]  you have to cover
[2909.60 --> 2910.38]  a switch up with
[2910.38 --> 2912.10]  something or a switch
[2912.10 --> 2912.80]  happens to be in a
[2912.80 --> 2914.08]  completely illogical
[2914.08 --> 2914.64]  location,
[2915.76 --> 2916.68]  I don't know,
[2916.78 --> 2917.44]  drives me absolutely
[2917.44 --> 2917.72]  nuts.
[2917.84 --> 2918.36]  So that's kind of a
[2918.36 --> 2919.40]  cool solution for that.
[2920.46 --> 2921.72]  iPhone soccer again,
[2921.82 --> 2922.92]  I don't think that's
[2922.92 --> 2923.64]  going to be happening.
[2925.08 --> 2926.18]  We're not sponsored
[2926.18 --> 2927.54]  by the best damn
[2927.54 --> 2928.82]  screen protectors out
[2928.82 --> 2929.58]  there this year.
[2929.72 --> 2930.58]  We're sponsored by
[2930.58 --> 2931.14]  Squarespace!
[2931.38 --> 2932.02]  Build it beautiful!
[2932.02 --> 2935.90]  So maybe we'll have
[2935.90 --> 2936.90]  it super fun about
[2936.90 --> 2938.44]  kicking websites around.
[2938.98 --> 2939.82]  I doubt it.
[2941.86 --> 2942.76]  Looking forward to
[2942.76 --> 2943.98]  more VR shenanigans
[2943.98 --> 2945.38]  readily available to
[2945.38 --> 2945.86]  the public.
[2946.82 --> 2947.94]  Yep, that'll be cool.
[2948.10 --> 2949.24]  I don't think CES is
[2949.24 --> 2950.38]  going to be largely,
[2952.60 --> 2954.02]  like maybe at CES
[2954.02 --> 2954.78]  companies will be
[2954.78 --> 2955.50]  announcing their
[2955.50 --> 2956.54]  finalized dates of
[2956.54 --> 2956.86]  when you're going to
[2956.86 --> 2957.40]  be able to get them,
[2957.48 --> 2958.12]  or maybe they're going
[2958.12 --> 2959.18]  to be announcing the
[2959.18 --> 2959.98]  ability to pre-order
[2959.98 --> 2960.62]  them or something,
[2960.76 --> 2961.18]  but I don't think
[2961.18 --> 2961.60]  there's going to be
[2961.60 --> 2964.26]  any, obviously,
[2964.44 --> 2965.52]  like full-on releases
[2965.52 --> 2966.04]  there.
[2968.02 --> 2969.14]  HTC Vive breakthrough
[2969.14 --> 2970.22]  announcement, we will
[2970.22 --> 2970.60]  see.
[2970.76 --> 2971.54]  Hopefully that's good.
[2972.50 --> 2973.26]  Some new displays
[2973.26 --> 2973.90]  would be nice too.
[2974.02 --> 2974.96]  Displays are a fairly
[2974.96 --> 2975.92]  common thing.
[2977.22 --> 2978.54]  Oh wow, this is not
[2978.54 --> 2979.34]  working perfectly,
[2979.48 --> 2980.26]  so it needs to be
[2980.26 --> 2980.82]  there.
[2982.04 --> 2983.40]  So Jimmy Leander,
[2983.62 --> 2984.06]  Jimmy, Jimmy,
[2984.06 --> 2985.60]  Jimmy Leander,
[2985.82 --> 2986.58]  Jimmy Leander,
[2987.00 --> 2987.50]  I'm going to go with
[2987.50 --> 2987.78]  that.
[2988.32 --> 2989.26]  CES says some new
[2989.26 --> 2989.94]  displays would be nice
[2989.94 --> 2990.12]  too.
[2990.12 --> 2990.94]  That's actually fairly
[2990.94 --> 2991.30]  common.
[2991.42 --> 2992.14]  I think last year we
[2992.14 --> 2994.04]  had HP and LG
[2994.04 --> 2994.96]  talking about displays.
[2996.16 --> 2997.74]  Monitors and TVs
[2997.74 --> 2999.36]  are always definitely
[2999.36 --> 3000.48]  a thing at CES.
[3000.80 --> 3001.78]  So if there aren't
[3001.78 --> 3002.74]  monitors being a big
[3002.74 --> 3004.46]  thing, there will be
[3004.46 --> 3007.08]  TVs at the very least.
[3007.54 --> 3008.66]  The amount of 8K TVs
[3008.66 --> 3009.46]  this year is probably
[3009.46 --> 3010.62]  going to be annoyingly
[3010.62 --> 3011.02]  insane.
[3011.48 --> 3012.16]  Also excited for
[3012.16 --> 3013.12]  Linus drop tips
[3013.12 --> 3013.74]  2016.
[3014.36 --> 3015.74]  Any comment on that?
[3015.74 --> 3018.72]  I don't drop anything
[3018.72 --> 3019.32]  on purpose.
[3020.84 --> 3021.82]  Which is why it's
[3021.82 --> 3022.66]  even more exciting.
[3022.72 --> 3023.48]  I think that's why
[3023.48 --> 3024.30]  people like it.
[3026.70 --> 3027.74]  Alright, so no real
[3027.74 --> 3028.70]  comment on that other
[3028.70 --> 3029.52]  than that he doesn't do
[3029.52 --> 3030.14]  it on purpose.
[3031.70 --> 3032.50]  Moving down.
[3033.38 --> 3034.06]  People are excited for
[3034.06 --> 3034.94]  VR, that's good.
[3035.20 --> 3036.50]  Because I'm already
[3036.50 --> 3037.38]  planning a few videos
[3037.38 --> 3038.12]  on that hopefully.
[3038.36 --> 3039.52]  So hopefully you like
[3039.52 --> 3040.12]  it and share it and
[3040.12 --> 3040.86]  watch it and do all
[3040.86 --> 3041.60]  that kind of fun stuff
[3041.60 --> 3042.14]  so that I can keep
[3042.14 --> 3043.02]  doing videos on VR.
[3044.52 --> 3045.60]  More Linus dropping
[3045.60 --> 3046.06]  things.
[3046.20 --> 3046.44]  Wow.
[3047.52 --> 3047.96]  Ruthless.
[3052.88 --> 3053.94]  So to see some new
[3053.94 --> 3055.22]  PC cases, I think
[3055.22 --> 3057.52]  there's at least a few
[3057.52 --> 3058.36]  companies that I'm
[3058.36 --> 3059.20]  going to see that have
[3059.20 --> 3060.84]  PC cases and if that's
[3060.84 --> 3061.52]  true for me, there's
[3061.52 --> 3062.26]  probably some with
[3062.26 --> 3062.88]  Linus as well.
[3062.96 --> 3063.56]  So if you're excited
[3063.56 --> 3064.60]  for PC cases, that's
[3064.60 --> 3065.30]  probably going to be
[3065.30 --> 3065.60]  fine.
[3068.14 --> 3069.06]  We're probably not
[3069.06 --> 3069.46]  going to be playing
[3069.46 --> 3070.10]  soccer again.
[3070.10 --> 3073.08]  so unfortunately
[3073.08 --> 3074.06]  probably not.
[3078.04 --> 3079.16]  Linus' new top dog
[3079.16 --> 3079.54]  monitor?
[3083.48 --> 3084.34]  Linus' new best
[3084.34 --> 3084.98]  monitor yet?
[3085.34 --> 3085.58]  Maybe.
[3088.56 --> 3089.20]  Have you felt
[3089.20 --> 3089.78]  tremors?
[3089.98 --> 3090.88]  So someone's asking
[3090.88 --> 3092.02]  a not CES related
[3092.02 --> 3092.84]  question, which is
[3092.84 --> 3093.60]  probably more for
[3093.60 --> 3094.48]  Linus than for me.
[3095.22 --> 3096.12]  But he's asking about
[3096.12 --> 3096.94]  an earthquake that was
[3096.94 --> 3097.50]  up here recently.
[3097.60 --> 3098.22]  I don't think we felt
[3098.22 --> 3098.96]  it that hard, did we?
[3099.36 --> 3099.96]  You did?
[3100.10 --> 3101.10]  Oh yeah, I was in my
[3101.10 --> 3101.46]  office.
[3102.24 --> 3103.00]  So I was like one
[3103.00 --> 3103.62]  story up.
[3104.56 --> 3105.66]  It was crazy.
[3105.88 --> 3106.90]  And Taryn came like
[3106.90 --> 3108.32]  ripping up to my
[3108.32 --> 3109.02]  office and was like,
[3109.06 --> 3109.76]  holy crap, did you
[3109.76 --> 3110.20]  feel that?
[3110.38 --> 3111.06]  Was that an earthquake?
[3112.02 --> 3112.50]  Oh wow.
[3112.66 --> 3113.34]  I was watching the
[3113.34 --> 3114.16]  hit flip and I thought
[3114.16 --> 3115.02]  someone kicked my chair.
[3115.02 --> 3116.24]  I was asleep and I was
[3116.24 --> 3117.02]  asleep and I was like, I
[3117.02 --> 3117.50]  was asleep and had a crazy
[3117.50 --> 3119.06]  dream that like Colton
[3119.06 --> 3120.14]  died and I bought a
[3120.14 --> 3121.78]  plane and like weird
[3121.78 --> 3122.54]  things happened.
[3123.98 --> 3125.14]  I told Colton about it,
[3125.20 --> 3125.96]  it was funny, but it's
[3125.96 --> 3126.60]  a completely unrelated
[3126.60 --> 3126.98]  topic.
[3127.30 --> 3128.20]  But yeah, I had no idea
[3128.20 --> 3128.60]  it happened.
[3128.84 --> 3129.70]  But then when I woke up
[3129.70 --> 3130.28]  and everyone was freaking
[3130.28 --> 3131.30]  out about it, I was like,
[3131.36 --> 3132.30]  yeah, that makes sense as
[3132.30 --> 3133.06]  to what the hell my dream
[3133.06 --> 3133.44]  was about.
[3134.10 --> 3134.98]  So apparently I'm not
[3134.98 --> 3135.64]  going to wake up if
[3135.64 --> 3136.86]  there's a crazy freaking
[3136.86 --> 3138.36]  earthquake.
[3138.36 --> 3141.32]  Dale Caldwell says that
[3141.32 --> 3142.10]  he's interested in
[3142.10 --> 3143.28]  augmented reality.
[3143.68 --> 3145.02]  I really hope that's a
[3145.02 --> 3145.62]  thing this year.
[3146.50 --> 3147.80]  One of the problems that
[3147.80 --> 3148.84]  I foresee with augmented
[3148.84 --> 3152.64]  reality is that it has to
[3152.64 --> 3154.18]  be really, really, really
[3154.18 --> 3154.54]  good.
[3155.24 --> 3157.20]  VR actually has the lucky
[3157.20 --> 3158.40]  exception of being able to
[3158.40 --> 3159.60]  be constantly powered by
[3159.60 --> 3160.16]  a computer.
[3161.20 --> 3162.26]  Augmented reality is going
[3162.26 --> 3163.74]  to honestly in its ultimate
[3163.74 --> 3165.08]  form need to look like a
[3165.08 --> 3166.50]  very normal pair of glasses
[3166.50 --> 3167.86]  that happens to have the
[3167.86 --> 3169.90]  lenses are able to have
[3169.90 --> 3171.42]  projections on them somehow
[3171.42 --> 3173.28]  so you can see things on
[3173.28 --> 3174.08]  the normal lenses.
[3174.72 --> 3176.12]  I think that's one of the
[3176.12 --> 3176.98]  ultimate levels for
[3176.98 --> 3178.22]  augmented reality until they
[3178.22 --> 3179.68]  get it into contact lenses.
[3179.98 --> 3180.94]  But like, whoa, dang.
[3181.40 --> 3182.34]  So I don't know.
[3182.58 --> 3182.96]  We'll see.
[3183.38 --> 3184.28]  Mostly augmented reality
[3184.28 --> 3185.30]  stuff we've seen so far has
[3185.30 --> 3186.42]  been kind of not great.
[3187.12 --> 3189.72]  So I don't know.
[3190.22 --> 3191.28]  Yeah, people just saw Edsel
[3191.28 --> 3192.04]  in the LAN hoodie.
[3192.46 --> 3193.38]  I think that's still going to
[3193.38 --> 3194.24]  be a while until that's
[3194.24 --> 3195.16]  available, unfortunately.
[3196.02 --> 3197.00]  We'll get more to the show.
[3197.00 --> 3198.20]  What?
[3199.34 --> 3200.16]  That's awesome.
[3200.36 --> 3201.18]  Apparently I'm getting one
[3201.18 --> 3202.12]  at the show, so that's
[3202.12 --> 3202.36]  cool.
[3204.64 --> 3205.64]  Tons of people saying
[3205.64 --> 3206.86]  monitors and VR.
[3207.42 --> 3210.00]  So at least there's one
[3210.00 --> 3211.26]  category for each of us,
[3211.30 --> 3211.46]  right?
[3216.54 --> 3217.96]  Is that your text message,
[3218.06 --> 3218.16]  Tom?
[3218.94 --> 3219.86]  Oh, that's fun.
[3221.64 --> 3222.88]  Is she your Baymax?
[3222.88 --> 3228.30]  Someone says all you care
[3228.30 --> 3229.50]  about is Squarespace ads.
[3229.62 --> 3230.78]  That's good, because I think
[3230.78 --> 3232.06]  every video will have one.
[3232.98 --> 3234.94]  So hopefully you really like
[3234.94 --> 3235.76]  Squarespace ads.
[3237.22 --> 3239.14]  And you really like me saying
[3239.14 --> 3240.24]  Build It Beautiful, because
[3240.24 --> 3241.22]  I'm probably going to go ham
[3241.22 --> 3241.98]  the entire time.
[3242.20 --> 3243.32]  My voice is going to be gone
[3243.32 --> 3244.68]  near the end of it, too, if
[3244.68 --> 3245.68]  it's anything like previous
[3245.68 --> 3245.94]  years.
[3246.02 --> 3246.46]  So it's going to be like,
[3246.72 --> 3247.22]  Squarespace!
[3247.82 --> 3248.66]  Build It Beautiful!
[3248.66 --> 3250.14]  Which is probably going to be
[3250.14 --> 3251.92]  even better, so let me know.
[3252.54 --> 3253.52]  Linus dropping things and
[3253.52 --> 3253.98]  breaking them.
[3254.10 --> 3255.48]  Damn, you guys really didn't
[3255.48 --> 3256.46]  forget about that, did you?
[3262.86 --> 3263.76]  AMD Polaris?
[3263.88 --> 3264.82]  I'll see if it's going to be
[3264.82 --> 3265.00]  there.
[3265.08 --> 3266.02]  I'm the one going to the AMD
[3266.02 --> 3266.30]  booth.
[3266.46 --> 3267.44]  So hopefully they've got some
[3267.44 --> 3268.14]  really cool stuff.
[3271.26 --> 3272.88]  Excited for some Nvidia stuff.
[3273.56 --> 3275.60]  I think they have a VR thing?
[3275.60 --> 3276.68]  I'm not sure.
[3277.58 --> 3278.86]  It's probably just VR Gameworks.
[3280.40 --> 3281.38]  Oculus Consumer.
[3281.56 --> 3282.84]  I'm going to go to the
[3282.84 --> 3283.56]  Oculus booth.
[3284.88 --> 3286.72]  Their media contact is
[3286.72 --> 3288.06]  literally the hardest people
[3288.06 --> 3289.62]  to talk to ever, so we still
[3289.62 --> 3290.66]  don't have an actual media
[3290.66 --> 3291.50]  contact at Oculus.
[3291.92 --> 3293.26]  So I'm just going to go line
[3293.26 --> 3294.58]  up like I have at every show
[3294.58 --> 3295.54]  that we've done anything about
[3295.54 --> 3296.16]  Oculus with.
[3296.68 --> 3298.32]  So hopefully I can make that
[3298.32 --> 3299.02]  actually fit.
[3300.70 --> 3302.34]  But yeah, I will try.
[3302.34 --> 3306.14]  The exciting thing about Vive
[3306.14 --> 3307.44]  and Oculus Consumer version,
[3307.68 --> 3308.96]  if you're excited for those
[3308.96 --> 3310.46]  news from CES, is that
[3310.46 --> 3311.28]  they're probably coming out
[3311.28 --> 3312.04]  relatively soon.
[3312.24 --> 3313.00]  So you don't have to worry
[3313.00 --> 3314.80]  about seeing it from CES
[3314.80 --> 3316.66]  and then waiting a ridiculously
[3316.66 --> 3317.78]  long period of time.
[3318.68 --> 3319.34]  That spoiler?
[3320.48 --> 3321.06]  What spoiler?
[3323.16 --> 3324.76]  Oh, I think someone said
[3324.76 --> 3325.70]  something about Star Wars.
[3325.70 --> 3325.76]  Star Wars.
[3325.76 --> 3325.80]  Star Wars.
[3325.80 --> 3327.70]  Star Wars.
[3327.70 --> 3327.76]  Star Wars.
[3327.76 --> 3328.20]  Star Wars.
[3328.20 --> 3328.70]  Star Wars.
[3328.70 --> 3328.76]  Star Wars.
[3328.76 --> 3329.76]  Star Wars.
[3329.76 --> 3329.82]  Star Wars.
[3329.82 --> 3329.86]  Star Wars.
[3329.86 --> 3330.32]  Star Wars.
[3330.32 --> 3330.82]  Star Wars.
[3330.82 --> 3330.86]  Star Wars.
[3330.86 --> 3331.32]  Star Wars.
[3331.32 --> 3332.32]  Star Wars.
[3332.32 --> 3333.32]  Star Wars.
[3333.32 --> 3334.44]  Super excited to see some
[3334.44 --> 3335.20]  advances in VR.
[3335.20 --> 3337.36]  Okay, I think I might be done
[3337.36 --> 3338.18]  with this Twitter blitz.
[3338.18 --> 3339.44]  Basically everyone's saying
[3339.44 --> 3340.28]  the same things.
[3340.50 --> 3341.56]  Home automation, VR,
[3342.00 --> 3343.26]  monitors, and Linus drops
[3343.26 --> 3343.66]  things.
[3344.88 --> 3347.32]  So, someone said VR and
[3347.32 --> 3347.92]  sex dolls.
[3348.22 --> 3350.52]  I don't think that they're
[3350.52 --> 3351.46]  going to, oh, I just
[3351.46 --> 3352.18]  deleted my thing.
[3353.64 --> 3354.38]  That's awkward.
[3355.34 --> 3356.48]  I don't know where it is.
[3357.22 --> 3357.96]  I'm not going to have a lower
[3357.96 --> 3358.80]  third for the rest of the
[3358.80 --> 3360.34]  show because I literally
[3360.34 --> 3361.14]  just deleted it.
[3361.14 --> 3362.86]  So, that's unfortunate.
[3362.86 --> 3364.06]  But it's probably fine.
[3364.06 --> 3365.06]  Um...
[3365.06 --> 3372.10]  I was trying to delete the
[3372.10 --> 3374.34]  Twitter one and deleted the
[3374.34 --> 3375.42]  wrong one and then also
[3375.42 --> 3376.38]  deleted the Twitter one.
[3376.38 --> 3378.10]  So, that's probably fine.
[3378.10 --> 3379.30]  Um...
[3379.30 --> 3381.38]  Oh, this is actually totally
[3381.38 --> 3381.68]  cool.
[3382.38 --> 3383.14]  There's a totally
[3383.14 --> 3385.14]  experimental CPU that is
[3385.14 --> 3388.30]  integrated with optical logic,
[3388.30 --> 3390.38]  which promises significant
[3390.38 --> 3391.34]  power reductions.
[3391.72 --> 3393.56]  There's some quotes here that
[3393.56 --> 3395.26]  are saying things like the
[3395.26 --> 3397.44]  estimated power usage of data
[3397.44 --> 3400.10]  centers is like 20 to 30%
[3400.10 --> 3401.44]  based on just transferring
[3401.44 --> 3402.46]  data within themselves.
[3402.58 --> 3403.46]  Nick is apparently going to
[3403.46 --> 3404.44]  fix the lower third, I'm
[3404.44 --> 3404.72]  assuming.
[3405.14 --> 3405.22]  Oh, I was...
[3405.22 --> 3406.54]  Nope, he's doing something
[3406.54 --> 3406.78]  else.
[3406.86 --> 3407.18]  Screw the...
[3407.18 --> 3407.94]  No, don't even...
[3407.94 --> 3408.60]  It doesn't even matter.
[3409.06 --> 3409.88]  No one wants it anyways.
[3411.00 --> 3411.44]  Okay.
[3411.78 --> 3412.88]  Apparently he's fixing it.
[3413.50 --> 3413.94]  Um...
[3413.94 --> 3415.64]  And this should help quite a
[3415.64 --> 3415.86]  bit.
[3416.02 --> 3417.94]  So, they're essentially...
[3417.94 --> 3420.26]  This is a very odd topic,
[3420.34 --> 3421.10]  to be completely honest.
[3421.10 --> 3422.88]  Researchers say that, uh,
[3423.02 --> 3425.46]  it's 10 to 50 times the rate
[3425.46 --> 3426.92]  for a comparable electronic
[3426.92 --> 3429.08]  microprocessor, uh, because it
[3429.08 --> 3429.10]  can...
[3429.10 --> 3430.10]  What is...
[3430.10 --> 3431.14]  Data transfer in the
[3431.14 --> 3432.76]  prototype occurred at 300
[3432.76 --> 3434.40]  gigabytes per square
[3434.40 --> 3436.80]  millimeter, which is kind of
[3436.80 --> 3437.26]  obscene.
[3437.36 --> 3438.34]  Something to remember about
[3438.34 --> 3439.90]  this topic is that it
[3439.90 --> 3440.88]  started with totally
[3440.88 --> 3442.44]  experimental, and there's
[3442.44 --> 3444.38]  still giant problems like
[3444.38 --> 3446.18]  light leaking out of the
[3446.18 --> 3448.96]  chip, meaning that you
[3448.96 --> 3452.06]  could, uh, you know, lose
[3452.06 --> 3453.54]  data and things wouldn't
[3453.54 --> 3454.98]  exactly be reliable at all.
[3455.24 --> 3456.86]  That totally sounds like a
[3456.86 --> 3458.10]  problem that they can and
[3458.10 --> 3460.26]  will solve, but it just
[3460.26 --> 3461.12]  feeds into the totally
[3461.12 --> 3462.30]  experimental side of things.
[3462.30 --> 3463.36]  If we see this, it won't be
[3463.36 --> 3463.84]  for a while.
[3465.30 --> 3465.74]  Um...
[3465.74 --> 3470.64]  Yeah, electrical engineer
[3470.64 --> 3473.02]  Cheyenne Mokherja, hopefully
[3473.02 --> 3474.62]  I say that correctly, um,
[3474.62 --> 3475.90]  says that making chips like
[3475.90 --> 3477.84]  this required etching off
[3477.84 --> 3479.44]  part of the silicon, although
[3479.44 --> 3480.54]  I still don't necessarily
[3480.54 --> 3481.64]  understand what he means by
[3481.64 --> 3482.84]  that, because if you're
[3482.84 --> 3484.68]  adding in optical connectors,
[3485.06 --> 3486.28]  I would expect you to just
[3486.28 --> 3487.74]  make a whole new one, not,
[3487.82 --> 3489.12]  like, etch part of your
[3489.12 --> 3489.98]  current one off.
[3490.28 --> 3491.10]  But maybe that's why it's
[3491.10 --> 3491.86]  totally experimental.
[3492.64 --> 3493.06]  I don't know.
[3493.94 --> 3494.98]  We've got another topic in
[3494.98 --> 3495.88]  here, which is actually kind
[3495.88 --> 3497.42]  of funny, because I reviewed
[3497.42 --> 3498.18]  this controller.
[3498.54 --> 3500.44]  The topic name is that why
[3500.44 --> 3501.98]  Microsoft can't keep the
[3501.98 --> 3504.00]  $150 Xbox Elite controller
[3504.00 --> 3504.60]  in stock.
[3505.04 --> 3508.46]  And there's a ton of comments
[3508.46 --> 3510.28]  on this, but basically what it
[3510.28 --> 3511.68]  comes down to, I'm going to
[3511.68 --> 3515.44]  share the MSN, wait, I'm going
[3515.44 --> 3518.28]  to share the MSN news link, is
[3518.28 --> 3520.54]  that they looked at the market,
[3520.80 --> 3522.30]  saw that basically everyone
[3522.30 --> 3524.06]  was using, all the pro guys
[3524.06 --> 3525.44]  were using scuff controllers,
[3526.08 --> 3527.66]  thought that it was relatively
[3527.66 --> 3528.90]  saturated, but wanted to
[3528.90 --> 3529.70]  release this controller
[3529.70 --> 3531.38]  anyways, gave it to some
[3531.38 --> 3531.74]  people.
[3531.86 --> 3533.24]  Those people said, yeah, it's
[3533.24 --> 3534.14]  cool, but it's really
[3534.14 --> 3535.14]  expensive, so I don't expect
[3535.14 --> 3536.18]  that many people to buy it.
[3536.42 --> 3537.80]  Then they released it, and a
[3537.80 --> 3539.50]  whole bunch of people wanted
[3539.50 --> 3541.80]  to buy it, so they didn't
[3541.80 --> 3543.18]  pre-produce as many as they
[3543.18 --> 3544.18]  were hoping for.
[3545.40 --> 3546.78]  They're estimating that
[3546.78 --> 3548.70]  Microsoft has made 500,000
[3548.70 --> 3551.38]  controllers, and that's
[3551.38 --> 3553.20]  apparently not nearly enough.
[3554.74 --> 3555.60]  I don't know.
[3556.24 --> 3557.78]  I think that scuff is probably
[3557.78 --> 3558.96]  super happy that Microsoft
[3558.96 --> 3560.20]  can't keep their controllers
[3560.20 --> 3562.36]  in stock, but another thing
[3562.36 --> 3564.20]  that I've heard actually before
[3564.20 --> 3566.08]  reading this article is that
[3566.08 --> 3567.92]  scuff hasn't felt too much of a
[3567.92 --> 3568.66]  hit from this.
[3568.66 --> 3570.46]  I'm expecting that it's
[3570.46 --> 3573.20]  more not necessarily the
[3573.20 --> 3575.14]  console pro gamers or
[3575.14 --> 3577.86]  console super crazy high-end
[3577.86 --> 3578.94]  gamers that are buying the
[3578.94 --> 3579.88]  Xbox Elite controller.
[3580.04 --> 3581.84]  I'm assuming it's probably
[3581.84 --> 3583.88]  more like, I play a lot of
[3583.88 --> 3585.34]  Xbox games and would like a
[3585.34 --> 3586.08]  way better controller
[3586.08 --> 3587.30]  experience, so I'm going to
[3587.30 --> 3587.96]  grab this thing.
[3589.32 --> 3590.26]  I think that's cool.
[3590.34 --> 3591.36]  I actually really liked it,
[3591.44 --> 3592.66]  and I could understand PC
[3592.66 --> 3594.18]  gamers buying it as well if
[3594.18 --> 3594.98]  you're someone who would use
[3594.98 --> 3596.34]  a controller a lot for PC
[3596.34 --> 3598.24]  games, which is definitely a
[3598.24 --> 3599.92]  thing, and before PCMR people
[3599.92 --> 3600.50]  freak out.
[3600.96 --> 3602.04]  There's games that work for
[3602.04 --> 3603.80]  that action-based games,
[3603.92 --> 3604.90]  stuff like Assassin's Creed.
[3604.98 --> 3605.84]  I prefer to play with a
[3605.84 --> 3606.14]  controller.
[3607.06 --> 3607.90]  Racing games.
[3608.50 --> 3609.26]  If you don't have a racing
[3609.26 --> 3611.16]  wheel, keyboard and mouse is
[3611.16 --> 3612.68]  kind of not the greatest for
[3612.68 --> 3612.92]  that.
[3614.36 --> 3615.74]  Space Metal Gear Solid,
[3615.98 --> 3616.34]  apparently.
[3616.34 --> 3618.40]  Brandon likes it better on
[3618.40 --> 3618.72]  controller.
[3618.72 --> 3619.98]  I haven't played that one yet.
[3620.22 --> 3621.02]  I don't know.
[3621.34 --> 3621.72]  Whatever.
[3622.96 --> 3624.30]  A lot of space games are
[3624.30 --> 3625.46]  getting popular now.
[3625.84 --> 3629.82]  I've seen ads for, oh crap,
[3630.18 --> 3631.88]  Elite Dangerous in movie
[3631.88 --> 3633.10]  theaters and stuff recently,
[3633.28 --> 3636.00]  and on TV, which is kind of
[3636.00 --> 3636.94]  crazy, actually.
[3637.12 --> 3638.76]  Star Citizen has done some
[3638.76 --> 3639.98]  alpha thing recently that you
[3639.98 --> 3641.08]  would probably prefer to play
[3641.08 --> 3642.00]  with a controller over a
[3642.00 --> 3643.60]  keyboard and mouse, but I'm not
[3643.60 --> 3643.90]  sure.
[3644.34 --> 3645.68]  I personally use my Hotas.
[3646.98 --> 3650.64]  So, whatever it is, I don't
[3650.64 --> 3650.86]  know.
[3651.12 --> 3651.88]  You do you, man.
[3653.82 --> 3655.78]  Apparently more than 9,000 UK
[3655.78 --> 3658.34]  households are saying that
[3658.34 --> 3659.36]  they still watch black and
[3659.36 --> 3659.84]  white TV.
[3660.04 --> 3662.34]  You need a different license
[3662.34 --> 3665.36]  for watching different things.
[3665.48 --> 3666.60]  I don't really know how the
[3666.60 --> 3669.28]  whole UK viewing TV thing
[3669.28 --> 3670.42]  works.
[3670.84 --> 3672.10]  I've heard that you have to
[3672.10 --> 3673.10]  have a license.
[3673.10 --> 3674.18]  that it's not really an
[3674.18 --> 3675.12]  option, and that's how they
[3675.12 --> 3678.52]  fund the BBC stuff.
[3678.74 --> 3679.18]  I don't know.
[3679.46 --> 3680.64]  But black and white licenses
[3680.64 --> 3682.74]  cost 50 pounds, while color
[3682.74 --> 3684.90]  licenses cost 150 pounds.
[3685.22 --> 3686.74]  So, I'm kind of wondering if
[3686.74 --> 3688.80]  some people have found a way to
[3688.80 --> 3690.76]  do something so they still get
[3690.76 --> 3692.00]  color signals and they can pay
[3692.00 --> 3692.66]  less for it.
[3692.98 --> 3693.96]  But, who knows?
[3694.10 --> 3695.48]  Apparently there's still a ton of
[3695.48 --> 3697.26]  people with black and white TVs
[3697.26 --> 3697.92]  in the UK.
[3698.20 --> 3698.82]  That's pretty weird.
[3700.96 --> 3702.54]  Other random news from around
[3702.54 --> 3703.82]  the world because not a ton of
[3703.82 --> 3705.44]  stuff happens before CES and we
[3705.44 --> 3706.52]  have to find something to talk
[3706.52 --> 3707.50]  about in this segment while I'm
[3707.50 --> 3708.04]  by myself.
[3709.58 --> 3710.78]  Belgium, their biggest
[3710.78 --> 3712.76]  advertisement board, which is
[3712.76 --> 3713.84]  apparently massive.
[3714.00 --> 3715.22]  It looks massive if you see the
[3715.22 --> 3715.50]  picture.
[3715.76 --> 3717.04]  I'll show you guys here in a
[3717.04 --> 3717.24]  moment.
[3717.70 --> 3720.44]  Was hijacked or hacked or whatever
[3720.44 --> 3721.18]  you want to call it.
[3721.18 --> 3722.80]  And they did some pretty funny
[3722.80 --> 3723.22]  things.
[3723.34 --> 3725.02]  You can see there there used to be a
[3725.02 --> 3727.06]  Coca-Cola ice cold drink Coca-Cola
[3727.06 --> 3727.74]  ad thing.
[3728.20 --> 3730.34]  And then they trolled the crap out
[3730.34 --> 3732.46]  of it by putting on a troll face,
[3732.60 --> 3734.84]  which I find, while it's illegal,
[3735.14 --> 3735.80]  kind of hilarious.
[3736.34 --> 3737.60]  They did some other things,
[3737.66 --> 3737.86]  apparently.
[3737.96 --> 3739.06]  I don't know if the photos of them
[3739.06 --> 3739.96]  are in here.
[3740.20 --> 3741.40]  No, it doesn't look like it.
[3743.02 --> 3743.80]  Here it is.
[3744.06 --> 3745.58]  On the roof of the Coca-Cola logo,
[3745.80 --> 3746.80]  there's a series of images.
[3746.80 --> 3749.10]  One that says, hello BXL.
[3749.24 --> 3750.74]  Another one that featured the
[3750.74 --> 3752.98]  Coca-Cola logo with naked breasts
[3752.98 --> 3753.60]  in the background.
[3754.02 --> 3755.74]  So I don't know if Coca-Cola was
[3755.74 --> 3757.34]  necessarily that mad about that.
[3758.20 --> 3759.84]  And they did a few other things.
[3759.94 --> 3761.86]  One of the silly parts was that
[3761.86 --> 3763.14]  the guys that did this filmed
[3763.14 --> 3764.30]  themselves doing it.
[3764.78 --> 3766.90]  And I've heard that there's been
[3766.90 --> 3770.44]  complaints filed against whose
[3770.44 --> 3772.22]  faces have been made unrecognizable
[3772.22 --> 3772.88]  in the video below.
[3773.00 --> 3774.48]  Yeah, so they showed their faces.
[3774.66 --> 3775.98]  I don't see where the video below is.
[3775.98 --> 3778.04]  Oh, this is probably the video below.
[3779.34 --> 3780.22]  I'm going to mute it.
[3780.66 --> 3781.68]  I thought that was an image.
[3783.74 --> 3784.82]  Yes, this is the video below.
[3784.92 --> 3785.78]  We'll see if it even plays.
[3785.88 --> 3786.76]  It's trying to load right now.
[3787.30 --> 3789.02]  But like, they showed their faces
[3789.02 --> 3791.22]  in the video that they filmed
[3791.22 --> 3792.96]  of them hacking this panel.
[3792.96 --> 3794.96]  Which, like...
[3794.96 --> 3798.50]  You guys are so dumb.
[3799.88 --> 3800.60]  I don't know.
[3802.06 --> 3803.42]  Yeah, highly illegal.
[3803.60 --> 3804.38]  And they're probably going to get
[3804.38 --> 3805.50]  screwed over now because they
[3805.50 --> 3806.72]  showed their faces on the thing.
[3808.26 --> 3809.70]  Although, them getting screwed over
[3809.70 --> 3810.88]  is probably fair because
[3810.88 --> 3812.74]  they hacked something and put
[3812.74 --> 3814.34]  nude images on it behind
[3814.34 --> 3815.42]  company logos and stuff.
[3815.52 --> 3816.54]  So, I don't know.
[3816.70 --> 3817.12]  Whatever.
[3817.34 --> 3818.34]  You can decide what to think
[3818.34 --> 3819.18]  what you think about that.
[3819.26 --> 3820.10]  I think it's kind of funny,
[3820.20 --> 3821.08]  but not a good thing.
[3821.36 --> 3822.66]  So, oh well.
[3824.24 --> 3826.38]  Intel has acquired a company
[3826.38 --> 3827.18]  called Altera,
[3827.56 --> 3828.88]  which is an FPGA,
[3828.88 --> 3832.36]  field programmable gate array company.
[3832.36 --> 3834.44]  Altera seems to be quite happy about it,
[3834.50 --> 3836.00]  which is probably not too surprising.
[3837.80 --> 3839.62]  Dan McNamara,
[3840.10 --> 3844.02]  which is an Altera veteran
[3844.02 --> 3846.66]  who I think led this whole takeover thing,
[3847.00 --> 3848.40]  says that combining Altera's
[3848.40 --> 3850.10]  industry-leading FPGA tech
[3850.10 --> 3851.44]  and customer support
[3851.44 --> 3852.76]  with Intel's world-class
[3852.76 --> 3854.64]  semiconductor manufacturing capabilities
[3854.64 --> 3855.84]  will enable customers
[3855.84 --> 3858.00]  to create the next generation
[3858.00 --> 3859.56]  of electronic systems
[3859.56 --> 3860.76]  with unmatched performance
[3860.76 --> 3861.80]  and power efficiency,
[3862.28 --> 3863.90]  which is actually pretty sick.
[3864.20 --> 3865.02]  Everyone in chat is like,
[3865.08 --> 3865.96]  just a prank, bro.
[3866.50 --> 3866.88]  Yeah.
[3867.40 --> 3868.50]  I wonder if that was actually
[3868.50 --> 3869.46]  what happened in the video.
[3869.86 --> 3871.22]  That would be kind of hilarious.
[3871.86 --> 3872.98]  People in chat are talking about
[3872.98 --> 3875.00]  Activision buying MLG
[3875.00 --> 3876.22]  for $43 million.
[3876.22 --> 3879.10]  I'm going to be completely honest.
[3879.22 --> 3880.54]  I had not heard about that,
[3881.04 --> 3884.00]  but it's on WCCF Tech.
[3884.26 --> 3885.14]  So if you want to check it out,
[3885.20 --> 3886.60]  you can go there and check it out.
[3888.56 --> 3889.94]  Apparently they bought MLG.
[3891.18 --> 3892.02]  So now what?
[3892.30 --> 3893.66]  It's Activision, Blizzard,
[3894.46 --> 3895.62]  King, and MLG.
[3896.88 --> 3899.44]  Maybe Blizzard will finally get good
[3899.44 --> 3901.30]  at, you know,
[3902.14 --> 3903.54]  having competitive titles.
[3903.54 --> 3907.48]  WoW's Arena has been a disaster
[3907.48 --> 3908.34]  ever since the start.
[3908.44 --> 3908.96]  Actually, I think,
[3909.00 --> 3910.40]  getting kicked out of MLG.
[3910.64 --> 3912.34]  So maybe WoW's Arena
[3912.34 --> 3913.60]  will be back in MLG.
[3914.38 --> 3916.80]  And I've been constantly frustrated
[3916.80 --> 3918.64]  by them basically abandoning games.
[3918.90 --> 3920.18]  My brother was a caster
[3920.18 --> 3921.50]  at ColdSC on Twitter
[3921.50 --> 3923.24]  for StarCraft for a while,
[3923.44 --> 3924.92]  and they did nothing
[3924.92 --> 3926.14]  to help StarCraft.
[3926.26 --> 3927.18]  They actually hindered
[3927.18 --> 3929.12]  the progress of StarCraft
[3929.12 --> 3930.12]  competitive scene,
[3930.20 --> 3932.00]  which is extremely frustrating.
[3932.00 --> 3933.86]  Heroes of the Storm.
[3934.78 --> 3935.78]  They don't really seem
[3935.78 --> 3936.80]  to be doing a whole lot
[3936.80 --> 3937.96]  to help in that department.
[3938.16 --> 3938.70]  Hearthstone,
[3938.84 --> 3940.00]  they pushed really hard
[3940.00 --> 3940.60]  for a while.
[3941.20 --> 3942.24]  And then,
[3942.32 --> 3943.00]  I don't know.
[3943.16 --> 3944.52]  They seem to just make games
[3944.52 --> 3945.14]  and then go,
[3945.36 --> 3946.48]  I don't know.
[3948.50 --> 3950.04]  Maybe with the acquisition
[3950.04 --> 3950.70]  of MLG,
[3950.82 --> 3952.18]  they can push super hard
[3952.18 --> 3953.16]  with Overwatch.
[3954.12 --> 3955.18]  That would be cool.
[3956.08 --> 3956.76]  I don't know.
[3956.90 --> 3958.18]  I really want Overwatch to work.
[3958.58 --> 3959.82]  I want competitive Blizzard games
[3959.82 --> 3960.40]  to be a thing.
[3962.68 --> 3963.74]  Sorry about the frustration.
[3964.04 --> 3964.76]  Look at Diablo.
[3965.04 --> 3966.24]  That's like all I have to say.
[3967.10 --> 3967.34]  Okay.
[3968.26 --> 3969.40]  Moving on.
[3972.14 --> 3973.06]  I don't think I'm going to do
[3973.06 --> 3973.96]  that many more topics
[3973.96 --> 3974.46]  than I'm probably
[3974.46 --> 3975.44]  going to get out of here.
[3977.54 --> 3977.82]  Oops.
[3978.38 --> 3979.20]  I think that's actually
[3979.20 --> 3980.32]  probably it for topics.
[3982.00 --> 3982.66]  Oh, right.
[3982.74 --> 3984.04]  This is actually kind of awesome
[3984.04 --> 3987.12]  and funny in the same sentence.
[3987.30 --> 3988.80]  Switzerland is
[3988.80 --> 3990.54]  really, really, really, really,
[3990.54 --> 3991.20]  really driving
[3991.20 --> 3992.80]  for a universal phone charger
[3992.80 --> 3993.94]  for everything.
[3994.42 --> 3995.48]  All the phones.
[3995.74 --> 3997.00]  Not just Android phones.
[3997.22 --> 3998.22]  Not just Apple phones.
[3998.92 --> 3999.82]  All the phones.
[4000.52 --> 4001.48]  I'm not going to bother
[4001.48 --> 4002.26]  switch to the website
[4002.26 --> 4003.98]  because it's Vice
[4003.98 --> 4004.86]  and apparently Vice
[4004.86 --> 4007.34]  is all ads at this point.
[4008.10 --> 4008.54]  Literally.
[4008.80 --> 4009.00]  Okay.
[4009.14 --> 4009.68]  Look at this.
[4010.18 --> 4010.98]  I'm going to switch my screen.
[4010.98 --> 4012.68]  You can't even see the title
[4012.68 --> 4014.34]  of the article
[4014.34 --> 4015.14]  because the picture
[4015.14 --> 4016.34]  for the article is so big
[4016.34 --> 4017.56]  and then the ad
[4017.56 --> 4018.92]  is so big
[4018.92 --> 4019.88]  that it actually pushes
[4019.88 --> 4021.26]  the entire article
[4021.26 --> 4022.76]  off of the front
[4022.76 --> 4023.24]  of the fold
[4023.24 --> 4023.78]  of the website.
[4024.54 --> 4024.78]  So,
[4025.34 --> 4026.34]  that's crazy.
[4026.98 --> 4028.52]  We're going to jump back
[4028.52 --> 4030.44]  to my docs
[4030.44 --> 4031.02]  so that I can actually
[4031.02 --> 4032.06]  read things about it.
[4032.54 --> 4033.34]  Mobile phones
[4033.34 --> 4034.76]  will have to be compatible
[4034.76 --> 4036.62]  with a universal charger
[4036.62 --> 4039.12]  by mid-2017
[4039.12 --> 4040.52]  at the latest.
[4041.94 --> 4042.30]  Uh,
[4042.54 --> 4043.46]  I think they probably
[4043.46 --> 4044.42]  already are
[4044.42 --> 4046.04]  because there's cables
[4046.04 --> 4046.62]  that are universal.
[4046.70 --> 4047.22]  Are you just going to like
[4047.22 --> 4047.94]  drink alcohol
[4047.94 --> 4048.44]  in the stream?
[4049.68 --> 4050.22]  It is
[4050.22 --> 4051.70]  New Year's
[4051.70 --> 4052.16]  Day?
[4052.58 --> 4053.06]  Whatever?
[4053.24 --> 4053.48]  No.
[4054.60 --> 4054.84]  Yeah.
[4054.96 --> 4055.52]  Oh, no.
[4055.60 --> 4056.18]  That's tomorrow.
[4056.40 --> 4056.70]  New Year's Eve.
[4057.48 --> 4057.92]  No.
[4058.06 --> 4058.24]  No.
[4058.32 --> 4058.50]  Yeah.
[4058.64 --> 4058.90]  Okay.
[4059.68 --> 4060.22]  It's New Year's.
[4060.22 --> 4061.18]  Are you already drunk?
[4061.42 --> 4061.78]  No.
[4062.28 --> 4063.86]  No, it's not open yet.
[4064.06 --> 4064.38]  Okay.
[4064.52 --> 4064.76]  Okay.
[4064.82 --> 4066.14]  So, our construction company
[4066.14 --> 4066.74]  sent this over.
[4066.80 --> 4067.50]  I don't know what Luke
[4067.50 --> 4068.38]  was talking about
[4068.38 --> 4069.58]  before I got here.
[4069.58 --> 4070.28]  It's not that important.
[4070.98 --> 4071.80]  I kind of ran out
[4071.80 --> 4072.60]  of interesting topics
[4072.60 --> 4073.38]  to be honest.
[4073.70 --> 4074.74]  Like a while ago.
[4074.90 --> 4075.62]  Why are we sitting
[4075.62 --> 4076.78]  on top of this cable?
[4076.92 --> 4078.18]  It's completely in the way.
[4078.26 --> 4078.84]  Want to speed your group?
[4079.64 --> 4079.96]  Okay.
[4080.14 --> 4080.76]  You know what?
[4080.80 --> 4081.92]  I'm going to fix this.
[4082.10 --> 4082.28]  Okay.
[4082.36 --> 4083.24]  Get up off your chair.
[4083.24 --> 4086.28]  I'm getting in here.
[4086.90 --> 4088.48]  I'm organizing things.
[4088.70 --> 4088.92]  Oh, yeah.
[4088.92 --> 4089.98]  Things are going to get better.
[4090.08 --> 4090.68]  You did a lot.
[4091.00 --> 4092.00]  So, you're just going to
[4092.00 --> 4092.56]  keep talking
[4092.56 --> 4093.66]  and I'm going to keep drinking.
[4094.54 --> 4094.90]  Okay.
[4095.36 --> 4095.98]  So, anyway,
[4096.14 --> 4097.10]  Switzerland wants
[4097.10 --> 4098.08]  universal charger.
[4098.34 --> 4099.38]  It has to be compatible
[4099.38 --> 4100.82]  with a universal charger.
[4101.08 --> 4101.82]  I think they kind of
[4101.82 --> 4102.48]  already are.
[4102.64 --> 4104.10]  It just needs multiple ends.
[4104.10 --> 4105.02]  So, I'm assuming
[4105.02 --> 4105.92]  that they want it
[4105.92 --> 4106.44]  to be compatible
[4106.44 --> 4107.46]  with a charger
[4107.46 --> 4108.76]  that is able to plug
[4108.76 --> 4109.70]  directly in
[4109.70 --> 4111.18]  to whatever phone it is.
[4111.48 --> 4112.34]  I think they're probably
[4112.34 --> 4113.02]  going to have a lot
[4113.02 --> 4114.28]  of backlash from Apple
[4114.28 --> 4114.98]  on this one.
[4115.12 --> 4116.72]  So, we'll see how that works.
[4117.16 --> 4118.10]  I think, yeah,
[4118.16 --> 4119.14]  it says the European Union
[4119.14 --> 4120.64]  has previously voted on this
[4120.64 --> 4121.86]  and Switzerland is bringing
[4121.86 --> 4122.94]  itself in line
[4122.94 --> 4123.88]  with regulations.
[4124.60 --> 4126.10]  So, yeah.
[4126.10 --> 4127.82]  I don't really see
[4127.82 --> 4128.90]  this being a huge thing
[4128.90 --> 4129.88]  unless basically
[4129.88 --> 4130.72]  all of the EU
[4130.72 --> 4131.46]  gets behind it
[4131.46 --> 4132.62]  but we'll see what happens.
[4133.04 --> 4133.34]  Do you know how
[4133.34 --> 4134.16]  to properly open those?
[4134.20 --> 4135.28]  I have no idea.
[4135.60 --> 4135.88]  Alright.
[4138.40 --> 4139.56]  Yeah, just pull on it.
[4139.66 --> 4139.98]  I mean,
[4140.26 --> 4141.22]  I would assume.
[4143.48 --> 4144.50]  I don't know.
[4144.62 --> 4145.60]  It's hard.
[4146.14 --> 4147.04]  I would turn it.
[4147.54 --> 4147.96]  Turn?
[4148.26 --> 4148.60]  No.
[4149.86 --> 4150.34]  Oh!
[4151.62 --> 4153.38]  That does make sense.
[4153.90 --> 4154.96]  I've never opened
[4154.96 --> 4155.62]  one of those either
[4155.62 --> 4156.80]  but looking at the construction.
[4157.32 --> 4158.20]  It pops, right?
[4158.32 --> 4158.88]  It's going to shoot.
[4158.98 --> 4159.72]  Don't aim it at me.
[4159.88 --> 4161.22]  You should put like a...
[4161.22 --> 4162.30]  A bucket over it?
[4162.34 --> 4163.20]  Usually you put like
[4163.20 --> 4164.06]  a rag over it
[4164.06 --> 4165.56]  or like this cloud over it.
[4165.78 --> 4166.40]  Or you can let it
[4166.40 --> 4167.66]  hit the expensive light.
[4168.72 --> 4169.48]  Here, use this.
[4169.92 --> 4170.48]  What is it?
[4170.62 --> 4171.68]  It's a Wancho Swinger.
[4171.74 --> 4172.66]  Well, not anymore.
[4173.10 --> 4173.88]  Yeah, so you start
[4173.88 --> 4174.66]  because you'll start
[4174.66 --> 4175.78]  twisting, twisting, twisting.
[4176.04 --> 4176.32]  Really?
[4176.44 --> 4176.62]  And all of a sudden
[4176.62 --> 4177.54]  it's like boom!
[4177.80 --> 4178.10]  Okay.
[4178.40 --> 4179.22]  Here we go.
[4179.86 --> 4180.22]  Are you allowed
[4180.22 --> 4181.06]  to drink on Twitch?
[4182.10 --> 4182.84]  I don't know.
[4182.94 --> 4183.62]  Maybe just don't.
[4183.72 --> 4184.70]  Maybe just don't.
[4184.70 --> 4186.02]  It's not open yet.
[4186.36 --> 4186.86]  Are you allowed to...
[4186.86 --> 4186.96]  Oh!
[4187.74 --> 4188.18]  Whoa!
[4188.66 --> 4189.16]  Hey, oh!
[4189.28 --> 4189.68]  Wow!
[4190.22 --> 4191.80]  That really exploded.
[4191.98 --> 4192.92]  I wasn't joking, dog!
[4193.08 --> 4194.18]  Now there's foam everywhere
[4194.18 --> 4194.74]  so watch out.
[4195.28 --> 4195.70]  Is it?
[4195.92 --> 4196.10]  Yeah.
[4196.16 --> 4196.94]  Away from computers.
[4197.10 --> 4197.50]  Oh, it smells.
[4197.90 --> 4198.34]  Oh, you're good.
[4198.80 --> 4199.54]  Well, that was that.
[4199.66 --> 4200.50]  That was exciting.
[4200.66 --> 4201.16]  Don't drink it.
[4201.20 --> 4201.92]  I'm not going to drink it
[4201.92 --> 4202.98]  but that was amazing.
[4203.12 --> 4203.38]  Okay.
[4203.96 --> 4205.28]  Now I've got to go find the cork.
[4206.14 --> 4206.54]  What?
[4206.94 --> 4207.20]  I'm glad...
[4207.20 --> 4207.78]  You didn't catch it
[4207.78 --> 4208.22]  with the sweater?
[4208.22 --> 4209.24]  I don't know.
[4211.14 --> 4212.44]  He shot through it.
[4213.04 --> 4213.98]  It shot through it.
[4214.00 --> 4215.08]  I don't think it shot through it.
[4215.08 --> 4215.20]  I only know this because
[4215.20 --> 4216.02]  I've dented a roof.
[4216.60 --> 4217.72]  Dented a roof.
[4218.00 --> 4218.56]  There we go.
[4218.62 --> 4219.38]  I found the cork.
[4219.54 --> 4219.86]  Wow.
[4220.20 --> 4220.66]  Good job.
[4221.16 --> 4221.84]  There it is.
[4223.20 --> 4223.78]  There it is.
[4224.10 --> 4225.10]  Happy New Year.
[4225.64 --> 4225.96]  Oh!
[4227.76 --> 4228.68]  Luke doesn't drink.
[4228.76 --> 4229.60]  That's why this is funny.
[4230.18 --> 4230.62]  All right.
[4231.04 --> 4231.34]  All right.
[4231.40 --> 4233.26]  Back to your regularly scheduled whatever.
[4233.26 --> 4234.70]  Which is probably ending.
[4235.26 --> 4236.70]  So thanks for the epic ending.
[4236.98 --> 4237.98]  Thank you guys for watching.
[4238.28 --> 4239.34]  Don't forget to check out
[4239.34 --> 4241.40]  our content at CES 2015.
[4241.82 --> 4242.72]  Is that right?
[4242.86 --> 4243.06]  Yeah.
[4243.20 --> 4244.66]  CES 2015 this year.
[4244.66 --> 4245.18]  16-16.
[4245.40 --> 4246.36]  CES 2016
[4246.36 --> 4247.56]  because it will be next year
[4247.56 --> 4248.66]  by then.
[4249.58 --> 4251.18]  Oh, I'm going to screw that up a lot.
[4252.34 --> 4253.36]  The amount of times I've done like
[4253.36 --> 4254.40]  Computex 2015
[4254.40 --> 4256.06]  and PAX Prime 2015
[4256.06 --> 4257.42]  and PAX East 2015
[4257.42 --> 4258.72]  has been a lot.
[4259.04 --> 4260.58]  So I have to remember to say CES 2016.
[4260.98 --> 4262.04]  Anyways, check us out.
[4262.16 --> 4263.12]  Probably know the YouTube channel.
[4263.60 --> 4265.44]  YouTube.com slash Linus Tech Tips.
[4266.36 --> 4266.62]  Yeah.
[4266.82 --> 4267.48]  That's the one.
[4268.00 --> 4269.08]  Over 60 videos.
[4269.68 --> 4270.28]  I'm going to be doing
[4270.28 --> 4271.74]  an after party after this.
[4272.38 --> 4273.60]  Not for a little while though
[4273.60 --> 4274.46]  because the work day
[4274.46 --> 4275.30]  isn't technically over.
[4275.78 --> 4277.72]  So I have other stuff to do
[4277.72 --> 4279.10]  and then I'll be doing one later.
[4279.10 --> 4280.38]  Okay.
[4280.62 --> 4281.12]  All right.
[4293.98 --> 4295.32]  I'll be doing some humidity now.
[4299.64 --> 4300.48]  Fresh abdomen!
[4300.56 --> 4300.78]  Fresh Side.
[4301.10 --> 4302.34]  Thank you Fresh Calendar!

[4304.44 --> 4304.50]  Okay.
[4306.88 --> 4307.44]  All right.
[4308.00 --> 4308.30]  Thank you.
[4308.30 --> 4309.08]  You broke-

[4311.00 --> 4311.58]  kinds of guys are
[4311.58 --> 4311.78]  He'll be about to

[4314.06 --> 4314.16]  Number 1
