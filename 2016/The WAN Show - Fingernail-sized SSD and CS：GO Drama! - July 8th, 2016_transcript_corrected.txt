[0.00 → 15.00] So we're live now, but I'm going to have to do the show kind of quietly because Luke's trying to film up as fast as possible over there.
[15.00 → 19.00] Welcome to the WAN show you guys, going to be a great show today.
[19.00 → 25.00] Let me see, ooh Samsung is unveiling the successor to micros.
[25.00 → 27.00] What else we got here?
[27.00 → 34.00] MIT research shows the hole in the ozone layer may be healing.
[34.00 → 43.00] The UN Council says, or a UN Council, UN Council, let's go with that, says blocking internet access violates human rights.
[43.00 → 53.00] And CSGO YouTubers were promoting CSGO skin gambling sites that they owned.
[53.00 → 54.00] TCH, TCH, TCH, TCH.
[54.00 → 56.00] Naughty, naughty, naughty.
[56.00 → 60.00] We'll be talking about this and more on the WAN show today.
[60.00 → 63.00] Let's go ahead and roll that intro.
[63.00 → 66.00] Oh dang it.
[66.00 → 69.00] There we go.
[69.00 → 73.00] Alright, so I guess you guys can, uh...
[73.00 → 86.00] This is hilarious.
[86.00 → 90.00] You guys are like, it's pre-recorded.
[90.00 → 103.00] If we were pre-recording, we could do it at any time.
[103.00 → 106.00] We wouldn't have to do it while Luke's trying to get as fast as possible filmed.
[106.00 → 115.00] Long story, but Dennis is, uh... Dennis is working this weekend because of a thing, and so he needs it filmed now.
[115.00 → 116.00] And anyway, whatever.
[116.00 → 119.00] The point is, got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[119.00 → 122.00] I'm just going to jump right into the first one here.
[122.00 → 128.00] So this is freakin' awesome if you're into high-speed mobile storage.
[128.00 → 131.00] Uh, the original article here is from theverge.com.
[131.00 → 133.00] Just going to go ahead and pull that baby up.
[133.00 → 135.00] Linus's screen.
[135.00 → 142.00] It's funny, ten points to those of you who watch the fastest possible he's filming now, and then talk about the WAN show in the comments.
[142.00 → 144.00] Ten internet points.
[144.00 → 151.00] So they have finally released UFS memory cards.
[151.00 → 163.00] What UFS is, is in a nutshell, basically very similar to the interface that you would find on a desktop or even a server computer.
[163.00 → 165.00] It actually uses the SAS protocol.
[165.00 → 177.00] It has more contact pins, and it is able to achieve read and write speeds that are pretty similar to what you can do with a SATA 6 gigabit or a SAS 6 gigabit connection.
[177.00 → 185.00] I like to think that this is kind of like, uh, kind of like, apparently Luke is louder than I.
[185.00 → 190.00] Well, I'm trying not to interrupt him more than he's trying not to interrupt me.
[190.00 → 193.00] Because I mean, come on, it's like, it's WAN show. You guys get it.
[193.00 → 196.00] You guys, you guys know we have to, you guys know we have to make videos here.
[196.00 → 198.00] Like, speak up.
[198.00 → 200.00] Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[200.00 → 201.00] I'll sit right here.
[201.00 → 203.00] Luke's going to be joining me in just a minute here.
[203.00 → 212.00] But, um, basically the funny thing about this release from Samsung is that there is no ecosystem for the cards whatsoever.
[212.00 → 219.00] There's just, okay, they've got cards up to 256 gigabytes, but there are no readers on the market.
[219.00 → 226.00] And yeah, they're superfast, but there's literally nothing you can install them in and you can't buy them.
[226.00 → 234.00] They're just announced. We've already reached out to them asking, um, if they can send us something or if, um, like even just to kind of showcase it.
[234.00 → 238.00] Wow. I like lost my voice from whispering like that.
[238.00 → 248.00] Like if we can showcase it or just kind of hold one up on camera and be like, whoa, it's an SSD the size of your pinky nail.
[248.00 → 251.00] But so far they basically said, um, no.
[251.00 → 259.00] So here I'll give you the kind of the quote from their, uh, memory product planning and application engineering senior vice president.
[259.00 → 272.00] And I'm getting glared up by Luke. By launching our new high capacity, high performance UFS card lineup, we are changing the growing paradigm of the memory card market to prioritize.
[272.00 → 279.00] And someone just moved my document, uh, to prioritize performance and user convenience for all.
[279.00 → 287.00] Well, it's good to know that's an important shift because if performance and user convenience were not priorities before, then this is a great step in the right direction.
[287.00 → 296.00] So in a nutshell, UFS memory cards provides five times faster sequential read performance than a typical micro SD card.
[296.00 → 302.00] Did I mentioned this was Mike, a micro SD replacement, micro SD, not like full size SD.
[302.00 → 304.00] Like they are absolutely tiny.
[304.00 → 314.00] So to put that from the right perspective with a UFS card, users can read a five gigabyte full HD movie in approximately 10 seconds.
[314.00 → 318.00] Whereas a US one micro SD would take over 50 seconds.
[318.00 → 322.00] And that's assuming that that's a 95 megabyte per second card.
[322.00 → 326.00] Uh, random read IOPS are 40,000.
[326.00 → 338.00] And I mean, that is pretty comparable to fairly modern two and a half inch desktop SSDs on the, on the value end of this, of the, uh, of the spectrum.
[338.00 → 347.00] And the, the two 56 gig UFS card delivers more than 20 times higher random read performance compared to a typical micro SD.
[347.00 → 357.00] So what's really cool about this is that expandable phone storage has been a bit of a problem for a long time for a number of reasons,
[357.00 → 365.00] whether it's, uh, phone manufacturers just refusing to build in the slots, whether it's the mobile operating system makers kind of going,
[365.00 → 372.00] well, gee, there are a lot of issues with micro SD expansion because it uses a completely different interface, different communication protocol.
[372.00 → 376.00] Um, it doesn't actually jive that well.
[376.00 → 384.00] Um, I mean, it's okay for like photo storage, but it's not that great for doing things like installing apps.
[384.00 → 402.00] One of the reasons for that is that random performance is really not very good, but UFS, these cards are actually using a very, very similar means of communication and should perform similarly to modern primary storages in your mobile devices.
[402.00 → 405.00] So, hello.
[405.00 → 406.00] So hopefully,
[406.00 → 413.00] so hopefully gone are the days of having to buy a mobile device.
[413.00 → 416.00] Having to buy a device that has the amount of storage you need.
[416.00 → 423.00] I mean, I don't know if Apple is going to give in and support UFS, but at least on the Android side of things, I would expect that to happen.
[423.00 → 435.00] And if it does, then, hey, 32 gigs of base storage might be fine because you're not going to be limited to only being able to store, you know, photos and movies on your expandable storage.
[435.00 → 441.00] You could be able to actually store apps or even like, wow, here's a mind-blowing thing.
[441.00 → 452.00] I mean, we could see phones ship in more of a bare-bones type configuration, and you could just add your own full speed storage to it after the fact or buy a bundled one.
[452.00 → 460.00] This would help multiple parts of the supply chain because you look at what the differentiators are for product categories like computers.
[460.00 → 462.00] Okay. So you can get them with a different CPU.
[462.00 → 465.00] You can get them with a different GPU, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[465.00 → 469.00] If you're building a custom one, well, that's great.
[469.00 → 483.00] But if you're trying to buy a prebuilt, that actually dramatically increases the complexity for both the manufacturer who has to validate all these different SKUs and the button.
[483.00 → 492.00] Okay. So not only the manufacturer who has to build and maintain all these different SKUs, but also the distributors and the retailers who have to stock them all separately.
[492.00 → 495.00] I mean, what a frustrating situation.
[495.00 → 499.00] I mean, if those of you who have worked in any kind of supply chain job will probably get this.
[499.00 → 505.00] What a frustrating situation to have a customer walk in the door and say, yeah, I want a black iPhone 4S.
[505.00 → 511.00] And you've got 50 white ones in the back, and you don't have a black one to sell them.
[511.00 → 514.00] And you're just like, so that's aging inventory.
[514.00 → 516.00] That's inventory that you've already paid for.
[516.00 → 518.00] And now you have to go and special order some stupid thing.
[518.00 → 519.00] The customer has to come back in.
[519.00 → 521.00] It's a much higher touch transaction.
[521.00 → 529.00] So being able to just buy a bare-bones phone and boom, pop a UFS card in there would be absolutely sick.
[529.00 → 538.00] So Samsung has been really aggressive in preparing UFS for the market, contributing to the DEX standardization of UFS 2.0 specs in September 2013.
[538.00 → 543.00] And the UFS 1 card extension standards in March 2016.
[543.00 → 548.00] And basically they completed the universal flash storage association certification program.
[548.00 → 550.00] And there you have it.
[550.00 → 551.00] They have cards.
[551.00 → 552.00] They're ready to rock.
[552.00 → 555.00] We just need devices, and we need readers.
[555.00 → 558.00] Well, the entire rest of the ecosystem really.
[558.00 → 562.00] And we also need someone other than Samsung to also release products.
[562.00 → 565.00] So there's a little bit of competition.
[565.00 → 574.00] Not that I'm saying Samsung hasn't been mostly benevolent as far as their SSD pricing goes.
[574.00 → 577.00] Like, I mean, they've been kind of market leaders there.
[577.00 → 578.00] So, so.
[578.00 → 582.00] I did like your idea of like buying a phone and adding your own storage.
[582.00 → 583.00] Yeah.
[583.00 → 586.00] Especially for smaller phone manufacturers where they don't have to.
[586.00 → 588.00] I mean, they could just go, okay, we have three different models.
[588.00 → 589.00] Here are three colors.
[589.00 → 593.00] Instead of three different models, three different colours, plus three different capacities.
[593.00 → 594.00] Oh crap.
[594.00 → 595.00] Now there are nine SKUs.
[595.00 → 599.00] I would worry about the volatility of it.
[599.00 → 601.00] Like its ability to die.
[601.00 → 606.00] But if you just had like a little chip on the phone that had a base level operating system.
[606.00 → 612.00] Like a, like a fairly small compact version of Android that they expect you to update.
[612.00 → 617.00] You could just push that to the card every time that you want to wipe it or add a different one in or do whatever.
[617.00 → 618.00] Yeah.
[618.00 → 619.00] And then I could push to the card.
[619.00 → 621.00] You could update off that kernel using Wi-Fi or whatever.
[621.00 → 622.00] Yep.
[622.00 → 623.00] And then you're good to go.
[623.00 → 624.00] That would be awesome.
[624.00 → 625.00] I would love that.
[625.00 → 626.00] To be completely honest.
[626.00 → 631.00] Um, got someone asking in the Twitch chat if we can talk about the Dan case A4 SFX.
[631.00 → 632.00] Trust me.
[632.00 → 637.00] There will be plenty of coverage of the Dan case A4 SFX.
[637.00 → 638.00] It's coming.
[638.00 → 640.00] It's taken a little while to work on.
[640.00 → 646.00] I actually had to source some special RAM to work with the special motherboard that I had already sourced.
[646.00 → 653.00] Because my friends, I am doing an update to the ultimate compact gaming PC.
[653.00 → 659.00] It will have more cores, more GPU horsepower, more of absolutely everything.
[659.00 → 660.00] More RAM.
[660.00 → 661.00] Did you say gaming PC?
[661.00 → 662.00] Yeah.
[662.00 → 664.00] It will, uh, well, whatever.
[664.00 → 666.00] It'll be, it'll do anything.
[666.00 → 667.00] Okay.
[667.00 → 668.00] Yeah.
[668.00 → 669.00] Yeah.
[669.00 → 670.00] More cores might literally slow you down.
[670.00 → 673.00] It is not limited to just gaming performance.
[673.00 → 676.00] It can do absolutely anything pretty much under the sun.
[676.00 → 678.00] Everyone in the chat is saying Pokémon Go.
[678.00 → 679.00] We don't have it in Canada yet.
[679.00 → 680.00] Yeah.
[680.00 → 682.00] And there's like, sorry, I'm just going to do a very short aside.
[682.00 → 683.00] We just got wrecked.
[683.00 → 684.00] We did.
[684.00 → 685.00] Okay.
[685.00 → 686.00] So we don't have it in Canada yet.
[686.00 → 690.00] Some people are like, oh, you can just go the APK method and download it that way.
[690.00 → 691.00] It'll work just fine.
[691.00 → 692.00] No.
[692.00 → 695.00] Uh, there are some worries.
[695.00 → 696.00] Well, okay.
[696.00 → 697.00] Yes.
[697.00 → 701.00] But there are some worries there as well that like the Pokémon company might be banning people that are going that method.
[701.00 → 703.00] There's been some news around that.
[703.00 → 705.00] So I don't really want to go that method yet.
[705.00 → 706.00] But I want to play Pokémon Go.
[706.00 → 708.00] I heard the combat's terrible, but I don't care.
[708.00 → 710.00] I was a huge fan of Ingress already.
[710.00 → 715.00] And like, if you thought the combat in Ingress was good, you're kidding yourself.
[715.00 → 716.00] So like, I don't know.
[716.00 → 717.00] Ouch.
[717.00 → 718.00] I'm excited.
[718.00 → 719.00] It's terrible.
[719.00 → 721.00] You just press a button.
[721.00 → 724.00] Like, and it's like, okay, every game you press a button.
[724.00 → 729.00] But like, it's not a high end, like interesting combat system.
[729.00 → 730.00] It's rather boring.
[730.00 → 733.00] I mean, people would argue Diablo 2 is a good game.
[733.00 → 735.00] You basically click the mouse.
[735.00 → 736.00] I love Diablo 2.
[736.00 → 737.00] If you want to, if you want to, I know, I know.
[737.00 → 741.00] But if you want to bring it down to its most basic level, you click the mouse and the bad guy goes, eh.
[741.00 → 745.00] But there's no like, it's not like an intricate, interesting combat system.
[745.00 → 746.00] Right.
[746.00 → 747.00] Sure.
[747.00 → 748.00] Okay.
[748.00 → 749.00] Fair enough.
[749.00 → 750.00] Fair enough.
[750.00 → 752.00] It's really heinous because apparently all you do is just tap on the screen really quickly.
[752.00 → 753.00] And like if you try to dodge.
[753.00 → 755.00] So we're trying to all get carpal tunnel or?
[755.00 → 756.00] Yeah.
[756.00 → 757.00] Yeah.
[757.00 → 758.00] This is just what I've heard.
[758.00 → 759.00] What are we practicing for?
[759.00 → 760.00] From my friend Shane.
[760.00 → 761.00] Hi Shane.
[761.00 → 767.00] If you try to dodge, it takes so long that the other person is just still attacking and
[767.00 → 768.00] doesn't bother dodging.
[768.00 → 772.00] And then like your, the amount of time it takes, you just get hit a bunch, and you just fall
[772.00 → 773.00] behind anyway.
[773.00 → 775.00] So like it doesn't actually help.
[775.00 → 779.00] You just sit there and spam attack and there's no like abilities, which they could have very
[779.00 → 780.00] easily done.
[780.00 → 785.00] And people are speculating that they, they don't want to hurt their other like markets.
[785.00 → 787.00] They don't want to hurt their Game Boy games by making this one too good.
[787.00 → 788.00] Okay.
[788.00 → 789.00] It's like, come on.
[789.00 → 794.00] Nintendo stock raised like 8.8% or something because of the launch of this game.
[794.00 → 798.00] It's like, why not make it that much better and just crush everything?
[798.00 → 799.00] I don't know.
[799.00 → 804.00] Well, I, I don't pretend to understand why when it is.
[804.00 → 810.00] When it's, you know, to be insulting, we get treated like America's hat or the 51st state.
[810.00 → 811.00] I don't know how many states they have.
[811.00 → 812.00] I don't know.
[812.00 → 814.00] Some number of states plus one.
[814.00 → 815.00] Yeah.
[815.00 → 820.00] Um, so we get treated like that when it's like to be insulting or to oppress our culture.
[820.00 → 821.00] Culture.
[821.00 → 822.00] Yeah.
[822.00 → 823.00] Yeah.
[823.00 → 827.00] But then when it comes time for us to actually like, you know, gain some benefits from it,
[827.00 → 828.00] get cool stuff.
[828.00 → 832.00] I mean, we don't, we still don't, we still don't have YouTube red.
[832.00 → 833.00] Okay.
[833.00 → 834.00] I thought we even had that.
[834.00 → 836.00] Do you know how much I want YouTube red?
[836.00 → 837.00] Yeah.
[837.00 → 838.00] Because you have music.
[838.00 → 846.00] I am so sick of trying to like to go through my own videos and have ads show up on them.
[846.00 → 847.00] And like, yeah.
[847.00 → 848.00] Because we don't run ad block.
[848.00 → 850.00] Neither of us run ad block.
[850.00 → 853.00] Um, where this isn't like an F you add block segment of the stream.
[853.00 → 857.00] Just neither of us run ad block and would love a solution where we can just be like money.
[857.00 → 858.00] No more ads.
[858.00 → 859.00] Yay.
[859.00 → 860.00] It's not even a lot of money.
[860.00 → 861.00] No.
[861.00 → 863.00] Um, speaking of not a lot of money.
[863.00 → 865.00] Everyone in the chat is saying red tube.
[865.00 → 866.00] Red tube.
[866.00 → 867.00] No, red tube is not the same.
[867.00 → 868.00] They have ads.
[868.00 → 870.00] It's not the same thing.
[870.00 → 872.00] But there are ads on there as well.
[872.00 → 873.00] Oh, okay.
[873.00 → 876.00] So like the problem still exists.
[876.00 → 877.00] Right.
[877.00 → 880.00] I legitimately didn't know that.
[880.00 → 881.00] Why wouldn't that?
[881.00 → 882.00] Of course.
[882.00 → 885.00] I'm going to shut up now.
[885.00 → 886.00] We're going to continue with the show.
[888.00 → 890.00] What are we covering now?
[890.00 → 891.00] Uh, the ozone.
[891.00 → 892.00] Oh, okay.
[892.00 → 893.00] Get it.
[893.00 → 894.00] We're covering it.
[894.00 → 896.00] Oh, yeah, baby.
[896.00 → 897.00] Yeah.
[899.00 → 900.00] Oh my God.
[900.00 → 901.00] Are you doing nature world or MIT?
[901.00 → 903.00] Uh, nature world news.
[903.00 → 904.00] Oh, I already posted.
[904.00 → 905.00] I already posted.
[905.00 → 906.00] Yeah.
[906.00 → 909.00] Is the hole in the ozone layer closing?
[909.00 → 917.00] First signs of healing, which as, um, you know, some of you may or may not know is most
[917.00 → 919.00] assuredly a good thing.
[919.00 → 920.00] Yeah.
[920.00 → 926.00] Scientists at MIT and elsewhere have identified signs of healing of the Antarctic ozone layer.
[926.00 → 931.00] So the findings published earlier this week in the journal Science by Susan Solomon,
[931.00 → 939.00] uh, her team found that the September ozone hole has shrunk more than 4 million square kilometres.
[939.00 → 940.00] Well, that's a lot.
[940.00 → 944.00] Which is about half the area of the United States of America.
[944.00 → 945.00] Okay.
[945.00 → 947.00] Or like a quarter of Canada.
[948.00 → 949.00] Boom.
[950.00 → 951.00] You're wrecked.
[951.00 → 953.00] We don't use the majority of it.
[953.00 → 956.00] It's mostly just ice and wasteland.
[956.00 → 957.00] But you know.
[957.00 → 960.00] So this is since 2000 when ozone depletion was at its peak.
[960.00 → 964.00] The team also showed that recovery has slowed somewhat at times.
[964.00 → 968.00] This could be due to the effects of volcanic eruptions' year to year.
[968.00 → 973.00] So the authors used fingerprints of the ozone changes with season and altitude to attribute
[973.00 → 979.00] the ozone's recovery to a decline of atmospheric chlorine originating from chlorofluorocarbons
[979.00 → 980.00] or CFCs.
[980.00 → 981.00] Yeah.
[981.00 → 987.00] So if you were wondering, was it actually a good idea for us to do away with CFCs, however
[987.00 → 989.00] convenient they might have been?
[989.00 → 990.00] The answer is probably.
[990.00 → 991.00] Yeah.
[991.00 → 993.00] I mean, we could all be screwed anyway, but.
[993.00 → 994.00] Yeah.
[994.00 → 997.00] Like this doesn't at all solve all the problems.
[997.00 → 1001.00] This is one element that is very good that it is being solved.
[1001.00 → 1004.00] There are many others that are still very large issues.
[1004.00 → 1010.00] So these compounds were once emitted by dry cleaning processes, old refrigerators, air
[1010.00 → 1017.00] saws such as hair sprays, and most importantly, the air conditioning unit of my 1991 red Volkswagen
[1017.00 → 1018.00] diesel Jetta.
[1018.00 → 1022.00] So I actually had all the Creon.
[1022.00 → 1025.00] It totally makes sense that it was at a peak in the 90s because of hair spray.
[1025.00 → 1032.00] Every single dude with frosted tips made that hole.
[1032.00 → 1033.00] Made that hole.
[1033.00 → 1035.00] Sorry, who are we talking about?
[1035.00 → 1036.00] Don't worry about it.
[1036.00 → 1037.00] Continue.
[1037.00 → 1038.00] Oh man.
[1038.00 → 1039.00] That's awful.
[1039.00 → 1040.00] So I was telling a story.
[1040.00 → 1041.00] It wasn't a very good story.
[1041.00 → 1053.00] Now that it's been interrupted, I almost feel like I shouldn't even bother bringing it
[1053.00 → 1056.00] back up because it was super boring.
[1056.00 → 1063.00] The Creon leaked out of my air conditioning unit and so my air conditioning didn't work.
[1063.00 → 1065.00] That really was the end of the story.
[1065.00 → 1069.00] Because they couldn't recharge it with Creon because Creon was not a thing anymore.
[1069.00 → 1072.00] But man, Creon was awesome.
[1072.00 → 1076.00] The AC on that car was godlike.
[1076.00 → 1083.00] It was really like putting your hands up to an open window in the dead of winter.
[1083.00 → 1087.00] It was like, oh, I was so hot, and now I'm cold.
[1087.00 → 1088.00] This is great.
[1088.00 → 1098.00] By comparison, my wife's 2008 rabbit is kind of like if we had a couple of Luke's sitting
[1098.00 → 1101.00] under the hood blowing through the vents.
[1101.00 → 1102.00] Yeah.
[1102.00 → 1103.00] Yeah.
[1103.00 → 1106.00] And like it takes so long to get to the cold state.
[1106.00 → 1107.00] Yeah.
[1107.00 → 1108.00] The AC these days.
[1108.00 → 1109.00] Creon was awesome.
[1109.00 → 1110.00] Yeah.
[1110.00 → 1111.00] But.
[1111.00 → 1112.00] Good it's gone.
[1112.00 → 1113.00] It's good that it's gone.
[1113.00 → 1119.00] In 1987, virtually every country in the world signed onto the Montreal Protocol to ban the
[1119.00 → 1123.00] use of CFCs and repair the ozone hole, and they've been tracking it yearly, et cetera,
[1123.00 → 1124.00] et cetera, et cetera.
[1124.00 → 1130.00] So Solomon, again, the researcher sees no reason barring future volcanic eruptions that the ozone
[1130.00 → 1135.00] hole shouldn't shrink and eventually close by mid-century.
[1135.00 → 1143.00] So I could live to see the entire process from the signing of the Montreal Protocol to the closing of the ozone layer.
[1143.00 → 1148.00] That is to say, unless all the other terrible stuff we're doing catches up with us by that time.
[1148.00 → 1149.00] Very possible.
[1149.00 → 1150.00] All right.
[1150.00 → 1156.00] Do you want to move on to the UN Council thing, and I'll go film the video that I actually have to film during the show today?
[1156.00 → 1157.00] Sure.
[1157.00 → 1160.00] I don't know anything about this, but this might be a good point to pull in John.
[1160.00 → 1161.00] Yeah, sure.
[1161.00 → 1162.00] I'll go grab John.
[1162.00 → 1163.00] Okay.
[1163.00 → 1165.00] And you guys can hit this one.
[1165.00 → 1169.00] So the UN Council says that blocking internet access violates human rights.
[1169.00 → 1183.00] And as I have no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to laws, legality, human rights, or to be completely fair, morality on very many levels, we have brought in John.
[1183.00 → 1184.00] You're not an authority on morality?
[1184.00 → 1185.00] Sorry?
[1185.00 → 1186.00] You're not an authority on morality?
[1186.00 → 1187.00] No.
[1187.00 → 1188.00] Oh, that's news to me.
[1188.00 → 1189.00] Hey, everyone.
[1189.00 → 1190.00] So this is John.
[1190.00 → 1191.00] John does a-
[1191.00 → 1192.00] Oh, God.
[1192.00 → 1193.00] Well, sometimes I shake the table.
[1193.00 → 1194.00] John destroys things.
[1194.00 → 1195.00] I do.
[1195.00 → 1197.00] Not as much as Dennis, but-
[1197.00 → 1198.00] Fair.
[1198.00 → 1199.00] It does happen sometimes.
[1199.00 → 1201.00] He also writes fastest possible scripts, as in all of them.
[1201.00 → 1202.00] Most of them.
[1202.00 → 1203.00] Most all?
[1203.00 → 1204.00] Mostly all?
[1204.00 → 1205.00] Mostly all.
[1205.00 → 1208.00] Like a grossly high percentage of them.
[1208.00 → 1210.00] Which is getting near a million subscribers.
[1210.00 → 1211.00] Very close.
[1211.00 → 1212.00] It should be about a week.
[1212.00 → 1214.00] Yeah, until Tech Wiki's got a million subscribers.
[1214.00 → 1215.00] That'll be freaking cool.
[1215.00 → 1219.00] Anyway, I'm dropping you in super randomly in here, but-
[1219.00 → 1220.00] Okay, what are we talking about?
[1220.00 → 1221.00] This.
[1221.00 → 1222.00] Oh.
[1222.00 → 1223.00] Here's all the notes.
[1223.00 → 1224.00] Wait, nope.
[1224.00 → 1225.00] Uh...
[1225.00 → 1226.00] No, not this.
[1226.00 → 1227.00] This.
[1227.00 → 1228.00] Oh, interesting.
[1228.00 → 1231.00] So, read on that for a little bit while I read random bullshit bullet points, and then
[1231.00 → 1233.00] you can try to come in with actually insightful comments.
[1233.00 → 1234.00] Okay.
[1234.00 → 1235.00] I'll try?
[1235.00 → 1236.00] Yes.
[1236.00 → 1237.00] I'll try to.
[1237.00 → 1238.00] You can do your best.
[1238.00 → 1239.00] Okay.
[1239.00 → 1240.00] I'm just going to talk about things.
[1240.00 → 1241.00] Where's the chat stream, by the way?
[1241.00 → 1242.00] Uh...
[1242.00 → 1243.00] It would be here.
[1243.00 → 1246.00] So when you're done getting your insightful comments, you can click on that Twitch window,
[1246.00 → 1247.00] and then you can-
[1247.00 → 1248.00] Sick.
[1248.00 → 1249.00] Okay, we can kind of go back.
[1249.00 → 1250.00] Okay, very good.
[1250.00 → 1251.00] Guys.
[1251.00 → 1258.00] Delegates gathered for the 32nd session of the Human Rights Council in the-uh, in UN
[1258.00 → 1261.00] Geneva, Switzerland on June 13th.
[1261.00 → 1262.00] Really?
[1262.00 → 1263.00] Thanks, Colton.
[1263.00 → 1266.00] The charming little neighbourhood of United Nations.
[1266.00 → 1269.00] In United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland.
[1269.00 → 1274.00] Uh, I would assume in the United Nations building in Geneva, Switzerland on June 13th.
[1274.00 → 1279.00] They were taking aim at countries that block access to internet as means to suppress free
[1279.00 → 1280.00] expression.
[1280.00 → 1284.00] And trust me, there's probably more of those than you actually realize.
[1284.00 → 1290.00] The resolution passed by a 47-member council who, on quote, said they condemn unequivocally-
[1290.00 → 1291.00] Hmm?
[1291.00 → 1294.00] Condemns unequivocally measures-what?
[1294.00 → 1301.00] To, uh, internationally prevent or disrupt access or dissemination of information online
[1301.00 → 1306.00] in violation of international human rights laws and calls on all states to refrain from
[1306.00 → 1307.00] and cease such measures.
[1307.00 → 1309.00] Uh, going to be interesting.
[1309.00 → 1316.00] States listed Russia, China, Saudi Arabia asked the UN to strike that passage from the digital
[1316.00 → 1317.00] rights decree.
[1317.00 → 1318.00] Not surprised.
[1318.00 → 1321.00] South Africa and India also called for its removal.
[1321.00 → 1326.00] Um, and they're- dodo- do- uh, they're- they're saying, like, different reasons why this
[1326.00 → 1327.00] is happening.
[1327.00 → 1331.00] Internet blackouts have been well documented across China, definitely, multiple times,
[1331.00 → 1333.00] and Middle East, again, multiple times.
[1333.00 → 1338.00] The Turkish government were reportedly blocking news outlets as well as Facebook and Twitter
[1338.00 → 1343.00] in wake of Istanbul's, um, airport attack, which was absolutely terrible.
[1343.00 → 1347.00] Um, transparency reports published by Twitter show that requests from courts and government
[1347.00 → 1352.00] agencies have skyrocketed from six per year to over a thousand, and there's more than just
[1352.00 → 1354.00] Twitter that has that problem.
[1354.00 → 1357.00] Um, yeah, it's, uh, it's a big thing.
[1357.00 → 1363.00] Edward Snowden, former CIA employee-these notes are gold.
[1363.00 → 1368.00] Um, yeah, it's called the UN's dedication to the issue good news through Twitter.
[1368.00 → 1371.00] His Twitter account is awesome, by the way, so feel free to check it out.
[1371.00 → 1373.00] Yeah, he only follows the NSA-
[1373.00 → 1374.00] Yes.
[1374.00 → 1375.00] Like nobody else.
[1375.00 → 1379.00] Um, I'm going to figure out what his handle is right now.
[1379.00 → 1380.00] It's at Snowden.
[1380.00 → 1381.00] At Snowden.
[1381.00 → 1382.00] Yeah.
[1382.00 → 1383.00] Yeah.
[1383.00 → 1385.00] Following one, and it's the NSA.
[1385.00 → 1386.00] That's-
[1386.00 → 1387.00] Yeah, NSA-CSS.
[1387.00 → 1388.00] Definitely my favourite thing.
[1388.00 → 1389.00] Yeah.
[1389.00 → 1390.00] I wonder if they have him blocked.
[1390.00 → 1392.00] That's a good question.
[1392.00 → 1394.00] I'm sure they don't, because they would want to be able to track him.
[1394.00 → 1395.00] Yeah.
[1395.00 → 1397.00] I mean, there's really no point in that, I think.
[1397.00 → 1398.00] So, yeah.
[1398.00 → 1404.00] Apparently he's- he spoke out recently about- because he's- he has asylum in Russia, but
[1404.00 → 1408.00] recently he spoke out against something the government's doing, I think, with regards
[1408.00 → 1410.00] to like- it might have been internet freedom.
[1410.00 → 1411.00] I just remember seeing a headline about it.
[1411.00 → 1412.00] Right.
[1412.00 → 1415.00] So, I don't know how that's gonna work out, but-
[1415.00 → 1416.00] Anyway.
[1416.00 → 1417.00] So, what's happening here?
[1417.00 → 1418.00] Anything insightful?
[1418.00 → 1419.00] Um, I mean-
[1419.00 → 1422.00] I don't know if this falls in your wheelhouse at all.
[1422.00 → 1425.00] No, Snowden's not wrong when he says it's good news, because obviously it is.
[1425.00 → 1426.00] Yeah.
[1426.00 → 1430.00] The UN does lots of stuff, but also, I think a lot of people know you don't need to be
[1430.00 → 1435.00] an expert in international policy or anything like that to know that not every country in
[1435.00 → 1437.00] the UN has equal clout.
[1437.00 → 1438.00] Yeah.
[1438.00 → 1439.00] Yeah.
[1439.00 → 1443.00] And so if- I mean, you have Russia and China that don't want this, and these are two of the
[1443.00 → 1447.00] five permanent security council members, which is a huge deal.
[1447.00 → 1448.00] Yeah.
[1448.00 → 1455.00] So, I mean, it's nice, but whether anything is actually going to be done, um, who the heck
[1455.00 → 1456.00] knows?
[1456.00 → 1457.00] Um, and-
[1457.00 → 1459.00] The UN also has an enforcement issue.
[1459.00 → 1460.00] They do.
[1460.00 → 1461.00] Yeah.
[1461.00 → 1462.00] They have a huge enforcement issue.
[1462.00 → 1464.00] They're like, everyone must do this!
[1464.00 → 1467.00] If you don't do this, that's probably fine.
[1467.00 → 1473.00] It's like in, uh, Team America, when, you know, Hans Blue comes in to Kim Jong Il
[1473.00 → 1476.00] 's palace, and he's like, you know, what are you going to do about it?
[1476.00 → 1479.00] And he says, we will write you a letter telling you how angry we are.
[1479.00 → 1480.00] You know?
[1480.00 → 1486.00] So, I mean, it's not quite, you know, it's not quite that, you know, useless, but at
[1486.00 → 1489.00] the same time, you know, there's obviously an issue here with that.
[1489.00 → 1492.00] Um, some of the chats, like, hashtag porn for China.
[1492.00 → 1496.00] It's funny you should mention that, because there's also, um, there's been a huge trend
[1496.00 → 1501.00] recently, like, the past 10 years or so to get internet access, like, basically recognized
[1501.00 → 1502.00] as a human right.
[1502.00 → 1505.00] But there's also kind of a question of degree here.
[1505.00 → 1511.00] It could be anything from, like, the Great Firewall of China to, like, Britain saying
[1511.00 → 1513.00] you have to opt in if you want to watch porn.
[1513.00 → 1516.00] It could be anything in between those two extremes, you know?
[1516.00 → 1517.00] Oh, right.
[1517.00 → 1521.00] So, there's an issue with that, and, um, yeah, it's kind of cool that Freedom House
[1521.00 → 1522.00] is mentioned on here.
[1522.00 → 1524.00] And I guess part of it would be, uh, sorry, Vic.
[1524.00 → 1525.00] No, no, go ahead.
[1525.00 → 1526.00] It's fine.
[1526.00 → 1527.00] Yeah.
[1527.00 → 1528.00] I guess part of it would be, like, the opt-in thing that you just brought up.
[1528.00 → 1529.00] Mm-hmm.
[1529.00 → 1530.00] Like, it doesn't stop tracking.
[1530.00 → 1533.00] So, governments would still know what you were doing.
[1533.00 → 1534.00] Mm-hmm.
[1534.00 → 1537.00] And they could try to hit you for unrelated things if they're corrupt.
[1537.00 → 1538.00] Yeah, so it's like, what is internet for you?
[1538.00 → 1540.00] So, it might not actually stop the problem.
[1540.00 → 1541.00] Yeah.
[1541.00 → 1546.00] Is it just a removal of restrictions, or is it like, we want to have better privacy and line of
[1546.00 → 1547.00] needs something?
[1547.00 → 1548.00] It's on the...
[1548.00 → 1549.00] I plugged it in.
[1549.00 → 1550.00] Yeah.
[1550.00 → 1553.00] Although, I might, I heard something crash that might have fallen.
[1553.00 → 1558.00] Yeah, so, um, yeah, it's also funny that, you know, you mentioned Freedom House in the
[1558.00 → 1559.00] report.
[1559.00 → 1561.00] Uh, they're a pretty big, um, NGO.
[1561.00 → 1566.00] They do a report basically every year called Freedom of the World, and they measure every
[1566.00 → 1569.00] country on a few different metrics.
[1569.00 → 1571.00] They categorize it as, like, free or not free.
[1571.00 → 1573.00] And that's obviously a pretty sweeping thing.
[1573.00 → 1574.00] Yeah.
[1574.00 → 1577.00] But, um, I'm kinda not surprised that they're looking into this, so.
[1577.00 → 1578.00] Freedom House 2016.
[1578.00 → 1580.00] Yeah, there we go.
[1580.00 → 1582.00] I don't know if they've gotten to every country yet, but...
[1582.00 → 1583.00] World.
[1583.00 → 1585.00] Is green free?
[1585.00 → 1588.00] Yeah, green is free, and then you have yellow, which is sort of part...
[1588.00 → 1589.00] Hardly free.
[1589.00 → 1592.00] Yeah, the way they classify it is kinda funny.
[1592.00 → 1593.00] Not free.
[1593.00 → 1594.00] Okay.
[1594.00 → 1599.00] Based on the map, it's kinda ironic that Snowden is getting asylum in Russia.
[1599.00 → 1600.00] In a not free area.
[1600.00 → 1601.00] Yeah.
[1601.00 → 1602.00] Interesting.
[1602.00 → 1605.00] Where's, like, the most free country?
[1605.00 → 1611.00] Um, a lot of countries are tied, because it's only on a scale from one to seven.
[1611.00 → 1612.00] Oh, wow, okay.
[1612.00 → 1615.00] In, like, I think, two different categories.
[1615.00 → 1620.00] So, if you have one rating in both, then that's, like, the most you can get, so.
[1620.00 → 1621.00] Right, okay, that makes sense.
[1621.00 → 1626.00] Now, one thing that we do need to do that I forgot is whenever we're, like, talking about
[1626.00 → 1627.00] something, we should share it on the screen.
[1627.00 → 1628.00] Yes.
[1628.00 → 1629.00] People can actually see what we're talking about.
[1629.00 → 1630.00] Anyway, um, so yeah.
[1630.00 → 1632.00] Is that linked up here or on mine?
[1632.00 → 1635.00] That's, I, well, it's linked up here, actually, yeah.
[1635.00 → 1636.00] Okay, so I can bring this up.
[1636.00 → 1637.00] It's fine, we already, all right.
[1637.00 → 1644.00] Um, but, yeah, I guess that's a good thing, um, but, like you were saying and like I was
[1644.00 → 1648.00] saying, we'll see if it actually does anything.
[1648.00 → 1649.00] Mm-hmm.
[1649.00 → 1651.00] Has any actual noticeable impact on anything.
[1651.00 → 1652.00] We'll have to wait and see.
[1652.00 → 1653.00] Yeah.
[1653.00 → 1657.00] This is one of those things that I worry, uh, the internet might forget about.
[1657.00 → 1661.00] Yeah, I mean, and, you know, especially because all, the most the UN can do is pressure
[1661.00 → 1663.00] people through various means.
[1663.00 → 1664.00] Yeah.
[1664.00 → 1667.00] So, they can't just come in with, like, a big sword of justice to say, no, you can't
[1667.00 → 1668.00] do this.
[1668.00 → 1672.00] And China kind of seems, China and Russia both seem like countries that would be a little
[1672.00 → 1675.00] difficult to pressure into doing anything they didn't really want to do.
[1675.00 → 1678.00] Because, again, they have a lot of clout in the UN.
[1678.00 → 1679.00] Yeah.
[1679.00 → 1680.00] So, yeah.
[1680.00 → 1681.00] Yeah.
[1681.00 → 1682.00] So, yeah.
[1682.00 → 1683.00] Interesting.
[1683.00 → 1686.00] The next topic, uh, Linus definitely wants to be here for.
[1686.00 → 1690.00] Dun-DA-dun, dun-DA-dun, dun-DA-dun, Duna.
[1690.00 → 1691.00] Okay, let's scroll down to this one.
[1691.00 → 1693.00] This one's definitely in your wheelhouse.
[1693.00 → 1694.00] Uh.
[1694.00 → 1696.00] The password sharing thing or something else?
[1696.00 → 1697.00] Yes.
[1697.00 → 1698.00] This one.
[1698.00 → 1701.00] So, uh, click here.
[1701.00 → 1702.00] Trying to connect.
[1702.00 → 1704.00] Linus isn't even online.
[1704.00 → 1705.00] Oh, no.
[1705.00 → 1709.00] See, uh, the Twitch stream on this laptop was just not working at all.
[1709.00 → 1712.00] And I was wondering why, and it wasn't even connected to Wi-Fi.
[1712.00 → 1713.00] What the sh-?
[1713.00 → 1714.00] Yeah.
[1714.00 → 1715.00] Okay.
[1715.00 → 1716.00] Anyway.
[1716.00 → 1717.00] Alright, here we go.
[1717.00 → 1720.00] The user sharing your password is now a federal crime.
[1720.00 → 1722.00] I don't know why.
[1722.00 → 1725.00] That is just the, uh, title of the document.
[1725.00 → 1726.00] And that's all it is, I think.
[1726.00 → 1729.00] I, I looked at this briefly a little while ago.
[1729.00 → 1730.00] Okay.
[1730.00 → 1731.00] I think it's kind of the clickbaity headline.
[1731.00 → 1732.00] But, yeah, let's go through the details first.
[1732.00 → 1738.00] It was a result of a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the most powerful appeals courts in the U.S.
[1738.00 → 1739.00] Is that true?
[1739.00 → 1740.00] Yes.
[1740.00 → 1741.00] Yes.
[1741.00 → 1751.00] Any user sharing a password that has not been authorized by the host of the website is in breach of the CAA Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the U.S.
[1751.00 → 1752.00] Interesting.
[1752.00 → 1754.00] We've banned people on the forum for that before.
[1754.00 → 1758.00] Um, conviction of David Noble, something like that.
[1758.00 → 1763.00] Former employee of Born slash Ferry International, a research firm.
[1763.00 → 1765.00] Former employee of Born.
[1765.00 → 1767.00] They made some interesting music.
[1767.00 → 1769.00] Yeah, I'm thinking about the band everyone listened to in middle school.
[1769.00 → 1770.00] Yeah.
[1770.00 → 1771.00] I hear that.
[1771.00 → 1772.00] It was upheld.
[1772.00 → 1783.00] Noble used a former co-worker's password to access one of the firm's databases after his employment was terminated, which was declared as unauthorized use of a computer system under the CAA.
[1783.00 → 1784.00] Interesting.
[1784.00 → 1789.00] See, because I'm thinking like, I guess I didn't think of this on the right level.
[1789.00 → 1792.00] I was thinking like, oh, we're sharing our World of Warcraft accounts.
[1792.00 → 1793.00] Like, I didn't, I didn't.
[1793.00 → 1796.00] Yeah, that's why I really didn't like the headline.
[1796.00 → 1797.00] Yeah.
[1797.00 → 1799.00] Because sharing your password isn't a crime.
[1799.00 → 1805.00] Using someone else's to gain unauthorized access to a system is, and that's been the case for a long time.
[1805.00 → 1806.00] This isn't being you.
[1806.00 → 1807.00] Yeah.
[1807.00 → 1808.00] Okay, that makes sense.
[1808.00 → 1809.00] Yeah.
[1809.00 → 1810.00] Interesting.
[1810.00 → 1819.00] They argue that this sets a dangerous precedent for everyday citizens who share passwords for services like Netflix and HBO Go with family members, with friends and family members.
[1819.00 → 1827.00] Since they do not have authorization from those companies to share those passwords, they are breaking federal law under the CAA.
[1827.00 → 1834.00] They are primarily concerned with what they call the government's boundless interpretation of the CAA.
[1834.00 → 1840.00] The majority does not provide, nor do I see, this is a quote, I guess.
[1840.00 → 1841.00] There are no quotes around it.
[1841.00 → 1842.00] Okay, there's an end quote.
[1842.00 → 1843.00] There's no start quote.
[1843.00 → 1844.00] Wonderful.
[1844.00 → 1867.00] The majority does not provide, nor do I see, a workable line which separates the consensual password sharing in this case, I'm assuming that means stuff like Netflix and whatnot, from the consensual password sharing of millions of legitimate account holders, which may also be contrary to the policies of system owners, wrote a dissenting judge, Stefan Reinhardt.
[1867.00 → 1870.00] Thanks for the addition of the quote.
[1870.00 → 1872.00] Nick Light, I, yes.
[1872.00 → 1873.00] TSK TSK?
[1873.00 → 1875.00] Yes, I think he's covering for Colton there.
[1875.00 → 1878.00] Um, yeah, I don't know.
[1878.00 → 1884.00] He says that this decision loses sight of the anti-hacking purpose of the CAA.
[1884.00 → 1888.00] That's a good point, if that is the actual true purpose of them.
[1888.00 → 1895.00] Using someone else's password with their permission, but not the system owners isn't hacking, but that's what the court is treating it as.
[1895.00 → 1897.00] That's an interesting point.
[1897.00 → 1900.00] Um, I feel like there should be a different rule for that.
[1900.00 → 1905.00] There probably should because the CAA is a very broadly written statute.
[1905.00 → 1910.00] It criminalizes any kind of unauthorized access to a computer system.
[1910.00 → 1920.00] Like, like, if I, if I go into the editing den, I'm wondering what time it is, and the closest thing to me is the clock on Dennis' computer, and I look at it, have I committed a federal crime?
[1920.00 → 1922.00] Like, the statute is written, like, so vaguely.
[1922.00 → 1923.00] Right.
[1923.00 → 1924.00] Okay.
[1924.00 → 1925.00] Uh, wow.
[1925.00 → 1926.00] What's up?
[1926.00 → 1927.00] Unauthorized access to a computer system.
[1927.00 → 1932.00] This is getting, like, super potentially political because of Hillary Clinton's emails and stuff.
[1932.00 → 1933.00] Oh, yeah, let's not get into that.
[1933.00 → 1935.00] I think we're just going to completely avoid that.
[1935.00 → 1936.00] No, we're not going to get into that.
[1936.00 → 1942.00] But, like, okay, the only question I have there is, does the CAA have any interest in what's going on there?
[1942.00 → 1948.00] Is that the kind of stuff that they're talking about?
[1948.00 → 1950.00] Um, with what's going on with Hillary Clinton?
[1950.00 → 1952.00] With, like, access to servers and all this kind of stuff?
[1952.00 → 1954.00] As far as I know, I don't think so.
[1954.00 → 1955.00] That was a completely different issue.
[1955.00 → 1956.00] Okay.
[1956.00 → 1957.00] It was about her.
[1957.00 → 1958.00] I don't even want to discuss it.
[1958.00 → 1961.00] Her allegedly mishandling classified info.
[1961.00 → 1962.00] Sure.
[1962.00 → 1963.00] That's all I'll say about it.
[1963.00 → 1965.00] If you guys are interested, go somewhere else for that discussion.
[1965.00 → 1966.00] This is not the right place.
[1966.00 → 1968.00] But, um, anyway, so.
[1968.00 → 1978.00] Anyway, one note at the end says that, uh, Reinhardt also noted that all 50 states have their own more narrow computer trespassing statutes.
[1978.00 → 1982.00] And the case would have to be suited for civil, not criminal proceedings.
[1982.00 → 1989.00] Unless Netflix or HBO start to pursue individual customers, this probably means nothing, which is good.
[1989.00 → 1993.00] But it sets a precedent that users who share passwords in the U.S. should consider.
[1993.00 → 1995.00] Yeah, I mean, if you are.
[1995.00 → 1996.00] Which sucks.
[1996.00 → 1997.00] It does.
[1997.00 → 1998.00] Oh, no, you first.
[1998.00 → 2005.00] I think I used to, uh, way back in the day, uh, with a buddy of mine named, I just call him Stretch.
[2005.00 → 2007.00] I still do play games with him.
[2007.00 → 2013.00] Uh, we'll maybe be playing games with him tonight after the show on the after party thing on my Twitch channel, whatever.
[2013.00 → 2017.00] Um, I used to share, uh, my World of Warcraft account information with him.
[2017.00 → 2020.00] Just in case he needed to, like, use my character for something.
[2020.00 → 2023.00] Say I was away and they, like, needed a tank because I was a warrior.
[2023.00 → 2024.00] He could just jump on my dude and use my dude.
[2024.00 → 2025.00] Like, it wasn't a big deal.
[2025.00 → 2026.00] Like, it wasn't a big deal.
[2026.00 → 2033.00] It wasn't, like, the rampant account sharing that World of Warcraft was trying to get around, which was, like, people just sharing accounts and having separate characters.
[2033.00 → 2036.00] Um, so not paying for two accounts like they should be.
[2036.00 → 2040.00] It was just, like, I don't know.
[2040.00 → 2047.00] I felt okay even though it was against WoW's rules, and I wasn't worried about, like, having a criminal law come against me for it.
[2047.00 → 2048.00] Yeah.
[2048.00 → 2049.00] I was a little bit worried about my account getting banned.
[2049.00 → 2051.00] I felt like I could probably appeal it.
[2051.00 → 2054.00] But, like, I wasn't worried about law coming down on me.
[2054.00 → 2057.00] Yeah, I mean, it's not really something you should probably worry about.
[2057.00 → 2068.00] I mean, if you're violating, like, Netflix's or HBO Go's or whoever's terms of service, like, 99.999% chance all we'll do is, okay, your account's terminated or suspended for a bit.
[2068.00 → 2069.00] And that'll be it.
[2069.00 → 2070.00] Yeah.
[2070.00 → 2078.00] And that's what Justice or Judge Reinhardt meant when he was talking about this is better suited for civil litigation instead of criminal.
[2078.00 → 2079.00] Yeah.
[2079.00 → 2088.00] But I think maybe what happened here, and this is just speculation if you guys want more details, federal appeals cases are actually very easy to find online.
[2088.00 → 2090.00] You can read exactly what the judges wrote.
[2090.00 → 2098.00] But my guess is because he got a password of some, like, it was, like, his former employer's private, like, intranet or something like that.
[2098.00 → 2099.00] Mm-hmm.
[2099.00 → 2104.00] Yeah, so maybe they thought, oh, he was up to no good trying to, like, get company secrets or something.
[2104.00 → 2107.00] I have no idea if that's the case or not, but maybe that's why it got as far as it did.
[2107.00 → 2108.00] Right.
[2108.00 → 2115.00] So that's obviously probably not going to happen with some random person who's otherwise lullaby just sharing their HBO Go password or something else.
[2115.00 → 2116.00] Yes, yes.
[2116.00 → 2117.00] Yes, that makes sense.
[2117.00 → 2118.00] That's good.
[2118.00 → 2119.00] So.
[2119.00 → 2120.00] Just switching screens here.
[2120.00 → 2121.00] Cool.
[2121.00 → 2122.00] Because your laptop has internet again.
[2122.00 → 2128.00] The 1060 was sort of announced is how I'm going to say that.
[2128.00 → 2141.00] So benchmarks aren't allowed to be talked about, but there are, like, specs and stuff that have actually been announced and reviewers and stuff.
[2141.00 → 2142.00] Oh, nope.
[2142.00 → 2144.00] You've got to be careful about what you're showing on the screen.
[2144.00 → 2145.00] Oh, sorry about that, yeah.
[2145.00 → 2146.00] Just go around and look at stuff.
[2146.00 → 2147.00] I see, okay.
[2147.00 → 2148.00] But on that site.
[2148.00 → 2149.00] Gotcha.
[2149.00 → 2151.00] And I would actually encourage you to go around and look at stuff because that's what's showing on the screen.
[2151.00 → 2152.00] Not a regular host, sorry.
[2152.00 → 2153.00] That's all good.
[2153.00 → 2167.00] Um, so you can probably assume, I would say that you could probably assume that benchmarking information would be coming relatively soon.
[2167.00 → 2168.00] Yes.
[2168.00 → 2169.00] That's all I'll say about it.
[2169.00 → 2170.00] Yeah.
[2170.00 → 2171.00] Yes.
[2171.00 → 2172.00] Ending there.
[2172.00 → 2175.00] Um, but there's like pictures out of them already.
[2175.00 → 2178.00] There are specs, there's comparison, which is showing on the screen right now.
[2178.00 → 2192.00] So in VR, naturally, it's doing very well because of the natural performance increases and then because of the performance increases afforded to it by SMP or simultaneous multi-projection, which we have a video out on Tech Wiki.
[2192.00 → 2193.00] On Tech Wiki.
[2193.00 → 2194.00] On Tech Wiki, yeah.
[2194.00 → 2195.00] It's been out, I think, for maybe like two weeks.
[2195.00 → 2196.00] You should watch it.
[2196.00 → 2199.00] It's, SMP is actually really, fascinating.
[2199.00 → 2200.00] It's, it's cool.
[2200.00 → 2201.00] Even if you're not just interested in VR.
[2201.00 → 2203.00] It's a really fantastic technology.
[2203.00 → 2205.00] I really highly recommend checking that out.
[2205.00 → 2207.00] If you're using three monitors, it can be very, very helpful.
[2207.00 → 2208.00] Yeah.
[2208.00 → 2209.00] Which a lot of people are.
[2209.00 → 2210.00] Yeah.
[2210.00 → 2211.00] So I would check it out.
[2211.00 → 2218.00] So the improvements there, 960 versus 1060 are 3x, they're stating, which is absolutely badass.
[2218.00 → 2220.00] In Rise of the Tomb Raider, it's slightly over 2x.
[2220.00 → 2223.00] Witcher 3, Wild Hunt, and Overwatch are slightly under 2x.
[2223.00 → 2225.00] Huge performance improvements.
[2225.00 → 2236.00] And they've been slinging around the term that the 1060 is getting 980-like performance in everything, not just VR.
[2236.00 → 2237.00] Yeah.
[2237.00 → 2238.00] I did clarify that.
[2238.00 → 2243.00] When I first heard about it, I thought they were doing that thing again where they were like, oh yeah, it's like this performance in VR.
[2243.00 → 2246.00] And then you get the performance bump because of SMP.
[2246.00 → 2259.00] But I have heard from them directly, without doing any benchmarking on my own, that it is on like performance levels with the 980, not including VR titles.
[2259.00 → 2261.00] So even just DirectX 11 and 12 titles.
[2261.00 → 2262.00] Which is super cool.
[2262.00 → 2265.00] I also put a picture of the card on the screen for you guys.
[2265.00 → 2273.00] And I don't know how easy it is for you to tell, but that kind of middle area, it looks pretty nice considering what tier this card is supposed to be at.
[2273.00 → 2274.00] Yeah.
[2274.00 → 2280.00] It sort of has a similar look to the high-end Founders Edition cards, but that little area actually is not a window.
[2280.00 → 2282.00] It's kind of just a piece of like plastic.
[2282.00 → 2286.00] It is a piece of metal plastic with like lines cut into it.
[2286.00 → 2287.00] So it sort of looks like the other ones.
[2287.00 → 2288.00] It's reminiscent though.
[2288.00 → 2289.00] Yeah.
[2289.00 → 2293.00] And like it can trick you if you don't look that closely, actually.
[2293.00 → 2295.00] It looks pretty good, especially for its price point.
[2295.00 → 2299.00] So one thing to add is this specific card is $300.
[2299.00 → 2300.00] The Founders Edition.
[2300.00 → 2301.00] Because it's the Founders Edition.
[2301.00 → 2304.00] There will be models released under that.
[2304.00 → 2309.00] But now that we've had experience with the Founders Edition with the 1080 and the 1070, we kind of know how this is going to go.
[2309.00 → 2318.00] So there's probably going to be one after market SKU that has a nice cooler on it that's like $5 or $10 cheaper than the Founders Edition.
[2318.00 → 2322.00] There's going to be an after market SKU that is more expensive than the Founders Edition.
[2322.00 → 2328.00] And then there's going to be the like cheap plastic blower style cooler.
[2328.00 → 2335.00] Yeah, which will be the advertised low after market MSRP price, which is $249.
[2335.00 → 2339.00] So that's only $50 more than the RX 480 from AMD.
[2339.00 → 2342.00] So these guys are going to be fighting it out a little bit.
[2342.00 → 2345.00] There is a $50 Delta on a $200 to $250 card.
[2345.00 → 2348.00] So that is actually significant at that price point.
[2348.00 → 2350.00] But they will be still fighting it out a little bit.
[2350.00 → 2353.00] And we will be doing a price performance on that once we actually-
[2353.00 → 2354.00] At some time.
[2354.00 → 2355.00] Yes, at some time.
[2355.00 → 2357.00] On an unspecified date.
[2357.00 → 2358.00] Yes.
[2358.00 → 2359.00] But you can look out for it.
[2359.00 → 2360.00] So, yes.
[2360.00 → 2361.00] Am I allowed to take in?
[2361.00 → 2362.00] Yes.
[2362.00 → 2363.00] Sure.
[2363.00 → 2364.00] Have we done sponsor spots already?
[2364.00 → 2365.00] No.
[2365.00 → 2366.00] No.
[2366.00 → 2367.00] Okay.
[2367.00 → 2368.00] Thanks, John.
[2368.00 → 2369.00] Thank you.
[2369.00 → 2370.00] Are you just slamming ice into your thing again?
[2370.00 → 2371.00] Yeah, I'm not really sure what the best solution is.
[2371.00 → 2374.00] Do you just wait for it to defrost and then drink the-
[2374.00 → 2375.00] Pretty much, yeah.
[2375.00 → 2376.00] Yeah.
[2376.00 → 2377.00] I'm all about the ice-cold water.
[2377.00 → 2378.00] Yeah.
[2378.00 → 2379.00] So I'm just gonna-
[2379.00 → 2380.00] So we had an issue with our freezer-
[2380.00 → 2381.00] That's how warm your computer is.
[2381.00 → 2382.00] Oh wow, wow.
[2382.00 → 2384.00] Ice melts really fast on a razor blade.
[2384.00 → 2389.00] We had an issue with our freezer defrosting.
[2389.00 → 2390.00] That probably sounds terrible.
[2390.00 → 2391.00] I'm sorry.
[2391.00 → 2392.00] I'm sorry.
[2392.00 → 2394.00] I'm shielding you best I can, Twitch chat.
[2394.00 → 2395.00] Everything about this is awful.
[2395.00 → 2396.00] No, I'm sorry.
[2396.00 → 2399.00] Including what it probably looks like I'm doing.
[2399.00 → 2400.00] What does it make that sound, Mommy?
[2400.00 → 2401.00] I don't know, Cassie.
[2401.00 → 2402.00] I don't know if I really saved them, but I genuinely tried.
[2402.00 → 2403.00] Ow.
[2403.00 → 2404.00] That didn't look comfortable at all.
[2404.00 → 2405.00] No, it wasn't.
[2405.00 → 2406.00] He just slammed his hand into ice and metal bottles.
[2406.00 → 2407.00] Yeah, that's fine.
[2407.00 → 2408.00] All good.
[2408.00 → 2409.00] Ah, refreshing.
[2409.00 → 2410.00] Okay.
[2410.00 → 2411.00] So we should probably do the sponsors for today.
[2411.00 → 2412.00] Sponsor number one is I have no idea.
[2412.00 → 2413.00] Blue apron?
[2413.00 → 2414.00] I have absolutely-Blue apron.
[2414.00 → 2415.00] Yeah.
[2415.00 → 2416.00] Oh, is it blue apron?
[2416.00 → 2417.00] Nice.
[2417.00 → 2418.00] Hell yeah.
[2418.00 → 2419.00] Good old blue apron.
[2419.00 → 2420.00] Come to Canada.
[2420.00 → 2421.00] The first 100 people to use this list, this list of people are good, but I genuinely
[2421.00 → 2422.00] really tried.
[2422.00 → 2423.00] I genuinely tried.
[2423.00 → 2424.00] Ow.
[2424.00 → 2425.00] That didn't look comfortable at all.
[2425.00 → 2426.00] No, it wasn't.
[2426.00 → 2427.00] You just slammed his hand into ice and metal bottles.
[2427.00 → 2428.00] Yeah, that's fine.
[2428.00 → 2429.00] All good.
[2429.00 → 2430.00] Ah, refreshing.
[2430.00 → 2431.00] Okay.
[2431.00 → 2432.00] So, we should probably do the sponsors for today.
[2432.00 → 2433.00] Sponsor number one is I have no idea.
[2433.00 → 2434.00] Blue apron?
[2434.00 → 2435.00] Blue apron?
[2435.00 → 2436.00] Yeah.
[2436.00 → 2437.00] Oh, is it blue apron?
[2437.00 → 2438.00] Nice.
[2438.00 → 2443.00] 100 people to use this link get three free meals on their first order.
[2443.00 → 2446.00] Which is actually like pretty freaking sick.
[2446.00 → 2451.00] So if you guys aren't familiar with blue apron, they allow you to create delicious chef-designed
[2451.00 → 2453.00] recipes right in your own home.
[2453.00 → 2455.00] I mean, you have to do the work.
[2455.00 → 2456.00] Yeah.
[2456.00 → 2457.00] But they make it easy to do the work.
[2457.00 → 2463.00] They deliver farm fresh ingredients right to your doorstep in exactly the right proportions.
[2463.00 → 2464.00] No trip to the grocery store.
[2464.00 → 2466.00] No waste from unused ingredients.
[2466.00 → 2468.00] And they offer two types of plans.
[2468.00 → 2469.00] Sometimes...
[2469.00 → 2470.00] Sorry.
[2470.00 → 2471.00] I'm just going to cut in here really quickly.
[2471.00 → 2475.00] Sometimes one of the most complicated things about eating healthy is getting the right
[2475.00 → 2480.00] stuff and knowing what to do with it and having it there at all.
[2480.00 → 2485.00] So I like that part of blue apron.
[2485.00 → 2486.00] Yeah.
[2486.00 → 2487.00] Alright, good for you.
[2487.00 → 2488.00] Yes.
[2488.00 → 2489.00] Thank you.
[2489.00 → 2491.00] Thank you for this segment of this is what Luke cares about.
[2491.00 → 2492.00] Sorry.
[2492.00 → 2493.00] This is a...
[2493.00 → 2494.00] Oh, we're wearing like gold and silver shirts today.
[2494.00 → 2495.00] Yeah.
[2495.00 → 2496.00] It reminds me of Rudolph...
[2496.00 → 2497.00] Sorry.
[2497.00 → 2498.00] Wow.
[2498.00 → 2499.00] I've tangented twice without even actually finishing a tangent.
[2499.00 → 2500.00] Silver and gold.
[2500.00 → 2502.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2502.00 → 2503.00] Sorry.
[2503.00 → 2505.00] Where I was targeting last time.
[2505.00 → 2507.00] I don't actually know if I can remember.
[2507.00 → 2511.00] Anyway, blue apron offers two plans.
[2511.00 → 2514.00] The two-person plan and the family plan.
[2514.00 → 2518.00] And the recipes are delivered in a refrigerated box so they stay fresh even if you're not at
[2518.00 → 2519.00] home.
[2519.00 → 2522.00] They have a large selection of recipes, and they're always adding new dishes to the menu.
[2522.00 → 2523.00] There's no commitment.
[2523.00 → 2529.00] You can skip or cancel the service at any time, and it's between 500 and 800 calories per person
[2529.00 → 2533.00] with all meal meals possible to be prepared in 40 minutes or less.
[2533.00 → 2534.00] Honestly, when...
[2534.00 → 2538.00] Before my wife and I had kids, we would almost always eat out.
[2538.00 → 2539.00] Yeah.
[2539.00 → 2545.00] And the reason for that was that when you factor in the quantity of food that you have to buy
[2545.00 → 2551.00] to get a good deal or how much you're paying for it when you're buying small quantities
[2551.00 → 2556.00] and how much of that you're going to end up wasting because you're just two people, it
[2556.00 → 2561.00] actually economically made more sense because neither of us really has particularly expensive
[2561.00 → 2562.00] taste in food.
[2562.00 → 2567.00] It's just like, let's run to like, you know, FOAM or whatever, and you'd get like a lemongrass
[2567.00 → 2569.00] chicken on rice for 850 plus tax.
[2569.00 → 2570.00] Yeah.
[2570.00 → 2571.00] As if they're paying any of it.
[2571.00 → 2578.00] Um, so, so it's, and, and that was usually enough for like dinner and then lunch the next
[2578.00 → 2579.00] day.
[2579.00 → 2580.00] Because it's like these huge portions.
[2580.00 → 2583.00] So we would eat cheaply, but we would eat out once we, once you have kids, the math
[2583.00 → 2588.00] gets a little bit, um, a little bit easier to justify, but blue apron is a fantastic solution
[2588.00 → 2589.00] to that.
[2589.00 → 2591.00] So head over to blueapron.com slash Linus.
[2591.00 → 2595.00] And, uh, sorry to everyone who's like super excited about this.
[2595.00 → 2596.00] Like I am.
[2596.00 → 2601.00] Uh, it's only in the U S if you're outside the U S then you are plum out of luck.
[2601.00 → 2605.00] But you know what you're not plum out of luck about?
[2605.00 → 2606.00] Squarespace.
[2606.00 → 2612.00] Squarespace is available anywhere that you can sign up for a free trial with no credit card
[2612.00 → 2613.00] required.
[2613.00 → 2618.00] And then after two weeks, give them a credit card so that your site can be up all the time
[2618.00 → 2620.00] with no hassle whatsoever.
[2620.00 → 2627.00] Our LinusMediaGroup.com site has never been down, asterisk, except when it was Linus Media
[2627.00 → 2628.00] Group's fault.
[2628.00 → 2635.00] So it did go down shortly recently, actually, but that was entirely to do with, uh, an infiltrator
[2635.00 → 2640.00] getting into our domain name registrar account and nothing to do with Squarespace's servers
[2640.00 → 2641.00] being down.
[2641.00 → 2644.00] We've been so pleased with the reliability of their site.
[2644.00 → 2646.00] And it is easy to build your website on Squarespace.
[2646.00 → 2649.00] Whether you're just want like a one-page web presence.
[2649.00 → 2652.00] However, Luke might feel about those.
[2652.00 → 2655.00] Are you doing a muted version of you should?
[2655.00 → 2656.00] Love it.
[2656.00 → 2658.00] I didn't even realize.
[2658.00 → 2664.00] Did you know that there is a the, the, uh, top post on Reddit, PC Master Race?
[2664.00 → 2665.00] Yeah.
[2665.00 → 2667.00] Was all of our sponsor callout stuff.
[2667.00 → 2669.00] Was like all the dankest sponsor callout memes.
[2669.00 → 2678.00] One of the like top things was a picture back from CES of like, have you, have, uh, have I spoken
[2678.00 → 2680.00] to you about our Lord and Saviour Squarespace or whatever.
[2680.00 → 2683.00] I was like, oh man, this is so cold.
[2683.00 → 2692.00] Anyway, whether you want a one-page presence or whether you want something more complex, all of their beautiful templates scale to the smallest or largest screens.
[2692.00 → 2697.00] And they are easy to use through their, uh, cloud based editing tool.
[2697.00 → 2699.00] They've got 24, seven tech support.
[2699.00 → 2708.00] So give it a try, get some help and, uh, use offer code when, which we have right there to save 10% off your first purchase.
[2708.00 → 2709.00] Squarespace.
[2711.00 → 2712.00] See, we didn't say it, Nick.
[2713.00 → 2714.00] I like your workaround.
[2714.00 → 2715.00] Thank you.
[2717.00 → 2718.00] I wonder if they'll swing it after us for that.
[2718.00 → 2723.00] Every time we do a Squarespace integration lately, have you, have you gotten the speeches?
[2723.00 → 2726.00] Every time I do any form of Squarespace integration, don't forget.
[2727.00 → 2729.00] None of the none of the slogans or catchphrases.
[2730.00 → 2731.00] Can't do that anymore.
[2732.00 → 2733.00] We just don't care what he says.
[2736.00 → 2737.00] It's better this way.
[2737.00 → 2738.00] Okay.
[2739.00 → 2742.00] Um, speaking of better this way, Lynda.com.
[2743.00 → 2745.00] The WAN show is better with three sponsors.
[2745.00 → 2750.00] That is after last week when we only had one because I screwed up and didn't do one of the reads.
[2750.00 → 2751.00] That's why I read today.
[2752.00 → 2753.00] Um, so Lynda.
[2753.00 → 2754.00] Wait, last week.
[2754.00 → 2755.00] Yeah.
[2755.00 → 2756.00] Last week I only did one sponsor spot.
[2756.00 → 2757.00] Were you here?
[2757.00 → 2758.00] Yeah.
[2758.00 → 2759.00] We both did one.
[2759.00 → 2760.00] Neither of us realized.
[2760.00 → 2761.00] There was only one in the doc.
[2761.00 → 2762.00] Oh, well then it's Colton's fault.
[2762.00 → 2763.00] Or am I crazy?
[2763.00 → 2764.00] No, no, no.
[2764.00 → 2765.00] Here.
[2765.00 → 2766.00] I'm going to track this down.
[2766.00 → 2767.00] Lynda.com.
[2767.00 → 2769.00] Used by more than, more than millions.
[2769.00 → 2773.00] Used by millions of people around the world with more than 3,000 courses available.
[2773.00 → 2777.00] Topics like web development, photography, visual design, business, video editing,
[2777.00 → 2780.00] software training like Excel, WordPress, and Photoshop.
[2780.00 → 2788.00] So whether you are, you know, trying to reenter the workforce and get up to speed on the latest newfangled technologies,
[2788.00 → 2795.00] or whether you're just a young person looking for educational supplements that aren't covered by your local school curriculum,
[2795.00 → 2798.00] Lynda is affordable and easy to use.
[2798.00 → 2803.00] The courses are taught by industry experts with new courses added every week.
[2803.00 → 2807.00] And whether, you know, you want to sit in front of your computer and study,
[2807.00 → 2813.00] or whether you want to download them to view on your phone offline, make better use of that time you're spending on the bus,
[2813.00 → 2816.00] Lynda has the tools to help you learn.
[2816.00 → 2822.00] All their courses have transcripts that you can read along with, or you can skip to that part of the video,
[2822.00 → 2828.00] so you can see the illustrations that go along with it, and you can create your own custom sort of curriculums
[2828.00 → 2832.00] that you can share with your friends, so you can all learn alongside each other.
[2832.00 → 2841.00] Plan started only 25 bucks a month, and you can get the first 10 days for free by visiting lynda.com slash WAN show.
[2841.00 → 2843.00] So was it not our fault?
[2843.00 → 2844.00] Yeah.
[2844.00 → 2845.00] Ha!
[2845.00 → 2846.00] It wasn't our fault.
[2846.00 → 2847.00] July 1, 2016.
[2847.00 → 2848.00] One sponsor spot.
[2848.00 → 2852.00] Alright, so let's get into the big topic!
[2852.00 → 2856.00] This was posted by, excuse me, MegaZero on the forum.
[2856.00 → 2859.00] Original article here is from Polygon.
[2859.00 → 2860.00] Let's go ahead and put this up.
[2860.00 → 2865.00] I love how this is like the, the, Linus and Luke fight Colton about the WAN doc stream.
[2865.00 → 2866.00] Is it?
[2866.00 → 2867.00] Oh!
[2867.00 → 2868.00] Kind of.
[2868.00 → 2869.00] Was there more?
[2869.00 → 2872.00] There was a missing quote at the beginning of a really long note.
[2872.00 → 2874.00] It was an end quote at the very end.
[2874.00 → 2876.00] I didn't know it was a quote that I was saying, and I was like, what?
[2876.00 → 2877.00] Way to go, Colton.
[2877.00 → 2878.00] Yeah!
[2878.00 → 2879.00] Um...
[2879.00 → 2882.00] Way to go from making the, the whole doc for us, and like, taking perfect notes.
[2882.00 → 2883.00] Yeah.
[2883.00 → 2884.00] Yeah.
[2884.00 → 2885.00] Hate that guy.
[2885.00 → 2886.00] Jerk.
[2886.00 → 2887.00] Alright.
[2887.00 → 2892.00] CSGO Lotto and owners sued over illegal gambling allegations.
[2892.00 → 2899.00] So I would like to begin this entire segment here with, allegedly.
[2899.00 → 2904.00] Because I am not going to get sued for libel.
[2904.00 → 2906.00] I am not interested in that.
[2906.00 → 2908.00] Everything is allegedly.
[2908.00 → 2911.00] So let's have a can, can, you know what?
[2911.00 → 2914.00] And there's like lots of people that have made really detailed videos about this.
[2914.00 → 2915.00] Yeah.
[2915.00 → 2916.00] I'm going to be right back.
[2916.00 → 2919.00] And everyone, no okay, not everyone.
[2919.00 → 2926.00] Lots of people are getting on the view bandwagon and making reaction videos and how they feel
[2926.00 → 2931.00] about these videos and lots of people are very hurt about this thing.
[2931.00 → 2933.00] Um...
[2933.00 → 2937.00] Allegedly hurt about this thing.
[2937.00 → 2938.00] Nice.
[2938.00 → 2939.00] Good idea.
[2939.00 → 2940.00] I got a piece of paper.
[2940.00 → 2941.00] Um...
[2941.00 → 2946.00] One thing that I find interesting before we even get into the notes, just because I'm sure a lot of people know what's going on,
[2946.00 → 2953.00] is that a lot of the hurt that seems to be going on, allegedly, um...
[2953.00 → 2954.00] Okay.
[2954.00 → 2955.00] Yes, we're armed.
[2955.00 → 2956.00] We're armed for this topic.
[2956.00 → 2962.00] Seems to be tied in with like, oh, underage gambling and promoting underage gambling.
[2962.00 → 2964.00] That was already happening.
[2964.00 → 2965.00] Yep.
[2965.00 → 2966.00] Obviously.
[2966.00 → 2967.00] Yep.
[2967.00 → 2971.00] The only new news, allegedly, is that these guys owned the site.
[2971.00 → 2975.00] They were still promoting this to a relatively young audience.
[2975.00 → 2982.00] Betting and gambling around CSGO has been blank word for a really long time.
[2982.00 → 2989.00] It was so corrupt and not cool and has like, in my opinion, kind of ruined the esport.
[2989.00 → 2990.00] Like, it's not a good thing.
[2990.00 → 2992.00] You should have already hated this.
[2992.00 → 3001.00] And a lot of videos that I'm seeing are purely based around the fact that it's gambling that is roughly, allegedly, targeted towards kids.
[3001.00 → 3002.00] Right.
[3002.00 → 3004.00] Which didn't change with this new information.
[3004.00 → 3005.00] Yeah.
[3005.00 → 3006.00] It's not new stuff.
[3006.00 → 3012.00] Well, I'm glad that this is at least forcing people to take a closer look at it and finally confront it.
[3012.00 → 3013.00] That's true.
[3013.00 → 3015.00] So, let's go through the alleged facts.
[3015.00 → 3016.00] Okay.
[3016.00 → 3018.00] YouTubers Tom Syndicate and Smart...
[3018.00 → 3019.00] Martin.
[3019.00 → 3020.00] Martin.
[3020.00 → 3021.00] Thank you.
[3021.00 → 3022.00] Sorry.
[3022.00 → 3023.00] I don't really follow gaming YouTubers.
[3023.00 → 3024.00] I didn't either.
[3024.00 → 3025.00] I just heard the name.
[3025.00 → 3026.00] Okay.
[3026.00 → 3035.00] So, they were promoting their own CSGO gambling site in videos and not disclosing the fact that they were owners of that site.
[3035.00 → 3045.00] So, in the first CSGO Lotto video that Martin posted, he said, we found this new site called CSGO Lotto, effectively lying to his viewers.
[3045.00 → 3052.00] Encouraged his viewership to go check it out and said that he won a pot, and it was the coolest feeling ever.
[3052.00 → 3056.00] And he said that he won a pot that was $69.
[3056.00 → 3060.00] I'm sure that was an entirely chance.
[3060.00 → 3068.00] Um, both YouTubers had strings of videos on their channels where they gambled CSGO skins through their website.
[3068.00 → 3075.00] So, on June 27th, YouTuber Honoured the Truth reported that Martin and Syndicate actually own the company CSGO Lotto.
[3075.00 → 3080.00] Martin replied with a video informing his audience that it's never been a secret,
[3080.00 → 3085.00] and originally claimed that he was offered an equity stake after he had already been sponsored by the company.
[3085.00 → 3090.00] The company documents show that he was the one who incorporated the company.
[3090.00 → 3093.00] So, that would be categorically false.
[3093.00 → 3097.00] He said he claimed it in every video that he had uploaded.
[3097.00 → 3106.00] So, H3H3 found that Martin had tried to go back to his older videos and put disclaimers in the video descriptions after the fact.
[3106.00 → 3108.00] This video has since been removed.
[3108.00 → 3116.00] Um, so, ownership of the company wasn't noted on Martin's LinkedIn while his other business ventures were.
[3116.00 → 3120.00] On July the 3rd, this has been very much an ongoing development here,
[3120.00 → 3123.00] H3H3 Productions covered it and the story blew up.
[3123.00 → 3127.00] Martin then released an apology video, which he has since also removed.
[3127.00 → 3131.00] July 4th, Martin deleted all of his videos revolving around CSGO Lotto.
[3131.00 → 3134.00] So, a sex, uh, or sorry, that's it.
[3134.00 → 3135.00] No, it's not sex.
[3135.00 → 3136.00] A second, second.
[3136.00 → 3137.00] I was going to say second.
[3137.00 → 3138.00] Just calm down.
[3138.00 → 3140.00] Um, so, Martin then released blah, blah, blah.
[3140.00 → 3142.00] Okay, so delete a blah, blah.
[3142.00 → 3148.00] So, there's actually a second, um, lawsuit, which we actually talked about, um,
[3148.00 → 3149.00] what?
[3149.00 → 3151.00] Filed a vein, blah, blah, blah.
[3151.00 → 3158.00] I knew, we, I knew about the lawsuit filed against Valve by, uh, what's his, what's his face?
[3158.00 → 3159.00] Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[3159.00 → 3163.00] I actually haven't looked into, I haven't looked into this one.
[3163.00 → 3170.00] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3170.00 → 3174.00] Okay, yeah, sorry, I'm not going to give any more detail on that, because I actually hadn't already checked that.
[3174.00 → 3181.00] Anyway, as of July 7th, Martin has gone dark, and his lawyers have stated that there will be no further comment.
[3181.00 → 3184.00] and that they will make their next comments in the courtroom.
[3184.00 → 3194.00] Separate story, but related, on July 4th, uh, YouTuber, uh, Pay Syndicate created a video where he admits that two of his videos from company Steam Lotto were rigged.
[3194.00 → 3203.00] So, he made a video on the Pay Syndicate channel named Pay Syndicate Exposed, which is kind of funny.
[3203.00 → 3206.00] It's like the dislike ratio is like half.
[3206.00 → 3210.00] So, I guess he's doing a little bit better than like, even worse than that.
[3210.00 → 3214.00] So, he was paid via skins to rig the lottery and win some highly valued CSGO skins.
[3214.00 → 3218.00] You know what though? I will give Pay Syndicate props for one thing.
[3218.00 → 3219.00] He played this right.
[3219.00 → 3220.00] Exposing himself.
[3220.00 → 3230.00] In the, in the wake of the huge news from much bigger guys, he will be completely forgotten.
[3230.00 → 3236.00] Like, his involvement in this will be completely forgotten and people will be mad, but they will get over it.
[3236.00 → 3244.00] Um, I actually, I, I, I have no idea what the outcome is going to be for, uh, for Tom Syndicate and T Martin here.
[3244.00 → 3246.00] Total Biscuit commented on that video.
[3246.00 → 3252.00] One of the okay, one of the top comments on Pay Syndicate's thing is someone saying, uh, Justin Greenleaf saying,
[3252.00 → 3256.00] I'm not applauding what you've done, but like you said, you didn't have to make this video.
[3256.00 → 3258.00] And that's a fair...
[3258.00 → 3260.00] Well, he did have to make the video.
[3260.00 → 3263.00] If, if he, if he didn't make that video, that's a fair comment.
[3263.00 → 3266.00] But if he didn't make this video, he would have gotten way more screwed.
[3266.00 → 3268.00] This video was made out of self-interest.
[3268.00 → 3272.00] Let's not kid ourselves about what was going on here with Pay Syndicate.
[3272.00 → 3274.00] I'm just saying it was a smart business move.
[3274.00 → 3278.00] If he got caught by someone else, he would have gotten picked up by the windstorm.
[3278.00 → 3282.00] Instead, uh, saying it himself is going to leave him on the ground.
[3282.00 → 3284.00] I think so anyway, but we'll see.
[3284.00 → 3286.00] Uh, Total Biscuit commented on that video.
[3286.00 → 3290.00] You people are a, well, effing embarrassment to our industry.
[3290.00 → 3292.00] And he is 100% right.
[3292.00 → 3293.00] Good job, Total Biscuit.
[3293.00 → 3295.00] This is the kind of thing that, yeah, it doesn't take a job.
[3295.00 → 3299.00] It's something that, yeah, it doesn't take a genius to figure out how embarrassing they are.
[3299.00 → 3302.00] It just takes someone who's outspoken enough to say it aloud.
[3302.00 → 3303.00] So, still.
[3303.00 → 3304.00] Good work, John.
[3304.00 → 3307.00] People are going, ProSyndicate and the face bomb.
[3307.00 → 3309.00] No, it's literally Pay Syndicate.
[3309.00 → 3310.00] ProSyndicate's the other dude.
[3310.00 → 3311.00] Yeah.
[3311.00 → 3312.00] Pay Syndicate is...
[3312.00 → 3313.00] Different guy.
[3313.00 → 3314.00] Is a different guy.
[3314.00 → 3315.00] Yeah, different guy.
[3315.00 → 3318.00] Uh, here, why don't I just go ahead and link that video in the Twitch chat so you can see...
[3318.00 → 3319.00] Total Biscuit is awesome.
[3319.00 → 3320.00] I just like...
[3320.00 → 3321.00] Yeah, I like John.
[3321.00 → 3322.00] I want to re-say that.
[3322.00 → 3326.00] Like, I don't watch anyone's videos on video games except for Total Biscuit.
[3326.00 → 3328.00] He is one of...
[3328.00 → 3332.00] Outside my family and Linus Media Group employees.
[3332.00 → 3339.00] I think he's one of less than a number of people I can count on my hand that I actually reply to tech support requests from.
[3341.00 → 3342.00] That's pretty cool.
[3342.00 → 3344.00] Because I just don't have time for it anymore.
[3344.00 → 3345.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3345.00 → 3347.00] But if it's John, he's like, oh yeah, I'm having an issue with, like, SLI.
[3347.00 → 3349.00] It's the only time he talks to me.
[3349.00 → 3350.00] SLI?
[3350.00 → 3351.00] No, no, not SLI.
[3351.00 → 3352.00] But if he has, like...
[3352.00 → 3354.00] The only time he talks to you is when he has SLI problems.
[3354.00 → 3355.00] No, no, no.
[3355.00 → 3356.00] It's the only problems he has.
[3356.00 → 3357.00] Yeah.
[3357.00 → 3363.00] If he has some kind of technical issue, he'll reach out.
[3363.00 → 3364.00] That's cool though.
[3364.00 → 3365.00] I don't know.
[3365.00 → 3366.00] He's...
[3366.00 → 3368.00] If he even liked me, I would do the same thing.
[3368.00 → 3369.00] He's super...
[3369.00 → 3374.00] He released a video soon about how he's gonna, like, change his content style because things are hard right now.
[3374.00 → 3377.00] And he's going to make it a little bit easier for him to produce content and stuff.
[3377.00 → 3378.00] Right.
[3378.00 → 3382.00] And, like, he was axing certain things and making new things and all this kind of stuff.
[3382.00 → 3386.00] And it was interesting, like, analyzing how I felt through the video.
[3386.00 → 3388.00] Because after I watched it, I was like, that was interesting.
[3388.00 → 3393.00] Because I felt bad for the shows that were dying, but then I was excited about his new show ideas.
[3393.00 → 3397.00] And I was like, I don't think I've ever felt bad about, like, a YouTube channel before.
[3397.00 → 3398.00] Sharp guy.
[3398.00 → 3399.00] Cool.
[3399.00 → 3400.00] Yeah.
[3400.00 → 3401.00] Sharp guy, good guy.
[3401.00 → 3402.00] And his plans are good.
[3402.00 → 3404.00] I'm excited about the direction of his channel.
[3404.00 → 3405.00] Um...
[3405.00 → 3406.00] So...
[3406.00 → 3407.00] Yeah.
[3407.00 → 3408.00] I guess...
[3408.00 → 3409.00] Oh, I guess we got...
[3409.00 → 3410.00] Yeah, we got another one here.
[3410.00 → 3411.00] So, uh...
[3411.00 → 3412.00] Here we go.
[3412.00 → 3413.00] Let's go ahead and post the link.
[3413.00 → 3414.00] I got the link.
[3414.00 → 3417.00] I'm just going to fire this baby up.
[3417.00 → 3419.00] So, the original article here is from Game Zone.
[3419.00 → 3422.00] So, Faze Rain and Faze Banks are also...
[3422.00 → 3423.00] Uh...
[3425.00 → 3426.00] Oh, good word.
[3426.00 → 3432.00] ...allegedly caught secretly owning a CSGO gambling site.
[3432.00 → 3435.00] Legal action is possibly...
[3435.00 → 3436.00] Allegedly...
[3436.00 → 3438.00] We know we're overusing the word, by the way.
[3438.00 → 3439.00] Just...
[3439.00 → 3441.00] We're forcefully trying to do that.
[3441.00 → 3442.00] Um...
[3442.00 → 3446.00] Two members of Faze Clan, which we literally just said, um, have already been caught...
[3446.00 → 3447.00] Okay.
[3447.00 → 3448.00] Just like Syndicate and T. Martin.
[3448.00 → 3449.00] Yeah.
[3449.00 → 3450.00] Um...
[3450.00 → 3452.00] So, they're Word and Shat and Ricky Banks.
[3452.00 → 3453.00] Yeah.
[3453.00 → 3454.00] Um...
[3454.00 → 3456.00] They claim they do not officially...
[3456.00 → 3458.00] Own it.
[3458.00 → 3463.00] Their accusers say that they are using this reply since it's held up by shell companies.
[3463.00 → 3467.00] But they are allegedly the owner through a number of shell companies.
[3467.00 → 3468.00] It's a much smarter way to do it.
[3468.00 → 3469.00] Yeah.
[3469.00 → 3471.00] I can't believe that, uh...
[3471.00 → 3472.00] I can't believe that...
[3472.00 → 3474.00] T. Martin has his just straight-up name on it?
[3474.00 → 3475.00] Yeah, that's...
[3475.00 → 3476.00] What the hell?
[3476.00 → 3477.00] Insane.
[3477.00 → 3478.00] Get it!
[3478.00 → 3479.00] Yeah!
[3479.00 → 3480.00] Did I get it?
[3480.00 → 3481.00] I think so.
[3481.00 → 3482.00] Yeah!
[3482.00 → 3483.00] I didn't see it anywhere around the hand.
[3483.00 → 3484.00] I killed something today.
[3484.00 → 3485.00] No, it's right there.
[3486.00 → 3487.00] Where'd it go?
[3487.00 → 3488.00] It's above you!
[3488.00 → 3489.00] It's above you!
[3489.00 → 3490.00] Jump!
[3490.00 → 3491.00] I think you got it!
[3491.00 → 3492.00] Yeah!
[3492.00 → 3493.00] Well, you officially killed something today.
[3493.00 → 3494.00] Yep!
[3494.00 → 3495.00] Nice!
[3495.00 → 3496.00] Bugs in the warehouse.
[3496.00 → 3497.00] It's like snakes...
[3497.00 → 3498.00] Hunting bugs on the land show!
[3498.00 → 3500.00] It's a sequel to Snakes on a Plane.
[3501.00 → 3502.00] Um...
[3502.00 → 3503.00] Wow, I clapped really hard.
[3503.00 → 3504.00] Good for you.
[3504.00 → 3506.00] That doesn't feel very good.
[3506.00 → 3509.00] Every time I say good for you, like I'm channelling...
[3509.00 → 3510.00] We had the...
[3511.00 → 3516.00] I'm free to tell this story because he or she is no longer with the company that he or she was associated with.
[3516.00 → 3517.00] Were you on that call?
[3517.00 → 3518.00] Yeah.
[3518.00 → 3519.00] Well, or I was there or something.
[3519.00 → 3520.00] I don't know.
[3520.00 → 3526.00] It was the most embarrassed I think I have ever felt for someone on a conference call.
[3526.00 → 3535.00] So, um, the boss's underling is kind of leading the first 10–15 minutes of the call because her boss is running late.
[3536.00 → 3538.00] Uh, which was a fairly common occurrence.
[3539.00 → 3542.00] And boss jumps on, hey, sorry I'm late.
[3542.00 → 3548.00] Underling kind of goes, okay, so I was just running them through this and this, and we're up to speed on this.
[3548.00 → 3550.00] Uh, they had a couple questions about this.
[3550.00 → 3551.00] Maybe we can pick up there.
[3551.00 → 3554.00] And, uh, yeah, everything's kind of good and under control.
[3554.00 → 3556.00] Boss says, good for you.
[3556.00 → 3558.00] And completely changes the topic.
[3558.00 → 3560.00] I was like, ugh.
[3560.00 → 3561.00] Just mortified.
[3561.00 → 3563.00] Like, just completely mortified.
[3563.00 → 3564.00] So then of course...
[3564.00 → 3565.00] Good for you.
[3565.00 → 3572.00] I go out of my way whenever Luke, like, does something good and should be feeling good about himself to say, good for you.
[3572.00 → 3575.00] I actually love that story.
[3575.00 → 3576.00] It's so legendary.
[3576.00 → 3579.00] It's just, it's such a, I can't, what a thing to say.
[3579.00 → 3581.00] And then, and like, the, oh, yeah.
[3581.00 → 3585.00] The thing was, you can sound condescending when you do that and then follow through with those things.
[3585.00 → 3589.00] And like, you're kind of a dick, but it's not that bad.
[3589.00 → 3599.00] To completely just go off away from everything that was planned while saying that is just like minimizing that person so much at that moment.
[3599.00 → 3600.00] Whole new level of rude.
[3600.00 → 3607.00] Anyway, so the, um, the alleged, uh, Faze Rain and Faze Banks thing was found out by YouTuber 8 Thoughts.
[3607.00 → 3611.00] So, very much a developing topic.
[3611.00 → 3619.00] Um, I would venture a guess that we are nowhere near the bottom of this barrel of poo.
[3619.00 → 3626.00] There will be much more poo dug out of the barrel, flung around, flung at people.
[3626.00 → 3629.00] The competitive gaming scene is kind of a mess.
[3629.00 → 3631.00] It is, it is a cesspool.
[3631.00 → 3636.00] And like, there's definitely sections of it that are far better.
[3636.00 → 3637.00] Obviously.
[3637.00 → 3642.00] But like, the amount of like, scandal crap and stuff like this.
[3642.00 → 3644.00] Just like, come on, that's coming out of it.
[3644.00 → 3645.00] Is crazy.
[3645.00 → 3646.00] Like there's-
[3646.00 → 3649.00] And like, I know some people are like, no, stuff happens with the NFL as well.
[3649.00 → 3651.00] They're huge!
[3651.00 → 3653.00] And it's been going on for a super long time.
[3653.00 → 3655.00] I'm not surprised that that's happening.
[3655.00 → 3657.00] And it's not right there either.
[3657.00 → 3658.00] Yeah.
[3658.00 → 3659.00] To be very clear.
[3659.00 → 3660.00] Yeah.
[3660.00 → 3671.00] Like, between labour disputes and inflate gate and every other stupid, freaking thing.
[3671.00 → 3673.00] I don't even follow professional sports anymore.
[3673.00 → 3674.00] Inflate gate was ridiculous.
[3674.00 → 3676.00] I, yeah, it's become too nuts.
[3676.00 → 3677.00] It's just insane.
[3677.00 → 3684.00] I can't like, this is, might get slightly controversial, but I, the one sport that I actually did really like watching was soccer.
[3684.00 → 3687.00] And soccer was the sport that I played most when I was growing up.
[3687.00 → 3688.00] You mean European football?
[3688.00 → 3689.00] Uh, yes.
[3689.00 → 3691.00] Uh, but I can't watch.
[3691.00 → 3694.00] I can't watch professional European football.
[3694.00 → 3695.00] Too much diving.
[3695.00 → 3696.00] Yeah.
[3696.00 → 3698.00] Like I LI- I can't deal with it.
[3698.00 → 3700.00] Whenever I see one happen, I just get mad.
[3700.00 → 3702.00] And then I'm like, there's no point in-
[3702.00 → 3703.00] Oh!
[3703.00 → 3704.00] Oh!
[3704.00 → 3705.00] Oh!
[3705.00 → 3706.00] Oh!
[3706.00 → 3707.00] Oh!
[3707.00 → 3708.00] Oh!
[3708.00 → 3709.00] Oh!
[3709.00 → 3710.00] Oh!
[3710.00 → 3711.00] Oh!
[3711.00 → 3712.00] Oh!
[3712.00 → 3713.00] Oh!
[3713.00 → 3714.00] Oh!
[3714.00 → 3715.00] Oh!
[3715.00 → 3716.00] Oh!
[3716.00 → 3717.00] Oh!
[3717.00 → 3718.00] Oh!
[3718.00 → 3719.00] Oh!
[3719.00 → 3720.00] Oh, oh!
[3720.00 → 3720.40] Oh!
[3721.00 → 3723.00] Oh!
[3723.00 → 3724.00] Oh!
[3724.00 → 3727.54] Screaming about your leg, you're not just going to be able to run after the goalie that just picked you up.
[3727.78 → 3728.92] You are an ass.
[3729.38 → 3730.86] Just like, oh, my God.
[3730.86 → 3732.84] And they come back on the next play and, like, score.
[3733.20 → 3734.02] Yeah, right?
[3734.10 → 3735.16] Like, come on.
[3735.26 → 3736.90] Like, are you injured or are you not injured?
[3737.02 → 3737.72] And, like, I wasn't.
[3737.88 → 3738.74] By the way, red card.
[3739.26 → 3740.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3740.42 → 3744.08] And, like, I come from playing sports like football and rugby.
[3744.44 → 3745.56] I'm not hitting people in soccer.
[3745.90 → 3746.26] American football.
[3746.50 → 3747.32] Yes, American football.
[3747.62 → 3748.94] And rugby is kind of universal.
[3749.72 → 3752.04] And, like, I'm not bringing the hitting into soccer.
[3752.16 → 3753.38] I didn't get carded in soccer.
[3753.38 → 3757.26] To be honest, in the leagues that I played in, dives wasn't really a big problem.
[3757.26 → 3758.40] Linus uses splash.
[3758.50 → 3759.06] It was effective.
[3761.90 → 3762.62] Thank you.
[3763.46 → 3767.84] In the leagues that I played in, diving wasn't really a problem.
[3768.00 → 3770.54] So I actually really enjoyed it and played it for many, many years.
[3770.92 → 3775.54] But watching pro soccer now, or pro European football, is just a nightmare.
[3775.66 → 3776.70] I can't deal with it.
[3776.76 → 3782.84] It makes me really upset to see these extremely skilled professional players fall down to such petty,
[3782.84 → 3786.06] pathetic acts of, I don't know, terrible.
[3786.18 → 3789.18] Anything to win, unfortunately, is what it all comes down to.
[3789.92 → 3790.28] Win.
[3790.40 → 3792.24] That only entails effort.
[3792.56 → 3793.18] That's great.
[3793.42 → 3793.84] Good job.
[3794.26 → 3797.50] So this was originally posted on the forum by Master Disaster.
[3797.50 → 3802.72] Here in America, sharing your password is now a federal crime.
[3803.22 → 3805.66] I'm going to go ahead and post this link in the Twitch chat.
[3806.16 → 3811.02] So this is, the original article here is from motherboard.device.com.
[3811.18 → 3813.24] Password sharing is a federal crime.
[3813.66 → 3814.72] Appeals court rules.
[3814.72 → 3815.40] I didn't know where to talk about this.
[3815.70 → 3816.02] Did you?
[3816.12 → 3820.02] Because I was like, John might be a good person to talk about this with and stuff.
[3820.46 → 3821.18] So it's not the title.
[3821.18 → 3822.98] Why don't you introduce the next topic then, smart guy?
[3823.10 → 3824.12] Just to fill you in.
[3824.40 → 3825.56] The title is super misleading.
[3825.66 → 3828.12] Why don't you just find a not misleading?
[3828.12 → 3829.58] It's like not sharing company passwords and stuff.
[3829.68 → 3830.86] So like Netflix is not a big deal.
[3831.14 → 3831.34] Okay.
[3831.38 → 3832.02] Well, I still hate you.
[3832.28 → 3832.32] So.
[3832.36 → 3832.62] Okay.
[3832.82 → 3833.14] That's fair.
[3833.16 → 3833.62] I don't hate you.
[3833.72 → 3834.20] What is this one?
[3834.48 → 3835.30] We can be shirt buddies.
[3835.38 → 3836.02] Shiny shirt buddies.
[3836.06 → 3836.34] Yeah.
[3836.76 → 3838.22] Do you turn yours inside out when you wash it?
[3840.18 → 3840.54] No.
[3840.54 → 3841.26] Very important.
[3841.66 → 3842.10] That's a good point.
[3842.10 → 3847.26] The foil shirts can, the foil deformities after apparently as few as 10 washes if you
[3847.26 → 3847.96] don't turn it around.
[3848.44 → 3853.86] But, and this is true of pretty much all of your clothing, black shirts, even just t-shirts.
[3854.10 → 3857.84] If you flip them inside out, then they'll retain their colour much, much better.
[3858.00 → 3858.34] Interesting.
[3858.62 → 3858.78] Yeah.
[3858.84 → 3861.38] So I flip all of my jeans and all of my other stuff.
[3861.94 → 3863.46] Fun fact about jeans.
[3863.46 → 3865.06] I will probably not remember to do any of this.
[3865.16 → 3868.98] Basically when I buy clothing, if I then realize that there's special washing instructions,
[3869.20 → 3869.80] I'm just like, well.
[3869.80 → 3872.56] Well, it's not special if you flip everything inside out.
[3873.66 → 3874.08] Yes.
[3874.26 → 3876.52] But that means everything has a special instruction.
[3877.16 → 3878.36] That's not special anymore.
[3878.38 → 3880.94] Everyone is a special, unique snowflake.
[3881.98 → 3882.74] You're special.
[3883.98 → 3884.72] Thank you.
[3885.60 → 3886.62] Good for you.
[3886.74 → 3887.44] Good for you.
[3890.44 → 3890.88] Okay.
[3891.02 → 3892.86] Why don't you move us on to the next thing then?
[3892.92 → 3893.22] Okay.
[3893.38 → 3894.10] Net neutrality.
[3894.10 → 3898.10] Should the EU slash regulation to win 5G connectivity.
[3898.58 → 3899.44] Have you shared the thing?
[3899.80 → 3901.66] No, but I can.
[3902.02 → 3902.26] Okay.
[3902.40 → 3907.92] So basically Europe's largest telecom groups have pledged to launch superfast 5G networks
[3907.92 → 3912.16] in at least one city in every EU country by 2020.
[3912.16 → 3917.84] So this is part of a manifesto signed by the heads of BT, Deutsche Telekom, Telecom Italia,
[3917.84 → 3919.82] and Vodafone, among others.
[3920.50 → 3928.60] As quid pro quo for more investment, controversial new EU rules on net neutrality should be watered
[3928.60 → 3929.06] down.
[3929.06 → 3934.90] So according to the document signed by 17 different telecom groups and seen by Financial Times,
[3934.90 → 3942.22] policies and rules must be future-oriented, pro-investment, and pro-innovation, the manifesto
[3942.22 → 3942.62] reads.
[3942.62 → 3947.26] The telecom industry warns that the current net neutrality guidelines as put forward by the
[3947.26 → 3953.74] BERET create significant uncertainties around 5G return on investment.
[3954.32 → 3959.28] Investments are therefore likely to be delayed unless regulators take a positive stance on innovation
[3959.28 → 3960.42] and stick to it.
[3961.62 → 3966.36] Telecom's industry also demands regulatory level playing field by placing communication
[3966.36 → 3970.36] tools such as WhatsApp and Skype under the same rules as them.
[3970.36 → 3978.64] So the rules that they create that are good for them, they want applied to somebody else.
[3978.72 → 3981.34] That sounds super dumb.
[3981.80 → 3982.12] Yeah.
[3982.32 → 3984.24] I guess that's all there is to really say about that.
[3984.52 → 3986.04] Have we gotten into any of the rapid fire stuff?
[3986.10 → 3986.86] I saw you guys did 1060.
[3986.86 → 3988.26] We talked about 1060 really quickly.
[3988.40 → 3989.34] We haven't talked about anything else.
[3989.50 → 3989.82] Okay.
[3990.00 → 3990.40] Cool.
[3993.02 → 3993.42] Okay.
[3997.82 → 3999.98] Blizzard is suing cheat creator.
[4000.36 → 4008.00] What the hell is this?
[4008.54 → 4009.98] Oh, you haven't seen this?
[4010.16 → 4010.48] No.
[4010.48 → 4010.80] Oh, my God.
[4010.80 → 4012.10] I missed this week.
[4012.18 → 4012.30] Okay.
[4012.38 → 4014.52] I'll post the thing.
[4014.76 → 4015.74] You talk about this.
[4015.74 → 4015.80] Okay.
[4015.80 → 4016.10] So microphone.
[4016.90 → 4017.36] Microphone.
[4017.80 → 4018.24] Microphone.
[4018.84 → 4019.24] Microphone.
[4019.30 → 4020.16] Dropping the Microsoft.
[4020.78 → 4021.14] Sorry.
[4021.28 → 4021.52] Go ahead.
[4021.52 → 4022.98] Microphone in soft.
[4022.98 → 4032.78] Microsoft invites quote unquote bay interns to get lit on lots of drinks and then apologizes
[4032.78 → 4035.96] because, oh my God, that's not how you talk to your employees.
[4037.16 → 4038.62] At like a large company.
[4038.72 → 4039.94] I mean, we do some silly stuff here.
[4040.08 → 4041.40] Even I wouldn't say that.
[4041.40 → 4042.24] I know you wouldn't.
[4042.40 → 4042.54] Yeah.
[4042.64 → 4043.18] At all.
[4043.28 → 4044.50] Like not even close.
[4044.74 → 4044.80] No.
[4046.36 → 4046.84] Yeah.
[4047.26 → 4051.12] Email was sent to interns using a cringy version of slang.
[4051.48 → 4055.92] The email began with, hey, bay intern exclamation mark heart symbol.
[4058.72 → 4060.50] Oh, you could probably stop there.
[4060.50 → 4066.10] And then went off to offer lots of drinks and the ability to get lit on a Monday night.
[4066.66 → 4069.90] Also a promised beer pong and hello noms.
[4070.52 → 4075.70] An apology was issued within hours because, oh my God, how could you think that was okay?
[4076.08 → 4081.58] After the invites went viral on social networks, noting that the email was poorly worded and
[4081.58 → 4083.94] not in keeping with our values as a company.
[4084.14 → 4085.82] No shoot.
[4088.14 → 4088.66] Sick.
[4089.02 → 4090.00] Oh, wow.
[4090.00 → 4091.12] That's great.
[4091.30 → 4093.08] Nick Van Burke's insight was sick.
[4093.32 → 4093.56] Yeah.
[4096.66 → 4098.94] Which I think is very appropriate for this article.
[4099.90 → 4100.34] Sick.
[4101.60 → 4105.38] So this was originally posted by Joel123 on the forum.
[4105.52 → 4107.44] I'm going to go ahead, and I'll just drop this.
[4107.44 → 4107.90] Is the D silent?
[4108.66 → 4109.46] I don't know.
[4109.54 → 4110.08] I guessed.
[4110.24 → 4111.14] I did my best with it.
[4111.14 → 4111.66] The Joel.
[4112.06 → 4114.78] But the original article here is from WCCF Tech.
[4114.78 → 4122.86] Apparently, LG G5's abysmal sales performance has led the company to make some drastic decisions.
[4122.86 → 4126.20] And here they are.
[4126.20 → 4132.92] So first up, they have decided to dismiss several staff and restructure the mobile division.
[4133.36 → 4138.96] Next, they've created a special program management office that will oversee product development
[4138.96 → 4140.62] in the future.
[4140.62 → 4145.58] The mobile division will answer directly to LG Mobile's head, CHO Juno.
[4145.78 → 4151.02] And LG's spokesperson explained that this activity wasn't only about G5 sales and no executive
[4151.02 → 4154.02] were asked to leave LG as part of this realignment.
[4154.58 → 4159.68] So the purpose is to create an optimized and agile organization that can deliver greater performance
[4159.68 → 4160.32] going forward.
[4160.32 → 4164.62] So I just want to go ahead and...
[4164.62 → 4165.42] I love the term agile.
[4165.70 → 4167.08] Fewer workers that work harder.
[4168.16 → 4168.38] Yeah.
[4168.64 → 4169.70] We're very agile.
[4169.94 → 4170.26] We are.
[4170.92 → 4171.38] I just...
[4171.38 → 4173.54] I love it when it's used when the companies are downsized.
[4173.54 → 4177.00] You just watch yourself because we might end up a little more agile if you're not careful.
[4177.20 → 4177.30] Okay.
[4178.14 → 4178.96] It is a threat.
[4179.16 → 4179.86] A little more agile.
[4180.18 → 4180.58] Okay.
[4180.72 → 4180.92] Sorry.
[4181.22 → 4182.64] Have fun producing that many videos.
[4182.68 → 4182.94] Yeah.
[4182.94 → 4191.78] So I want to take a moment to say, okay, I gave the G5 a negative review.
[4192.78 → 4197.40] A lot of people didn't like it, but I'm going to...
[4197.40 → 4198.26] Didn't like that you gave it a negative review?
[4198.26 → 4198.42] Yeah.
[4198.50 → 4198.92] Okay.
[4198.92 → 4199.12] Yeah.
[4199.20 → 4203.76] I'm going to point to this as evidence that...
[4203.76 → 4204.40] Your review worked.
[4204.40 → 4205.64] That was a very...
[4205.64 → 4206.24] No, not that.
[4206.44 → 4210.10] That was a vocal minority.
[4210.44 → 4210.62] Yeah.
[4210.80 → 4211.86] And I understand.
[4211.86 → 4218.54] There are users out there for whom the value of micros expansion and removable batteries
[4218.54 → 4222.12] that they are still clinging to from the Galaxy...
[4222.12 → 4223.42] What was it?
[4223.44 → 4224.34] When did they remove it?
[4224.40 → 4225.12] I can't even remember.
[4225.24 → 4225.78] I don't care.
[4226.52 → 4230.40] From the Galaxy S whenever they still had removable batteries and micros.
[4231.60 → 4232.50] I get it.
[4232.56 → 4233.62] You guys are clinging to that.
[4233.80 → 4234.46] That's fine.
[4234.92 → 4239.26] But that doesn't change the fact that that's not what most people care about.
[4239.26 → 4241.80] And in fact, it isn't what I care about.
[4242.48 → 4250.70] And the G5 compromised in ways that I cannot accept in order to have those features.
[4251.02 → 4251.14] Okay.
[4251.14 → 4252.16] I didn't watch.
[4252.48 → 4253.32] How did it compromise?
[4253.32 → 4258.88] Basically, it's an ugly three generation looking design.
[4259.04 → 4259.92] It doesn't look good.
[4259.98 → 4265.10] The size and weight are both very two, three gens ago.
[4265.58 → 4269.08] The removable battery is in the name of a gimmick.
[4269.24 → 4270.78] That is a terrible gimmick.
[4270.78 → 4276.58] I mean, and I had a lot of people really criticizing me about the modular interface slot at the bottom.
[4277.12 → 4283.72] Saying that because I hated on the camera one, which was really stupid, by the way.
[4284.04 → 4290.96] It's like, yay, I want my phone to not fit in my pocket or fit any third-party protective cases all in the name of a button.
[4290.96 → 4295.80] A button that I could literally use a different button on the phone to do.
[4296.58 → 4298.16] It was just stupid.
[4298.32 → 4303.04] And they were like, oh, well, you ignored the high definition audio module, which, by the way, isn't available in Canada.
[4303.22 → 4305.36] And you're ignoring all the potential for future modules.
[4305.46 → 4309.98] Well, looks like LG is realigning their business based on the fact that this phone isn't selling well.
[4310.18 → 4312.52] And I would be surprised if we see any more modules.
[4312.70 → 4315.84] Which, by the way, told you so.
[4316.06 → 4317.52] Saw that coming a mile away.
[4317.70 → 4318.84] How often have we seen this?
[4318.84 → 4320.30] Lots of times.
[4320.30 → 4321.02] Here's a product.
[4321.22 → 4325.74] It's going to have all these amazing first-party and third-party add-ons.
[4325.98 → 4328.40] And, oh, wait a second.
[4328.98 → 4330.30] Oh, it's a mobile phone.
[4330.62 → 4331.20] Oh, right.
[4331.90 → 4333.84] Oh, mobile phones move really fast.
[4334.06 → 4335.92] And the market demands change.
[4336.00 → 4337.52] And the hardware changes so quickly.
[4337.62 → 4340.94] Oh, actually, we'll be lucky if it ever gets a freaking D-brand skin.
[4342.20 → 4343.72] Yeah, that's what happened.
[4344.26 → 4345.58] So, I'm sorry.
[4345.58 → 4352.58] I'm sorry if you have an LG G5 and you really, really love it, and you rub it up against your tummy for good luck at night or whatever else the case may be.
[4353.56 → 4354.68] Very adorable, by the way.
[4354.70 → 4355.10] We keep doing that.
[4356.26 → 4359.62] It doesn't change the fact that the negative review, I believe, was merited.
[4359.68 → 4362.14] There were a couple of things I got wrong, to be very, very clear.
[4362.26 → 4363.50] I forget what the details were.
[4363.56 → 4365.20] But there were a couple of little things I got wrong.
[4365.20 → 4367.90] But I still didn't like the phone.
[4368.46 → 4369.46] And knowing those things now...
[4369.46 → 4370.12] Good for you.
[4370.48 → 4371.22] Thank you for that.
[4371.66 → 4373.94] Knowing those things now, I still don't like the phone.
[4374.08 → 4375.76] I wouldn't even begin to consider using it.
[4376.00 → 4377.48] And apparently neither would a lot of people.
[4378.08 → 4380.46] And I'm sure that I'm getting ripped apart in the Twitch chat.
[4380.80 → 4382.20] But I guess I'm...
[4383.32 → 4384.16] Yeah.
[4385.26 → 4386.86] It's just the number of people that are like,
[4386.92 → 4389.62] how much did Samsung pay you to give this phone a negative review?
[4390.96 → 4391.32] Nothing.
[4391.50 → 4392.00] Not a thing.
[4392.00 → 4393.28] I'm allowed to have my own opinion.
[4393.62 → 4394.46] And that was one of the...
[4394.46 → 4396.60] Actually, that review was one of the triggers
[4396.60 → 4400.78] that pushed me to create Honest Answers,
[4400.84 → 4401.48] How Do We Make Money?
[4401.80 → 4403.62] To address it once and for all,
[4403.68 → 4407.44] that we do not get paid to make reviews.
[4407.56 → 4408.74] I just want to give a shout-out to...
[4408.74 → 4409.94] Well, we do get paid to make reviews.
[4410.26 → 4412.80] But not by the maker of the product that we are reviewing.
[4413.16 → 4415.06] I just want to give a shout-out to MG2R,
[4415.30 → 4416.14] mod on the forum.
[4416.30 → 4417.84] This is the first time he's been able to catch the stream
[4417.84 → 4419.14] in one and a half years.
[4419.90 → 4420.80] And he's live right now.
[4421.62 → 4421.94] Nice.
[4422.18 → 4422.42] Yeah.
[4422.56 → 4423.58] One and a half years.
[4423.74 → 4423.98] Yeah.
[4424.28 → 4424.64] Wow.
[4424.94 → 4425.18] Yeah.
[4425.62 → 4426.72] He's on vacation right now.
[4428.28 → 4431.68] I guess I probably shouldn't have just told everyone
[4431.68 → 4432.38] that he's on vacation.
[4432.82 → 4434.08] Anyway, enjoy it.
[4435.14 → 4438.48] Consumer Reports finds that the Galaxy S7 Active
[4438.48 → 4440.96] is not actually water-resistant,
[4441.06 → 4442.38] which is good timing for them to...
[4442.38 → 4443.02] Okay, well, that's not true.
[4443.02 → 4443.90] ...release this.
[4444.30 → 4447.74] I'm getting exhausted of people using words incorrectly.
[4448.44 → 4449.84] It's definitely water-resistant.
[4449.88 → 4450.16] Yes.
[4450.16 → 4452.20] Who knows to what degree.
[4452.20 → 4456.92] But maybe not necessarily to the extent that Samsung has been advertising.
[4457.12 → 4461.16] So Consumer Reports actually tested not one, but two S7 Actives
[4461.16 → 4467.98] at Samsung's claimed 30 minutes of survival in fresh water at low depths.
[4467.98 → 4470.66] And both of them failed.
[4470.66 → 4476.00] So my plan right now then is to finish my review, finish shooting all of our B-roll,
[4476.14 → 4479.04] and then I'm actually going to test it as the last thing.
[4479.12 → 4482.66] Because the reality of it is, and Samsung's coming out and saying,
[4482.88 → 4483.90] yo, hold on a second.
[4483.90 → 4487.54] And actually, it's pretty darn water-resistant.
[4488.50 → 4492.36] Give us a shot here to kind of address this, you guys.
[4492.44 → 4492.66] Yeah.
[4493.82 → 4495.12] What is going on here?
[4496.10 → 4498.32] Oh, I moved the things around.
[4498.72 → 4499.36] Okay, all good.
[4499.46 → 4499.78] All good.
[4499.84 → 4500.40] Everything is fine.
[4502.10 → 4503.72] And you can have a bad unit.
[4503.92 → 4505.56] You can even have two bad units.
[4505.56 → 4508.42] So I just want to see if there are three bad units.
[4508.58 → 4512.20] We'll take a crack at it with ours and see how that goes.
[4514.38 → 4518.98] What else do we really have in the doc today that looks phenomenally important?
[4519.26 → 4520.42] It is after time now.
[4521.22 → 4521.52] Yeah.
[4521.80 → 4523.32] It's kind of like after party time.
[4524.88 → 4525.68] Yeah, okay.
[4525.86 → 4527.56] Let's call that a...
[4527.56 → 4530.66] One interesting thing that I want to discuss a little bit,
[4530.78 → 4534.04] if I can jump into my email here really quick.
[4534.28 → 4535.80] I can preface it slightly.
[4536.10 → 4537.84] I was thinking about answering on there,
[4538.20 → 4542.32] and then decided not to with some insight from Nick Light.
[4543.00 → 4548.70] But I made that video about the Oculus Rift.
[4549.42 → 4549.96] Oh, okay.
[4549.96 → 4552.20] And kind of like tore it apart, right?
[4552.82 → 4554.60] Well, you tore apart Oculus.
[4555.04 → 4555.28] Yeah.
[4555.44 → 4556.16] Not the Rift.
[4556.34 → 4556.56] Yeah.
[4557.56 → 4560.16] So guess what Subreddit liked the video
[4560.16 → 4561.88] and what Subreddit disliked the video.
[4562.72 → 4563.52] So you were mean...
[4563.52 → 4564.00] Largely.
[4564.08 → 4564.66] Like, generally.
[4564.66 → 4566.22] So you were mean to the Oculus Rift.
[4566.40 → 4566.62] Yeah.
[4567.24 → 4571.22] I would guess that Oculus Subreddit didn't like it.
[4571.70 → 4575.30] And I would guess that Five Subreddit thought it was funny.
[4575.58 → 4576.62] That's what you'd guess.
[4577.84 → 4581.70] The Rift Subreddit largely seemed to very much like it.
[4582.04 → 4586.74] And the Five Subreddit largely seemed to very much dislike it.
[4586.74 → 4588.70] To my absolute confusion...
[4589.34 → 4591.70] So is Oculus just...
[4591.70 → 4596.20] Like, are they in that much of a poisonous state right now?
[4596.20 → 4599.58] One of the things that I had said there was that it's currently an incomplete experience.
[4599.96 → 4601.56] And that the touch controllers need to come out.
[4601.92 → 4602.20] Right.
[4602.20 → 4604.80] So a lot of the Oculus guys was like, that is correct.
[4606.04 → 4610.08] And one thing that I had said was that they're fighting for timed exclusives, not full exclusives.
[4610.30 → 4613.30] So the Oculus guys were like, that is correct.
[4613.88 → 4614.14] Okay.
[4614.32 → 4614.80] Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[4614.86 → 4615.92] So they were kind of onboard.
[4616.16 → 4619.90] They were like, this isn't a positive review, but you didn't say anything wrong.
[4620.00 → 4622.14] Which, in my opinion, good.
[4622.64 → 4622.94] Right.
[4622.94 → 4624.16] I have no problem hearing that.
[4624.60 → 4628.98] The Five guys were pissed at me because I didn't go more into the drama segment.
[4629.48 → 4638.86] Which, in part of my write-up that I didn't end up sending, was that Linus, very properly, this should have happened, cut out probably like two and a half pages.
[4639.34 → 4643.48] I cut out about 80% of what he wanted to say about all the drama and game developers.
[4643.72 → 4644.40] And I was like...
[4644.40 → 4646.28] I was just kind of sitting here going, who cares?
[4646.28 → 4647.24] And he was right.
[4647.58 → 4652.12] And to be completely honest, a lot of it just doesn't matter.
[4652.62 → 4656.90] And has now been actually nullified by them changing how they're doing things.
[4657.06 → 4659.06] And was just false.
[4659.72 → 4664.08] One thing that I loved to do was, why didn't you talk about Giant Cop or Super hot?
[4664.38 → 4668.14] And there are quotes on the screen from both of them.
[4669.24 → 4670.92] I did talk about them.
[4671.20 → 4674.30] Anyway, they're all timed exclusives and stuff.
[4674.30 → 4675.64] But if you guys...
[4675.64 → 4677.40] I saw a lot of comments in there.
[4677.60 → 4688.22] If you guys want to attack stuff because there wasn't enough drama in it, I think...
[4688.22 → 4689.14] You're missing the point.
[4689.16 → 4691.16] Maybe refocus the expectation.
[4691.40 → 4691.60] Yeah.
[4692.34 → 4693.20] I actually...
[4693.20 → 4693.56] You know what?
[4693.58 → 4694.60] That's funny that you say that.
[4694.60 → 4703.48] Because the video that I just shot, Honest Dancers Episode 3, where I'm going to get into what's going on with our Amazon Associates account.
[4703.48 → 4705.64] I have the final story for that.
[4705.80 → 4706.84] So that's going to come out there.
[4707.76 → 4712.38] I'm going to be talking about the Twitter hack that occurred last week.
[4712.50 → 4713.00] I think so.
[4713.22 → 4713.42] Yeah.
[4713.62 → 4715.26] I'm going to be talking about the Twitter hack.
[4715.40 → 4717.48] And I'm going to be talking about a couple of other little things.
[4717.48 → 4723.62] One of the things I specifically say is we don't do drama on Linus Tech Tips.
[4724.08 → 4726.30] If you want that, go subscribe to H3H.
[4726.30 → 4727.52] I took the facts that I had.
[4727.58 → 4728.76] I took the quotes that I had.
[4728.82 → 4730.54] I told you how it was running right now.
[4730.80 → 4731.82] That's what actually mattered.
[4732.00 → 4733.82] Linus was right when he cut out all the stuff in the script.
[4734.34 → 4735.06] That's how that goes.
[4736.66 → 4739.20] That's why my card says Senior Editor on it.
[4739.20 → 4741.16] Also because I'm old.
[4741.52 → 4742.10] Does it?
[4742.30 → 4742.62] No.
[4743.72 → 4745.62] I was like, why would it say that?
[4746.40 → 4747.50] You have a way cooler title.
[4747.68 → 4747.88] All right.
[4747.92 → 4751.28] Well, all I know is I'm going to be going home tonight to play with my HTC Five.
[4752.00 → 4754.30] I'm going to be going home tonight, but not to play with my HTC Five.
[4754.36 → 4755.18] I'm going to be playing games, though.
[4755.36 → 4756.78] You should really set up your Five.
[4756.78 → 4757.60] It's going to be set up this weekend.
[4757.60 → 4758.54] You should set up your Five.
[4758.72 → 4759.06] I know.
[4759.16 → 4759.64] Do it tonight.
[4761.16 → 4768.68] Well, I think streaming the setup of the Five would be kind of not because that's a super
[4768.68 → 4769.58] work-related thing.
[4770.22 → 4771.82] Streaming the setup of the Five.
[4772.58 → 4773.02] Why?
[4773.92 → 4774.50] Isn't it?
[4774.94 → 4776.18] It feels work-related.
[4776.64 → 4777.56] Setting up the Five?
[4777.72 → 4777.98] Yeah.
[4778.32 → 4779.12] It's your Five.
[4780.86 → 4783.70] If I built a computer on the stream, would it not be work-related?
[4784.04 → 4785.92] If you built a computer on the stream.
[4786.62 → 4789.68] Because I have all those LAN computers, but I haven't been streaming the builds of them
[4789.68 → 4792.66] because it feels like that is something I would do for work.
[4792.78 → 4796.68] But then I have literally filmed myself setting up the Five and put it in a video for work.
[4797.10 → 4798.64] So it feels work-related, doesn't it?
[4798.66 → 4799.22] I don't know.
[4799.38 → 4800.22] I have no idea.
[4800.96 → 4802.14] We'll figure this out later.
[4802.38 → 4802.52] Okay.
[4802.64 → 4805.26] In the meantime, same bad time, same bad channel, you guys.
[4805.32 → 4806.08] We'll see you next week.
[4806.28 → 4806.56] Bye.
[4808.96 → 4809.76] And we'll do it.
[4812.00 → 4813.22] It will be set up this weekend.
[4813.48 → 4813.74] Good.
[4813.86 → 4815.42] If I don't do it tonight, I'm doing it tomorrow.
[4815.42 → 4816.00] You have to do it.
[4816.04 → 4818.54] Because, like, what's-what's-his-face-Frisbee game?
[4819.06 → 4819.98] Oh my god.
[4820.10 → 4825.80] Okay, if that comes out, and it's not set up yet, I will set it up immediately in my room.
[4826.00 → 4826.34] Okay.
[4826.58 → 4827.66] But I'm setting it up this weekend.
[4827.88 → 4828.60] Yep, I like it.
[4828.68 → 4829.74] I am having so-
[4829.74 → 4830.30] Project Arena.
[4830.90 → 4831.24] Okay.
[4832.04 → 4836.18] I am having a ridiculous amount of fun to have audio shape.
[4836.28 → 4836.64] Audio shape.
[4837.32 → 4839.40] You have to send me your list of songs that work well.
[4839.48 → 4840.14] So much fun.
[4840.28 → 4842.82] You're not going to like any of my songs that work well.
[4842.82 → 4845.76] One of them is literally Bop by Hanson.
[4846.68 → 4847.58] But you know what?
[4847.74 → 4849.62] It just works really well with the game.
