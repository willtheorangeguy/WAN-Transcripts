[0.00 → 11.00] Well, hello, hello everyone! Thank you for joining me here on The WAN Show. It's going to be just me this week.
[11.00 → 18.00] That is to say, unless Twitch pulls a Dennis or Riot, which seems pretty likely.
[18.00 → 25.00] Although I think he is busy editing a video right now, so I'm really not sure if it's going to be an option.
[25.00 → 39.00] But I've actually got a fair number of good topics this week, asterisk, because some of the good topics that I'll be discussing this week are actually ones that took place more last week than this week.
[39.00 → 47.00] But I didn't get a chance to talk about them last week because Luke got all distracting with his dreamy blue eyes and all that stuff.
[47.00 → 51.00] So Luke and Brandon are actually on an embargoed trip right now.
[51.00 → 61.00] They are in Switzerland, of all places. Pretty freaking cool, which means that I am on my own, except that, yes, Twitch chat is completely exploding.
[61.00 → 68.00] Thank you for that, Twitch chat. I'll tell you what. I will ask Dennis to join me for a few minutes here, but I really don't know how much time he's going to have.
[68.00 → 80.00] You guys are merciless. Just for a few minutes. That's always how my requests start.
[80.00 → 87.00] Hey, can we do that thing I want to do? It'll only take a few minutes.
[87.00 → 96.00] So I've got a pretty good show for you guys today, though. Some of the topics are actually leftovers from last week, like I said, but there is some pretty interesting stuff from this week.
[96.00 → 104.00] So in spite of my inability to order one, the HTC Five managed to sell 15,000 units in 10 minutes. Talking about the implications of that.
[104.00 → 112.00] Samsung has a 15 terabyte SSD. I'm waving, but my body language. I'll try it. Furthermore, I'll try it.
[112.00 → 121.00] Hi, Dennis. Welcome to the show. Hold on. I'm just going to tell people about some of the topics we got this week.
[121.00 → 132.00] So John McAfee revealed on national television how to hack into the San Bernardino killer's iPhone, which the method he outlined.
[132.00 → 139.00] I mean, I'm no iPhone security expert, but caused me to raise an eyebrow, and I'm not the only one.
[139.00 → 151.00] Far Cry Primal's map. Same map as Far Cry 4. More on this at 11. And joining me for the show is Dennis, with one of the gigantic food of his people around his neck.
[151.00 → 154.00] Would you say that shrimp is food of the Taiwanese people?
[154.00 → 158.00] Yeah. Yeah, this is fresh, big shrimp I got from Taiwan.
[158.00 → 161.00] Okay, excellent. I'll roll the intro now.
[161.00 → 169.00] Oh, nice. Thank you. Ed made it.
[169.00 → 175.00] It's me and Luke. Yeah. With shirts that we no longer wear, but that we used to wear.
[175.00 → 180.00] Those used to be like our trademark shirts.
[180.00 → 182.00] Yep. We don't have that couch anymore.
[182.00 → 186.00] Nope, we do not have that couch anymore. I do still have that shirt somewhere.
[186.00 → 191.00] And Luke may still have that. I think it's like a tea liquid hoodie. He may still have it somewhere.
[191.00 → 194.00] But I'm genuinely uncertain.
[194.00 → 197.00] We definitely don't have the red cushions anymore. Those are gone.
[197.00 → 198.00] Yeah.
[198.00 → 202.00] Yeah. I actually gave that couch to a friend of mine who runs a badminton centre now.
[202.00 → 208.00] So, badminton. You're Asian. What do you know about badminton? You like badminton?
[208.00 → 218.00] I play in Taiwan's PE class. We play a lot of badminton. But I'm not professional. I don't think I'm as good as you.
[218.00 → 221.00] You don't have to say that just because like...
[221.00 → 225.00] I'm better than the other people here, I think.
[225.00 → 228.00] Okay. Okay. We should play sometime. We should play sometime.
[228.00 → 236.00] Maybe we'll get an opportunity to engage in some kind of fun, exciting sports thing sometime in the next little bit.
[236.00 → 239.00] We'll see how your physical sporting prowess is.
[239.00 → 245.00] So, let's jump into our first topic for the day. This was posted by Sam Fisher on the forum.
[245.00 → 250.00] I have not... I forgot to test if my screen capture was working.
[250.00 → 255.00] So, it helps if you plug in the HDMI cable. And...
[255.00 → 257.00] Whoa! Look at that!
[257.00 → 261.00] The stream computer worked for the first time ever.
[261.00 → 268.00] The HTC Five sold over 15,000 units in 10 minutes.
[268.00 → 270.00] That's... the Taiwanese people made that.
[270.00 → 271.00] Yeah, that's my people.
[271.00 → 275.00] Yep. So, well, they... I mean, they make pretty much everything that's not made in...
[275.00 → 277.00] That's not made in China. So, it's like...
[277.00 → 284.00] It's like Taiwan and Japan. If you want something that's sort of a step above China, then that's where you're gonna want to go.
[284.00 → 289.00] So, HTC has been hanging on for dear life. They can't make a phone that anyone wants.
[289.00 → 293.00] So, they partnered up with Valve. They introduced the HTC Five.
[293.00 → 297.00] The initial concept looked fascinating, for those of you who need a bit of a primer on it.
[297.00 → 307.00] Where they had this idea where, instead of having a tracker right in front of the user, they were going to have these lighthouse towers for extremely low latency motion...
[307.00 → 310.00] Excuse me, motion... position detection.
[310.00 → 314.00] And the initial units were frankly not very impressive.
[314.00 → 316.00] At... did you try the Five at CES this year?
[316.00 → 318.00] No. No, I didn't get to see that.
[318.00 → 327.00] At CES this year, the Five grew up. The Five put on its big boy pants and started to look like a legitimate competitor for the Oculus Rift.
[327.00 → 334.00] Now, to my knowledge, Oculus has not released any of the sales figures for the Rift.
[334.00 → 342.00] But the Five was priced at... if I recall correctly, it was $799 US.
[342.00 → 344.00] Let me just... let me just... let me just... yeah.
[344.00 → 360.00] So, the Five was priced at $800, leading many, myself included, to believe that, combined with the cost associated with running VR on a computer that's powerful enough to run VR, would really hurt initial adoption.
[361.00 → 369.00] I mean... 15... can you believe 15,000 people bought a pair of goggles that goes on their head that runs with, like, a handful of programs,
[369.00 → 375.00] and they have to have a computer starting at probably around $1,000 to $1,300 to even use?
[375.00 → 377.00] Hmm... that's quite a lot.
[377.00 → 379.00] Have you tried VR at all?
[379.00 → 392.00] I... I try... I didn't try the entire thing. Furthermore, I have a... Furthermore, I tried a glasses' thing in CES. Didn't have much time. But I would love to try that. The Five.
[392.00 → 396.00] Thanks, Dennis. You're a great co-host here. You're helping me out a lot here.
[396.00 → 398.00] The Five is amazing.
[398.00 → 401.00] Really? You guys... you guys all have tried it?
[401.00 → 403.00] A few people tried it at CES.
[403.00 → 404.00] Okay. I didn't even see it.
[404.00 → 411.00] You don't have to be so shy, man. Like, if someone's... if, like, me or Luke is, like, trying something at CES, you can be like, can I try it?
[411.00 → 414.00] Did Luke's... I don't think we saw that at CES.
[414.00 → 417.00] Um... yeah, I'm pretty sure. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[417.00 → 430.00] We went to the HTC booth, but we saw the... there's a scale thing. That's all we saw. Oh, not CES. The thing before CES. The first day. So, I didn't see CES.
[430.00 → 444.00] So, the implications of this are pretty huge from my perspective. I mean, I am willing to bet money, based on that HTC has never, you know, come out and said, yeah, we sold 15,000 of our new flagship phone in 10 minutes.
[444.00 → 451.00] That it has been a long time since HTC has had a product fly off the shelf like this.
[451.00 → 461.00] And for them to get their foot in the door in a real way, whether it's the partnership with Valve, whether it's the fact that the Five is just a really impressive piece of hardware,
[461.00 → 465.00] this could be a breath of fresh air into the lungs of HTC.
[465.00 → 473.00] And I personally have been kind of rooting for them all this time, because they were that... they were that kind of upstart from nowhere.
[473.00 → 484.00] People forget this, but they were kind of like a OnePlus many years ago when Android was just kind of starting to chip away at the market share of the other phone makers.
[484.00 → 489.00] And they were kind of a big deal. They made a lot of really important phones over the years.
[489.00 → 502.00] And as much as phones have kind of lost their glamour with anyone but Apple, Samsung, or actually LG to a certain extent lately, unable to really dazzle people with their new phone releases,
[502.00 → 510.00] if HTC is the one out of all those guys that figured out, okay, we're going to jump into this, then I'm proud of them.
[510.00 → 512.00] I'm proud of them. Great job, guys.
[512.00 → 516.00] And to be clear, I do recognize that Samsung has the whole Gear VR thing going on.
[516.00 → 526.00] But you guys need to recognize that the Five and the Oculus Rift are completely different pieces of hardware compared to something like Gear VR.
[526.00 → 530.00] It is not the same thing at all.
[530.00 → 534.00] So, yeah, I guess that's... I am blown away.
[534.00 → 536.00] You know, here. I want to hear from you guys.
[536.00 → 539.00] And this is important. This is important, you guys.
[539.00 → 542.00] I want you to answer as honestly as possible.
[542.00 → 545.00] Did you pre-order a Five?
[545.00 → 551.00] You know what? Did you pre-order a gaming VR headset?
[551.00 → 553.00] And I'm going to put all the options on here.
[553.00 → 555.00] So, Five...
[555.00 → 558.00] And I'm really serious. I'm leaving out the turn-up option, okay?
[558.00 → 562.00] So, Five, Rift, both, none.
[563.00 → 565.00] Let's get that poll created here.
[565.00 → 566.00] And I want to hear from you guys.
[566.00 → 569.00] By the way, I did eventually manage to get...
[569.00 → 572.00] Everyone, stop answering the Twitch chat for crying out loud.
[572.00 → 575.00] That's not how we do things. I can't even read that.
[575.00 → 577.00] Can they even see your thing?
[577.00 → 579.00] Because it's all gone back out.
[579.00 → 582.00] I know. And they make it impossible for me to post my links.
[582.00 → 584.00] Look at the link. Click the Bitly, you guys.
[584.00 → 585.00] The LTT bought Bitly.
[585.00 → 586.00] So, let's have a look.
[586.00 → 590.00] So, guys, to be clear, I did eventually manage to get a Five pre-order in.
[590.00 → 593.00] It took me a little while. It took me about 40 minutes.
[593.00 → 598.00] So, I'm deeply concerned that I'm not going to be getting a particularly early unit,
[598.00 → 600.00] which is going to set back our coverage for it.
[600.00 → 603.00] But, whatever, there's nothing I can do about that at this point.
[603.00 → 604.00] So, I did get one.
[604.00 → 606.00] So, we definitely have an order in for a Rift.
[606.00 → 608.00] And we definitely have an order in for a Five.
[608.00 → 615.00] And we're going to be really looking into how video cards perform with these.
[615.00 → 617.00] What the experiences are like.
[617.00 → 619.00] I'd love to even maybe branch out.
[619.00 → 621.00] And I haven't talked to Luke about this, so don't quote me on this.
[621.00 → 625.00] But I'd love to even do some game and app reviews specific.
[625.00 → 627.00] Specifically for these products.
[627.00 → 631.00] Because while I recognize, especially now seeing the results of this poll,
[631.00 → 640.00] that very few of you are actually interested enough in gaming-grade VR to plunk down, you know,
[640.00 → 645.00] I think it ended up costing me about 1200 Canadian rubles for just one of them.
[645.00 → 649.00] To plunk down that kind of money on a gaming headset.
[649.00 → 652.00] I think it is super important for the future.
[652.00 → 658.00] And it's important for us to get familiar with these devices so we can continue to provide you guys with
[658.00 → 663.00] contextually relevant information about the new devices that will be coming in the future.
[663.00 → 668.00] And it's also important for us to have these devices here in the office so poor Dennis can try them.
[668.00 → 669.00] Yeah.
[669.00 → 671.00] Where do you have the needle?
[671.00 → 672.00] What?
[672.00 → 673.00] Oh.
[673.00 → 674.00] Okay.
[674.00 → 677.00] These, that is an interesting question.
[677.00 → 678.00] And I'm glad you asked.
[678.00 → 684.00] So, I have these needle-capped syringes here on the table.
[684.00 → 686.00] And the finger...
[686.00 → 687.00] Yeah.
[687.00 → 688.00] It's called nail polish.
[688.00 → 689.00] Nail polish.
[689.00 → 690.00] Yep.
[690.00 → 691.00] Nail polish.
[691.00 → 698.00] Which, ironically, does not polish your nail so much as cover your nail with paint.
[698.00 → 701.00] Nail polish is actually a bit of a misnomer.
[701.00 → 702.00] Oh.
[702.00 → 705.00] A misnomer is a name for something that...
[705.00 → 706.00] But it's not right.
[706.00 → 707.00] It's not...
[707.00 → 708.00] It doesn't accurately describe it.
[708.00 → 709.00] Yeah.
[709.00 → 710.00] See?
[710.00 → 711.00] This is how the arrangement works.
[711.00 → 713.00] We don't actually pay them.
[713.00 → 716.00] But he teaches us about Taiwanese culture.
[716.00 → 717.00] Yeah.
[717.00 → 718.00] And edits videos.
[718.00 → 721.00] And then, you know, we teach him English.
[721.00 → 724.00] We're not doing a very good job of our end of the bargain though.
[724.00 → 726.00] Sorry, Dennis.
[728.00 → 730.00] Here's the what's that for.
[730.00 → 731.00] Okay.
[731.00 → 732.00] So, actually, this...
[732.00 → 735.00] I'm going to be doing a live experiment with the...
[735.00 → 736.00] Here, I'll actually...
[736.00 → 737.00] I'll switch to the camera angle.
[737.00 → 738.00] That looks terrifying.
[738.00 → 739.00] That I'm planning to use for...
[739.00 → 740.00] No, no.
[740.00 → 741.00] It's not a big deal.
[741.00 → 743.00] I'll be doing a live experiment where...
[743.00 → 750.00] I had a lot of people comment on my painting video of this GTX 980 Ti that the text here,
[750.00 → 755.00] the GTX 980 Ti, really needs to be a different colour to make it pop.
[755.00 → 756.00] Because this used to be black.
[756.00 → 766.00] So, my theory is that I can do a poor man's, like, epoxy resin fill technique to colour this
[766.00 → 768.00] with a syringe and some nail polish.
[768.00 → 775.00] That is an actual technique that's used to make things like high-end case badges and emblems.
[775.00 → 781.00] So, where they'll actually have a metal stamped or cast sticker.
[781.00 → 782.00] Yeah.
[782.00 → 783.00] And then they fill in with different colours.
[783.00 → 784.00] That's cool.
[784.00 → 789.00] So, I'm hoping that I can do that for sort of under $10 kind of thing.
[789.00 → 790.00] But I don't know if it's going to work.
[790.00 → 791.00] But I was...
[791.00 → 792.00] If I ran out of topics on my show today, I was going to...
[792.00 → 793.00] Is it easy to get needles?
[793.00 → 794.00] Yeah.
[794.00 → 795.00] It's just a needle.
[795.00 → 796.00] You just tell the pharmacy you're diabetic.
[796.00 → 797.00] What is that?
[797.00 → 798.00] Diabetic.
[798.00 → 799.00] Oh.
[799.00 → 800.00] Yeah.
[800.00 → 802.00] That means you have, like, a brain disorder that makes it so when...
[802.00 → 803.00] No, I'm just kidding.
[803.00 → 804.00] Diabetes, yes.
[804.00 → 805.00] Diabetes.
[805.00 → 806.00] I know diabetes.
[806.00 → 807.00] Yes, you can also get them at safe injection sites.
[807.00 → 808.00] They're very nice.
[808.00 → 809.00] The ones they have at the safe injection sites are better?
[809.00 → 810.00] Well, the people are very nice.
[810.00 → 811.00] Oh, the people are nice.
[811.00 → 812.00] Let's get to see those.
[812.00 → 813.00] I don't need to judge you.
[813.00 → 814.00] Oh, how did you know?
[814.00 → 827.00] So, posted by Nona Hex on the forum.
[827.00 → 831.00] The original article here is from Computer World.
[831.00 → 837.00] Samsung ships the world's highest capacity SSD with 15 terabytes of storage.
[837.00 → 840.00] Now, 15 terabytes of storage.
[840.00 → 846.00] So, Dennis, do you know how much overall storage capacity we have in our entire server room?
[846.00 → 849.00] Um, 200 terabytes?
[849.00 → 853.00] Um, actually, that is very, very close.
[853.00 → 854.00] Yep.
[854.00 → 858.00] We are somewhere in the neighbourhood of 200 terabytes of storage.
[858.00 → 866.00] Now, that 200 terabytes of storage takes up, um, one entire 4U rack.
[866.00 → 868.00] That's all magnetic storage.
[868.00 → 876.00] And another 4U rack with the necessary, um, uh, host bus adapters and trays and two and a half inch SSDs.
[876.00 → 877.00] It's not a very efficiently laid out case.
[877.00 → 879.00] It's only got 24 SSDs in it.
[879.00 → 881.00] But so far we've taken up eight years worth of racks.
[881.00 → 889.00] And then we've got another machine that's just got like a, like a temporary, like a dumping ground for, um, for offloaded footage that makes up the rest of it.
[889.00 → 898.00] With a mere, what, 12 of these SSDs, we would be, because we've actually got about 185 terabytes.
[898.00 → 910.00] So we would be, we would have the same capacity of storage that we have in our entire server room in like what I could fit in my two hands, just like this.
[910.00 → 911.00] Yeah, wow.
[911.00 → 913.00] This thing looks freaking bananas.
[913.00 → 916.00] Now it is still, I believe it is SATA.
[916.00 → 919.00] I don't even think it, no, no, it is SAS.
[919.00 → 921.00] So this is a SAS drive.
[921.00 → 927.00] Uh, they're calling it the PM1633A, and it is the highest capacity solid state drive.
[927.00 → 929.00] Um, it peaks.
[929.00 → 935.00] So random read and write speeds of up to 200,000 and 3200 IOS per second.
[935.00 → 939.00] So to be clear, those read IOPS are pretty darn good.
[939.00 → 942.00] Those write IOPS are not particularly impressive.
[942.00 → 956.00] So what Samsung's going after here is the, uh, write infrequently read very, very frequently and with very, very high data storage density applications.
[956.00 → 959.00] And there is definitely a place for this.
[959.00 → 971.00] Like for example, um, while it doesn't have the same kind of performance that a PCI Express based, uh, preferably NVMe SSD would have because it uses a SAS interface.
[971.00 → 978.00] It's a you can connect a lot more of them to a system just with host bus adapters or raid cards.
[978.00 → 980.00] So you can connect like whack loads of them.
[980.00 → 983.00] You're not limited by how many PCI Express slots you have.
[983.00 → 987.00] And in addition to that, uh, it is hot swappable.
[987.00 → 991.00] So you don't have to power down the system, take it out and swap a card.
[991.00 → 999.00] If you have a drive failure or something along those lines, this is freaking incredible.
[999.00 → 1001.00] 15.36 terabytes.
[1001.00 → 1002.00] Oh, wow.
[1002.00 → 1003.00] Look at, look at this.
[1003.00 → 1008.00] So Samsung is trying to set a new bar for the endurance of the drive as well.
[1008.00 → 1011.00] It can support one full drive, right?
[1011.00 → 1012.00] Right.
[1012.00 → 1013.00] Per day.
[1013.00 → 1021.00] That is a full 15.36 terabytes every day on a single drive without failure over its five-year warranty.
[1021.00 → 1024.00] Holy freaking crap.
[1024.00 → 1031.00] So let me tell you, there are some data centre architects that are drooling over this.
[1031.00 → 1039.00] And I'm personally drooling too because I can think of all kinds of things that I would love to use a 15 terabyte SSD for.
[1039.00 → 1041.00] Wow.
[1041.00 → 1048.00] So they're saying that the random read IOPS performance is about a thousand times that of a SAS type hard disk drive.
[1048.00 → 1053.00] And the sequential read and write speeds are more than twice the speed of a typical SATA SSD.
[1053.00 → 1054.00] Because this is not just SAS.
[1054.00 → 1056.00] It is SAS 12 gigabit.
[1056.00 → 1063.00] So that is the because of, I believe it's due to the controller complexity and the power consumption.
[1063.00 → 1072.00] That is the next step for the for what, remember guys, SAS and SATA are very closely related and have, and have evolved with each other.
[1072.00 → 1077.00] So that would be the next step for SATA if they could figure out how to solve those problems.
[1077.00 → 1092.00] And if there was really a need for a desktop system to have so many drives connected to it anymore with between the cloud and NAS storage, I can't think of a reason why most personal computers really need more than one or maybe two drives.
[1092.00 → 1105.00] So the, so the desire for this, you know, 12 gigabit interface that you can connect, you know, anywhere between six or 12 or however many SATA ports you would have on a motherboard drives is, is really not very high.
[1105.00 → 1107.00] And the, and the cost of implementing it is very high.
[1107.00 → 1112.00] I've learned some turning FAP process in SATA.
[1112.00 → 1116.00] We don't really refer to it as FAP externally. We call it fast as possible.
[1116.00 → 1117.00] Yeah.
[1117.00 → 1120.00] But, uh, that's good.
[1120.00 → 1124.00] They know what I'm talking about.
[1124.00 → 1125.00] Yes.
[1125.00 → 1126.00] They call you that word too.
[1126.00 → 1127.00] Yeah.
[1127.00 → 1128.00] They, they probably, they probably do.
[1128.00 → 1131.00] Um, so what was I going to say?
[1131.00 → 1132.00] All right.
[1132.00 → 1145.00] So the way that Samsung is achieving all this capacity is with their stackable, uh, vertical NAND, they are right now far and away the industry leader in that technology with guys like Intel, very much playing catch up.
[1145.00 → 1146.00] So let's, let's see.
[1146.00 → 1148.00] There's actually a lot of really great technical details.
[1148.00 → 1151.00] This is a perfect article from computer world here.
[1151.00 → 1155.00] So they're using the same, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1155.00 → 1156.00] What are we looking at?
[1156.00 → 1158.00] So how many 256 gigabit dies are on here?
[1158.00 → 1160.00] And then then then.
[1160.00 → 1161.00] Wow.
[1161.00 → 1165.00] 256 gigabit on a chip that is larger than the tip of a finger.
[1165.00 → 1172.00] So they're stacked in 16 layers to form a single 512 gigabyte package.
[1172.00 → 1178.00] So there's a total of 32 of those flash packages in the 15.36 terabyte drive.
[1178.00 → 1187.00] Um, this is actually a question that a lot of people have asked whether it's directly to me or just, I've seen this, this question on forums and stuff over the years.
[1187.00 → 1190.00] And here, I will, I will pose it to you, Dennis.
[1190.00 → 1192.00] I'll see if you can, I'll see if you can answer the question.
[1192.00 → 1193.00] I'll see if I can, I can answer the question.
[1193.00 → 1194.00] Okay.
[1194.00 → 1195.00] So you know how a hard drive is like this big?
[1195.00 → 1196.00] Yeah.
[1196.00 → 1197.00] Okay.
[1197.00 → 1199.00] And an SSD is so small.
[1199.00 → 1200.00] Yeah.
[1200.00 → 1205.00] Like they're like this big or in the cases of laptops, remember the one, you probably edited the one on M.2, right?
[1205.00 → 1206.00] Yeah.
[1206.00 → 1207.00] Like they're tiny.
[1207.00 → 1210.00] They're just a little, like they basically are like a thicker SD card.
[1210.00 → 1211.00] Yeah.
[1211.00 → 1212.00] Like crazy.
[1212.00 → 1223.00] So a lot of people have asked over the years, why don't they just pack as many flash chips as they can into something the size of a hard drive for desktops?
[1223.00 → 1225.00] Then we could have had high capacity.
[1225.00 → 1234.00] I mean, theoretically, if Samsung can make a 15 terabyte, two and a half inch SSD today, why can't they make a 60 terabyte, three and a half inch SSD today?
[1234.00 → 1235.00] Hmm.
[1235.00 → 1241.00] I really don't know why, but that sounds doable.
[1241.00 → 1244.00] And in theory it does.
[1244.00 → 1248.00] And I'll explain why, just because a lot of people have brought this up over the years.
[1248.00 → 1251.00] The reason is actually due to a couple of things.
[1251.00 → 1252.00] Number one is cost.
[1252.00 → 1256.00] And number two is actually very closely related to number one, and it is complexity.
[1256.00 → 1263.00] So the cost of the NAND chips, it doesn't get cheaper if you make them bigger.
[1263.00 → 1281.00] In fact, the manufacturing process for NAND chips is refined to the point where down to micrometers, they've determined what the optimal size is for the optimal interconnect speed and all that nonsense that goes on inside a chip.
[1281.00 → 1292.00] There is no point, there's no benefit to making it physically larger and putting it into a larger package because you might actually end up with a latency penalty, for example, that would hurt performance.
[1292.00 → 1293.00] So there's the cost.
[1293.00 → 1307.00] So just because you can put, you know, 3000 flash chips into something the size of a like a five and a quarter inch optical drive, like, yeah, why don't we just have five and a quarter inch SSDs, and we'll put them in our optical bays?
[1307.00 → 1310.00] Doesn't mean that we could afford it.
[1310.00 → 1313.00] And the number two is complexity also related to cost.
[1313.00 → 1329.00] So building a controller that supports more communication channels out to all of these chips and can handle things like load balancing and, and the, the levelling of the wearing out of all the different NAND chips in the drive.
[1329.00 → 1332.00] Building that controller is extremely difficult.
[1332.00 → 1341.00] And the more, the more, the more communication it needs to do, the more calculation it needs to do, the more expensive and the more complex it needs to be.
[1341.00 → 1352.00] And unless you can sell over a certain threshold of these controllers, you're not going to make back what you spent in R and D, no matter how much you end up charging for it.
[1352.00 → 1363.00] So you have to wait until the economies of scale make enough sense that you can build a complex enough controller that you can attach enough NAND chips, NAND chips that you can afford in order to make an SSD of a higher capacity.
[1363.00 → 1372.00] So the solution that we've been left with is you just have small SSDs and big metal adapters if you really, really, really want to put them into a three and a half inch bay.
[1372.00 → 1375.00] I'm so lost.
[1375.00 → 1377.00] I'm so lost.
[1377.00 → 1378.00] Sorry, Dan.
[1378.00 → 1379.00] That's okay.
[1379.00 → 1381.00] Hopefully you guys aren't lost.
[1381.00 → 1383.00] This is great.
[1383.00 → 1386.00] Retro Capes says you're having a Vietnam flashback.
[1386.00 → 1391.00] I'm just trying to persist all the words you say.
[1391.00 → 1392.00] Yeah, sorry.
[1392.00 → 1393.00] I talk pretty fast.
[1393.00 → 1396.00] Although I read a fascinating article once.
[1396.00 → 1398.00] Ed actually linked it to me.
[1398.00 → 1400.00] I would love to be able to find it.
[1400.00 → 1403.00] By the way, we've got the final results for our straw poll here.
[1403.00 → 1408.00] 91% of you did not pre-order a gaming VR headset with a whopping 8%...
[1408.00 → 1409.00] That doesn't add up.
[1409.00 → 1410.00] What the hell?
[1410.00 → 1411.00] What the hell?
[1411.00 → 1412.00] Okay.
[1412.00 → 1413.00] Anyway.
[1413.00 → 1414.00] Rounding error.
[1414.00 → 1427.00] 91% of you did not pre-order a gaming VR headset with 8% of you saying that you did and only 1% of you saying that you pre-ordered both.
[1427.00 → 1446.00] So, very niche, very expensive, but apparently around the world, beyond our audience, where we've got about 150 people saying they bit the bullet and went for it, there are apparently thousands and thousands of people revealing a much healthier appetite for this stuff than I would have necessarily expected.
[1446.00 → 1452.00] Especially given how few people have actually had an opportunity to try it.
[1452.00 → 1455.00] When's the VR thing coming out?
[1455.00 → 1457.00] Is it coming out in this couple of five years?
[1457.00 → 1458.00] A couple of years?
[1458.00 → 1459.00] Or...
[1459.00 → 1462.00] Well, one of the headsets is shipping in April.
[1462.00 → 1463.00] So, we'll have one here.
[1463.00 → 1464.00] Wow.
[1464.00 → 1465.00] Like, very soon.
[1465.00 → 1471.00] However, if you're a Mac user, you may not be able to enjoy that same privilege.
[1471.00 → 1475.00] So, this was originally posted by Master Disaster on the Forum.
[1475.00 → 1478.00] Original article here is from PC Gamer.
[1478.00 → 1480.00] Oculus founder.
[1480.00 → 1486.00] Rift will come to Mac if Apple, quote, ever release a good computer.
[1486.00 → 1487.00] Wow.
[1487.00 → 1488.00] Burn.
[1488.00 → 1496.00] And to be clear, to be clear, and this is right in the article, very sensationalist headline.
[1496.00 → 1498.00] I don't blame them.
[1498.00 → 1503.00] When your entire business is whether people click on your article or not, I don't...
[1503.00 → 1508.00] As long as you're not being deceptive, I don't actually blame you for trying to attract people to click on it.
[1508.00 → 1511.00] But, it does say...
[1511.00 → 1521.00] He did clarify, saying that he was referring to Apple's lack of high-end GPU support, even in its high-end systems, that the Rift is dependent on.
[1521.00 → 1531.00] So, he went on to say, you can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with a top-of-the-line AMD Fire Pro D700, and it still doesn't match Oculus' recommended specs.
[1531.00 → 1533.00] I mean, remember guys, Oculus is asking for what?
[1533.00 → 1536.00] R9290 or a GTX 970 graphics card.
[1536.00 → 1541.00] I mean, we're talking a current-gen, enthusiast-grade graphics card.
[1541.00 → 1549.00] Whereas, Apple, over the last little while, unless you look at their mobile lineup, has really de-emphasized the importance of GPU.
[1549.00 → 1551.00] And to be clear, I don't mean mobile laptops.
[1551.00 → 1554.00] They're laptops, some of them I think still have decent GPUs in them.
[1554.00 → 1556.00] But nothing high-end.
[1556.00 → 1560.00] I mean, a lot of people say, you know, Linus, why do you use the Racer Blade 14?
[1560.00 → 1562.00] It's just a MacBook with a better GPU.
[1565.00 → 1567.00] Why do I have to explain why I use it?
[1567.00 → 1571.00] Because the MacBook is a great piece of hardware.
[1571.00 → 1572.00] It's a MacBook Pro, to be clear.
[1572.00 → 1580.00] The MacBook Pro is a great piece of hardware, but it has a freaking fantastic GPU for what it is and for how much it costs.
[1580.00 → 1583.00] That's why the Racer Blade 14 makes a lot of sense to me.
[1583.00 → 1590.00] So, I guess that's pretty much all there is to really say about that.
[1590.00 → 1594.00] I was going to riff on this with Luke if he was here this week a little bit more.
[1594.00 → 1597.00] But, Damien Dennis, I'll get your thoughts.
[1597.00 → 1602.00] What?
[1605.00 → 1607.00] I don't know.
[1607.00 → 1611.00] Do you think Apple makes good enough computers for gaming?
[1611.00 → 1615.00] I've never seen people playing games on Mac.
[1615.00 → 1620.00] Mostly they do media things like Photoshop or Illustrator or video editing.
[1620.00 → 1624.00] But seriously, I've never seen people play games on Mac.
[1624.00 → 1627.00] Oh, Nick. He has a Mac.
[1627.00 → 1628.00] Yeah, get rest, Burke.
[1628.00 → 1633.00] He played like stupid little games when he was in college. In class.
[1633.00 → 1634.00] In every class.
[1634.00 → 1635.00] Yeah.
[1635.00 → 1636.00] In class.
[1636.00 → 1637.00] How did he pass?
[1637.00 → 1639.00] Did he get better grades than you?
[1639.00 → 1641.00] Yes. In every class.
[1641.00 → 1642.00] But no.
[1642.00 → 1644.00] My grammar is better than his.
[1644.00 → 1645.00] Your grammar is better than his?
[1645.00 → 1646.00] Yes.
[1646.00 → 1647.00] But.
[1647.00 → 1648.00] Like in writing.
[1648.00 → 1649.00] Yeah.
[1649.00 → 1650.00] No, no, no.
[1650.00 → 1651.00] There's a grammar test.
[1651.00 → 1652.00] I got 100% go.
[1652.00 → 1653.00] Wait, you guys are in BIT.
[1653.00 → 1654.00] Why are you doing grammar tests?
[1654.00 → 1655.00] There's a communications class.
[1655.00 → 1656.00] Because we have communications diplomas.
[1656.00 → 1657.00] Communication is what we do.
[1657.00 → 1658.00] That's what our education is.
[1658.00 → 1659.00] What do you mean communications is what you do?
[1659.00 → 1660.00] You never even graduated.
[1660.00 → 1661.00] Yeah, well that's why my communication is shit.
[1661.00 → 1674.00] Okay, there was a law class that we had, and I never studied, and I always just played Age
[1674.00 → 1679.00] of Empires in it and I would just subconsciously listen, and I got an A in it and then I failed.
[1679.00 → 1681.00] But you suck at Age of Empires.
[1681.00 → 1682.00] Yeah, so?
[1682.00 → 1686.00] So you work hard on Age of Empires, but you suck.
[1686.00 → 1688.00] I work hard on Law.
[1688.00 → 1689.00] I pass still.
[1689.00 → 1693.00] I think we can all agree that Age of Empires is much more important to his current line
[1693.00 → 1694.00] of work than Law.
[1694.00 → 1699.00] How else would I find those novel facts?
[1699.00 → 1700.00] No.
[1700.00 → 1703.00] Alright, so moving on with actually the show.
[1703.00 → 1709.00] This is a big deal, and hopefully we can get Dennis to weigh in on this one.
[1709.00 → 1710.00] Okay.
[1710.00 → 1712.00] This was posted by Mech777 on the forum.
[1712.00 → 1714.00] The original article here is from Tech Power Up.
[1714.00 → 1716.00] Let's go ahead and pull that up.
[1716.00 → 1717.00] Oh, you know what?
[1717.00 → 1722.00] I just realized I've been totally Deeping, and I haven't been posting the articles in the
[1722.00 → 1723.00] Twitch chat.
[1723.00 → 1724.00] Normally Luke does that for me.
[1724.00 → 1725.00] I'm sorry guys.
[1725.00 → 1726.00] There you go.
[1726.00 → 1728.00] There's the article from Tech Power Up there.
[1728.00 → 1730.00] And now I'm going to try and find my way back to it.
[1730.00 → 1731.00] Crying out loud.
[1731.00 → 1732.00] Okay, there we go.
[1732.00 → 1741.00] Windows Store games are going to be limited in some pretty freaking crappy ways.
[1741.00 → 1747.00] I mean Microsoft, the more times they commit to the PC Gamer, the more times they turn
[1747.00 → 1754.00] around and take a steaming dump on the PC Gamer, especially the enthusiast PC Gamer.
[1754.00 → 1755.00] I understand.
[1755.00 → 1759.00] I understand that if all you play is like, what's it called?
[1759.00 → 1767.00] Like Yuma or like, you know, what's that stupid game that my sister played with the café diner
[1767.00 → 1769.00] dash, or you know, whatever.
[1769.00 → 1776.00] If that's all you, if that's all you play on your PC, you are technically still a PC Gamer.
[1776.00 → 1778.00] And I'm not going to be down on that.
[1778.00 → 1780.00] Like, yeah, you're not like OG enough.
[1780.00 → 1781.00] You're not hardcore enough.
[1781.00 → 1784.00] You don't have a five digit Steam ID, yo.
[1784.00 → 1790.00] You know, I'm not, I'm not going to be like that or anything, but why take a crap on the
[1790.00 → 1797.00] enthusiast gamers who do invest in hardware that runs your operating system and not let
[1797.00 → 1798.00] them take full advantage of it.
[1798.00 → 1803.00] So word on the street right now, the way that it's looking right now is that Windows Store
[1803.00 → 1815.00] games may not have proper support for adaptive V-Sync, SLI and Crossfire modding, or even proper
[1815.00 → 1823.00] full screen game support because while it is, so what it appears that they are going to
[1823.00 → 1829.00] be doing is running these games as Windows apps.
[1829.00 → 1833.00] So technically that's going to run in windowed full screen.
[1833.00 → 1838.00] So I do know, and I haven't, I apologize in advance because I haven't, it's not a hundred
[1838.00 → 1844.00] percent clear, um, how many of these limitations will affect how many games and with which video
[1844.00 → 1845.00] are going to be available.
[1845.00 → 1848.00] So if you're not going to be able to do that, what I do know is that NVIDIA supports G-Sync,
[1848.00 → 1851.00] for example, in windowed full screen.
[1851.00 → 1859.00] AMD on the other hand does not appear at this time to have a solution for AMD Free Sync in Windows
[1859.00 → 1860.00] full screen.
[1860.00 → 1867.00] So while news breaking originally that there might be exclusive titles, I believe the upcoming
[1867.00 → 1872.00] Gears of War release is going to be exclusive to the Windows Store.
[1872.00 → 1875.00] And I was like, sure, okay, I get it.
[1875.00 → 1877.00] I mean, hey, look, everyone else is doing it.
[1877.00 → 1882.00] You know whether you're Ubisoft or Valve or EA or whatever, everyone else is doing it.
[1882.00 → 1883.00] So fine, I get it.
[1883.00 → 1885.00] You want to drive the adoption of your platform.
[1885.00 → 1893.00] But if you are going to stunt your platform by killing things like SLI and Crossfire support,
[1893.00 → 1901.00] I mean, killing it even worse than the game developers implementing it poorly, then what's your problem?
[1901.00 → 1906.00] Like I get, I get, I get the economics.
[1906.00 → 1917.00] I get the business strategy of not wanting to give up a cut of the game that you are selling to some third party distribution service like Steam.
[1917.00 → 1919.00] If you just want to pocket that money, fine.
[1919.00 → 1920.00] I understand that.
[1920.00 → 1922.00] You know, everybody's got to make money.
[1922.00 → 1937.00] But if you cripple your game at the same time, then that becomes just, that just becomes, it's just rubbing salt in the wound.
[1937.00 → 1941.00] And I've got some people asking about Tim Sweeney's comments.
[1941.00 → 1947.00] Unfortunately, that situation, we were looking into it before WAN show, is a lot of he said, she said right now.
[1947.00 → 1950.00] Maybe we can talk about it a little bit once the dust settles next week.
[1950.00 → 1957.00] But right now, that whole situation between Epic Games and Microsoft right now is something that I, that I don't really want to, want to touch.
[1957.00 → 1960.00] So, Dennis, let's get your thoughts on this.
[1960.00 → 1962.00] About the Windows thing?
[1962.00 → 1963.00] Yeah, yeah.
[1963.00 → 1967.00] So they don't support full screen in some Sync.
[1967.00 → 1969.00] So they do support full screen.
[1969.00 → 1971.00] It's, but it's like borderless full screen.
[1971.00 → 1973.00] So you don't actually, it's a borderless window.
[1973.00 → 1976.00] So it's technically running in windowed mode.
[1976.00 → 1979.00] Like you can all tab out of it and into other applications.
[1979.00 → 1984.00] Like it doesn't completely take over the experience, but you don't see the surrounding borders.
[1984.00 → 1985.00] Oh.
[1985.00 → 1992.00] But what that means because of some complications in the video card driver is that certain-advanced features that require the video card driver,
[1992.00 → 1997.00] to fully take control of the application are not able to function.
[1997.00 → 2006.00] And these are, these are, these are functions that, so someone might buy one of these, and they will get sort of the full experience in this situation.
[2006.00 → 2008.00] Missing some stuff potentially.
[2008.00 → 2011.00] But some people will go as far as to buy two of these.
[2011.00 → 2018.00] So they'll spend an entire additional like $800 on their gaming system in order to theoretically double their performance in SLI.
[2018.00 → 2019.00] Yeah.
[2019.00 → 2021.00] So Microsoft is taking a big poo on that.
[2021.00 → 2024.00] Oh, so like the Windows have full control of the entire thing.
[2024.00 → 2025.00] Yeah.
[2025.00 → 2026.00] Oh, I don't like that.
[2026.00 → 2034.00] I like, I like everything you can just control, and you don't have to buy something for that brand.
[2034.00 → 2035.00] Like.
[2035.00 → 2041.00] To be clear, Microsoft isn't offering an alternative Microsoft video card.
[2041.00 → 2045.00] They're just completely kneecapping the functionality and not giving you any recourse whatsoever.
[2045.00 → 2046.00] I don't like that.
[2046.00 → 2048.00] So there you go guys.
[2048.00 → 2049.00] You heard it here first.
[2049.00 → 2051.00] Dennis doesn't like that.
[2051.00 → 2053.00] And I don't like it either.
[2053.00 → 2056.00] So Microsoft, if you guys are watching.
[2056.00 → 2057.00] Yeah.
[2057.00 → 2058.00] Thank you, Dennis.
[2058.00 → 2059.00] All right.
[2059.00 → 2063.00] So let's move on to our next topic here.
[2063.00 → 2064.00] Actually.
[2064.00 → 2070.00] Oh, we should, we should probably do a, oh no, this one's, this one's too, this one's too good to pass up.
[2070.00 → 2073.00] I was going to do sponsors for, no, I'll do, I'll do sponsors first.
[2073.00 → 2074.00] I'll do sponsors first.
[2074.00 → 2076.00] We'll jump into that, that other topic after.
[2076.00 → 2079.00] So first sponsor is Lynda.com.
[2079.00 → 2080.00] Dennis, what do you know about Lynda.com?
[2080.00 → 2085.00] You can watch videos and learn, and you can go through all the scripts, and you can go along.
[2085.00 → 2092.00] You can download it to your app on your iOS or Android to iPad.
[2092.00 → 2094.00] You can watch it on the go.
[2094.00 → 2098.00] You can watch on the bus or when you are doing exercise, exercise.
[2098.00 → 2099.00] Right?
[2099.00 → 2102.00] That's actually surprisingly good.
[2102.00 → 2104.00] He's doing it off memory too.
[2104.00 → 2106.00] I'm adding so many things.
[2106.00 → 2107.00] Okay.
[2107.00 → 2114.00] So whether you're looking to supercharge your hobby or you want to, you know, kickstart a new career path, Lynda.com has more than 3,000 courses available.
[2114.00 → 2121.00] In topics like web development, photography, visual design, Excel, WordPress, Photoshop, video editing.
[2121.00 → 2129.00] And what's great about Lynda.com courses is that, well, they're not necessarily going to be like the way to master cinematography.
[2129.00 → 2136.00] What they will do is they will give you the fundamentals to be self-taught in the future.
[2136.00 → 2152.00] So you can learn a lot of tips and tricks that if you have, if you've taken classes or if you've taught yourself a lot of things, they'll, they'll, they'll give you that, that broad foundation that will fill in the gaps that you missed and help you to continue your journey.
[2152.00 → 2168.00] Plan started only $25 a month, and you can get a 10-day free trial, which gives you access to every course on Lynda.com by heading over to Lynda.com slash WAN show, which I pointed down below, which we'll have linked in the video description, which would be true on the, uh, the GOD.
[2168.00 → 2173.00] But in the meantime, I guess I could just post it in the Twitch chat here.
[2173.00 → 2174.00] What are you doing?
[2174.00 → 2175.00] Here.
[2175.00 → 2177.00] Oh, oh yeah, right.
[2177.00 → 2178.00] Oh, good work.
[2178.00 → 2186.00] See, this is why this, for those of you wondering why Dennis is joining me on the show today, right there, right there, guys.
[2186.00 → 2191.00] And also for his gorgeous smooth face, Dollar Shave Club.
[2191.00 → 2192.00] Wait, what?
[2192.00 → 2194.00] Did I click the wait, what?
[2195.00 → 2196.00] Dang it, Nick.
[2197.00 → 2198.00] All right.
[2198.00 → 2200.00] Well, we'll do Squarespace first.
[2200.00 → 2206.00] So Squarespace, the way to build your simple, powerful, beautiful website using, oh, you know what, Dennis?
[2206.00 → 2207.00] I want you to do it.
[2207.00 → 2208.00] You should.
[2208.00 → 2214.00] If you are looking for, if you are looking for a good tool, they have a million templates.
[2214.00 → 2216.00] No, no, they have, they, okay.
[2216.00 → 2217.00] They don't have a million.
[2217.00 → 2218.00] They have a couple.
[2218.00 → 2220.00] They have a lot of templates.
[2220.00 → 2221.00] Yes.
[2221.00 → 2231.00] And you can build your webpage, profile, or for commercial, or for your portfolio, or whatever.
[2231.00 → 2241.00] It's easy to build, make it beautiful, and what's good.
[2241.00 → 2245.00] It looks good, even we use Squarespace for our forum.
[2245.00 → 2247.00] No, no, no, not for our forum.
[2247.00 → 2249.00] No, no, that's the other one.
[2249.00 → 2251.00] No, we use it for LinusMediaGroup.com.
[2251.00 → 2252.00] No, no, no, no.
[2252.00 → 2254.00] Squarespace doesn't have forum functionality.
[2254.00 → 2255.00] Yeah, sorry, that's my phone.
[2255.00 → 2258.00] LinusMediaGroup.com.
[2258.00 → 2260.00] So it's really easy to use.
[2260.00 → 2262.00] Even I can use it.
[2262.00 → 2263.00] Really?
[2263.00 → 2265.00] Have you updated things on the Squarespace site?
[2265.00 → 2267.00] No, you just always hear me say that.
[2267.00 → 2268.00] Yeah.
[2268.00 → 2269.00] Okay.
[2269.00 → 2270.00] I saw your line.
[2270.00 → 2271.00] But yes, yes, you could use it.
[2271.00 → 2272.00] But it looks really easy.
[2272.00 → 2273.00] Yeah.
[2273.00 → 2275.00] All of Squarespace's tools are web-based.
[2275.00 → 2276.00] So all you've got to do is go in.
[2276.00 → 2277.00] It's very visual.
[2277.00 → 2278.00] You don't have to be a programmer.
[2278.00 → 2282.00] Although there are more tweaks you can make if you do have some coding experience.
[2282.00 → 2286.00] And you just go in, you make your edits, you click save, and uppity bop, the whole thing is handled by them.
[2286.00 → 2288.00] The page is hosted by them.
[2288.00 → 2292.00] And if you sign up for a year, they will even throw in a free domain.
[2292.00 → 2296.00] So for a plan starting at only $8 a month, you get all that stuff taken care of.
[2296.00 → 2305.00] So you can focus on just building a beautiful website rather than focusing on like figuring out how to get that freaking image to write a line.
[2305.00 → 2307.00] Just can't do it.
[2307.00 → 2309.00] Which can be very frustrating.
[2309.00 → 2310.00] So there you go, guys.
[2310.00 → 2311.00] Squarespace.
[2311.00 → 2313.00] You should build it.
[2313.00 → 2315.00] Simple, powerful, beautiful.
[2315.00 → 2320.00] I think I'm just going to start stringing together every slogan they've ever done at a certain point.
[2320.00 → 2323.00] Until we have literally all of them.
[2323.00 → 2325.00] It'll be like Pokémon style.
[2325.00 → 2328.00] Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and drop my...
[2328.00 → 2329.00] Seriously?
[2329.00 → 2332.00] Seriously, is that not going to work?
[2332.00 → 2334.00] Is that not going to work for me?
[2334.00 → 2336.00] You've got to be freaking kidding me.
[2337.00 → 2340.00] Alright, I will find this.
[2340.00 → 2343.00] I am freaking out here.
[2343.00 → 2344.00] Come on, come on.
[2344.00 → 2345.00] Nope, not that one.
[2345.00 → 2346.00] Nope, not that one.
[2346.00 → 2347.00] Nope.
[2347.00 → 2348.00] Okay, fine.
[2348.00 → 2349.00] There you go.
[2349.00 → 2351.00] Dollar Shave Club.
[2351.00 → 2353.00] Alright, Dennis, you're up.
[2353.00 → 2355.00] Tell me about Dollar Shave Club.
[2355.00 → 2358.00] So you can order all the...
[2358.00 → 2360.00] Not just your...
[2360.00 → 2361.00] What's that?
[2361.00 → 2365.00] Razor and some bathroom supply.
[2365.00 → 2368.00] Deliver it to your house every month.
[2368.00 → 2370.00] Can I help you?
[2370.00 → 2371.00] I got this.
[2371.00 → 2372.00] They have...
[2372.00 → 2373.00] They have...
[2373.00 → 2374.00] You sure?
[2374.00 → 2375.00] Charlie's...
[2375.00 → 2376.00] What's that?
[2376.00 → 2377.00] Charlie...
[2377.00 → 2378.00] One White Charlie.
[2378.00 → 2379.00] One White Charlie.
[2379.00 → 2380.00] Thanks, Nick.
[2380.00 → 2381.00] They have...
[2381.00 → 2382.00] Shave Moisture...
[2383.00 → 2384.00] And cream...
[2384.00 → 2385.00] What did you just say?
[2385.00 → 2386.00] Shave Moisture thing.
[2386.00 → 2387.00] Ah, yes.
[2387.00 → 2388.00] Shaving cream.
[2388.00 → 2391.00] They have some nonsense razor.
[2391.00 → 2392.00] Yep, yep.
[2392.00 → 2393.00] It's all six blade.
[2393.00 → 2394.00] Yep.
[2394.00 → 2396.00] And easy to use.
[2396.00 → 2397.00] Deliver to your house.
[2397.00 → 2399.00] So easy, Dennis can use it.
[2399.00 → 2400.00] And...
[2400.00 → 2401.00] Yeah, I don't have beer, no.
[2401.00 → 2402.00] Okay, so...
[2402.00 → 2404.00] So Dollar Shave Club.
[2404.00 → 2415.00] Whether you want high quality razors and other bathroom supplies, like their butt wipes, or their aftershave, or their Dr. Carver shave butter, which is not technically a shaving cream, because there's no cream in it.
[2415.00 → 2416.00] They have travel size, too.
[2416.00 → 2417.00] And they have travel sizes.
[2417.00 → 2418.00] Thank you, Dennis.
[2418.00 → 2434.00] If you're in the US, Canada, and Australia for just a few bucks a month without having to go out to the store and spend way too much on replacement blades, you guys can join the club, save money, save time, and head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to start doing it.
[2434.00 → 2435.00] I like the...
[2435.00 → 2437.00] I like people send stuff to my house.
[2437.00 → 2438.00] And...
[2438.00 → 2443.00] Because when you receive the package, like someone sent your gift, but it's actually you send yourself.
[2443.00 → 2445.00] That's another happiness you can buy.
[2445.00 → 2452.00] That is a good point.
[2452.00 → 2453.00] Thank you.
[2453.00 → 2454.00] Thank you.
[2454.00 → 2455.00] Thank you, Dennis.
[2455.00 → 2459.00] Okay, so moving into our next actual topic.
[2459.00 → 2462.00] If you have work to do, you can leave.
[2462.00 → 2465.00] I actually only meant to drag you here for a few minutes.
[2465.00 → 2466.00] Okay, sorry, Dennis.
[2466.00 → 2468.00] I know you're trying to edit as fast as possible right now.
[2468.00 → 2469.00] Thank you for joining me.
[2469.00 → 2470.00] See ya.
[2470.00 → 2471.00] Yeah, thanks, Dennis.
[2471.00 → 2472.00] Stay, stay, stay.
[2472.00 → 2473.00] Stay?
[2473.00 → 2474.00] Oh, they stay.
[2474.00 → 2475.00] Yeah, they'll stay.
[2475.00 → 2476.00] Don't worry.
[2476.00 → 2477.00] It's okay.
[2477.00 → 2478.00] Um...
[2478.00 → 2479.00] So...
[2479.00 → 2485.00] This is posted by NoNerg, whatever that is, on the forum.
[2485.00 → 2487.00] I'm going to go ahead and drop the link here in the Twitch chat.
[2487.00 → 2488.00] Um...
[2488.00 → 2489.00] Boom.
[2489.00 → 2490.00] There you go.
[2490.00 → 2499.00] John McAfee, according to the Ars Technica headline, better prepare to eat a shoe, because he doesn't know how iPhones work.
[2499.00 → 2500.00] Okay.
[2500.00 → 2501.00] Okay.
[2501.00 → 2512.00] So, we're gonna fire up this video, um, at risk of, at risk of me getting like a, like a, uh, an infringement strike here from, um...
[2512.00 → 2513.00] Who is this?
[2513.00 → 2514.00] I don't know.
[2514.00 → 2516.00] Some, some United States.
[2516.00 → 2518.00] Can I just see this on YouTube, please?
[2518.00 → 2519.00] Thank you.
[2519.00 → 2520.00] All right.
[2520.00 → 2521.00] So, um, so some, some news network.
[2521.00 → 2522.00] I don't know.
[2522.00 → 2523.00] I'm not American.
[2523.00 → 2529.00] Um, so basically, to be clear, he did say, and it's the it's the top comment on the video,
[2529.00 → 2534.00] I hope everyone knows that the Apple explanation was vastly dubbed down for the press.
[2534.00 → 2541.00] I know the A7 system chip well, including its secure enclave with separate coprocessor that stores the encrypted fingerprint,
[2541.00 → 2544.00] the ephemeral key generated by the coprocessor that Apple doesn't even know,
[2544.00 → 2548.00] the secure enclave memory isolated from the rest of the processors on the chip, etc.
[2548.00 → 2549.00] It doesn't matter.
[2549.00 → 2552.00] The main ARM processor has its own memory, and that's what I'm interested in.
[2552.00 → 2556.00] Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, etc., etc., etc.
[2556.00 → 2563.00] Um, however, ours put together a very strong, because I was kind of looking at it going,
[2563.00 → 2568.00] like, the way he was explaining this, it was like, it was like a four-year-old could break
[2568.00 → 2569.00] into an iPhone.
[2569.00 → 2574.00] So, like, he says, okay, so this is a summary from John McAfee.
[2574.00 → 2577.00] You only need two people, a hardware and a software engineer.
[2577.00 → 2578.00] Okay.
[2578.00 → 2581.00] Well, that sets the bar somewhat, somewhat high.
[2581.00 → 2583.00] The hardware engineer takes the phone apart.
[2583.00 → 2586.00] That doesn't even sound like a hardware engineering task, to be perfectly honest.
[2586.00 → 2590.00] I mean, I can think of, there's probably a thousand people on YouTube alone who could
[2590.00 → 2592.00] take apart an iPhone with their eyes closed.
[2592.00 → 2602.00] Copies the instruction set, which I, it sounds like he, um, he's sort of loosely using the
[2602.00 → 2611.00] term instruction set to mean, which is actually a way that a processor takes software, takes
[2611.00 → 2615.00] what software tells it and turns that into something that transistors can understand.
[2615.00 → 2619.00] Like, it translates it into, like, like machine code.
[2619.00 → 2621.00] Um, so, so that's, that's an instruction set.
[2621.00 → 2626.00] So, so you, you actually wouldn't, you wouldn't even want the instruction set.
[2626.00 → 2631.00] Um, so I, so I think what he sort of means is, is like the, the, the software, like the actual
[2631.00 → 2633.00] operating system or something.
[2633.00 → 2634.00] I'm not sure.
[2634.00 → 2635.00] Okay.
[2635.00 → 2640.00] Then you run a disassembler, which takes the ones and zeros and gives you readable information.
[2640.00 → 2641.00] Okay.
[2641.00 → 2646.00] Then the coder sits down, reads and finds the first access to the keypad, reads the instructions
[2646.00 → 2648.00] for where in memory the secret code is stored.
[2648.00 → 2651.00] And he says, it'll take half an hour.
[2651.00 → 2658.00] However, ours technics summary, which did my understanding of it is, and I am not a software
[2658.00 → 2659.00] engineer.
[2659.00 → 2660.00] I want that to be very clear.
[2660.00 → 2665.00] I'm neither a software engineer nor a hardware engineer, but from my understanding of the
[2665.00 → 2673.40] way that Apple's encryption works, Apple is being honest and being very upfront about the
[2673.40 → 2682.00] fact that even day cannot break into an iPhone unless they were to push a software update.
[2682.00 → 2689.00] So they were to install a new version of iOS onto the phone that defeated the safeguards
[2689.00 → 2694.00] that they have put into place to prevent even Apple from breaking the encryption.
[2694.00 → 2703.00] So to imagine for a second that Apple is storing plain text versions of the entries of a passcode,
[2703.00 → 2706.00] which by the way, the passcode itself is not what unlocks an iPhone.
[2706.00 → 2711.00] It actually generates a key that unlocks the iPhone.
[2711.00 → 2721.00] So to imagine that Apple is storing this in plain text somewhere is just baffling, baffling
[2721.00 → 2726.00] to me that he would think that it's that simple.
[2726.00 → 2733.00] And I mean, so here, ours explains it better than I possibly could because they're really
[2733.00 → 2736.00] smart over there, and I'm only a little bit smart.
[2736.00 → 2739.00] So the pin is not stored in the flash storage at all because there's no need if the wrong
[2739.00 → 2740.00] pin is entered.
[2740.00 → 2743.00] The encryption key that gets generated by combining the pin with the hardware ID won't work.
[2743.00 → 2747.00] There, that's in a sentence a way better explanation than I could have possibly given you guys.
[2747.00 → 2750.00] It will not unlock any encrypted files.
[2750.00 → 2754.00] So that's how the iPhone can verify if the pin is correct or not.
[2754.00 → 2760.00] It verifies simply on the basis of did it work in the key or not.
[2760.00 → 2764.00] It doesn't actually know what the or did it work in the lock or not.
[2764.00 → 2767.00] It doesn't actually know what the right key is for the lock.
[2767.00 → 2774.00] It's basically like, like the way that it works is as if people just walk up and try any key in a lock
[2774.00 → 2781.00] and the only way the lock even knows what its own, what its own, what its own tumbler setup was,
[2781.00 → 2783.00] was whether the key works or not.
[2783.00 → 2785.00] That's the only way it could have possibly known.
[2785.00 → 2796.00] So to imagine that it is easy to pull that information out of an iPhone is, is asinine as far as my understanding
[2796.00 → 2801.00] and the author's understanding goes, which isn't to say that it's impossible.
[2801.00 → 2811.00] If they were to actually disassemble the chip itself, so they would actually have to inspect the handset's processor.
[2811.00 → 2815.00] So this is back to the article again, which I believe I linked in Twitch chat, but just in case, I will do it again.
[2815.00 → 2816.00] Because it's a perfect read.
[2816.00 → 2818.00] You guys should definitely be checking this out.
[2818.00 → 2828.00] If they inspect the handset's processor using acid and lasers, it is possible that they could get the device's unique hardware ID.
[2828.00 → 2835.00] And then with that ID, they could combine it with each pin, every pin in turn until they hit upon the exact right one.
[2835.00 → 2842.00] One, although the cost and complexity of the technique would be extremely high, and the risk of destroying the device permanently,
[2842.00 → 2847.00] making it completely unrecoverable, would also be very high.
[2847.00 → 2852.00] So I don't know if he's actually planning to eat a shoe.
[2852.00 → 2856.00] I don't know if he actually thinks he could open it in a couple of weeks.
[2856.00 → 2860.00] Because if he could, like, it's pretty easy to do that demo with some other iPhone.
[2860.00 → 2864.00] Just be like, hey, just to prove that I really can, here we go, we did it.
[2864.00 → 2881.00] Or if he's just in his own eccentric way, trying to just undermine the FBI's efforts to get Apple to agree to build in a backdoor.
[2881.00 → 2890.00] If he is, like, I can't, I can't believe that, like, he's kind of a he's kind of an eccentric character,
[2890.00 → 2895.00] but I haven't seen anything about him to make me believe that he's stupid.
[2895.00 → 2904.00] So, um, maybe he's just playing a game that most of us have not picked up on here,
[2904.00 → 2911.00] I'm trying to get the benefit of the doubt, where he's just trying to, to put up barricades for the FBI,
[2911.00 → 2917.00] for the government's requests, to have Apple build in this functionality.
[2917.00 → 2924.00] I'd like to believe that's what's going on here, but I'm, I'm definitely not sure.
[2924.00 → 2928.00] Um, so, there, there you have it.
[2928.00 → 2933.00] Um, yeah.
[2933.00 → 2938.00] So, I'm actually going to take a break from our regularly scheduled WAN show programming,
[2938.00 → 2946.00] to bring you guys my live, yes, my friends, live Voyage of Discovery here, with this GTX 980 Ti.
[2946.00 → 2951.00] I'm actually not out of topics, I actually have a fair number of them remaining, but I really want to do this.
[2951.00 → 2956.00] I'm, I'm actually, like, kinda amped on it, and so, uh, I, I want to bring you guys along for the ride,
[2956.00 → 2960.00] because I have to go home after work today, I'm not going to have a chance to, uh, to stick around and try this.
[2960.00 → 2965.00] Oh, oh, that, that's not what I meant to do. Sorry, I was just trying to, uh, see if I can get the colour right.
[2965.00 → 2970.00] Ah, wow! That's weird. Okay, so my hands are now pink, uh, which they're not.
[2970.00 → 2976.00] But that card looks a lot closer to what it looks like in real life, so I think, uh, I think we've got our, our colour good enough here.
[2976.00 → 2984.00] So what I will be trying to do is, like, an epoxy, okay, the table's not dirty, it's actually, um, it was painted, it is chipped paint.
[2984.00 → 2989.00] The, the table is actually not dirty. See, look, I'll, I'll lick my finger. That tastes fine.
[2989.00 → 3000.00] Um, so what I'm going to be trying to do is use nail polish to be like a poor man's epoxy resin fill technique.
[3000.00 → 3010.00] I don't know how to open these. Um, for colouring a recessed, a recessed logo or emblem or something along those lines.
[3010.00 → 3017.00] So my wife went to the pharmacy and, uh, obtained these, uh, needle syringes for me.
[3017.00 → 3027.00] So I was hoping to use this as an applicator. I'm actually thinking I might try to suck up the nail polish without the needle tip,
[3027.00 → 3032.00] because I don't want to get nail polish all over it. I'm going to have to be very careful about the way that I apply it.
[3032.00 → 3039.00] Um, because a lot of people had critiqued this already, um, even though I haven't even released the video about it.
[3039.00 → 3051.00] I just painted GTX 980 Ti saying that it would really be a lot better if I took the extra step to, uh, to colour the GTX 980 Ti text.
[3051.00 → 3056.00] So, oh, hold on. All right. Now, you'll have to pardon me. I've never done this before.
[3056.00 → 3060.00] I've never put nail polish into, uh, into a syringe.
[3060.00 → 3066.00] Okay. I realize I'm not actually showing you guys what's going on here.
[3066.00 → 3073.00] Uh, okay. That is super-duper not working very well.
[3073.00 → 3076.00] Okay. Okay. That's fine. Not an obstacle.
[3076.00 → 3081.00] Got everyone being all, like, shooting nail polish. That is not what happens on this show.
[3081.00 → 3083.00] Not what happens on this show.
[3086.00 → 3095.00] Oh, wow. That is, uh, that is some slow, slow, slow, slow,
[3095.00 → 3100.00] and, uh, suction that we've got going on here. Hopefully you guys can see.
[3100.00 → 3103.00] I am managing to draw up some nail polish, though.
[3103.00 → 3107.00] So that, that bodes well for our chances of success here.
[3107.00 → 3110.00] If we can at least get the nail polish into the syringe.
[3110.00 → 3113.00] Boy, is that ever slow, though. Holy crap.
[3113.00 → 3116.00] We've got a near vacuum in the thing at this point.
[3116.00 → 3121.00] Okay. Okay. That's fine. That's fine. I can make do with this.
[3121.00 → 3122.00] Okay.
[3122.00 → 3126.00] So there are professional ways to do this, but as you guys know,
[3126.00 → 3131.00] I tend to, uh, shy away from those for reasons that are really not very clear to anyone.
[3131.00 → 3135.00] So let's start on the let's start on the easiest, the easiest thing here.
[3135.00 → 3139.00] Um, let's start with, let's start with the T.
[3139.00 → 3143.00] That seems like the least complex, the least complex of the letters.
[3143.00 → 3145.00] Got everyone asking me why I don't put it in the oven.
[3145.00 → 3148.00] I think you all know the answer to that.
[3148.00 → 3150.00] Okay.
[3150.00 → 3156.00] Oh, wow. Okay. So here I learned something new about, uh, needles today.
[3156.00 → 3161.00] The hole is not actually right in the end.
[3161.00 → 3162.00] Hmm.
[3162.00 → 3163.00] Okay.
[3163.00 → 3169.00] So that, that just put a bead that is not spreading out at all into the T.
[3169.00 → 3171.00] Which is fine. I can work with this.
[3171.00 → 3175.00] We're going to try and, uh, we're going to try and spread it out.
[3175.00 → 3179.00] I sure hope I haven't, like, permanently wrecked this thing.
[3179.00 → 3184.00] Okay.
[3184.00 → 3188.00] Okay.
[3188.00 → 3191.00] Wow. This is stressful.
[3191.00 → 3195.00] I mean, there's a lot of stuff that I do that's like kind of stressful, but...
[3195.00 → 3210.00] I mean, for me, the cost of a component is less of a factor because, you know, for us, the components are just sort of cost of doing business.
[3210.00 → 3214.00] Um, we, we need them. We can't make videos about this stuff unless we have them.
[3214.00 → 3221.00] So ruining a component is, is really, really crappy and I, and I hate doing it.
[3221.00 → 3228.00] But ruining a bunch of time that I've already invested in a video is, is much more harmful.
[3228.00 → 3237.00] Um, so I'm really hoping not to destroy this video card that I have already done, uh, most of the work for.
[3237.00 → 3239.00] Oh, sorry. I realized I moved that away from you.
[3239.00 → 3249.00] So what I'm kind of hoping for is that I can use some kind of, uh, of like a cloth or something.
[3250.00 → 3253.00] Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's coming out really fast.
[3254.00 → 3256.00] Okay. Don't come out so fast, you.
[3256.00 → 3257.00] Okay.
[3257.00 → 3258.00] Okay.
[3258.00 → 3259.00] Okay.
[3259.00 → 3260.00] Okay.
[3260.00 → 3261.00] Okay.
[3261.00 → 3262.00] Okay.
[3262.00 → 3263.00] Wow.
[3263.00 → 3266.00] This is some, this is some touchy, touchy work here.
[3266.00 → 3278.00] So what I'm hoping is I can use some kind of wipe over the top of it to, you know, if it came out the end of the needle, I would be in much better shape right now.
[3278.00 → 3285.00] Um, to get the excess off around the edges and hopefully get a nice clean line.
[3286.00 → 3289.00] That is what I am sincerely hoping.
[3291.00 → 3292.00] Okay.
[3293.00 → 3306.00] So, the G, the T, and the X, or the G, the T, and the X, the T, only the T, is sort of done, but it looks a little overfilled.
[3306.00 → 3307.00] Okay.
[3307.00 → 3317.00] So, I am at a bit of a loss for how to fix that right now because I don't think I even have any nail polish remover.
[3318.00 → 3320.00] Well, there you have it, guys.
[3321.00 → 3324.00] I got sad on WAN Show today.
[3325.00 → 3326.00] Okay.
[3326.00 → 3327.00] You know what?
[3327.00 → 3328.00] Here.
[3328.00 → 3329.00] I actually have an idea.
[3329.00 → 3330.00] I have an idea.
[3330.00 → 3331.00] People are like, can we talk news?
[3331.00 → 3332.00] This is WAN Show.
[3332.00 → 3334.00] There's only a 60% chance we're even going to talk about news on WAN Show.
[3334.00 → 3336.00] You guys knew that coming into this.
[3337.00 → 3339.00] You knew what this was.
[3340.00 → 3342.00] Um, okay.
[3343.00 → 3344.00] You know what?
[3344.00 → 3349.00] No, I want like a okay, what if I use, I need a what do I need?
[3349.00 → 3350.00] I need something.
[3350.00 → 3352.00] I need like a flat edge.
[3352.00 → 3353.00] I need a flat edge.
[3353.00 → 3356.00] Oh, people are suggesting to suck up the excess with the needle.
[3356.00 → 3358.00] There's not that much excess, though.
[3358.00 → 3360.00] I might not have fine enough control.
[3360.00 → 3362.00] Okay, I'm going to try this.
[3362.00 → 3366.00] I'm going to try scraping the extra off.
[3366.00 → 3370.00] Actually, that could work.
[3370.00 → 3371.00] That could work.
[3371.00 → 3375.00] I might need to take another couple runs at this here.
[3375.00 → 3379.00] But as long as I can sufficiently clean off.
[3383.00 → 3384.00] Oh.
[3384.00 → 3385.00] Oh.
[3385.00 → 3386.00] Oh.
[3386.00 → 3387.00] Oh.
[3387.00 → 3388.00] Oh.
[3388.00 → 3389.00] We're in trouble now.
[3389.00 → 3390.00] Uh oh.
[3390.00 → 3391.00] Okay.
[3391.00 → 3392.00] Um.
[3392.00 → 3393.00] Uh oh.
[3393.00 → 3394.00] Now I'm in trouble.
[3394.00 → 3398.00] Time to, uh, time to bring in the cavalry, cavalry here.
[3398.00 → 3399.00] Um.
[3399.00 → 3400.00] Uh.
[3400.00 → 3406.00] I might need our resident nail polish expert.
[3406.00 → 3409.00] Can you just clean it with saliva?
[3409.00 → 3410.00] Oh.
[3410.00 → 3411.00] The answer is no.
[3411.00 → 3415.00] I don't know what, oh, oh, oh, I got a bunch on the top because there's nail polish on my fingers.
[3415.00 → 3417.00] Uh, uh oh.
[3417.00 → 3420.00] Well, I sure hope I didn't completely ruin it.
[3420.00 → 3423.00] We shall find out very, very soon.
[3425.00 → 3426.00] Cavalry's coming.
[3428.00 → 3429.00] Yvonne.
[3429.00 → 3430.00] What?
[3430.00 → 3431.00] Um.
[3431.00 → 3439.00] I may have ruined my painted video card by spreading the nail polish out a bunch and ruining it.
[3439.00 → 3440.00] Um.
[3440.00 → 3441.00] Do you know how to get that off?
[3441.00 → 3442.00] Oh shoot.
[3442.00 → 3443.00] Sorry.
[3443.00 → 3444.00] Can I have to switch it off?
[3444.00 → 3445.00] Yep.
[3445.00 → 3446.00] Yep.
[3446.00 → 3447.00] I'm live.
[3447.00 → 3448.00] So, um.
[3448.00 → 3449.00] And I got some there too.
[3449.00 → 3450.00] What the heck?
[3450.00 → 3451.00] Do you know how to remove that?
[3451.00 → 3452.00] Yeah, you need polish remover.
[3452.00 → 3453.00] Uh.
[3453.00 → 3455.00] I was even going to buy some because I was like, I know you're going to screw this up.
[3455.00 → 3456.00] And then I didn't.
[3456.00 → 3457.00] Because I was like, you're using a syringe.
[3457.00 → 3458.00] It'll be okay.
[3458.00 → 3463.00] In my defence, these syringes are not quite what I was expecting.
[3463.00 → 3466.00] Uh, apparently isopropyl will work.
[3466.00 → 3467.00] Um, I don't think so.
[3467.00 → 3468.00] I don't think so.
[3468.00 → 3469.00] But I will.
[3469.00 → 3470.00] I actually also don't think so.
[3470.00 → 3471.00] You need acetone.
[3471.00 → 3472.00] So that's the same thing.
[3472.00 → 3473.00] Yeah.
[3473.00 → 3475.00] Well, um.
[3475.00 → 3476.00] Yep.
[3476.00 → 3477.00] So, there you go.
[3477.00 → 3480.00] I will do a news topic now.
[3480.00 → 3483.00] Thank you for coming along with me for that wild ride.
[3483.00 → 3486.00] Oh, this is sort of a big deal.
[3486.00 → 3487.00] I mean, it's only sort of tech related.
[3487.00 → 3488.00] But I guarantee you that this will.
[3488.00 → 3489.00] Is that coming off?
[3489.00 → 3490.00] Actually, yeah, because it's not dry yet.
[3490.00 → 3491.00] Oh, really?
[3491.00 → 3492.00] Oh, can I see?
[3492.00 → 3493.00] Oh, why?
[3493.00 → 3494.00] Because I want to see if it could maybe be removed a little bit.
[3494.00 → 3495.00] Yeah.
[3495.00 → 3496.00] Oh, well, yeah.
[3496.00 → 3497.00] You just rub harder, and then it comes off more.
[3497.00 → 3498.00] Oh, really?
[3498.00 → 3499.00] Well, because it's not dry yet.
[3499.00 → 3500.00] Oh, can I, okay.
[3500.00 → 3501.00] Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I have that?
[3501.00 → 3502.00] Whoever said that, I'm sorry.
[3502.00 → 3503.00] You were right.
[3503.00 → 3504.00] Okay.
[3504.00 → 3505.00] Good job with the isopropyl.
[3505.00 → 3506.00] And then it comes off more.
[3506.00 → 3507.00] Oh, really?
[3507.00 → 3508.00] Well, because it's not dry yet.
[3508.00 → 3509.00] Oh, can I, okay.
[3509.00 → 3522.00] I mean, have you ever tried to use alcohol on your fingers?
[3522.00 → 3523.00] Yeah, I have.
[3523.00 → 3524.00] Oh, okay.
[3524.00 → 3527.00] But I think it could be because of the paint finish, too.
[3527.00 → 3528.00] Like maybe that's why it's going off.
[3528.00 → 3531.00] Maybe it makes it easier to remove.
[3531.00 → 3533.00] I think you should let me do that.
[3533.00 → 3534.00] I think you're ruining it.
[3534.00 → 3535.00] I...
[3535.00 → 3537.00] Look, you're taking the paint off.
[3537.00 → 3538.00] What?
[3538.00 → 3539.00] Yeah.
[3539.00 → 3540.00] I don't think so.
[3540.00 → 3543.00] No, I think that's just, um, I think that's just nail polish junk.
[3543.00 → 3548.00] Cause if there's a way to, if there's a way to fill it without...
[3548.00 → 3552.00] Oh, oh yeah, it's, no, it's, okay, that's the problem.
[3552.00 → 3555.00] The alcohol is not taking it off fully.
[3555.00 → 3557.00] It's just kind of spreading it around.
[3557.00 → 3560.00] Well, that's why you should let me do it because I was doing fine.
[3560.00 → 3561.00] Okay, go away.
[3561.00 → 3562.00] Wait.
[3562.00 → 3564.00] We also have that goof off stuff.
[3564.00 → 3565.00] That may work.
[3565.00 → 3566.00] But will that take the paint off?
[3566.00 → 3567.00] I'm not sure.
[3567.00 → 3568.00] We're better off taking the paint off than having that stuck on, though.
[3568.00 → 3569.00] Just throwing that out there.
[3569.00 → 3570.00] All right.
[3570.00 → 3571.00] Thank you.
[3571.00 → 3586.00] Um, I don't know if I posted this in the Twitch chat yet, so I'm going to go ahead and post
[3586.00 → 3587.00] it here.
[3587.00 → 3591.00] But, uh, yeah.
[3591.00 → 3594.00] Dow Chemicals and DuPont are merging.
[3594.00 → 3600.00] This is only peripherally related to tech, um, because, like, for example, Corning, uh,
[3600.00 → 3602.00] falls under, falls under this merger.
[3602.00 → 3605.00] Um, they make a lot, an awful lot of glass that goes on...
[3605.00 → 3606.00] It's taking the paint off?
[3606.00 → 3607.00] It's taking the paint off?
[3607.00 → 3608.00] Yeah.
[3608.00 → 3609.00] That's why it's sticky.
[3609.00 → 3610.00] It's orange.
[3610.00 → 3611.00] Oh, no.
[3611.00 → 3613.00] That means it's all the way through the clear coat.
[3613.00 → 3615.00] I think that's why it's sticky.
[3615.00 → 3618.00] Oh, that's terrible.
[3618.00 → 3619.00] Where's the paint off?
[3619.00 → 3620.00] I mean, at this point.
[3620.00 → 3622.00] Um, I don't know.
[3622.00 → 3627.00] It might be in the cleaning supplies, um, under the sink, in the kitchen.
[3627.00 → 3632.00] Oh, if I have to repaint that, that's, like, actually kind of disaster.
[3632.00 → 3634.00] I don't even know if I have enough primer left.
[3634.00 → 3640.00] I always push the limits.
[3640.00 → 3643.00] Always push the limits.
[3643.00 → 3651.00] So the deal is valued at $130 billion, making it the 18th largest corporate deal ever.
[3651.00 → 3655.00] This company looks to challenge, uh, Monsanto's seed dominance.
[3655.00 → 3660.00] So it'll create three separate entities in India with agriculture products, material science,
[3660.00 → 3663.00] and specialty products as main businesses.
[3663.00 → 3669.00] So DuPont and Dow Chemicals have long been criticized for their track records regarding environmental stewardship.
[3669.00 → 3674.00] Uh, DuPont refused to take responsibility for toxic pollutants spilled into the Ohio River.
[3674.00 → 3686.00] The company has also received scrutiny for its release of perfluorooctanoic acid, which is used to make nonstick products like Teflon.
[3686.00 → 3692.00] And Dow was responsible for producing napalm used by the U.S. military to devastate populations in Vietnam.
[3692.00 → 3699.00] Um, its subsidiary Union Carbide was responsible for the deaths of thousands in Bhopal, India in 1984,
[3699.00 → 3702.00] following a massive leak of a chemical used to make pesticide.
[3702.00 → 3710.00] And Dow continues to refuse to clean the site or fund medical initiatives to address the spill's ongoing aftermath, say critics of the companies.
[3710.00 → 3715.00] Um, so this is bound basically to affect pretty much, uh, everyone.
[3715.00 → 3723.00] Like if you buy, if you go into a grocery store or like a store and buy pretty much anything,
[3723.00 → 3730.00] I can guarantee you that you are buying something that lines the pockets of DuPont or Dow Chemicals.
[3730.00 → 3738.00] Um, so 3M for example is owned by DuPont and will now be owned by this, by this merged company.
[3738.00 → 3749.00] Um, in other news, the, uh, Dow CEO, Andrew Levers gets nearly $53 million in a golden parachute deal after the DuPont merger.
[3749.00 → 3756.00] Um, so that's $53 million in severance compensation, um, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
[3756.00 → 3761.00] So I think between the two of them, it was something to the tune of like $80 or $100 million.
[3761.00 → 3770.00] And, uh, and a golden parachute is effectively an executive, um, an executive, like, you know, assurance package.
[3770.00 → 3778.00] So that if the company were to ever merge or get bought out, for example, uh, they would, and then they were to lose their job as a result,
[3778.00 → 3781.00] they would definitely still be financially secure.
[3781.00 → 3787.00] Secure and, um, yeah, my $53 million, I, I would, I would consider that financially secure.
[3787.00 → 3794.00] Uh, in other news, this was originally posted on the forum by, oh, that last one was posted on the forum by, oh, no one.
[3794.00 → 3797.00] Okay. So this one was originally posted on the forum by Implosive Tech.
[3797.00 → 3802.00] Let's go ahead and link you guys to the original article here.
[3802.00 → 3807.00] Apple patents magnetically detachable wireless earbuds for the iPhone.
[3807.00 → 3815.00] So is it true that the iPhone 7 will have no three and a half millimetre jack?
[3815.00 → 3818.00] Possibly. Possibly.
[3818.00 → 3821.00] And again, possibly not.
[3821.00 → 3823.00] So, uh, yep.
[3823.00 → 3830.00] This would be a hybrid headphone design that is capable of both corded and wireless operation.
[3830.00 → 3836.00] So I, I love, I love the illustrations in like patent applications.
[3836.00 → 3841.00] It's like, it's like they're determined to make people look as weird and creepy as possible.
[3841.00 → 3844.00] Like who, who has eyes like that?
[3844.00 → 3848.00] And it's like, she's, it's like, she's so smug.
[3848.00 → 3851.00] It's like, she's like a it's like she's an Apple user.
[3851.00 → 3854.00] Oh, I guess that's why.
[3854.00 → 3855.00] No, no, I'm just kidding.
[3855.00 → 3857.00] The smug look on her face could be for any reason.
[3857.00 → 3859.00] So actually there's better, there are better drawings right here.
[3859.00 → 3862.00] So it would allow, um, here you go.
[3862.00 → 3864.00] So it would have a magnetically detachable point, right?
[3864.00 → 3865.00] Oops, sorry.
[3865.00 → 3866.00] I had the wrong mouse here.
[3866.00 → 3867.00] Right around here.
[3867.00 → 3870.00] And then you could, well, attach or detach it.
[3870.00 → 3874.00] And then power would come in here and, you know, stuff.
[3874.00 → 3875.00] It's very fascinating.
[3875.00 → 3878.00] Um, good for them, I guess.
[3878.00 → 3879.00] Yeah.
[3879.00 → 3880.00] Relies on two cables.
[3880.00 → 3884.00] One connecting the stereo headphones together to form a listening subsystem in them.
[3884.00 → 3886.00] One tethering that subsystem to the host device.
[3886.00 → 3889.00] And it would be for blah, blah, blah.
[3889.00 → 3895.00] So you could connect the listening device to the host cord for battery recharging and for wired audio signal transmission.
[3895.00 → 3900.00] Uh, direct X 12 explicit multi GPU mode bringing Radeon and G force together.
[3900.00 → 3901.00] I know we talked about that last week.
[3901.00 → 3902.00] Dang it, Colton.
[3902.00 → 3903.00] Hi, can I help you?
[3903.00 → 3904.00] Yeah, you have to.
[3904.00 → 3905.00] Is it completely ruined?
[3905.00 → 3906.00] Can I see?
[3906.00 → 3907.00] Yeah.
[3907.00 → 3909.00] Oh, that sucks.
[3909.00 → 3910.00] Yep.
[3910.00 → 3913.00] So there you go.
[3913.00 → 3918.00] My wonderful paint job that I was super proud of is completely ruined.
[3918.00 → 3923.00] And I will need to completely sand this back down to metal.
[3923.00 → 3929.00] Um, reprise it, repaint it, reclean coat it, and reassemble the card.
[3929.00 → 3938.00] The good news, there is some good news here, is that this piece is, if I recall correctly, the easiest one to remove.
[3938.00 → 3941.00] So I will not need to fully disassemble the card.
[3942.00 → 3946.00] That is a very, very small silver lining.
[3946.00 → 3952.00] Um, but I will not be reattempting my cheapo, um, epoxy resin fill attempt.
[3952.00 → 3953.00] Since it's ruined, can I try?
[3953.00 → 3955.00] Since it's ruined, yes, you can try.
[3955.00 → 3958.00] But I really don't think it's going to be worth the risk of trying it once it's painted again.
[3958.00 → 3961.00] And you can't do it until after I paint it again.
[3961.00 → 3964.00] So, um, it was a good idea in theory.
[3964.00 → 3969.00] I think it could actually still work, but I believe what you would have to do is dilute the nail polish.
[3969.00 → 3972.00] Because the problem I was having was that it wasn't spreading.
[3972.00 → 3976.00] So, it couldn't overcome the surface tension that was making it bead.
[3976.00 → 3978.00] I had to try to spread it out by hand.
[3978.00 → 3981.00] And of course, when you try and spread it out by hand, you might as well paint it by hand.
[3981.00 → 3984.00] Ahhhh.
[3984.00 → 3987.00] In other news, happy goggles!
[3987.00 → 3989.00] Here's how to update the world's most...
[3989.00 → 3990.00] There we go.
[3990.00 → 3994.00] A virtual reality headset made from a Happy Meal box.
[3994.00 → 3998.00] And this is on, uh, this is actually pretty cool.
[3998.00 → 4005.00] So, they show you the whole instructions for how to basically Google Cardboard it up with your Happy Meal box.
[4005.00 → 4009.00] You get to wear that smile on your face too, so you look like a real winner.
[4009.00 → 4010.00] Love it!
[4010.00 → 4011.00] Very cool.
[4014.00 → 4017.00] That's pretty much all that I have to say about that.
[4017.00 → 4020.00] It's pretty, uh, pretty self-explanatory.
[4020.00 → 4025.00] Um, it's a limited edition Happy Meal box that can fold into VR goggles.
[4025.00 → 4030.00] Special boxes are being issued to mark the 30th anniversary of the Happy Meal in Sweden.
[4030.00 → 4035.00] And only select McDonald's restaurants in Sweden will be selling the boxes for now.
[4035.00 → 4039.00] To accompany the goggles, McDonald's is including a special VR game called Slope Stars,
[4039.00 → 4044.00] which will be available to download off the McDonald's Sweden's website starting on March the 4th.
[4044.00 → 4046.00] It's essentially, uh, ski-free.
[4046.00 → 4047.00] No, I'm just kidding.
[4047.00 → 4048.00] It has nothing to do with ski-free.
[4048.00 → 4051.00] Although, if you guys get the reference, then one internet point for you.
[4051.00 → 4057.00] Uh, the company says the game will offer the player a 360-degree ski experience
[4057.00 → 4060.00] and teach them how to stay safe on the slopes.
[4060.00 → 4064.00] Uh, the reaction to the goggles on McDonald's Facebook page was mixed,
[4064.00 → 4065.00] which to me is kind of bizarre.
[4065.00 → 4067.00] Like, what's to not like about it?
[4067.00 → 4075.00] It's, it's, it's, it's at least repurposing a box as opposed to, um, you know, just throwing it away.
[4075.00 → 4076.00] Like, why not?
[4076.00 → 4081.00] Quantum Breaks cutscenes, this was originally posted by Sam Fisher on the forum,
[4081.00 → 4086.00] will require, the live action cutscenes will require an internet connection.
[4086.00 → 4089.00] That is some, you know what?
[4089.00 → 4093.00] I, I think this was actually added after I started the show here.
[4093.00 → 4095.00] So I don't, I have not, I have not reviewed this.
[4095.00 → 4096.00] I did not know that.
[4096.00 → 4098.00] So it was posted a few days ago though.
[4098.00 → 4099.00] Will require an internet connection.
[4099.00 → 4104.00] So, wow, that is, that is really, that is a really weird thing.
[4104.00 → 4110.00] So it's a time warping shooter that employs a blend of video game cutscenes and the live action TV show,
[4110.00 → 4112.00] attempting to tell a story in a new cross media way.
[4112.00 → 4113.00] Okay, very cool.
[4113.00 → 4119.00] So the live action cutscenes will not be on the disc, but will actually be streamed to your PC.
[4119.00 → 4123.00] The developer says that there wouldn't have been enough room to get it all on disc,
[4123.00 → 4126.00] because there's actually 40 different variations of the show.
[4126.00 → 4131.00] Xbox One players will have the option of downloading episodes, but PC players will not.
[4131.00 → 4134.00] The game is set to release April 5th.
[4134.00 → 4135.00] So I kind of get it.
[4135.00 → 4137.00] Okay, there's no room on the disc, so we have to have it streamed.
[4137.00 → 4139.00] But, well, hold on a second.
[4139.00 → 4142.00] If you can stream it to me, then you can give it to me as a download.
[4142.00 → 4146.00] And if you're going to give it to Xbox players, then why aren't you going to give it to PC players?
[4146.00 → 4152.00] That is a lot of nonsense that really doesn't make any sense to me at all.
[4152.00 → 4153.00] I mean, for, to...
[4155.00 → 4156.00] Yeah.
[4156.00 → 4159.00] I, yeah, that's very frustrating.
[4159.00 → 4164.00] Well, I wish that hadn't been added to the doc now, because now, now I'm just upset.
[4164.00 → 4165.00] Um...
[4168.00 → 4169.00] This is cool.
[4169.00 → 4171.00] So this was originally posted on the forum by Cloaked.
[4171.00 → 4174.00] And the original article here is from Ars Technica.
[4174.00 → 4181.00] With the next update on the PlayStation 4, you will be able to stream games to your PC or to your Mac.
[4181.00 → 4182.00] Oops.
[4182.00 → 4185.00] Sorry, it's hard when I'm running this whole thing myself.
[4185.00 → 4188.00] There's, like, a touchpad and there are two mice in front of me.
[4188.00 → 4189.00] Um...
[4189.00 → 4191.00] It's a feature that...
[4192.00 → 4198.00] To my knowledge, I've actually yet to encounter someone who extensively uses Steam in-home streaming.
[4198.00 → 4200.00] Like, I kind of get it on the handheld side.
[4200.00 → 4205.00] Whether it's a PS Vita, or whether it's something like an Nvidia Shield, which didn't take off.
[4205.00 → 4207.00] I mean, they never even refreshed it.
[4207.00 → 4209.00] We never even got a new Shield portable.
[4209.00 → 4210.00] That should tell you...
[4210.00 → 4212.00] That should give you some idea how popular the feature was.
[4212.00 → 4213.00] Um...
[4213.00 → 4218.00] The whole streaming from your gaming system to another device thing really hasn't taken off yet.
[4218.00 → 4219.00] Uh...
[4219.00 → 4222.00] So I don't know how many people are really going to leverage this.
[4222.00 → 4223.00] But...
[4223.00 → 4226.00] It's cool to see more options being offered.
[4226.00 → 4227.00] Um...
[4227.00 → 4230.00] I'm very interested to see how they handle PC inputs.
[4230.00 → 4232.00] So, things like, um...
[4232.00 → 4235.00] Can you actually play the game with a keyboard and mouse?
[4235.00 → 4239.00] Will PlayStation game developers be expected to add that kind of support?
[4239.00 → 4244.00] Or will you basically be expected to just play PlayStation 4 with a PS4 controller...
[4245.00 → 4247.00] On a screen that's connected to your PC?
[4247.00 → 4248.00] Not 100% sure.
[4248.00 → 4249.00] Um...
[4252.00 → 4253.00] Yep.
[4253.00 → 4254.00] Yeah.
[4254.00 → 4255.00] Oh.
[4255.00 → 4256.00] I am so...
[4256.00 → 4257.00] I am so sad.
[4257.00 → 4261.00] I am so sad right now that that graphics card is broken.
[4261.00 → 4262.00] Ahhhh.
[4262.00 → 4263.00] Now I'm just...
[4263.00 → 4264.00] Now I just can't...
[4264.00 → 4266.00] Now I just can't focus.
[4266.00 → 4267.00] Um...
[4267.00 → 4268.00] Alright.
[4268.00 → 4270.00] Far Cry Primal Map.
[4270.00 → 4273.00] This was originally posted by Trick starry on the forum.
[4273.00 → 4277.00] Original article here is from GamerPressure.com.
[4277.00 → 4282.00] And Ubisoft recycled Far Cry 4's map in Far Cry Primal.
[4282.00 → 4284.00] Far Cry Primal, apparently.
[4284.00 → 4285.00] So if you have a look here...
[4285.00 → 4288.00] The similarities are actually...
[4288.00 → 4290.00] Are actually pretty striking.
[4290.00 → 4291.00] Um...
[4291.00 → 4294.00] I guess that's pretty much all there is to say about that.
[4294.00 → 4297.00] So thank you guys very much for tuning into the WAN Show.
[4297.00 → 4301.00] Thank you to our very special guest, Dennis, for joining us today.
[4301.00 → 4303.00] And we will see you again next week.
[4303.00 → 4306.00] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4306.00 → 4309.00] Luke should be back next week, I believe.
[4309.00 → 4312.00] So expect a more normal WAN Show.
[4312.00 → 4314.00] Thanks again for watching, and I'll see you guys next time.
[4314.00 → 4316.00] I'll see you guys next time.
[4316.00 → 4317.00] I'll see you guys next time.
[4317.00 → 4318.00] I'll see you next time.
[4318.00 → 4331.00] Up device castle, bye, bye, bye!
[4335.00 → 4339.78] witnessing
[4339.78 → 4345.62] Sorry guys, no after party. I've got some work to do. I've been really busy lately.
