[0.00 --> 6.08]  yeah you have to post like okay all right so are we live so the real question we should be asking
[6.08 --> 12.08]  ourselves right now um aside from why is linus streaming from the nerd fusion studio
[12.08 --> 18.24]  here in seattle is why is it that with a supposed professional streamer in a supposed
[18.24 --> 24.00]  professional streaming studio i still can't start the show on time well we were do you want me to
[24.00 --> 29.60]  answer that go ahead man hit me i can take the blame hit me with your best shot hit me with your
[29.60 --> 33.52]  best shot i mean it could be because we were filming until 10 minutes after we were supposed to be
[33.52 --> 39.92]  live okay non-live yes that that could have had something to do with it so yeah actually i guess
[39.92 --> 44.96]  i'll answer the other the other burning question on everyone's minds why the hell am i here and the
[44.96 --> 50.88]  answer is we are down here filming a collab with matt sevetus from nerd fusion we are actually
[50.88 --> 58.08]  installing that server that we live streamed the build of like a month ago about a month ago yeah
[58.08 --> 64.48]  was about a month ago so we were going to ship it down here but it kept you know i kept not getting
[64.48 --> 70.88]  around to fixing the problems that he caused when he installed an extra motherboard standoff which i'm
[70.88 --> 78.56]  pretty sure i didn't do that what i think it was already in there and i just sort of okay so for those of
[78.56 --> 88.16]  you who watched the live stream you probably saw me ask not one not two but at least three times are
[88.16 --> 93.68]  you sure are you sure you don't have an extra motherboard standoff and the thing wouldn't post
[93.68 --> 100.96]  when he left the office so i was stuck diagnosing it by myself after hours at my office listen after
[100.96 --> 107.12]  hours at my office i was diagnosing it by myself it added drama it added no drama we weren't filming
[108.16 --> 113.68]  no one got to experience there's drama right now yeah no one got to experience the drama in real time
[113.68 --> 120.56]  and isn't that everything i want this to be the the linus troll now where everybody who visits
[120.56 --> 129.36]  your studio just installs an extra standoff oh so anyway we were lucky okay so some of the uh some of
[129.36 --> 135.28]  the solder points at the back of one of the ram slots are actually like bent over from the motherboard
[135.28 --> 142.40]  being did i send you the picture you did and it's fine it works so it's fine okay so it works now so
[142.40 --> 147.12]  we're down here we installed it we're gonna have a video coming very soon where we tell you guys
[147.12 --> 153.04]  exactly what the crap a bunch of twitch streamers need a like fifteen thousand dollar server in their
[153.04 --> 157.92]  closet for that's about what that thing costs you know i mean those cpus alone are like four four grand
[157.92 --> 162.48]  plus or something like that yeah so uh okay so we're we're gonna get that going we've also got
[162.48 --> 169.60]  a bunch of great topics for you guys today including but not limited to uh the galaxy note 7 which i
[170.16 --> 178.00]  posted a very glowing review of i still use it last night well yours didn't explode how great would it
[178.00 --> 182.56]  be if it happened on camera though well using it's okay just don't try to charge it oh that's what it is
[182.56 --> 189.44]  right right okay no problem so we'll talk a little bit about why the shipments have been suspended and
[189.44 --> 194.96]  a recall notice has been issued for the note 7. uh we are also going to have probably i imagine this
[194.96 --> 200.48]  will be one of our longer discussions a chat about youtube being accused of censoring vloggers
[201.12 --> 210.80]  the eu has demanded that apple pay 13 billion euros plus interest in taxes owed to ireland and a lot of
[210.80 --> 215.92]  you have been asking me for this up until now i have maintained my silence we will be talking about
[215.92 --> 221.84]  the tech syndicate controversy um something that has been very much a developing story that i haven't
[221.84 --> 226.00]  looked at today so my information may actually be out of date but hey let's face it you don't watch
[226.00 --> 232.00]  the wands show for the absolute latest in news because a lot of it is from like the previous saturday
[232.00 --> 236.96]  let's roll the intro that's a shining endorsement i don't even know why anyone watches this show
[236.96 --> 244.56]  you could be watching literally anything else right now but you tuned in tuned in here and we
[244.56 --> 246.72]  appreciate that we do
[256.00 --> 260.16]  you show the time in the intro why would why would a motherboard stand off kill the motherboard
[260.16 --> 264.88]  just because it was ball bent because it was in the wrong spot because there was no hole there
[264.88 --> 271.76]  there was no hole there oh oh wow well that's a mistake i mean it wasn't that big of a deal well
[271.76 --> 276.88]  well it didn't end up being that big of a deal for you as someone who speaks from experience okay i'm
[276.88 --> 282.40]  not going to claim i've never done it you can kill motherboards that way have you done this we were
[282.40 --> 286.96]  lucky we could have also killed a dim because that standoff would have been shorting out those solder
[286.96 --> 293.44]  points under the memory slot and we had that dim installed so luckily that dim works the server works but um
[293.44 --> 298.32]  well there you go all right so i've got pretty much everyone in the twitch chat um accusing us of
[298.32 --> 304.96]  this being an archive stream it is in fact an archive stream so you guys you guys are honest i mean it's
[304.96 --> 310.56]  not even like me addressing the people saying the stream is archived is proof of any sort that this is
[310.56 --> 315.12]  not an archive stream because that happens all the time yeah you're just really smart i could totally
[315.12 --> 320.24]  fake that at any given moment and there would be a message in twitch chat saying that it's archived so
[320.24 --> 324.32]  well you guys are on to us i think this is the first thing that's actually been pre-recorded in
[324.32 --> 330.80]  this room ever yep so we're setting all kinds of twitch terms of service violating milestones today
[330.80 --> 337.28]  maybe we should start whipping out the nipples i mean so if you whip out a nipple on my twitch channel
[337.28 --> 342.32]  who's in trouble you are i am yeah yeah so i'm responsible for your actions you are that's
[342.32 --> 347.92]  unfortunate completely it's very unfortunate for you uh the other big thing people are demanding to know is
[347.92 --> 352.32]  where the crap is luke he's actually on the pax show floor covering all kinds of cool stuff
[352.32 --> 359.76]  including but not limited to i heard a rumor that somewhere on the show floor there is a working kaby
[359.76 --> 366.32]  lake sample so uh for those of you who don't know which is probably just you actually sorry taryn yeah
[366.32 --> 371.44]  uh for so for those of you who don't know that is intel's upcoming cpu architecture the successor to
[371.44 --> 377.84]  skylight only a bit like behind the scenes people can see it well like it depends how obnoxious you
[377.84 --> 383.76]  are when you walk into the booth so if you're the kind of person who takes a behind closed doors
[383.76 --> 389.52]  demo kicks the door down grabs the product and points a camera at it then you might have footage
[389.52 --> 394.72]  of it before anyone else does is that what you did that is the kind of publication we are yes my friend
[395.52 --> 404.96]  so uh consider it not a rumor um there will be there will be a video so kaby lake is coming um so so
[404.96 --> 410.48]  anyway luke's on the floor there's all kinds of great stuff logitech has their new 69 dollars across
[410.48 --> 415.36]  the board set of gaming peripherals that they're showing off um i think we should do a 69 dollar
[415.36 --> 422.96]  is that real they're really doing 69 yeah the mouse is 69 yeah you can spill they spilled a whole
[422.96 --> 427.76]  they spilled a whole beer on it during the party really yeah oh i wasn't there yeah it's like it's like a
[427.76 --> 435.52]  a beer proof keyboard for 69 really yeah that's very cool you know what's really funny is the only
[435.52 --> 441.92]  time i've ever really seen that in the past is on lenovo thinkpads so ibm used to have uh used to have
[441.92 --> 446.72]  spill proof keyboards they actually had drainage built into the keyboard so that if you spilled an
[446.72 --> 451.76]  entire like cup of coffee on it it would actually drain out the bottom of the laptop and bypass all
[451.76 --> 456.16]  these sensitive internals oh wow probably still sticky there yeah yeah probably still stick i mean
[456.16 --> 461.68]  coffee is not ideal but especially if it was water you'd be okay but i mean by sort of my logic for
[461.68 --> 465.60]  something like that is that well hey if you can spill coffee down it you can probably spill isopropyl
[465.60 --> 471.60]  down it and then you can leave the stickiness that way right you know now you're thinking with portals
[471.60 --> 477.20]  this is with a kleenex wait sorry what are we talking about what um okay so why don't we jump into our
[477.20 --> 484.08]  first topic here i think this one is going to be this one is going to be a linus and and matt top
[484.08 --> 489.28]  matt or severus do you care more people call me matt nowadays actually than severus which is surprising
[489.28 --> 494.88]  you know what's funny is we used to do something similar at lmg so i've always gone by yeah i've
[494.88 --> 500.16]  always gone by linus because not because i thought it was a good idea but because i didn't have the
[500.16 --> 505.12]  foresight to use a fake name i actually have a lot of people accuse me of linus being a fake name and i
[505.12 --> 510.64]  kind of go that would have been smart it's a really good fake name yeah yeah it is maybe it
[510.64 --> 515.28]  really like i've seen i've seen the ultimate troll right here yeah right here i've seen really angry
[515.28 --> 522.80]  posts under our videos about how i'm trading on the fame of of linus torvalds by who is that
[523.52 --> 530.72]  really really linus well he's swedish so that's how they pronounce it all right listen i only know americans
[530.72 --> 538.56]  if they if it ain't from america then it can just get out get out of here that would be both of us
[538.56 --> 547.44]  yeah uh so all right peace bye i can do this you're from america so that's true i'm actually american yeah
[547.60 --> 553.68]  um so so yeah i've had people angrily say i'm just like trading on the fame of linus torvalds in order to
[553.68 --> 557.28]  get my name out there more like no no actually i wasn't smart enough to do anything like that
[557.28 --> 563.52]  um but when we added people so my original camera guy at ncix who also did all the editing
[563.52 --> 569.76]  um who still works there and whose name is still a secret he is just the cameraman the mac guy to my
[569.76 --> 576.24]  pc-ness i don't even know troll me from behind the camera um he just didn't want his name or his
[576.24 --> 582.00]  personality out there so we called him the cameraman and we had all this great banter between me and the
[582.00 --> 587.04]  cameraman who was like like this like sting you know like no one knew who yeah yeah uh every once
[587.04 --> 592.24]  in a while you might see kind of like a reflection in a camera so so we had like a whole wilson yeah
[592.80 --> 597.44]  thing going on and that was where the nickname thing came from does nobody know who it is really no one
[597.44 --> 602.16]  knows who it is i mean i do now this is a challenge i don't know you will have no way of guessing you
[602.16 --> 607.04]  would have no it's not someone who currently works for you no no they still work at ncix okay yeah and
[607.04 --> 612.24]  they're behind the scenes you would have no way of going okay so anyway when luke joined i kind of
[612.24 --> 617.76]  went okay well i want to keep up this like the off-camera people have these nicknames and personas
[617.76 --> 622.88]  thing because it had worked really well like the banter was great um so we were like okay your nickname
[622.88 --> 632.48]  is slick because your pc is oil cooled oh yeah he was slick wasn't he yeah that's right um and then ed
[632.48 --> 638.40]  was diesel because i could never remember his name at the beginning and like he looks nothing
[638.40 --> 644.96]  like vin diesel and he looks nothing like vin diesel um and then brandon was b-roll for fairly
[644.96 --> 650.08]  obvious reasons yeah that's a good one and so we had all of them i never got one and you never got
[650.08 --> 655.12]  one because it was around that time i think that those guys were just like this is stupid we should
[655.12 --> 659.36]  just use our real names and i think the audience likes it better too so we just we just got away
[659.36 --> 663.68]  from it and now everyone just uses their real names so that was i don't remember where i was
[663.68 --> 667.36]  going with this story right so you're more matt now so maybe that's the new thing maybe people don't
[667.36 --> 673.44]  like nicknames anymore i don't know if that's true i think it's because i do more businessy stuff nowadays
[673.44 --> 680.08]  i kind of go by matt so you're a boring old man now basically oh sorry to hear that boring yeah yeah
[680.88 --> 684.80]  not very exciting here all right well let's talk about your exciting phone so the original article here
[684.80 --> 693.36]  posted by patrick 3027 on the forum here is there we go you can ask me a question like fight like to
[693.36 --> 698.96]  try to be first because you always say like somebody oh this person posted first on the forum
[698.96 --> 704.24]  right is there like right when news like this hits like 10 articles that they're praying that you're
[704.24 --> 709.04]  going to shout them out on the win show i don't think it's that intense i think that i think it's i
[709.04 --> 713.68]  think it's six of one half it doesn't need the other so i think some people do like the opportunity to
[713.68 --> 717.52]  have the shout out on the land show but we're not consistent enough about remembering to call it out
[718.72 --> 725.60]  for i think people to be really that that into that but people do like especially the major
[725.60 --> 731.60]  contributors within the tech news and reviews from around the web forum section i think people do like
[731.60 --> 736.40]  to be like a major contributor and they do like people commenting on their posts and that discussion
[736.40 --> 742.80]  happening so yeah when something major breaks i get like 95 of my tech news from my own forum
[742.80 --> 748.48]  all i have to do is go online this tech forum and if people are talking about it it's important
[748.48 --> 753.36]  and if it's not on there it's probably not important that's that's actually been my rule of
[753.36 --> 758.08]  the thumb for like the last two years i like it yeah it's great outsource it to the audience so
[758.72 --> 765.36]  there you have it galaxy note 7 shipments suspended over reports of exploding units now i'm glad i didn't
[765.36 --> 772.64]  bring mine i actually um i okay so this is this is funny now normally when i do a review if i have a
[772.80 --> 780.56]  review unit die i actually don't bring it up i will let it slide once especially if the review unit dies
[780.56 --> 788.16]  in a way that is different from you sort of any other reports that i'm seeing um or if it is or if
[788.16 --> 793.60]  it's something that really looks like a fluke so mine died but it didn't explode if it the battery had
[793.60 --> 800.16]  exploded your i would have died my first note seven died whoa so what what happened was my nan flash went
[800.16 --> 806.40]  um and that like i i and so i normally like my general policy is i don't mention a failure unless
[806.40 --> 811.68]  it's a failure that i can that i can identify as something that should have been preventable
[811.68 --> 818.16]  um with better design and something like nan flash nan flash can die that can happen that's not a knock
[818.16 --> 824.24]  against an intel ssd any more than it is a knock against a samsung phone stuff can happen even if your rma
[824.24 --> 832.48]  rate is 0.1 that still means that one out of every thousand units dies yeah and and and to be to like
[832.48 --> 837.60]  to be completely transparent with you guys like from being on the other side of the it industry the
[837.60 --> 846.16]  sales side of it rma rates from the you know one to three percent range are considered very good um with
[846.16 --> 851.68]  anything above five percent considered to be getting pretty bad so that should give you some idea of what
[851.68 --> 856.08]  your odds are i mean that's one of the reasons that companies charge to put together a computer
[856.08 --> 861.20]  for you because by the time you put eight components into a system if you've got about a three to five
[861.20 --> 865.44]  percent failure rate on any given one of them the odds of having a 10 one is actually not that bad
[866.96 --> 871.20]  just something to something to consider that's a reason that a lot of people i know who know how to
[871.20 --> 876.32]  build a computer actually do pay for someone else to assemble it for them where there's a warehouse of
[876.32 --> 884.32]  replacement parts in the back if something does go wrong so anyway so mine actually did die um which
[884.32 --> 889.12]  i don't remember what the point of me bringing up i've showered with mine but and there's been no
[889.12 --> 894.40]  problems you you okay right so that's the reason i don't have mine with me so i'm actually because
[894.40 --> 899.36]  i'm planning to use it as a daily driver so i'm rocking the regular s7 okay and then that's got my
[899.36 --> 905.12]  canadian sim and i've got my us sim and my iphone 6s yeah i i didn't know who was calling me earlier
[905.12 --> 910.48]  yeah do i answer this yeah sorry about that yes yes that was me it was not a phone number leak
[910.48 --> 915.04]  um you know not that i speak from experience about that i actually have a new phone number now that
[915.04 --> 922.80]  is not anywhere so go linus all right um so so anyway yeah so it would be great if this thing it
[922.80 --> 927.60]  can't you said it has to be charging for it to and by the way this word explode have you seen the
[927.60 --> 933.68]  pictures of it like when i think of the word explode i think of let's go yeah yeah it's more like
[933.68 --> 940.48]  like expanded and like smoke coming out well not in the picture i saw it was just like
[941.36 --> 945.60]  fatter it was like a little bit of lava leaked out yeah like that's a battery thing right yeah yeah
[945.60 --> 952.80]  yeah like lithium batteries will will do they'll do that let me see i guess it's an explosion i want
[952.80 --> 958.16]  like a boom i want to see if i can find a picture so we can show you guys uh so you can we can show you
[958.16 --> 965.44]  guys here blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah yeah i can't find it right now yeah anyway so not
[965.44 --> 971.36]  really the point but they have suspended shipments of the phone to various south korean telecoms
[971.92 --> 980.00]  and due to reports of exploding galaxy note 7s which is a real shame because i think it puts customers
[980.00 --> 984.88]  who are very happy with their purchase of the phone like i'm incredibly happy um in a pretty awkward
[984.88 --> 991.44]  position because what like what can you do as a recall now so what i'm doing is i think in most of
[991.44 --> 998.48]  the american carriers you have until the end of the month to go give it to them in which they will swap
[998.48 --> 1005.60]  it out for something of similar quality right there's a way that they put it yeah and then whenever they
[1005.60 --> 1013.76]  get shipments back in whenever samsung actually starts sending things then i'll be able to go pick up you
[1013.76 --> 1020.40]  know pick it up again when i don't know if i'm gonna do it but i mean what my goal is to wait
[1020.40 --> 1026.08]  it out and hope that within the next 30 days shipments come in so i can just go and swap rather
[1026.08 --> 1032.88]  than having to go to some lesser peon of a phone this is such a crappy position for samsung to be in
[1032.88 --> 1036.88]  right now because there's a couple things that were really going great for them on the note 7.
[1036.88 --> 1042.24]  apparently the blue color which is actually what you ended up with the blue color has just been
[1042.24 --> 1048.00]  phenomenally popular um so samsung canada was saying that by far it was the most pre-ordered color
[1048.40 --> 1054.08]  um even though sexy even though this is the first time they've done a pure black phone in quite some
[1054.08 --> 1059.92]  time and i think they were expecting that to be a pretty big draw no no that like that like metallic
[1059.92 --> 1066.40]  baby blue has just been super hot for them um the note 7 is a great phone and they're absolutely
[1066.40 --> 1074.64]  killing the momentum on it and number three is apple is waiting on the doorstep with the iphone
[1074.64 --> 1081.76]  set and iphone 7 plus yeah it's coming in like a couple weeks while samsung is going to be putting
[1081.76 --> 1090.32]  out fires literally processing oh my god do you think so so what it is is it's it's not samsung's fault
[1090.32 --> 1095.84]  right so what there's well what i read at least is that it's the not the battery cell manufacturer
[1095.84 --> 1102.48]  which is a subsidiary of samsung yeah but it is the people that take those cells and then turn it
[1102.48 --> 1111.68]  into the packs which is a third party that's who who messed up it's a third party so could there be
[1111.68 --> 1120.40]  so here's here's the thing oh come on we'll pan them off to cause issues do you guys have a tinfoil
[1120.40 --> 1124.32]  hat prop we do we actually do but i don't know where it is can we get some tinfoil that's very
[1124.32 --> 1130.24]  tinfoil but you never know you never know all right okay i doubt it okay so so then here's the question
[1130.24 --> 1137.36]  for you then as an owner knowing that because it doesn't even look like all of the all of the
[1137.36 --> 1141.20]  batteries were manufactured by the particular factory that they're claiming that's true so
[1142.24 --> 1150.00]  samsung is estimating that 24 units on a scale of 1 million were affected by the battery problems
[1151.20 --> 1156.96]  are you going to chance it are you just going to keep it i will keep it i will absolutely keep it
[1157.60 --> 1164.72]  if i can't just swap out if there becomes a time this month where i can swap out yeah i'll do that but
[1164.72 --> 1170.08]  if there's nothing in stock where i can't swap out i'm keeping it screw it all right so i mean one
[1170.08 --> 1175.92]  thing okay i don't fast charge often okay i occasionally do like when i'm at a con or something
[1175.92 --> 1182.72]  i need just let's go yeah okay normally i'm just dribbling it up okay so that actually ties in pretty
[1182.72 --> 1188.16]  well so a lot of people basically half the comments on my note 7 review that went up last night are um
[1188.80 --> 1193.76]  yo linus great timing for this review endorsing this phone because yo the batteries are all exploding
[1193.76 --> 1199.04]  hot way to go that was really funny you gotta admit that was hilarious well i appreciate a good
[1199.04 --> 1203.68]  ironic twist as much as anyone else and it was definitely it was there was definitely some irony
[1203.68 --> 1210.48]  there but to be clear my video was actually uploaded to vessel a week prior so i had no way of knowing
[1210.48 --> 1217.68]  about this and number two i do still think it's a very solid phone when you can get one that is not
[1217.68 --> 1224.72]  affected by the recall and number three in my video though unrelated to this particular phone
[1224.72 --> 1231.60]  and its battery issues i do say i don't recommend fast charging i don't recommend it it's a bad idea
[1231.60 --> 1237.52]  and there's a couple of very basic reasons for that that apply to all phones it's great in a pinch if
[1237.52 --> 1245.04]  you're at a con and you have 15 minutes to get like 30 battery that is a very cool piece of technology but
[1245.04 --> 1252.24]  charging your battery at these higher voltages does cause it to heat up more heat is bad for a your
[1252.24 --> 1260.00]  device but to a much greater extent your battery and so if there is any way that you can avoid fast
[1260.00 --> 1266.56]  charging on your phone even trickle charging it at 500 milliamps overnight is better because it causes
[1266.56 --> 1273.68]  it to not run as hot and it is better for the cells so for me personally i have never fast charged my
[1273.68 --> 1278.72]  note 7.7 either of them actually and it's something that i wouldn't really plan to do i mean i don't
[1278.72 --> 1283.76]  have trouble going through a whole day with this phone yeah so if you charge it at night and you
[1283.76 --> 1288.88]  aren't doing anything crazy like playing pokemon go for six hours at a time i i don't really see it as
[1288.88 --> 1293.92]  an issue um with that said i'm not you're not going to hear like an official minus media group
[1293.92 --> 1298.56]  recommendation that you not recall your phone and then go and blame me when it lights on fire in
[1298.56 --> 1302.48]  your pocket i don't want to open up that kind of worms recall your phone recall your phone you heard
[1302.48 --> 1309.04]  it here first well later after we'll see keep it away from flammable surfaces like you should do that
[1309.04 --> 1315.60]  anyway right oh keep it away from flat oh i got it i got it yeah keep it away from open flames that's
[1315.60 --> 1321.84]  all i read that yes keep it off the surface of the sun yeah yeah it's gotcha actually very hard to
[1321.84 --> 1328.48]  put something on the sun but yeah no i i have had every note that has ever existed and really yeah
[1328.48 --> 1335.68]  all the whole line and um this is by far the best definitely like bar none it also feels the best it's
[1335.68 --> 1342.48]  like the curves there's just so much good about it that it's definitely this is my example of how
[1343.44 --> 1348.88]  you don't always have to continuously do massive leaps forward right it's refined that's what this is
[1348.88 --> 1353.20]  right yeah you're taking a product and just constantly refining it to the point of almost
[1353.20 --> 1358.48]  perfection dusting except that it lights on fire except the fact that it might catch on fire yes
[1359.04 --> 1363.12]  i mean as long as you don't charge it ever yeah you'll be yeah i think that's that's the key okay
[1363.12 --> 1368.88]  yeah so as long as so it's single use omni how do you even do that i mean if i also wirelessly charge
[1368.88 --> 1376.00]  everything so is this so is this only through the port do you know um so i avoid wireless charging for
[1376.00 --> 1381.76]  the same reason yeah more heat yeah uh worse for the battery and and that's another thing to consider
[1381.76 --> 1388.16]  if your battery is on the edge more heat could push it over the edge in a way that not more heat could
[1388.16 --> 1394.56]  not yeah yeah brandon would always wirelessly charge his phone and uh his battery was just complete crap
[1394.56 --> 1399.28]  by the end that was on his nexus 5 right yeah i think yeah he he basically had it like sitting on a
[1399.28 --> 1404.40]  wireless charger just all day all the time yeah oh that's yeah they topped up yeah you should probably
[1404.40 --> 1411.28]  just plug that thing in to charge it i mean i have to buy usb c cable i know i come on oh my phone
[1411.28 --> 1417.84]  might explode oh poor matt with his big nerd fusion studio and he can't afford a cable he has all these
[1417.84 --> 1425.92]  wonderful lego dump trucks that thing is cool okay thank you taryn that's the first thing he saw when
[1425.92 --> 1431.52]  you came in this room yeah i know it was we have to keep we have to like keep him physically away from
[1431.52 --> 1437.28]  the lego at work if we want him to stay focused on his editing i do it's fine i'm waiting for him to
[1437.28 --> 1443.68]  correct i know it's the trigger moment i think i said it so fast really you don't yeah yeah okay
[1443.68 --> 1449.60]  you're not supposed to pluralize it well there's another one where people say lego as in the company
[1449.60 --> 1455.68]  but it's actually the lego group so there's two gotchas yeah lego is not the company that's the most
[1455.68 --> 1462.88]  boring fact we've ever had on the lan show thanks oh beyond yeah i hope we didn't need that the most
[1462.88 --> 1466.80]  boring fact i'm just trying to think of things that we've discussed like i we've discussed like
[1466.80 --> 1472.32]  arguments i've had with my wife on the land show and you took more interesting you took the boring
[1472.32 --> 1478.08]  cake right there well you got you know i gotta top something over here i gotta you know all right so
[1478.08 --> 1485.12]  next article this was originally posted on the forum by card death card with an e pretentious card
[1486.00 --> 1495.04]  and this is a european commission go in card card at the end okay sorry go ahead uh european commission
[1495.04 --> 1505.52]  press release uh database site here we go ireland gave illegal tax benefits to apple worth up to 13
[1505.52 --> 1514.32]  billion euros and the european commission has concluded that because ireland granted these undue
[1514.32 --> 1521.20]  tax benefits to apple which is illegal under eu state aid rules because it allowed apple to pay
[1521.20 --> 1528.40]  substantially less tax than other businesses ireland ireland must now recover that illegal aid
[1528.96 --> 1535.36]  and there's there are a bunch of different angles that you can go at this from i mean we've got we've got
[1535.36 --> 1543.04]  sort of we've got the us jumping in and saying yo you know apple's an american corporation uh why why
[1543.04 --> 1549.36]  why is ireland all of a sudden going to be taking this 13 billion euros you know you guys you guys can't
[1549.36 --> 1553.20]  be getting involved in you guys can't be getting involved in this and if you're getting involved
[1553.92 --> 1559.68]  why aren't we getting involved like i mean whenever 13 billion euros is changing hands you know someone's
[1559.68 --> 1563.76]  going to be upset about who's paying it and someone's going to be upset about who's getting it
[1563.76 --> 1567.92]  um so there's there's a lot of debate there but you know what so hold on let me just see if there's
[1567.92 --> 1572.48]  anything else sort of fact wise then i'll launch into sort of what i think of this so uh blah blah
[1572.48 --> 1576.72]  blah illegal state aid there's been a suggestion that the bill could be as much as 19 billion after
[1576.72 --> 1581.76]  interest is added which is pretty pretty fun by the way i mean honestly i think it's i think it's
[1581.76 --> 1586.48]  bullshit to be charging apple interest on something that you told them they didn't have to pay yeah um
[1586.48 --> 1592.96]  um not not that i'm saying that i think you know uh state-sponsored tax evasion is necessarily a good
[1592.96 --> 1599.60]  thing i'm just saying like is that a lot of money 19 billion euros like you must you are so american dude
[1599.60 --> 1604.96]  no my question is like there's the man who can't afford they made they made they clearly had to have
[1604.96 --> 1611.52]  made leaps and bounds above that yes because they that's just the tax because ireland's corporate tax rate
[1611.52 --> 1618.72]  is already only 12 and a half percent okay so yeah they made way more yes yeah now hang on how
[1618.72 --> 1622.72]  why would they give these tax breaks in the first place okay so that's a whole other discussion we'll
[1622.72 --> 1627.84]  get to that after um so michael noonan the irish finance minister favors an immediate appeal over
[1627.84 --> 1633.28]  the tax bill insisted that ireland had to preserve its status as a low tax base for overseas companies
[1633.84 --> 1639.84]  um so we'll sort of get into that as well and that the country so the country made deals with apple
[1639.84 --> 1646.56]  allowing them to pay tax on profits at a maximum of one percent oh so even compared to their 12 and a
[1646.56 --> 1651.68]  half percent now to put this in the appropriate context okay oh i thought this was like a different
[1651.68 --> 1663.28]  kind of tax in british columbia canada uh linus media group pays about 25 corporate tax on its profits
[1663.28 --> 1669.20]  just to give you guys some idea is that federal or is that that's all together actually you know
[1669.20 --> 1672.72]  what i i'm gonna go to a lifeline on this one because i don't want to give you guys the wrong
[1672.72 --> 1681.84]  facts it may actually be more both federal and um um we live in a state where nerd fusion does not pay
[1681.84 --> 1687.60]  any state income tax because we don't have it really yeah oh that's right i knew that that's the whole
[1687.60 --> 1692.48]  reason that vancouver washington exists right so you can shop in oregon with no sales tax
[1693.04 --> 1697.04]  and live in washington with no income tax you just don't pay tax down there
[1698.32 --> 1702.56]  wow that's great where do you guys even get roads from well because we charge for the road
[1703.92 --> 1709.92]  the road i'm driving around the roads our roads have like some lanes that are toll lanes if you want
[1709.92 --> 1716.24]  to you can pay extra money to go faster basically there's there's uh net neutrality does not exist on our
[1716.24 --> 1722.88]  roads basically um so okay we've got a couple past lands pay to win we've got a couple more
[1722.88 --> 1727.36]  statements so the credit ratings agency standard and poor's pointed out that an injection of 13
[1727.36 --> 1733.04]  billion euros would reduce ireland's national debt significantly i mean there okay there is it a lot
[1733.04 --> 1741.12]  of money yes um that would be more than five percent of ireland's gross domestic product domestic
[1741.12 --> 1747.84]  product five percent of ireland's gdp um and warned that it could undermine the government at the same
[1747.84 --> 1754.80]  time now apple ceo tim cook has just graciously accepted the ruling has pulled out the check just
[1754.80 --> 1762.32]  kidding um has you fooled me launched and claimed so this is a quote the european commission has
[1762.32 --> 1767.60]  launched an effort to rewrite apple's history in europe what which is one way of putting it i suppose
[1767.60 --> 1775.20]  what ignore ireland's tax laws and rhetoric and upend the international tax system are you kidding
[1775.20 --> 1782.64]  me that is what the eu commission is doing how can we stand for any of these things the international
[1782.64 --> 1788.88]  tax system there is no international tax system also that's not part of the thing that brexit in
[1788.88 --> 1796.56]  brexit yeah ireland yeah is that part of that yeah so do you control it wait i don't know what
[1796.56 --> 1801.52]  how it's like well i can't remember hold on scotland is ireland yeah ireland's in the uk right like
[1801.52 --> 1805.76]  what is the uk it's not crap i don't know now we're all the ignorant americans why did you even bring it
[1805.76 --> 1811.44]  up oh good heavens now we look so dumb and we should know more okay i said yes initially so let's find
[1811.44 --> 1818.48]  out if i'm right why it's more in the comprises four countries england scotland wales and northern ireland
[1818.48 --> 1824.96]  so this is southern so this is ireland ireland okay cool so now that there's good now we know that
[1826.00 --> 1832.56]  it feels so we learned a thing sorry all americans and canadians for that matter know about that
[1832.56 --> 1839.84]  entire like the whole region group of islands is from braveheart yes and it fits inside of texas fun
[1839.84 --> 1847.52]  fact so fun fact the kilt which was depicted in braveheart as uh being you know a thing that scottish
[1847.52 --> 1853.44]  people wear uh didn't actually become commonplace or even invented for that matter until about 150
[1853.44 --> 1858.08]  years later after the events of the movie later after 150 years after the events of the movie
[1858.80 --> 1862.40]  so a more interesting fact than the lego group yes
[1863.36 --> 1869.28]  eric you're still on the bottom i i just don't care anymore so let's talk about this okay this is great
[1869.28 --> 1877.04]  so as a corporation that pays literally uh hold on let me let me see if my wife who is our actual
[1877.04 --> 1882.48]  accountant and actually knows these things okay so whatever i i know it's deep into double digits
[1882.48 --> 1887.60]  so as a corporation that pays deep into double digits taxes yeah we're about the same before
[1887.60 --> 1893.60]  you do federally yeah oh federally oh so it's just no state tax right we don't have any state tax we
[1893.60 --> 1898.72]  have there is federal tax on profit yeah okay never mind okay okay i thought i was i thought we were
[1898.72 --> 1901.92]  going to be able to have kind of two sides of a debate here i mean it's definitely less than yours okay
[1901.92 --> 1907.44]  um i really hope that i really hope that i hear back from her that seems like a lot i might even
[1907.44 --> 1912.56]  just call her because my understanding is so the first little bit like if you're a really small
[1912.56 --> 1918.16]  company you don't actually get hit that hard but after a certain point it starts being actually quite
[1918.16 --> 1923.12]  a lot yeah we have that too which is why we have so i think it's like fun accounting that happens the
[1923.12 --> 1929.04]  first like uh for us i think it's the first 500 000 or something like that gets taxed at a lower rate
[1929.04 --> 1934.00]  wow that's hey um what does our corporate tax rate work out to in percentage
[1936.48 --> 1946.16]  can you give me a ballpark ours max is out at 33 but oh can can you just ballpark it this is uh
[1946.64 --> 1952.24]  enthralling three nerds on there okay thank you okay so it's somewhere between 20 and 40 for us
[1952.24 --> 1958.56]  and i think it goes up to nearly yeah i think we're less yeah so does it bother you
[1958.56 --> 1964.16]  that multinationals with the capability if they were paying taxes of significantly reducing an
[1964.16 --> 1969.52]  entire country's national debt yeah are paying one percent one percent is ridiculous how did they how
[1969.52 --> 1974.80]  did ireland rationalize it at the beginning like why wouldn't they want the money so i think they want
[1974.80 --> 1981.12]  the jobs okay so they want the jobs for the citizens and that's i mean that's the kind of our percent of
[1981.12 --> 1987.84]  their employment going to apple like if that's how much it is i mean apple employees and and that i
[1987.84 --> 1993.12]  actually okay so that that's another thing to consider is not all of the corporations that
[1993.12 --> 1998.00]  quote unquote have their headquarters in a country like ireland actually employ a significant number
[1998.00 --> 2003.44]  of people there sure so so there's that can be a factor in this kind of a decision but in this case
[2004.00 --> 2008.08]  i actually don't know that it was because my understanding is that apple in particular does not
[2008.08 --> 2012.40]  employ a ton of people in ireland and i'm sure that twitch chat is going to be uh apparently
[2012.40 --> 2018.64]  they have call centers in ireland there you go that's it yeah this is all over call centers call
[2018.64 --> 2026.88]  centers um listen apple needs that 16 billion to build that stupid building they're building in uh
[2026.88 --> 2031.20]  where is that okay 5 000 okay they commit to invest in infrastructure
[2031.20 --> 2037.04]  what infrastructure so i i don't know but infrastructure can mean anything it can mean
[2037.04 --> 2041.68]  roads it can mean urban development it can mean uh it can mean it pretty pretty much it's what you
[2041.68 --> 2047.36]  say to a place to make them be okay with you causing a lot of noise and traffic uh blah blah blah
[2048.96 --> 2054.08]  okay okay and this is another good point ireland wants the one percent because even one percent of
[2054.08 --> 2060.96]  apple's profits is better than zero percent of apple's profits so basically it becomes like a
[2060.96 --> 2065.36]  bidding war between countries for who can offer the lowest corporate taxes this is great thank you
[2065.36 --> 2070.72]  twitch chat for contributing positively to a conversation you guys are awesome today note that i
[2070.72 --> 2076.56]  said today so ireland says okay you you can be here and we're only going to charge you the one percent
[2076.56 --> 2082.72]  and the eu's like hey ireland now you gotta charge them the full price yeah so basically so it's all
[2082.72 --> 2087.12]  good for ireland shoot they're in a really good place i was gonna say they're in a really good place
[2087.12 --> 2092.88]  unless unless unless apple backs up unless apple bails on ireland and and all the other high-tech
[2092.88 --> 2097.44]  companies because apple's not the only one that's using ireland as a tax shelter like this is like
[2097.44 --> 2102.64]  part of their like if you were making it part of your business as a country to attract one percent
[2102.64 --> 2109.76]  of the profits of tech giants like apple and google then all of a sudden being stuck where price the
[2109.76 --> 2116.48]  price is fixed where you have uh like effectively like a like a minimum advertised price uh similar to
[2116.48 --> 2121.12]  how retailers are stuck selling a product at the same price if that's part of the manufacturer
[2121.12 --> 2125.44]  agreement like if they're stuck in a in like a price fixing situation or shouldn't say price
[2125.44 --> 2130.80]  fixing price fixing is illegal it's a different thing if it's like a like a a fair competition act
[2130.80 --> 2136.08]  kind of thing then what can they offer other than slashing the price and i think there's a there's some
[2136.08 --> 2140.32]  good things that could come out of that we could have countries coming up with more uh with more
[2140.32 --> 2146.40]  interesting and more innovative ways to attract companies and we could have companies well actually
[2146.72 --> 2151.20]  injecting some of that private money that quite frankly what do they even need it for
[2151.76 --> 2157.44]  at a certain point injecting some of that private money back into the citizens that are staffing their
[2157.44 --> 2161.68]  companies even if they're not willing to pay it to them directly i mean we've all seen the growing
[2161.68 --> 2168.48]  disparity between the wages of the highest one percent and the average working blue-collar joe yeah so
[2168.48 --> 2176.00]  overall i think this is great um yeah i think ireland wins here i think there's so many other companies
[2176.00 --> 2182.32]  there that are probably like wow we weren't charged one percent like whoever's over there people in
[2182.32 --> 2185.84]  charge saying microsoft is over there what if microsoft is being charged that full amount and
[2185.84 --> 2191.20]  now they're just finding out about this i don't think they are but maybe hey maybe they're paying 1.2
[2191.20 --> 2196.96]  percent 1.2 mind you if everyone ultimately has to come back and back pay at the same rate
[2196.96 --> 2201.12]  that's when they all move to what's that island jersey that tax haven island over there
[2201.12 --> 2206.24]  yeah anyway i mean this makes this is really frustrating as someone who actually pays taxes
[2206.24 --> 2211.20]  who actually feels like they paid for the road that leads to the building that they occupy
[2211.76 --> 2218.48]  um it is very very frustrating for me that the bigger you get the less you get leaned on especially
[2218.48 --> 2222.24]  because and you look at it from a personal i don't know if your personal taxes work the same way
[2222.24 --> 2226.72]  but from a personal tax and for normal businesses tax the more you make the more you pay
[2226.72 --> 2232.80]  yeah up to a point absolutely the truth i mean the first i think it's 26 or 28 000 a year that you
[2232.80 --> 2238.48]  make in british columbia there's no tax so if you're very low income there is no income tax and then as
[2238.48 --> 2243.60]  you go up you get into a higher and higher tax bracket but the way it works is there's no punishment
[2243.60 --> 2247.52]  for going up into a higher tax bracket because you only pay the higher tax rate on the income you make
[2247.52 --> 2252.40]  over the last threshold yeah so once i think you're past about a hundred thousand a year
[2252.40 --> 2260.96]  um it goes up as high as 40 percent personally um and and we have a 12 percent federal and provincial
[2260.96 --> 2269.12]  sales tax total so we actually pay over half plus property tax if you're a landowner um plus bridge
[2269.12 --> 2274.56]  tolls like i have to pay a toll every time i want to go into vancouver city yeah well so like just think
[2274.56 --> 2280.24]  of how many times you can take the root if you like hate yourself yeah and you want it to like it you
[2280.24 --> 2287.52]  could pay yourself you could pay yourself half of minimum wage yeah to go around if you look
[2287.52 --> 2291.84]  depending on where you're going it'll be like only five more minutes and then i'll take it because
[2291.84 --> 2296.72]  it'll it'll if there's like a traffic jam you know because google will tell you but yes it's ridiculous
[2296.72 --> 2301.92]  with those tax laws just think about how much money your country's going to make when trump wins and
[2301.92 --> 2310.00]  everybody decides hey i'm going to go to canada right as the fix it you know yeah i don't know you know
[2310.00 --> 2317.20]  what's actually funny is uh canada's canada's working on um loosening up the rules for getting
[2317.20 --> 2325.28]  into the country yeah particularly if you are canadian educated oh yeah so if you if you came to canada as
[2325.28 --> 2331.04]  a student and you did like like an exchange program or some kind of foreign study thing then what canada's
[2331.04 --> 2336.40]  trying to do is instead of educating these bloody people and but what people don't really understand
[2336.40 --> 2342.32]  is that university is very expensive or college as you call it here in the us of a college is very
[2342.32 --> 2347.12]  very expensive for students but at least in canada anyway the actual cost to educate those students is
[2347.12 --> 2351.60]  much much higher there are heavy government subsidies as it is so basically you're taking
[2351.60 --> 2355.76]  these international students who do pay more but i'm still actually not quite sure if it covers it
[2355.76 --> 2360.24]  you're educating them with the canadian system they're you know getting immersed in canadian culture
[2360.24 --> 2364.80]  and then you're basically going okay out you go go back to wherever you came from you can't come back
[2364.80 --> 2369.28]  which makes no sense to me i mean the people care enough about canada and canadians and canadian
[2369.28 --> 2375.20]  culture but they came to study here and then what we're going to kick them out i mean what would
[2375.20 --> 2382.40]  that what would that mean for people like dennis like we're taking young single uh educated
[2383.44 --> 2389.52]  canadian culturalized people and we're saying you can't live here i mean those are the ideal the
[2389.52 --> 2400.08]  ideal immigrants yeah anyway i uh yeah yeah people are all the entire chats like canadian culture
[2400.08 --> 2406.08]  in quotes i know we have poutine they have maple syrup a little bit we have maple syrup we have maple
[2406.08 --> 2414.88]  bacon we have maple ice cream okay they're very sorry maple bacon is fantastic that's not culture though
[2414.88 --> 2421.44]  all right yeah things you eat our culture okay i mean what culture would america have if it wasn't
[2421.44 --> 2427.60]  for food well america america is is like well it's not so much the food that's the culture it's the
[2427.60 --> 2431.92]  amount of it it's like lots of yeah that's right you want to throw stones i'll throw stones how awkward
[2431.92 --> 2436.40]  you kind of have to defend both a little bit well because you have to go home eventually you're right
[2436.40 --> 2442.88]  you gotta actually go to canada i can do whatever i please all right so uh next topic coming up is youtube
[2442.88 --> 2446.96]  being accused of censoring vloggers and i don't actually where's that hat again yeah i don't
[2446.96 --> 2452.08]  actually normally do this where i'm like ha ha i'm gonna tease the topic before i jump into a bunch
[2452.08 --> 2456.56]  of sponsor spots but i really want you guys to stay tuned for that discussion because i think it is
[2456.56 --> 2462.40]  going to be a good one so our first sponsor of the day is squarespace you can get 24 7 support via live
[2462.40 --> 2468.00]  chat in brackets we don't offer telephone support it costs only eight dollars a month you get a free
[2468.00 --> 2470.80]  domain if you buy squarespace for a year i'm just going to read the talking points because nick
[2470.80 --> 2474.88]  keeps yelling at me for ad-libbing what does that mean like he doesn't like when you just
[2475.52 --> 2482.16]  that's what makes a better live stream right so you know what squarespace they make like websites
[2482.16 --> 2488.00]  and stuff and you go to squarespace.com and it's like responsive design and like they got features
[2488.00 --> 2492.48]  man they got features our corporate page is squarespace is it really god why aren't they paying
[2492.48 --> 2496.56]  us no yeah are they sponsored they're not oh all right but hey well there you go now you know yeah
[2496.56 --> 2502.48]  that's right now you know so if their website sucks you know who to blame and it's not squarespace
[2502.48 --> 2507.36]  because squarespace is actually very easy to use with lots of attractive templates that's right so
[2507.36 --> 2513.12]  it must be matt for doing a crappy job yeah uploading the wrong pictures it's like this is supposed to be
[2513.12 --> 2517.76]  about nerd fusion why are there monkey butts on it oh that's a great idea because we accidentally
[2517.76 --> 2524.24]  uploaded from the monkey butt folder i definitely put some of my astronomy pictures up there anyway
[2525.04 --> 2529.68]  everyone can now publish content in apple news format directly from their squarespace blog every
[2529.68 --> 2534.72]  squarespace site has built-in e-commerce and you can start a trial with no credit card required at

[2542.96 --> 2548.24]  speaking of paid plans if you're more into the having people like give you money than the whole
[2548.24 --> 2554.00]  paying money part of using the things that linus media group endorses then freshbooks freshbooks is
[2554.00 --> 2559.20]  the easy to use invoicing software that helps small businesses look professional i mean it doesn't
[2559.20 --> 2564.00]  make you professional you can still like you know have your butt hanging out while you're under someone's
[2564.00 --> 2568.00]  sink fixing their pipes that's fine you don't have to look professional you just well okay you have to
[2568.00 --> 2573.52]  look professional but only on the invoice okay you can still dress in like you know plaid and wear like
[2573.52 --> 2577.44]  dirty boots it's kind of unprofessional not to show crack on that job i feel like do you think so
[2577.44 --> 2585.20]  absolutely really so i i would trust somebody more who's the stereotypical plumber type than like
[2585.20 --> 2591.52]  someone who's all clean yeah so why comes in in like a suit and tie to fix your pipes like what you
[2591.52 --> 2596.96]  don't want okay well you're going extreme okay well i'm there as an example yeah i just i want the i want
[2596.96 --> 2601.84]  the person who's been doing it for a long time he just doesn't care about how he looks he just knows
[2601.84 --> 2609.84]  he's getting the job done i see so you think that in order to in order to be a good plumber you just
[2609.84 --> 2616.72]  have you've been bent over that long yep so long that your pants are well is molded to that shape so
[2616.72 --> 2621.76]  it's always just pulling down your so you're cracked okay so so then is that i mean is that a form of
[2621.76 --> 2625.84]  discrimination i mean you guys have serious anti-discrimination employment laws here in
[2625.84 --> 2630.64]  washington i would only hire a plumber that shows i see why nick doesn't like it when you're at
[2630.64 --> 2635.44]  the sponsor spot this is fine they're going to talk about that so if it's a female is that sexual
[2635.44 --> 2639.92]  discrimination if you're saying look if you don't show crack while you're fixing my pipes we're out of
[2639.92 --> 2645.04]  this yeah we're out of this yeah well you heard it here first if you guys ever get called to the
[2645.04 --> 2651.12]  nerd fusion office to fix their pipes then you better be ready to show crack um anyway back to fresh
[2651.12 --> 2656.64]  depending on the kind of speaking of fresh books is the super simple easy to use invoicing tool
[2656.64 --> 2661.68]  that lets small business owners whether you're a plumber whether you're a dance teacher whether you're

[2883.28 --> 2891.84]  the big the big one the original article this was posted by um ramam attacks on the forum uh the original
[2891.84 --> 2900.40]  article that i actually saw was uh sexy phil's uh sexy phil's post which had a very very incendiary
[2900.40 --> 2904.16]  title something like youtube is shutting my channel down and i don't know what to do to
[2904.16 --> 2908.16]  phil defranco oh i didn't know i saw that too um sorry i don't know i don't think anyone calls him
[2908.16 --> 2914.96]  sexy phil anymore his like old channel name is ssf yeah kind of like austin evans's old channel name
[2914.96 --> 2921.52]  is duncan33303 i think i'm one of the only guys whose channel name is actually my channel name
[2921.52 --> 2926.72]  because they let you switch it now so if i wanted to rebrand to something not quite so narcissistic
[2926.72 --> 2936.96]  i could but i won't why would you um so here we go why is youtube being accused of censoring vloggers
[2936.96 --> 2942.00]  with the sub headline here is that called a byline nothing has changed remember i don't actually have
[2942.00 --> 2948.32]  a news background i just run this podcast with the subtitle littler title yeah the littler the like
[2948.32 --> 2954.64]  gray and not black it's not always gray it's so it's it's italicized and the font is smaller
[2954.64 --> 2958.72]  the worst is when they repeat what you've already read in the title like like three or four times
[2959.36 --> 2968.64]  okay so let's let's stick with the facts to start with the fact is that youtube is not shutting down
[2969.36 --> 2973.92]  phil defranco's channel that i mean the guy's well known for having clickbait titles and you can
[2973.92 --> 2980.24]  think of that whatever you will you know if it if it if it works i i actually as long as the video
[2980.24 --> 2985.52]  is somewhat about that and i guess it's somewhat about how that is not actually what's happening
[2986.24 --> 2992.40]  i guess like he sort of that's yeah because in the video he specifically says says like we're not going
[2992.40 --> 2996.56]  anywhere the channel is not shutting down we have all these other sources of revenue because we're smart
[2996.56 --> 3000.72]  and we built up other revenue streams which is smart and that's good it just means that the title
[3000.72 --> 3006.56]  really isn't anything to do with reality um so youtube did not shut down the channel and they
[3006.56 --> 3014.48]  have not as some people have said changed their terms of service okay let's uh let's go ahead and
[3014.48 --> 3020.80]  pull up the support.google page here i think that's my screen share yeah there we go uh well this is one
[3020.80 --> 3023.68]  of the things i love about the touch screen by the way a lot of people ask me why i care about the
[3023.68 --> 3029.28]  touch screen i actually use it to scroll nicely when i'm uh when i'm streaming i wish i had one of those
[3029.28 --> 3036.72]  these terms of service have not changed content that is considered inappropriate for advertising
[3037.60 --> 3043.84]  not for hosting on the youtube.com website okay sexually suggestive including partial nudity and
[3043.84 --> 3047.76]  sexual humor violence including display of serious injury and events related to that violent extremism
[3047.76 --> 3050.96]  inappropriate language including harassment profanity and vulgar language promotion of drugs
[3050.96 --> 3054.96]  and related substances including selling use and abuse of such items controversial sensitive subjects
[3054.96 --> 3058.32]  and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and
[3058.32 --> 3064.40]  strategies even if graphical imagery is not shown if any of the above describes any portion
[3064.96 --> 3069.68]  of your video then the video may not be approved for monetization if monetization is approved
[3069.68 --> 3074.32]  your video may not be eligible for all available ad formats youtube reserves the right to not
[3074.32 --> 3080.56]  monetize a video as well as suspend monetization features on channels that repeatedly submit videos
[3080.56 --> 3090.56]  violating our policies so they haven't changed that the key difference is in the enforcement of the
[3090.56 --> 3098.96]  aforementioned rules now some of this stuff makes a fair bit of sense to me some of the videos that
[3098.96 --> 3107.20]  clearly violate anti-cyber bullying policies some of which had been revised in the last i think four to six
[3107.20 --> 3112.72]  weeks something along those lines whereas some of them don't make a ton of sense to me although i
[3112.72 --> 3118.72]  haven't watched the video in question phil defranco did claim that he had a video that was covering a
[3118.72 --> 3125.52]  news item about something controversial but that wasn't promoting it in any way and where basically his
[3125.52 --> 3131.60]  coverage of the news was being considered not advertiser friendly and therefore not eligible for
[3131.60 --> 3137.84]  monetization potentially that is to say if his only income stream was from youtube and google adsense
[3138.40 --> 3147.04]  potentially undermining his ability to maintain his channel that makes sense right now these are the
[3147.04 --> 3150.72]  rest of my notes on this and then we'll open this one up for for a real discussion here and i'm sure
[3150.72 --> 3156.16]  twitch chat is going to get involved as well so right now videos seem to be being flagged for reasons that
[3156.16 --> 3164.08]  appear to be unfair and unclear um statements from youtube suggest that the problem isn't a new policy
[3164.72 --> 3171.84]  um it's just a long-running conflict between the platform's rules and their execution on those rules
[3173.28 --> 3180.96]  so don't surprise me all right i mean i think we're gonna tinfoil hat off sorry can i get there
[3180.96 --> 3186.08]  yeah can we get water thank you you guys have like a producer can you like fill it up all the way
[3186.08 --> 3191.92]  this time i still have water because i haven't been talking thank you thank you am i orange because
[3191.92 --> 3201.12]  like that's like tech tips is coming green okay i'm green um yeah so i i don't i don't know like as a not
[3201.12 --> 3210.88]  youtuber oh here we go it seems to me like like youtube just likes to has youtube done anything
[3210.88 --> 3217.36]  right recently right it's where we're like and they they seem to do really well when they piss off
[3217.36 --> 3223.76]  all their content creators you think so they seem to the the youtube views are going way up just look
[3223.76 --> 3228.64]  at this topic alone right think about how many videos and how many views are stemming from just
[3228.64 --> 3234.56]  this topic alone here's a question for you do they care because these are non-monetizable views that
[3234.56 --> 3240.64]  are basically costing you to be monetized costing oh the discussion about this is way more monetizable than the
[3240.88 --> 3248.08]  what they are un-monetized ours can let me put this on they are definitely making more money off of
[3248.08 --> 3253.68]  doing this than if they hadn't done it because all these videos those are videos that have been seen
[3253.68 --> 3258.40]  already by the large majority of people that are going to see them yeah and now there's a way more
[3258.40 --> 3264.88]  videos brand new monetized talking about this now thank you for the few million dollars everybody says
[3264.88 --> 3270.56]  youtube and uh they keep going i can tell you that every video from a youtuber because many in the
[3270.56 --> 3274.56]  youtube community the people who care about this within the youtube community seem to be for the
[3274.56 --> 3280.00]  most part super mad about it um most of the ones i've seen in fact one i saw was pretty funny where
[3280.00 --> 3285.76]  the guy went out of his way to break every single one of those guidelines um is still monetized no
[3286.40 --> 3290.72]  without monetizing it meaning that youtube is effectively just paying storage and bandwidth
[3290.72 --> 3297.28]  for something that they don't benefit from and that has a viewer using up valuable session view time
[3297.84 --> 3304.00]  on not making any money for the platform like that they have a whole sidebar full of related content
[3304.00 --> 3308.88]  as long as there's one click after on any of those you're good that's right interesting okay good
[3308.88 --> 3313.92]  content what else you got for me good for youtube content is king what else you got for me yeah i i have
[3313.92 --> 3320.32]  nothing no i i definitely think that doing things like this is what keeps youtube people talking about
[3320.32 --> 3325.44]  it they want people talking about the platform you know this is definitely tinfoil hat stuff right here
[3325.44 --> 3333.12]  ridiculous to me where it's like they drama is really good for youtube views it just is and if
[3333.12 --> 3337.28]  they have to manufacture the drama then so be it i i don't get the feeling that they're going out of
[3337.28 --> 3342.48]  their way to manufacture drama to get views i think they're doing this for other reasons i think this
[3342.48 --> 3349.44]  is pure hand-handedness i think that basically they got some pressure put on them by advertisers i mean
[3349.44 --> 3352.80]  at some point they're gonna have to make youtube profitable they're gonna have to figure out how to do that
[3352.80 --> 3359.36]  um i i think i think at some point well okay i know for a fact that one of the business goals
[3359.36 --> 3363.92]  within the youtube business unit is to be profitable whether google actually expects it to happen or not
[3363.92 --> 3370.48]  or alpha whether alphabet expects it to happen or not i'm not sure but that is that is a goal that is
[3370.48 --> 3376.00]  something that they seem to be working towards with things like youtube red which does extract more
[3376.00 --> 3382.16]  money per individual view than advertisement by the way that's interesting because there's youtube red videos
[3382.80 --> 3388.00]  that are not demonetized that break those guidelines right somebody has gone through and compiled like
[3388.00 --> 3394.00]  a list of 30 or 40 youtube red videos whose titles completely like have rate in them and stuff like
[3394.00 --> 3403.92]  that interesting yep well awkward okay so so sorry back to right so my my my personal theory is that
[3403.92 --> 3410.40]  basically advertisers came to them and said look we'll feel better about advertising on the platform if we
[3410.40 --> 3418.16]  don't have our ad displayed on you know some video full of profanity that is promoting hate and promoting
[3418.16 --> 3425.36]  you know cyber bullying or or or has these controversial topics and all this stuff um and basically what i
[3425.36 --> 3431.20]  think is happening is youtube is trying to figure out a way to deliver their ad inventory because there's
[3431.20 --> 3436.40]  always a there's always a finite amount of ad inventory they're figuring out a way to deliver their ad inventory
[3436.40 --> 3443.52]  in a way that best optimizes their cpms for both the platform itself and for the content creators who
[3443.52 --> 3451.04]  are keeping in line with brand friendly values while you know and treating the stuff that is not going
[3451.04 --> 3458.16]  to be monetizable as sort of collateral damage um and i think that right now because google is all about
[3458.16 --> 3463.36]  automated systems it's not like people are manually going through these videos so right now in the first
[3463.36 --> 3467.68]  iteration of the system they're basically going yeah there's going to be again there's going to be
[3467.68 --> 3473.76]  some collateral damage we will revise the algorithm over time and my belief is what they're actually
[3473.76 --> 3480.00]  generating on the back end is not just a black and white system because they made it very clear in the
[3480.00 --> 3484.32]  system they didn't or they made it very clear in the announcement or in the guidelines that the video
[3484.32 --> 3490.56]  might not be eligible for all types of advertising so they might be able to actually have potential
[3490.56 --> 3495.52]  advertising partners in the future that are okay with that i'm looking a year or two years down the
[3495.52 --> 3498.80]  road that makes sense where they can fill out a questionnaire and they can say what are you
[3498.80 --> 3504.40]  comfortable with yeah yeah and then those advertisers impressions and you'll check this box yeah that's
[3504.40 --> 3509.44]  right that makes a lot of sense or if you're willing to have your if you're willing to have your
[3509.44 --> 3514.24]  advertisement play on some youtube drama video about two youtubers who got in a fight or whatever
[3514.24 --> 3520.08]  that's full of you know people saying hateful things to each other um then hey maybe you pay a little bit
[3520.08 --> 3525.44]  less i think they want to figure i think youtube's ultimate goal is to monetize every single video
[3525.44 --> 3530.64]  on the platform i think just right now they are rolling this out in stages and then what the first
[3530.64 --> 3538.40]  stage looks like is a very imperfect algorithm for detecting stuff that they know is definitely or
[3538.40 --> 3543.60]  probably not safe for all the advertisers that they have now and then they'll work on rolling out
[3543.60 --> 3551.28]  something more granular in the future and i think that while it is totally crap for people to have
[3551.28 --> 3557.60]  made youtube a job to have to have relied on the benevolence of of google who runs this wonderful
[3557.60 --> 3561.68]  platform that makes it so people can quit their jobs and start doing this as a full-time job
[3562.40 --> 3567.52]  even if they're not business savvy people i think it's super crappy to those people but i think that
[3567.52 --> 3572.64]  it's also a huge wake-up call because what those people have to understand is even if they don't come from a
[3572.64 --> 3578.80]  business background they are entrepreneurs and they're going to have to understand that as great
[3578.80 --> 3585.04]  as it's been and we should be appreciative of google and youtube for keeping us divided from this as great
[3585.04 --> 3595.60]  as it is to feel like i can say and do whatever i want and ford or frito-lay or pepsico or major brands
[3595.60 --> 3601.76]  like this are going to just display advertising on it i'm going to make money that is not how it works in the real
[3601.76 --> 3610.08]  world absolutely not so if you imagined that this was going to keep up forever that brands with like
[3610.08 --> 3616.96]  corporate corporate values and those can go on either end of the the spectrum i mean look at chick-fil-a
[3616.96 --> 3621.68]  i mean you can go you can go all the way from like hyper conservative brands all the way to brands that
[3621.68 --> 3627.28]  are like yeah whatever do whatever bite the heads off of you know chickens on on stream or on video for
[3627.28 --> 3632.48]  all i care we'll endorse the crap out of it um people are just going to have to understand that
[3632.48 --> 3639.92]  if they expect to get mainstream advertising dollars and those big mainstream cpms that content just
[3639.92 --> 3645.92]  doesn't fly and there it's a miracle that it did for this long that's my take on it i mean do you think
[3646.64 --> 3653.12]  do you think there's something wrong there with how corporations perceive ads because right now it seems
[3653.12 --> 3658.80]  that they're like this is now part of the content which is crap yeah right i don't i don't think a
[3658.80 --> 3665.84]  single viewer out there thinks that the ad is in any way related to the content that i think is wrong
[3665.84 --> 3672.00]  really oh yes oh yes i mean i i mean all you got to do is spend some time on tumblr do we have to find
[3672.56 --> 3680.56]  i don't do that right to find people who can get very upset writing letters writing handwritten letters to
[3680.56 --> 3688.08]  ceos because they saw an ad for colgate toothpaste on some youtube video where someone was swearing
[3688.64 --> 3694.88]  and the problem is that it only takes one person well well that person's just wrong no that person
[3694.88 --> 3698.48]  is wrong that's all there it doesn't take just one person because advertising is all about
[3699.28 --> 3705.28]  a massive message to lots and lots of people it's just one person gets mad that's fine they don't care
[3705.28 --> 3710.48]  no but okay so hold on hold on so no i vocal minority because i agree with you that corporations are
[3710.48 --> 3715.76]  viewing advertising wrong and that that person is viewing advertising wrong but you also have to
[3715.76 --> 3722.32]  understand that from a corporation perspective you have to tread very lightly around that stuff because
[3722.32 --> 3729.44]  one angry person can turn into a thousand or ten thousand angry people very very quickly as soon as it
[3729.44 --> 3735.52]  ends up on national news because some rinky-dink news outlet had nothing else to talk about today
[3735.52 --> 3741.84]  besides the fact that a colgate ad played on this video besides the fact that colgate for that one
[3741.84 --> 3747.92]  person besides the fact that colgate is paying money yeah i mean that's the thing anywhere money
[3747.92 --> 3752.56]  exchange that's not how that works colgate does not pay that content creator that's not how the system
[3752.56 --> 3759.04]  works effectively they do yeah yeah no they don't they pay youtube and then youtube serves it wherever
[3759.04 --> 3765.36]  they please that's right because and colgate has every right to be mad if their money and their ad and
[3765.36 --> 3770.96]  their brand gets associated with someone else and and i don't think they should be mad in this case no
[3770.96 --> 3776.64]  no they shouldn't but remember i mean and we've had okay we've had this conversation offline the
[3776.64 --> 3783.68]  advertising industry is like 30 40 years ago oh yeah absolutely right they are no they are nowhere
[3783.68 --> 3790.96]  okay they're nowhere near ready for youtube let alone twitch yeah i mean that's very true obviously
[3790.96 --> 3797.04]  none of this is surprising but i mean like there there's it's just it's i think this is just an
[3797.04 --> 3804.56]  education thing where youtube is is taking some stance on something without even attempting to educate
[3804.56 --> 3810.08]  their advertisers that are advertising we don't you and i you and i spend a lot of time educating
[3810.08 --> 3815.04]  people that come to us right we put a lot of time talking to them about things like this talking to
[3815.04 --> 3822.24]  lynda.com about why it's better if we screw up your ad read it is better and it is better totally
[3822.24 --> 3826.96]  i have more fun yeah and that's what it's all about exactly having more fun personally right
[3826.96 --> 3835.20]  is it just that youtube isn't spending enough time educating advertisers into hey welcome to 2016
[3835.20 --> 3841.28]  in 2016 law so here's the thing it's like you've dealt with big brands with big brands and i'm not
[3841.28 --> 3848.40]  going to name any names but we have dealt with brands that come with very big egos i mean when
[3848.40 --> 3855.04]  you're talking to a hundred year old company that has become one of the you know fortune 50 companies
[3855.68 --> 3862.40]  through a long-standing tradition of behaving a certain way and having a certain set of brand values
[3862.40 --> 3866.80]  yeah when you're talking to them and you're going yeah yeah but that's all out the door in the
[3866.80 --> 3871.28]  last three years don't worry about it yeah can you imagine the kind of pushback you're gonna get
[3871.28 --> 3876.00]  like i mean it depends i'm saying that i'm taking my paycheck and i'm giving it to someone else
[3876.88 --> 3881.68]  that's simple i'll give it to malcolm in the middle reruns because that's just the right that's
[3881.68 --> 3888.08]  just the right amount of edgy oh god did you like that show i love that show it's great but you
[3888.08 --> 3892.72]  don't like that show it's all right it's all right i mean it's like dewey's the worst child
[3892.72 --> 3898.16]  actor on the face of the earth like everybody loves raymond like area of oh it's better than
[3898.16 --> 3904.48]  everybody loves raymond come on well anyway line is what you said about like not black and white but
[3904.48 --> 3911.04]  having various levels of of you know gray between where an advertiser can say i'm okay with this but
[3911.04 --> 3916.56]  not that i think that makes a lot of sense yeah like and if they would describe it and explain it that
[3916.56 --> 3920.80]  way well they're not but i don't think they're ready to roll it out that well but people are
[3920.80 --> 3924.00]  getting really upset because they don't understand what the heck is going on like you said there's
[3924.00 --> 3929.36]  not enough education going on here yeah but that's always youtube's problem like they're always sending
[3929.36 --> 3935.76]  out like remember when okay this is happening now site yeah yeah i mean so here's the bottom line so
[3935.76 --> 3941.84]  here here's the ultimate bottom line on this this was a matter of time and this is a huge wake-up call
[3941.84 --> 3948.40]  for youtubers about the fact that they they are business owners that they do have to conduct
[3948.40 --> 3955.44]  themselves in a professional manner if they expect sponsors to give them any money um and fact number
[3955.44 --> 3962.16]  three is that youtube is not censoring anyone they are not telling anyone that you can't continue to
[3962.16 --> 3969.12]  upload your videos to the site i mean they're saying we won't pay you to do it it's effect it's kind of
[3969.12 --> 3972.88]  it's an effective censorship you're not saying we'll shut you down because if someone's had a
[3972.88 --> 3977.12]  show where they've done this for the past like three years they have a certain thing that they
[3977.12 --> 3981.92]  do you know they're they're more rough around the edges yeah and now oh crap i can't make any more
[3981.92 --> 3986.08]  money this way because nobody's going to want to advertise with me i mean like you said maybe we all
[3986.08 --> 3990.72]  have to grow up about it yeah maybe you have to grow up and realize that this is either a hobby or it's
[3990.72 --> 3994.72]  or you're a businessman and you're a professional because someone says a curse word it's no longer a
[3994.72 --> 4000.80]  profession that's true and you know what i think like sensitive political topic what does that mean
[4000.80 --> 4006.64]  i think the algorithm is way too heavy-handed right now oh i agree with that i also i also think
[4006.64 --> 4011.44]  that they are heading to a place where it will ultimately be something that makes sense to me
[4011.44 --> 4017.36]  especially if they can have a tiered system where the edgier the content the fewer sponsors are gonna
[4017.36 --> 4022.00]  are going to uh whitelist it and are going to be okay with it are going to sign on for it and ultimately
[4022.00 --> 4028.48]  the lower cpns you might make but that you might still be able to make money um i just think that
[4028.48 --> 4033.92]  this ultimately is a bit of a wake-up call and that hopefully we're heading somewhere better with
[4033.92 --> 4038.48]  it and that youtube has done a crap job of communication and implementation they always do
[4038.48 --> 4044.40]  but they always do that and they always over fix and then pull it back that's just a typical thing
[4044.40 --> 4050.16]  right yes maybe that's a tactic of theirs that's basically what we're looking at here and ultimately
[4050.16 --> 4054.88]  you know what it isn't the phil defrancos of the world and he said this himself it isn't the phil
[4054.88 --> 4059.28]  defrancos of the world that are going to suffer from this sure it is the up and coming guys the guys
[4059.28 --> 4066.40]  that do not have a thriving merch business or that do not have a thriving direct donation business or that
[4066.40 --> 4072.32]  do not have any other means of augmenting their income and so ultimately and this is the part that is
[4072.32 --> 4079.60]  most shitty about it is that it is the least business like that are going to be affected
[4079.60 --> 4084.32]  the most the people who had the least chance of seeing it coming because quite frankly linus media
[4084.32 --> 4090.40]  group could survive if youtube shut off our adsense we are set up in such a way that we are ready for
[4090.40 --> 4096.80]  that because i've seen this coming literally years in advance from the moment i founded linus media group
[4096.80 --> 4102.24]  i was trying to figure out how to not be reliant on the benevolence of youtube even if i was still
[4102.24 --> 4107.04]  i still needed to use it to reach a large audience i had to find other ways to monetize that audience
[4107.04 --> 4112.00]  what that also means is i am deeply experienced dealing directly with sponsors and i'm already
[4112.00 --> 4118.40]  aware of these sensitivities so it is the guys that stumbled into it that don't have the business acumen
[4118.40 --> 4123.52]  that are ultimately getting crapped on the hardest by this and that sucks and they really need to fix it
[4123.52 --> 4129.76]  but ultimately the bottom line is this was coming so don't be that surprised there i mean i think
[4129.76 --> 4136.24]  everyone's surprised it was so heavy yes because that should probably not have come it's so heavy
[4136.24 --> 4144.00]  handed it is it's way too far yep they definitely i don't know and to use an automated system to
[4144.00 --> 4149.20]  detect when someone's cursing and just like wait wait that part is automated is if you say something i
[4149.20 --> 4155.44]  think right now from what i understand it's mostly tags and yeah yeah and things like that users reporting
[4155.44 --> 4160.16]  maybe yeah and then users fly yeah yeah that makes sense because as soon as this thing came out
[4160.16 --> 4164.88]  obviously a bunch of people started flagging videos right oh yeah yeah and then you get a bunch of
[4164.88 --> 4170.24]  false flags of the world yeah yeah all the sgw but then of course then yeah like i understand they
[4170.24 --> 4175.28]  want to automate it because like you can't have like a train a room full of of people just watching
[4175.28 --> 4181.44]  videos all day to listen for one swear word sounds like a fun job right that does not a fun job no
[4181.44 --> 4187.92]  that's what they use the report feature for and and i call it a feature when it's yeah that's something
[4187.92 --> 4196.00]  different all right so i will finally somewhat weigh in on the situation over at tech syndicate
[4196.64 --> 4202.32]  um let's go ahead and pop over to linus's screen so actually the main source i have for this is uh linus
[4202.32 --> 4209.28]  tech tips forum because as part of the whole uh and i'm gonna i need my allegedly sign because
[4209.28 --> 4214.08]  ultimately i don't we need some more props up in here because there is a lot of conflicting
[4214.08 --> 4219.76]  information have you been following this at all i have not do you know who they are i learned you
[4219.76 --> 4226.00]  okay right you can learn okay well whatever anyway the point is you want to explain though yeah they're
[4226.80 --> 4231.76]  who is tech syndicate okay so they're another youtube channel uh that makes videos about
[4233.04 --> 4239.52]  sometimes tech um i'm gonna look up because i think i know the guy the guy who runs it used to
[4239.52 --> 4245.44]  be the tiger direct youtube guy you know tiger direct i do know a tiger okay so he used to be
[4245.44 --> 4251.60]  their youtube personality like i do know who that is way back in the day okay okay i definitely know who
[4251.60 --> 4258.80]  that is so basically the drama llama is all over the place um there have been a couple of public
[4258.80 --> 4266.64]  statements released from what appear to be sort of two warring camps um allegedly i'm just i'm gonna
[4266.64 --> 4273.04]  fill it with that so basically logan and pistol appear to be on one side with wendell and kane and uh
[4273.68 --> 4279.76]  shoot i don't remember her name jennifer with wendell kane and jennifer kind of on the other side and what it
[4279.76 --> 4284.64]  looks like right now though i haven't actually checked the thread today so i don't know if anything
[4284.64 --> 4291.44]  if anything new has come out let's just go ahead and have a look here tuesday uh blah blah blah blah
[4291.44 --> 4297.68]  blah blah blah wow there's a lot of posts per page on our forum apparently yeah so there's 10 pages on
[4297.68 --> 4301.20]  the latest right here we're gonna we're gonna experience this together yeah just keep going
[4301.20 --> 4308.32]  let me just say your seo for your forums nailed it thank you uh not not me it's mostly it's mostly a
[4308.32 --> 4319.12]  loop thing but um okay basically wendell came out and said okay we have some problems uh it appears as
[4319.12 --> 4325.84]  though there's some misappropriation of funds um i am a part owner in the company um i believe he did
[4325.84 --> 4332.48]  clarify his shares are 30 the company's been increasing in revenue by 125k a year or so for
[4332.48 --> 4337.52]  the last three years which gives us some idea what at least a bare minimum of the overall company gross
[4337.52 --> 4341.92]  income is even if that doesn't tell us anything about profitability or or how much is being paid to
[4341.92 --> 4347.44]  employees or whatever else the case may be um patrons were complaining that they weren't getting the
[4347.44 --> 4355.04]  patreon rewards they were promised um the and i don't i don't watch the channel so allegedly just based
[4355.04 --> 4359.84]  on posts i'm seeing on reddit tech syndicate forum our own forum uh people were saying the content's
[4359.84 --> 4365.52]  actually getting worse even though patrons are contributing all this money um and wendell basically
[4365.52 --> 4370.48]  came out and said look i don't understand where this money is going i'm a shareholder and what is going
[4370.48 --> 4380.08]  on um so many many strong words were exchanged uh particularly by um pistol there's been a lot of
[4380.08 --> 4386.64]  speculation as to what exactly the role that she plays in all of this is uh logan has released a
[4386.64 --> 4393.44]  statement saying it's all basically like down to miscommunication uh kane has been fired apparently
[4393.44 --> 4402.88]  or quit depending on who you ask uh jennifer is definitely gone um and wendell from uh my understanding
[4402.88 --> 4410.00]  of it appears to be definitely on the way out claims that logan owes him for his shares and is
[4410.00 --> 4416.64]  seeking a minimum of the amount that he figures he owes him just in like unpaid uh services for the
[4416.64 --> 4426.64]  company and uh yeah let me just see if there's anything anything else anything else new um like the forums
[4426.64 --> 4431.68]  were shut down but they're back on yeah so that was that was a whole controversy so yeah in the in the
[4431.68 --> 4438.80]  hullabaloo with uh people posting like public public email exchanges public chat exchanges on both sides
[4438.80 --> 4446.24]  of this conflict oh wow in all of that um logan says he alleges that the forum was shut down accidentally
[4446.24 --> 4451.60]  because he let kane go and was worried that he would sabotage it but people are posting screenshots of
[4451.60 --> 4457.68]  logan threatening to shut down the forum uh if people don't stop criticizing whatever it is they're doing
[4457.68 --> 4466.80]  or or whatever else or being haters um or whatever the case may be and pretty much um pretty much i
[4466.80 --> 4474.80]  guess the bottom line is that uh it looks like a pretty bad situation over there i i wouldn't
[4474.80 --> 4479.36]  personally you'll you'll still see like wendell on the channel for a while like there's stuff that's been
[4479.36 --> 4485.68]  recorded weeks ago um that's kind of still getting published so a video went up with him in it and
[4485.68 --> 4490.56]  everyone's like oh i guess it's okay yeah and it's like oh by the way that's not how video works
[4490.56 --> 4496.16]  unless you're this guy you've got to work way ahead yeah in an industry like this i don't know how you
[4496.16 --> 4503.36]  guys are so we have videos written that are three weeks from youtube publication we have videos shot
[4503.36 --> 4508.56]  that are how long this video is gonna oh yeah this video will be a while all right because there's the
[4508.56 --> 4513.44]  editing queue there's the vessel time delay window oh right you do the week yeah yeah so by the time you
[4513.44 --> 4516.56]  can watch it unless you're subscribed to vessel which i doubt very much that you are
[4518.24 --> 4522.72]  i totally am linus and everybody should be just for you linus
[4524.80 --> 4531.84]  um a lot of people are on vessel just for us we're very popular on vessel yeah yeah so there basically
[4532.48 --> 4536.96]  my bottom line on this one is i haven't worked with anyone over there since highlander
[4536.96 --> 4543.84]  in any capacity so i don't really have any comment other than to summarize everything that i have
[4544.56 --> 4553.20]  basically read on reddit textin forum linus tech tips forum etc so um so there you go
[4554.48 --> 4561.76]  i wish them i mean drama's fun it's just drama's fun it just likes when it happens to you right yeah
[4561.76 --> 4570.24]  you know that's okay we have what what i will say is someone posted a rumor who is a who claims to be
[4570.24 --> 4580.96]  very close to the source um and i would say that their source it was him yeah can we get a zoom in
[4580.96 --> 4584.96]  on can we get a zoom in on that while i do like ominous music no it's i'm just kidding it's fine uh
[4584.96 --> 4592.56]  he's about to jump out of the chair so so what i will say about this person's source is that either
[4592.56 --> 4597.60]  they are completely full of crap or this person is completely full of crap but someone claimed that
[4597.60 --> 4602.64]  a linus media group employee will be making the jump over to tech syndicate i can assure you that is not
[4602.64 --> 4609.68]  happening um and uh yeah it's actually live i can also assure you that would not be very good yeah
[4609.68 --> 4615.68]  joke's on you you guys are on your own you can rename it to just tech tips you know or like
[4615.68 --> 4620.88]  uh yes yeah it'll say the ltt is way better alliteration
[4620.88 --> 4628.32]  taren tech tips ttt ttt ttt yeah it sounds like it sounds like an extremist group
[4629.20 --> 4635.76]  what the ttt like i just have oh okay yeah i can see that yeah we might want to really rethink our image
[4635.76 --> 4643.12]  yeah i don't know if i'm i'll work on the name all right so um i guess i didn't really talk to
[4643.12 --> 4647.20]  twitch chat much while we were talking about all this stuff yeah what have they been i don't really
[4647.20 --> 4653.36]  i don't really know like harambe thing lots of harambe oh yeah you know what's really funny i
[4653.36 --> 4660.00]  again like most of our participation in internet memes i feel like is is at least half unintentional
[4660.00 --> 4668.32]  so my video on the galaxy s7 yeah um contains gorillas no wait no no it's what cpu to buy
[4668.32 --> 4675.12]  yeah yeah what cpu to buy has um has ran you randomly put no way it was no i put the gorillas
[4675.12 --> 4683.04]  in no i my guidance called for gorillas okay so so anyway that video was written yeah then there was
[4683.04 --> 4689.68]  like a week no delay hold on hold on yes week plus delay in editing yes then there was a week delay
[4689.68 --> 4698.00]  to go to youtube from vessel yeah with um so i had two people who left reviews for the 1700 cpu the
[4698.00 --> 4705.12]  6950x extreme edition two people who left reviews that were like these like chest thumping this cpu is
[4705.12 --> 4710.40]  so great and so am i for using it and so is anyone else who uses it and the other guy's like yeah you're
[4710.40 --> 4717.12]  great and i'm great too you know i only spent this much on my total rate 4 600 which is less than you
[4717.12 --> 4722.64]  but still awesome i'm still a baller like so we had these gorillas pop in while we highlighted like the
[4722.64 --> 4727.20]  goofy stuff these guys were saying and we had these gorilla sound effects so we participated in the
[4727.20 --> 4732.16]  harambe meme you totally knew that was a thing completely unintentionally no idea i posted on twitter
[4732.16 --> 4738.08]  and i get all these harambe that is straight up being sitting i had to google it i had no idea i
[4738.08 --> 4742.88]  basically am not an internet citizen i had two children could you imagine if the gorilla picture
[4742.88 --> 4750.16]  that you chose accidentally was harambe well it was shutterstock so the odds were like one in a
[4750.16 --> 4753.92]  thousand just because it would have been all gorillas kind of look the same to me yeah but
[4753.92 --> 4758.88]  right now if you search gorilla i guarantee most of you know triggered i am so triggered right now
[4758.88 --> 4763.28]  i'm triggered by you being triggered okay i can't be in a room with someone who's been triggered
[4763.28 --> 4768.96]  um very triggering very triggering so you can't be in a room with yourself it's like a freaking
[4768.96 --> 4775.84]  paradox it's a box and a box and a box and a box um all right so let's do some of our let's do some
[4775.84 --> 4782.48]  of our more rapid fire topics our original article here posted by tim q on the forum is from anand tech
[4782.48 --> 4790.64]  the acer predator 21x which confirmed i will be one of the first to receive a review unit of that's one
[4790.64 --> 4800.72]  big lap that's huge features a k an undisclosed kaby lake processor gtx 1080 desktop grade sli come on
[4801.36 --> 4810.32]  and a curved gaming display a curved display on a laptop is it a laptop at that point yeah i mean come
[4810.32 --> 4815.28]  those look like mechanical they are mechanical keys does that look like a laptop that's that
[4815.28 --> 4819.92]  that's like a desktop that's been put in a trash compact look at these vents yeah look at these
[4819.92 --> 4825.60]  vents take that on an airplane and see what they said i think the vents are here too look at this
[4825.60 --> 4830.88]  thing no i'm looking at it now to be clear you do not actually need quite that much ventilation
[4830.88 --> 4837.60]  we actually have a gtx 1080 sli video like uh like a laptop coming up on youtube in i think six days or
[4837.60 --> 4843.76]  something like that again working ahead um already out on vessel already look at the plugs thank you
[4843.76 --> 4850.56]  for that um all you're doing is plugging them being mad at me for being on vessel so thanks a lot for
[4850.56 --> 4859.76]  that um this thing looks ridiculous yeah i don't i can already tell you what the review will be so i'm
[4859.76 --> 4866.40]  even spoiling it for the vessel piece indulge us this thing is amazing it's the best gaming experience
[4866.40 --> 4873.04]  in a laptop you could possibly have but it's not really a laptop yeah that's what we just we just
[4874.08 --> 4881.12]  there you go there's a conclusion done peace line us out yeah as long as it doesn't explode if you
[4881.12 --> 4887.36]  quick charge it yes it'll be fine um god so acer acknowledges that this laptop is more of a proof of
[4887.36 --> 4895.68]  concept than any sort of like big seller in retail however acer has become more and more savvy as time has
[4895.68 --> 4900.40]  gone on about gaming and i think half of it is by accident and i think this could end up being a big
[4900.40 --> 4909.68]  hit so so the draw is that it's just so baller so i gave msi a ton of crap about the gt80 titan
[4910.24 --> 4916.24]  okay i made fun of it in my review it was very expensive computer and i told them in person i was like
[4916.24 --> 4924.24]  this is a concept car right six months down the road i get i get an email like yo dog you were wrong
[4924.80 --> 4930.96]  it's a huge seller and you know the gt80 titan right i do the one with the mechanical actual cherry
[4930.96 --> 4935.52]  mx mechanical oh that one you hated that well maybe not hated i didn't hate it it was really cool
[4937.92 --> 4943.20]  totally unique piece of hardware amazing piece of engineering just i wouldn't use it i've never used it
[4943.20 --> 4947.04]  i know just just look on your face in the room when you saw it for the first time i was like oh
[4947.04 --> 4952.88]  that's not that great what is that i'm not impressed it's just i mean there's a reason that there's this
[4952.88 --> 4960.80]  whole market now for these external cages for your uh laptop for your no for just graphic cards to plug
[4960.80 --> 4968.64]  into your laptop because a laptop is meant to be moved at some point yeah spoiler alert the uh the kaby lake
[4968.64 --> 4974.00]  processor that was allegedly on the show floor somewhere isn't a product that's like looks pretty
[4974.00 --> 4979.84]  cool for that so it's a super mobile super mobile product so the last so here are the base
[4979.84 --> 4984.80]  specifications i didn't cover all of them uh mechanical keyboard with cherry mx switches 21 inch curved
[4984.80 --> 4990.80]  ips display with a 2560 by 1080 resolution four integrated speakers with two built-in you're telling
[4990.80 --> 4997.28]  me they're only doing 1080p on something that big no 20 yeah it's 2560 by 1080 oh so it's wider
[4997.28 --> 5005.28]  is like like 25 or 30 percent more resolution but remember this is a 21 21 inch display 1080p looks not
[5005.28 --> 5011.92]  bad on a 21 inch display and it's 21 inches of like ultra wide display so it's like it'll be okay i think
[5012.56 --> 5018.88]  five fans and multiple heat pipes and uh here's a here's a shot here's actually a couple different
[5018.88 --> 5023.04]  pictures of it so here it is here it is open let's get the screen share going here let's just zoom in
[5023.04 --> 5030.40]  what it has a little fold out the wrist rest yeah so i'm gonna ask for one for every one of our video
[5030.40 --> 5035.20]  editors okay taren yes you're already you're already complaining about the weight you're carrying yeah
[5035.20 --> 5041.92]  this is like 30 pounds what what do you i don't care i want a thing that i can edit with take a desktop
[5042.48 --> 5048.00]  well that used to do that yeah that's that's actually that's more of a paint about than taking a lot of
[5048.00 --> 5053.92]  we used acer's uh super slim 23 inch monitor with to carry with our desktop until we broke them when
[5053.92 --> 5058.80]  we were traveling yeah and like we were thinking of making a video out of like desktop in a suitcase
[5058.80 --> 5063.76]  yep um i don't think we ever did it no we never did it it's also like literally doing that like next
[5063.76 --> 5068.72]  week yeah oh i'm sorry it's been done before but not as well as you will yeah whatever he said it's
[5068.72 --> 5072.96]  been done before doesn't mean i don't want it i need it oh okay so you're making one because you want oh i
[5072.96 --> 5078.48]  make them because we're going to use it okay okay not just for video all right so this is fun carbon
[5078.48 --> 5087.52]  nanotube storage coming to market in 2018 carbon nanotubes the only thing they can't do is get out
[5087.52 --> 5092.48]  of the lab which is not my joke i stole that joke that's a that's a good joke it's still a very funny
[5092.48 --> 5097.60]  joke because it's true they're supposed to be great for everything and yet but we never ever see them as
[5097.60 --> 5102.88]  long as the wanzhou has existed i've been talking about how amazing carbon nanotubes are and yet
[5102.88 --> 5111.20]  i've never seen one well i mean i'm pointing at your your logo that has three oh carbon okay well
[5111.20 --> 5116.88]  okay i thought that's what you were going for no that's not no that is the shape of the hexagon is
[5116.88 --> 5122.88]  this lattice shape okay i don't know that ed's that like i thought that that's what you were going for
[5122.88 --> 5132.80]  no no no no sorry no all right okay so basically fujitsu announced that it has licensed nantero's carbon
[5132.80 --> 5139.60]  nanotube based n ram non-volatile ram which is pretty cool too like ram discs could be much more
[5139.60 --> 5145.44]  of a thing and will participate in a joint development effort to bring a 256 megabit 15 55
[5145.44 --> 5154.32]  nanometer product to market in 2018. so 2020. if ever promising characteristics include things like
[5154.32 --> 5161.92]  unmatchable performance we hope durability and extreme temperature tolerance and uh the attraction to
[5161.92 --> 5168.00]  these begins with their d ram speed so competing products like 3d crosspoint rear re ram and pcm
[5168.00 --> 5175.04]  suffer from limited endurance thresholds n ram has been tested up to one trillion cycles that is to say
[5175.04 --> 5183.60]  if they can ever make one cool and they have said that leading edge products will ship with half the cost
[5183.60 --> 5189.28]  of d ram and that prices will fall as production once again carbon nanotubes are going to be cheaper
[5189.28 --> 5193.44]  they're going to be faster they're going to be more reliable yeah and you might even buy one one day
[5194.40 --> 5198.08]  if you live for long enough it's like that bike company that's like here's a five thousand dollar
[5198.08 --> 5206.24]  bike it'll be only 500 bucks to make this in five years i'm overly optimistic so spacex's rocket blew
[5206.24 --> 5212.72]  up and destroyed a facebook satellite oh cool shame dude that was one of the coolest videos of explosions
[5212.72 --> 5218.72]  that i've seen in a long time i have a rocket does burn it sucks that it happened yeah but like mr zuckerberg
[5218.72 --> 5224.80]  will have to just you see the explosion and then the capsule that holds the actual satellite in like
[5224.80 --> 5231.04]  it's still intact and you see it slowly just fall off to the side and it's still intact still intact hits
[5231.04 --> 5239.68]  the ground yeah it was it was oddly satisfying so they were conducting a test firing of their unmanned
[5239.68 --> 5245.52]  rocket when the blast occurred thursday morning uh they blew up facebook's first satellite costing
[5245.52 --> 5252.80]  around 150 million pounds that's a lot of pounds there are insurance companies they could have given
[5252.80 --> 5258.56]  that all to iowa surely you insure that how much how much would that insurance cost i mean why would
[5258.56 --> 5264.40]  you think that someone else's rocket's gonna blow up on the launch pad making your rocket fall over i mean
[5264.40 --> 5269.36]  you've got to ensure rocket fall over insurance people buy insurance for holes in one that's true
[5269.36 --> 5273.92]  but stuff like there's certain things you can't buy insurance for though like they won't insure against
[5273.92 --> 5280.72]  earthquakes in uh vancouver oh but if you pay them enough they would no they won't why surely like
[5280.72 --> 5285.76]  lloyds or somebody would i i don't know i know that you can insurance insane things like i've heard of
[5285.76 --> 5290.56]  of celebrities insuring their hair for example yeah like mariah carey's or voice insurer or something
[5290.56 --> 5296.56]  like that yeah i i can i can see that happening but i i don't know i don't know if that would even
[5296.56 --> 5303.44]  occur to me that would be like if i'm gonna put my satellite on something that i have no idea if
[5303.44 --> 5308.48]  this thing is going to do it probably the first thing i do is going for insurance yeah i don't know
[5308.48 --> 5315.76]  i don't know who you asked for that kind of insurance but yeah hey geico geico satellite insurance is
[5315.76 --> 5321.76]  this something come on you can get in on this so the satellite was so okay spacex confirmed there
[5321.76 --> 5326.40]  was an anomaly on the launch pad that resulted in the loss of the rocket and its payload the satellite
[5329.60 --> 5335.44]  the facebook satellite was carrying technology to allow them to spot beam wireless internet
[5335.44 --> 5341.20]  directly to smartphones in sub-saharan africa whoa and this information was reported by tech crunch
[5341.20 --> 5346.16]  what else were they doing with that satellite yeah spot beam spot beam means into your brain
[5346.16 --> 5351.36]  i don't know if i want to know that um this is actually pretty great so the original poster on
[5351.36 --> 5356.96]  the forum is good bites and the original article here that we're pulling from is ours technica facebook
[5356.96 --> 5365.28]  fires human editors oh yeah algorithm immediately posts fake news yeah wonderful breaking fox news exposes
[5365.28 --> 5374.40]  traitor megan kelly kicks her out for backing hillary i don't know who megan kelly is fox news yeah she's
[5374.40 --> 5379.12]  like an anchor or reporter correspondent or something she's been involved in like a feud with trump or
[5379.12 --> 5385.92]  something like that anyway um so this is great so earlier this year facebook denied criticisms that its
[5385.92 --> 5392.00]  trending feature was surfacing news biased against conservatives the company has fired all its human
[5392.00 --> 5397.04]  editors replacing them with software replacing them with an algorithm that promotes stories based on
[5397.04 --> 5404.96]  what facebook users are talking about wow putting facebook users in charge of your feed oh man that's
[5404.96 --> 5409.92]  kind of like they tried to put a positive spin on firing somebody here is that what's going on but
[5409.92 --> 5416.88]  that's like red look reddit if you up vote a story then it goes to the front page so within 72 hours
[5416.88 --> 5422.80]  according to the uh washington post the top story trending on facebook was fake in a post about
[5422.80 --> 5427.52]  the changes facebook said the early move to remove human editors was in direct response to the feedback
[5427.52 --> 5432.40]  they got from the facebook community earlier this year it's actually your fault this sucks so humans
[5432.40 --> 5437.44]  will still be involved with trending in a few ways such as confirming that a topic is tied to a current
[5437.44 --> 5442.32]  news event in the real world that is a direct quote that's important not the fake quote so now they're
[5442.32 --> 5448.56]  rehiring everybody probably just fire probably not maybe they'll hire one guy do you think they fired
[5448.56 --> 5454.24]  people over that or they just moved what did you do fire a robot well no the people before the robot
[5454.24 --> 5459.52]  the people who programmed the robot because you said that you just said like they fired people to replace
[5459.52 --> 5467.84]  them like maybe maybe they get shuffled around to i'm not sure design satellites i don't know um okay so the
[5467.84 --> 5473.52]  rumor is uh this is post was posted by case to to female i don't know how to pronounce that i don't
[5473.52 --> 5480.64]  care um a device info sticker reaffirms 32 gig base storage for the iphone 7 to which all i have to
[5480.64 --> 5489.44]  say is it's about time um oh oh have iphones been super tiny and yeah base model 16 gigs for a device that
[5489.44 --> 5495.36]  costs like 800 dollars it's ridiculous yeah that's i know to an android user it's unthinkable that's pretty
[5495.36 --> 5500.32]  ridiculous like the the progressive android phone makers are having 64 gig base models with the
[5500.32 --> 5505.76]  ones that are still trying to get as many dollars out of you going with 32 i think this one's 64
[5505.76 --> 5510.80]  though isn't it yeah there you go there's no excuse for a flagship phone having a 16 gig model
[5510.80 --> 5517.60]  i want to try out an iphone soon i haven't ever touched an iphone brandon did it i think it took him
[5517.60 --> 5521.92]  about three months to switch back okay that's a long time so you know my theory though is about
[5521.92 --> 5528.88]  why they're not doing a 16 gig model so have you noticed that you can't buy a 512 megabyte sd card
[5528.88 --> 5537.76]  anymore sure yeah so at a certain point yeah it basically costs the same to make a larger flash
[5537.76 --> 5542.08]  chip than a smaller flash chip because we're pretty much down to the cot the bill of materials cost at
[5542.08 --> 5548.40]  that point you're not adding any more dies there are no dies that are cheaper so i think basically it
[5548.40 --> 5553.68]  is exactly the same price now for apple to do a 32 gig model they could have been saving as little
[5553.68 --> 5558.88]  as two dollars and i think they were still doing it and they just didn't care and i think well i think
[5558.88 --> 5561.92]  part of the agenda even if it was the same price maybe it's even cheaper because that's something
[5561.92 --> 5568.40]  that happens eventually too what is because there's more demand more volume in manufacturing at a capacity
[5569.20 --> 5574.48]  i just experienced that with uh thumb drives yeah we ordered a bunch of thumb drives for here and the 16
[5574.48 --> 5580.00]  gigs were cheaper than the eight that's right yeah that's right so so basically i think what might
[5580.00 --> 5584.00]  have happened because apple also wants to promote icloud they want people investing in cloud storage
[5584.00 --> 5588.96]  anyway so i think even at the same cost they might have preferred a 16 gig model because when you're
[5588.96 --> 5593.76]  apple and you have the margins and the profits that you do you can play around with well we're really
[5593.76 --> 5598.96]  investing in cloud business we can throw a couple dollars away even to the detriment of the customer
[5598.96 --> 5604.32]  directly in order to promote a different business unit or business model um do you do cloud stuff no
[5604.32 --> 5610.72]  i never back up to the cloud do you so actually this is a great uh great conversation um unraid has
[5610.72 --> 5616.00]  a lot of cool new features coming that might enable you to do some self-cloud type stuff that's cool
[5616.64 --> 5620.64]  which is pretty cool they also i'm trying to convince them this is not confirmed but i'm trying to
[5620.64 --> 5625.92]  convince them that they should have without me having to use crash plan or anything like that
[5625.92 --> 5632.08]  they should have a direct unraid box to unraid box uh link that i can do uh like like off-site storage
[5632.08 --> 5637.36]  with so just like an unraid clone like a one button uh you know and they they figure there
[5637.36 --> 5642.56]  is probably it's possible to do it with no need for like proxy or port forwarding or anything like
[5642.56 --> 5646.48]  that but it would have to be a paid service because you would have to at least do handle the port
[5646.48 --> 5651.04]  forwarding through their uh through their server unless you wanted to configure it yourself anyway it's
[5651.04 --> 5655.52]  like very much up in the air i'm trying to convince them to do it cool i think it's important i think
[5655.52 --> 5660.08]  they could get a lot of content creators using their storage if they could allow stuff like that
[5660.08 --> 5664.56]  lioness i think that i don't think anybody understands what you're even talking about
[5665.12 --> 5671.44]  these things he does well i do okay but like content creators you know who are these people
[5672.00 --> 5678.88]  youtubers twitch streamers you what do you have to pay attention oh lordy yeah you just complain when
[5678.88 --> 5683.44]  the server doesn't work okay well this would be an easier way for the server to work all the time okay
[5683.44 --> 5689.44]  see now i get it perfect there we go that's what i was looking for there uh okay last topic for today
[5689.44 --> 5697.20]  this was posted by nicholas fd obama signs the internet over to the united nations what does that
[5697.20 --> 5703.44]  even mean yeah yeah i don't know america to hand off internet in under two months it means america will
[5703.44 --> 5709.12]  be slightly less world police over one fewer thing in what within two months so the department of
[5709.12 --> 5714.16]  commerce is set to hand off american control of the internet over to international authorities in less
[5714.16 --> 5720.48]  than two months they will finalize the transaction effective october 1st the move means the internet
[5720.48 --> 5724.56]  assigned numbers authority will move from u.s control to a global one and the proposal will
[5724.56 --> 5730.16]  significantly increase the power of foreign governments over the internet expand icann's
[5730.16 --> 5735.60]  historical core mission by creating a gateway to content regulations and embolden its leadership to act
[5735.60 --> 5743.36]  without any real accountability senator ted cruz said so yeah i don't know what that is not a fan um
[5743.36 --> 5750.64]  but honestly i i am not savvy enough to know exactly what this means i will say that i'm not that cool
[5750.64 --> 5755.04]  with america being in control of the internet but i'm also not necessarily i don't necessarily think the
[5755.04 --> 5760.08]  un is going to do any better of a job of it so i mean i get that there's aaron is it you said aaron
[5760.08 --> 5766.08]  there's aaron i think a-r-i-n there's whatever it's one of those things that means a bunch of things
[5766.72 --> 5774.32]  um that sort of controls who gets what block yeah right i mean i can do they do that i don't remember
[5774.32 --> 5780.40]  what i think i can is like um uh dns and like maybe someone else's something i think aaron is the
[5780.40 --> 5786.48]  actual ip address is okay whatever it is sorry i'm not an internet this is controlling content as well
[5786.48 --> 5790.48]  no so it wouldn't be in control of content it would be in control of infrastructure and
[5790.48 --> 5796.96]  regulating it that makes sense i guess i guess i guess sure as long as somebody's managing it and
[5796.96 --> 5804.32]  it's not me it's apparently i-a-n-a-n i-n-n not errant so there you go enjoy okay so thank you guys
