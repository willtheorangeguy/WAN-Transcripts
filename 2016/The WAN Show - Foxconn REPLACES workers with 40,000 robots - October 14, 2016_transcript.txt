[0.00 --> 3.96]  Are we live?
[6.30 --> 7.56]  Are we live?
[9.02 --> 10.58]  I think we might be.
[13.04 --> 13.64]  Okay.
[14.26 --> 15.86]  I'm going to wait for the Twitch chat to
[15.86 --> 18.00]  catch up with me a little bit.
[18.66 --> 19.54]  We're going to see.
[19.94 --> 20.88]  We're going to see if it's working.
[21.26 --> 22.46]  You notice this isn't
[22.46 --> 24.80]  the office.
[25.58 --> 27.70]  You can kind of tell this time that it's
[27.70 --> 29.18]  not pre-recorded.
[29.18 --> 31.88]  I know you guys like saying that it's pre-recorded.
[32.20 --> 33.50]  Not this time, my friends.
[33.74 --> 34.44]  Not this time.
[35.24 --> 36.18]  We're at my house.
[37.10 --> 38.28]  I have pneumonia.
[38.82 --> 40.26]  I have a sinus infection.
[40.60 --> 42.44]  And I have a muscle issue with my neck.
[43.36 --> 44.34]  But I'm here.
[45.18 --> 47.42]  Also, you can look it up in the news.
[47.54 --> 49.32]  There's a storm coming through
[49.32 --> 49.78]  BC.
[50.62 --> 53.26]  And that is taking out the power in a ton
[53.26 --> 54.22]  of different places.
[54.92 --> 57.06]  And the power at work is
[58.26 --> 59.14]  not working.
[60.10 --> 60.80]  At all.
[61.74 --> 63.74]  Not going great.
[64.06 --> 65.46]  So, we lost power at work
[65.46 --> 66.66]  hours ago.
[67.00 --> 67.94]  And that was terrible.
[68.52 --> 69.40]  I can see Twitch chat.
[69.44 --> 70.88]  It's easier to monitor Twitch chat
[70.88 --> 71.48]  on my own setup.
[71.70 --> 73.00]  I'll give my setup that.
[73.20 --> 74.48]  It's doing well that way.
[77.68 --> 79.32]  There will probably be coughs
[79.32 --> 80.22]  on this show again.
[80.32 --> 80.68]  Pneumonia.
[80.90 --> 81.30]  So, sorry.
[81.36 --> 82.52]  I'm going to say sorry about that
[82.52 --> 82.94]  already.
[82.94 --> 86.74]  Linus is not going to be with me today.
[86.86 --> 90.84]  I was going to co-host with Nick or Colton or Taryn or something like that.
[91.48 --> 94.34]  But I was diagnosed with pneumonia today.
[94.82 --> 96.24]  And we figured out...
[96.24 --> 97.84]  I didn't know anything about it.
[97.84 --> 98.60]  So, apparently,
[99.20 --> 100.80]  my drugs
[100.80 --> 102.94]  are still
[102.94 --> 105.16]  not going to make me non-contagious
[105.16 --> 107.10]  for another couple days.
[107.30 --> 109.30]  So, I don't want to sit next to someone.
[109.58 --> 110.54]  So, it's just me.
[110.54 --> 112.46]  And we're at my house
[112.46 --> 113.56]  because I don't want to go to
[113.56 --> 114.80]  someone else's house
[114.80 --> 116.76]  and get bacteria everywhere
[116.76 --> 117.44]  and be all gross.
[117.70 --> 118.90]  I was going to go to Nick's place
[118.90 --> 119.90]  because Nick has this, like,
[119.96 --> 120.94]  nice-looking couch
[120.94 --> 121.80]  and this cool, like,
[121.86 --> 123.14]  clock on the wall and stuff
[123.14 --> 124.10]  instead of, like,
[125.24 --> 126.38]  my spare computer
[126.38 --> 127.48]  and my kitchen.
[129.84 --> 131.40]  So, yeah.
[131.66 --> 132.36]  We're here.
[132.76 --> 133.58]  Wancho's happening.
[134.96 --> 135.44]  Topics.
[136.32 --> 136.80]  There's
[136.80 --> 139.84]  the world's largest solar project.
[140.54 --> 141.68]  Samsung is offering
[141.68 --> 142.66]  Note 7 owners
[142.66 --> 143.06]  $100
[143.06 --> 144.54]  when they turn in their phone
[144.54 --> 145.78]  but stay with Samsung.
[146.12 --> 147.02]  I'm sure they're having
[147.02 --> 148.06]  a lot of troubles there.
[148.46 --> 149.32]  Those are the only
[149.32 --> 151.36]  two main news topics we have.
[151.84 --> 153.02]  This is going to be a great week.
[153.28 --> 154.10]  Don't worry about it.
[154.38 --> 155.06]  It's going to be good.
[155.56 --> 157.34]  There's also the Hyperloop One
[157.34 --> 159.04]  and Dubai Future Accelerators.
[159.76 --> 161.16]  They're building a Hyperloop
[161.16 --> 161.96]  for cargo.
[163.08 --> 165.64]  And the LCD transparent side panel
[165.64 --> 166.86]  that you guys saw
[166.86 --> 168.24]  a while ago.
[168.32 --> 169.08]  Actually, no.
[170.54 --> 173.52]  This one is going on
[173.52 --> 175.22]  an NZXT H440.
[175.42 --> 176.00]  It's going to be available
[176.00 --> 176.62]  for pre-order.
[176.88 --> 177.96]  So, no one should buy it.
[178.16 --> 178.72]  And they should wait
[178.72 --> 179.82]  for it to actually come out
[179.82 --> 181.60]  because that's how
[181.60 --> 182.26]  pre-orders work.
[182.46 --> 183.56]  Anyways, roll the intro.
[183.76 --> 184.34]  Hope it works.
[184.34 --> 193.96]  Squarespace.
[205.94 --> 206.70]  Squarespace.
[207.22 --> 207.78]  Squarespace.
[210.06 --> 210.62]  Crashbooks.
[210.62 --> 222.86]  and Mack Weldon which is why I have this super fly shirt on instead of my like usual garb if
[222.86 --> 228.78]  you want to call it that no bugs and on time we were almost on time we were not completely on time
[228.78 --> 234.00]  I was all set up and ready to go but I'm not going to exactly tell you what it is we have this new
[234.00 --> 241.14]  security system so I couldn't actually stream on the Linus Tech account I was able to stream on the
[241.14 --> 247.02]  test account if you guys saw that so it was like it was good we were ready but yeah we were we were a
[247.02 --> 252.84]  few minutes late but pretty close it was pretty good so yeah first one we're going to talk about
[252.84 --> 260.66]  actually no let's take a second and talk about something that happened last week I got called
[260.66 --> 265.04]  out Linus got called out I'm going to address this right here I'm going to post this in the
[265.04 --> 271.62]  comments which is actually someone's reddit comment I know you guys are going to be like what uh what
[271.62 --> 280.16]  um zaga 932 pointed out that we did some pretty shit coverage I mean wait I'm used to being able
[280.16 --> 287.90]  to swear in this area usually on my stream I'm allowed to swear um um um we did some pretty not
[287.90 --> 295.96]  very good coverage of uh um the oculus topic from last week so
[295.96 --> 305.62]  we we basically said that oculus was just like you can use cheaper computers because we want to sell
[305.62 --> 312.16]  more headsets and I am sure that that is still part of the problem or part of what's going on but
[312.16 --> 318.98]  there was actually new software tech that came out called asynchronous space warp so I'm going to play
[318.98 --> 324.38]  this real quick and hope that this works is there anything crazy on screen can I share my screen I
[324.38 --> 332.62]  think so uh okay let's watch new resources AMD has implemented support for a new feature that will
[332.62 --> 341.00]  make VR accessible and enjoyable to more people than ever before it's called asynchronous space warp or ASW
[341.00 --> 347.72]  ASW works by comparing previously rendered frames to detect motion between them and using that
[347.72 --> 353.68]  information to extrapolate the position of scene components in the next frame if you recognize this
[353.68 --> 359.34]  they've kind of done this for other things in other ways AMD has done this kind of stuff before for uh
[359.34 --> 365.34]  movies I believe it was pictures or something reprojected frames to more accurately approximate how
[365.34 --> 371.24]  they would look if they had been fully rendered combined with the existing asynchronous time warp and quick
[371.24 --> 378.02]  response cue features asynchronous space warp helps enable an incredibly smooth and comfortable VR can we
[378.02 --> 383.06]  all talk for for a moment about how monotone this dude's voice is
[383.06 --> 390.78]  experience at a price more accessible than ever before on AMD CPUs and VR capable
[390.78 --> 401.78]  pull out a price more acceptable than ever before on AMD CPUs and AMD capable GPUs anyways um it's it it makes it so
[401.78 --> 411.06]  that you can have a lower frame rate but still get to 90 FPS because of space warp tech kind of filling in the gaps so it
[411.06 --> 416.44]  doesn't feel quite so bad I need to check in with Nick to make sure there isn't like major problems with the stream
[416.44 --> 419.46]  what is going on right now I'm getting so many messages
[419.46 --> 421.46]  oh
[421.46 --> 427.20]  oh no
[427.20 --> 431.84]  I really hope this is recording locally
[431.84 --> 438.22]  I didn't check that part before I went live
[438.22 --> 442.24]  uh
[442.24 --> 444.88]  hold up
[444.88 --> 446.36]  is this gonna kill the stream
[446.36 --> 457.92]  I think we're gonna be restarting the stream now
[457.92 --> 462.26]  okay bye
[462.26 --> 468.32]  oh
[468.32 --> 469.72]  what
[469.72 --> 474.24]  I thought it would carry that setting over but I really don't think it did
[474.24 --> 482.32]  okay
[482.32 --> 485.92]  give me a second let me make sure it's not actually doing this
[485.92 --> 488.00]  I
[488.00 --> 492.72]  it might it might be locally recording that would suck so much
[492.72 --> 494.16]  come on now
[494.16 --> 495.70]  please
[495.70 --> 498.24]  do it for me
[498.24 --> 501.44]  what is this
[501.44 --> 502.68]  it might be
[502.68 --> 508.10]  what is this
[508.10 --> 512.20]  okay no I think we're good
[512.20 --> 513.44]  I think we're good
[513.44 --> 515.02]  I think it's recording
[515.02 --> 516.88]  I think we're fine
[516.88 --> 522.32]  this was created at
[522.32 --> 524.22]  434
[524.22 --> 525.62]  yeah
[525.62 --> 526.94]  yeah
[526.94 --> 528.96]  we're okay
[528.96 --> 531.06]  it's been recording locally the whole time
[531.06 --> 532.60]  nobody needs to freak out
[532.60 --> 533.84]  one problem though
[533.84 --> 535.94]  is I didn't film
[535.94 --> 538.24]  a YouTube intro thing
[538.24 --> 541.20]  um
[541.20 --> 546.78]  I literally just lost internet though
[546.78 --> 547.30]  oh
[547.30 --> 548.36]  Nick doesn't have internet
[548.36 --> 550.42]  it's a mess
[550.42 --> 551.92]  everything's a mess
[551.92 --> 553.12]  don't worry about it
[553.12 --> 554.16]  we're gonna continue the show
[554.16 --> 554.72]  anyways
[554.72 --> 556.60]  sorry about the asynchronous time warp thing
[556.60 --> 559.06]  if you guys are interested in that tech
[559.06 --> 560.98]  I don't want to go like way too far into it
[560.98 --> 563.04]  but we did screw up our coverage last week
[563.04 --> 565.94]  check out that reddit thread that I posted in the chat
[565.94 --> 568.60]  and if you missed that earlier
[568.60 --> 569.68]  check out the archive
[569.68 --> 572.70]  the thread link should be there with a time stamp
[572.70 --> 574.30]  and you guys can check that out
[574.30 --> 574.80]  he
[574.80 --> 576.12]  Zaga posted
[576.12 --> 578.92]  a ton of information
[578.92 --> 580.28]  if you want to see how it works
[580.28 --> 581.02]  and blah blah blah blah blah
[581.02 --> 583.28]  and it's all very well laid out there
[583.28 --> 584.34]  so please
[584.34 --> 585.86]  check that out
[585.86 --> 587.30]  should be easy to do
[587.30 --> 587.98]  um
[587.98 --> 589.62]  next topic
[589.62 --> 591.34]  first actual topic
[591.34 --> 592.12]  I guess
[592.12 --> 593.76]  we will check out
[593.76 --> 595.98]  the world's largest solar project
[595.98 --> 598.36]  it's apparently going to generate electricity
[598.36 --> 599.78]  24 hours a day
[599.78 --> 600.64]  which is pretty interesting
[600.64 --> 603.02]  it will power 1 million US homes
[603.02 --> 603.92]  which I believe
[603.92 --> 604.96]  is comparable
[604.96 --> 607.76]  to a nuclear power plant
[607.76 --> 608.56]  which is actually
[608.56 --> 609.76]  pretty freaking wicked
[609.76 --> 611.36]  um
[611.36 --> 614.02]  let's see here
[614.02 --> 614.54]  give me one second
[614.54 --> 615.78]  if you guys want to see it
[615.78 --> 618.18]  check this thing out
[618.18 --> 619.66]  that is ginormous
[619.66 --> 622.90]  110 megawatt
[622.90 --> 624.02]  I believe that says
[624.02 --> 625.64]  oh no
[625.64 --> 626.56]  holy crap
[626.56 --> 627.40]  I don't know why it says
[627.40 --> 628.84]  the 110 MW
[628.84 --> 631.26]  when it says
[631.26 --> 632.30]  it would generate between
[632.30 --> 633.12]  100
[633.12 --> 636.14]  1,500 and 2,000 megawatts
[636.14 --> 636.74]  of power
[636.74 --> 637.88]  enough to power
[637.88 --> 639.44]  about 1 million homes
[639.44 --> 641.08]  that amount of power
[641.08 --> 643.16]  is as much as a nuclear power plant
[643.16 --> 644.84]  or the 2,000 megawatt
[644.84 --> 645.70]  Hoover Dam
[645.70 --> 647.62]  so they're trying to compare
[647.62 --> 648.70]  to the Hoover Dam
[648.70 --> 651.22]  looking at how legendary
[651.22 --> 652.94]  the Hoover freaking Dam is
[652.94 --> 653.68]  that's pretty cool
[653.68 --> 654.98]  when it's a solar power plant
[654.98 --> 657.44]  looks like they found
[657.44 --> 658.42]  somewhere pretty flat
[658.42 --> 659.86]  out in a desert-y kind of area
[659.86 --> 660.98]  and they're going with
[660.98 --> 661.90]  a spiral
[661.90 --> 662.92]  kind of deal
[662.92 --> 664.60]  it looks really cool
[664.60 --> 668.84]  that's quite awesome
[668.84 --> 670.30]  5 billion dollars
[670.30 --> 671.84]  sandstone project
[671.84 --> 673.86]  very awesome
[673.86 --> 677.44]  100,000 mirrored
[677.44 --> 678.84]  heliostats
[678.84 --> 680.50]  captures the sun rays
[680.50 --> 681.26]  and concentrates it
[681.26 --> 682.24]  into 10 towers
[682.24 --> 683.28]  equipped with a
[683.28 --> 684.10]  molten salt
[684.10 --> 685.90]  energy storage system
[685.90 --> 687.04]  the molten salt
[687.04 --> 688.00]  heated to more than
[688.00 --> 689.28]  1,000 degrees
[689.28 --> 690.28]  then boils water
[690.28 --> 691.84]  and creates a steam turbine
[691.84 --> 693.48]  that can drive generators
[693.48 --> 695.14]  24-7
[695.14 --> 696.18]  that actually makes
[696.18 --> 696.92]  tons of sense
[696.92 --> 698.08]  I get that
[698.08 --> 699.14]  at first I was like
[699.14 --> 700.02]  okay
[700.02 --> 701.40]  it's solar
[701.40 --> 703.32]  how are you generating power
[703.32 --> 704.50]  24 hours a day
[704.50 --> 705.20]  I'm confused
[705.20 --> 706.40]  but now I
[706.40 --> 707.36]  sort of get it
[707.36 --> 707.78]  so yeah
[707.78 --> 709.64]  5 billion dollars
[709.64 --> 710.32]  pretty expensive
[710.32 --> 711.64]  construction probably won't begin
[711.64 --> 713.22]  for another 2 or 3 years
[713.22 --> 714.92]  so I guess that's a concept picture
[714.92 --> 716.40]  once construction begins
[716.40 --> 717.62]  Smith estimated the project
[717.62 --> 718.50]  would create about
[718.50 --> 719.94]  3,000 jobs
[719.94 --> 721.52]  for about 7 years
[721.52 --> 722.44]  so once it's up
[722.44 --> 724.56]  there probably won't be
[724.56 --> 725.90]  nearly 3,000 people
[725.90 --> 726.70]  working on it
[726.70 --> 728.64]  but 3,000 construction jobs
[728.64 --> 729.58]  for it to go up
[729.58 --> 730.34]  for a little while
[730.34 --> 732.62]  would be great
[732.62 --> 733.18]  yes
[733.18 --> 735.04]  I'm getting confused
[735.04 --> 736.12]  because now I can
[736.12 --> 737.60]  actively always see chat
[737.60 --> 738.32]  and that's not how
[738.32 --> 739.36]  it usually goes
[739.36 --> 740.54]  on Wanshow
[740.54 --> 741.52]  and there's so many
[741.52 --> 742.40]  freaking trolls
[742.40 --> 743.50]  like someone just
[743.50 --> 744.84]  said stream down
[744.84 --> 745.84]  in all capital letters
[745.84 --> 746.36]  and I was like
[746.36 --> 747.62]  oh no
[747.62 --> 749.38]  what did I do wrong
[749.38 --> 750.70]  but then other people
[750.70 --> 752.02]  are actively talking
[752.02 --> 753.62]  about what I'm talking about
[753.62 --> 756.38]  so I guess it's fine
[756.38 --> 758.82]  okay so that picture
[758.82 --> 759.74]  is of an existing
[759.74 --> 761.26]  10 times smaller installation
[761.26 --> 761.76]  so it's going to be
[761.76 --> 762.50]  10 times bigger
[762.50 --> 763.50]  than that picture was
[763.50 --> 764.46]  that's pretty awesome
[764.46 --> 766.48]  the company will also
[766.48 --> 767.28]  have to build
[767.28 --> 768.30]  a new transmission
[768.30 --> 768.86]  infrastructure
[768.86 --> 769.86]  to carry the energy
[769.86 --> 770.28]  to market
[770.28 --> 771.58]  which kind of makes sense
[771.58 --> 773.36]  and the generated power
[773.36 --> 775.24]  will likely be exported
[775.24 --> 776.78]  to the California market
[776.78 --> 779.48]  which also kind of makes sense
[779.48 --> 780.32]  not too surprising
[780.32 --> 782.00]  two potential sites
[782.00 --> 783.00]  on federal land
[783.00 --> 783.92]  in Nye County
[783.92 --> 785.06]  have been shortlisted
[785.06 --> 786.50]  and some environmentalists
[786.50 --> 787.18]  are concerned
[787.18 --> 788.74]  about the environmental impact
[788.74 --> 790.08]  of such a project
[790.08 --> 791.88]  I imagine it would be
[791.88 --> 793.08]  possibly relatively hard
[793.08 --> 793.78]  for things to grow
[793.78 --> 794.66]  under the solar panels
[794.66 --> 795.16]  yada yada
[795.16 --> 796.16]  but if you're going out
[796.16 --> 796.94]  in the middle of the desert
[796.94 --> 799.28]  at the same time
[799.28 --> 800.32]  environmentalists
[800.32 --> 801.28]  being more worried
[801.28 --> 803.00]  about the environmental impact
[803.00 --> 804.34]  of a solar plant
[804.34 --> 806.30]  compared to a nuclear plant
[806.30 --> 808.16]  is something new
[808.16 --> 809.84]  as far as I know
[809.84 --> 813.54]  kind of thought
[813.54 --> 814.34]  kind of thought
[814.34 --> 815.30]  that wasn't too much
[815.30 --> 815.80]  of a thing
[815.80 --> 817.42]  not entirely sure
[817.42 --> 818.56]  but yeah
[818.56 --> 819.56]  clicking noise
[819.56 --> 820.54]  that's my chair
[820.54 --> 821.22]  I'm sorry
[821.22 --> 822.40]  look how broken my chair is
[822.40 --> 823.14]  if I just lean
[823.14 --> 823.72]  watch
[823.72 --> 824.90]  you can see the tops
[824.90 --> 825.36]  of my chair
[825.36 --> 826.00]  if I just lean
[826.00 --> 827.84]  the chair just goes with me
[827.84 --> 829.14]  it's not supposed to
[829.14 --> 830.06]  that's not a feature
[830.06 --> 830.78]  it's broken
[830.78 --> 832.18]  it's
[832.18 --> 833.54]  I have a terrible chair
[833.54 --> 835.12]  I'm working on it
[835.12 --> 836.42]  I'm trying to pick a new one
[836.42 --> 837.88]  but buying an actually
[837.88 --> 839.06]  ergonomic chair
[839.06 --> 839.88]  is actually somewhat
[839.88 --> 840.52]  of a problem
[840.52 --> 841.60]  anyways
[841.60 --> 843.08]  Note 7 owners
[843.08 --> 844.50]  Samsung to Note 7 owners
[844.50 --> 846.42]  here's $100 for your phone
[846.42 --> 848.38]  this is a CNET article
[848.38 --> 849.40]  let me open it up here
[849.40 --> 849.94]  really quick
[849.94 --> 853.88]  so they're saying
[853.88 --> 854.88]  that Samsung will give you
[854.88 --> 855.78]  $100 credit
[855.78 --> 856.88]  at carrier
[856.88 --> 858.24]  or retail outlets
[858.24 --> 859.68]  who turn in their Note 7
[859.68 --> 860.92]  but actually get
[860.92 --> 862.30]  another Samsung phone
[862.30 --> 862.84]  I think
[862.84 --> 863.86]  the big problem
[863.86 --> 864.90]  that Samsung is happening
[864.90 --> 865.40]  right now
[865.40 --> 868.24]  no
[868.24 --> 872.20]  no autoplay audio ad CNET
[872.20 --> 872.92]  that is rude
[872.92 --> 874.32]  I don't have
[874.32 --> 875.26]  adblock on
[875.26 --> 875.96]  because I'm trying to be
[875.96 --> 876.76]  a nice person
[876.76 --> 878.06]  and you're being a jerk
[878.06 --> 879.40]  anyways
[879.40 --> 880.42]  back to CNET
[880.42 --> 883.20]  so yeah
[883.20 --> 884.12]  I think they're having
[884.12 --> 884.80]  problems with people
[884.80 --> 885.94]  buying like
[885.94 --> 886.98]  Apple phones
[886.98 --> 888.34]  or whatever else
[888.34 --> 889.94]  after turning in
[889.94 --> 890.64]  their Note 7
[890.64 --> 891.92]  and
[891.92 --> 894.24]  so they're trying
[894.24 --> 894.68]  to give people
[894.68 --> 894.94]  $100
[894.94 --> 896.36]  I believe before
[896.36 --> 897.08]  they were giving people
[897.08 --> 897.74]  $25
[897.74 --> 899.72]  the title of this article
[899.72 --> 902.60]  oh
[902.60 --> 903.20]  see
[903.20 --> 904.24]  in the doc
[904.24 --> 905.16]  it says
[905.16 --> 906.92]  Samsung to Note 7 owners
[906.92 --> 907.58]  here's $100
[907.58 --> 908.80]  for your phone
[908.80 --> 910.64]  and then the title here
[910.64 --> 911.98]  is Samsung to Note 7 owners
[911.98 --> 913.60]  here's an extra $100
[913.60 --> 914.54]  for your phone
[914.54 --> 916.58]  that's a huge difference
[916.58 --> 917.80]  I don't know
[917.80 --> 919.54]  if that was a copying
[919.54 --> 920.38]  problem or something
[920.38 --> 921.86]  but that's a huge difference
[921.86 --> 922.64]  when I first read
[922.64 --> 923.64]  the title of this article
[923.64 --> 924.92]  before reading the notes
[924.92 --> 925.30]  I was like
[925.30 --> 927.96]  what?
[928.34 --> 929.40]  because I was pretty sure
[929.40 --> 930.56]  that Samsung was trying
[930.56 --> 931.58]  to buy back
[931.58 --> 932.26]  their users
[932.26 --> 933.20]  and trying to buy back
[933.20 --> 934.02]  confidence and stuff
[934.02 --> 934.36]  so I was like
[934.36 --> 934.98]  why would they be
[934.98 --> 935.70]  cheaping the shit
[935.70 --> 936.16]  out of people
[936.16 --> 937.32]  they are not
[937.32 --> 938.42]  what they're trying to do
[938.42 --> 938.98]  is if you
[938.98 --> 940.06]  turn in your Note 7
[940.06 --> 940.98]  but still decide
[940.98 --> 942.06]  to stay with Samsung
[942.06 --> 943.34]  they're trying to give you
[943.34 --> 944.28]  an extra $100
[944.28 --> 945.96]  so that it can help
[945.96 --> 947.46]  incentivize that whole thing
[947.46 --> 948.64]  not super surprising
[948.64 --> 950.12]  so they're saying
[950.12 --> 951.04]  that the offer comes
[951.04 --> 952.02]  after Samsung
[952.02 --> 953.24]  and the US Consumer
[953.24 --> 954.38]  Product Safety Commission
[954.38 --> 955.12]  once again
[955.12 --> 955.82]  issued a recall
[955.82 --> 956.52]  for the Note 7
[956.52 --> 957.18]  because it was
[957.18 --> 958.14]  blowing up again
[958.14 --> 963.20]  sorry for the coughing
[963.20 --> 963.66]  for the people
[963.66 --> 964.28]  that didn't notice
[964.28 --> 965.80]  or weren't here
[965.80 --> 966.24]  from the beginning
[966.24 --> 967.24]  sorry I have pneumonia
[967.24 --> 967.96]  so there will be
[967.96 --> 968.90]  some coughing today
[968.90 --> 973.08]  the replacement units
[973.08 --> 973.66]  for the Note 7
[973.66 --> 975.40]  were recalled as well
[975.40 --> 976.76]  so that was
[976.76 --> 977.52]  kind of a problem
[977.52 --> 979.66]  Samsung confirmed
[979.66 --> 980.58]  that it had killed
[980.58 --> 983.20]  off half of the Note 7
[983.20 --> 984.04]  and warned consumers
[984.04 --> 984.66]  to power down
[984.66 --> 985.48]  and turn off their phones
[985.48 --> 986.44]  brutal
[986.44 --> 987.32]  I guess they
[987.32 --> 988.10]  okay so they had
[988.10 --> 988.98]  remotely killed off
[988.98 --> 989.62]  that makes sense
[989.62 --> 990.38]  it's kind of scary
[990.38 --> 991.14]  that they have that
[991.14 --> 991.82]  possibility
[991.82 --> 994.72]  when they were open
[994.72 --> 995.44]  about the fact
[995.44 --> 995.90]  that they could
[995.90 --> 996.78]  nerf your battery
[996.78 --> 997.28]  remotely
[997.28 --> 999.24]  that I found
[999.24 --> 999.68]  interesting
[999.68 --> 1001.28]  when Samsung
[1001.28 --> 1002.50]  was talking about
[1002.50 --> 1004.48]  how they would
[1004.48 --> 1005.52]  nerf people's battery
[1005.52 --> 1006.16]  down to like
[1006.16 --> 1006.94]  I think it was
[1006.94 --> 1008.44]  65% of its total
[1008.44 --> 1009.34]  actual capacity
[1009.34 --> 1010.32]  or something like that
[1010.32 --> 1011.28]  Steam notifications
[1011.28 --> 1012.40]  oh man
[1012.40 --> 1014.64]  I can't fix that
[1014.64 --> 1018.74]  wait I have a solution
[1018.74 --> 1021.28]  boop
[1021.28 --> 1024.32]  there
[1024.32 --> 1026.82]  problem solved
[1026.82 --> 1028.02]  now no one can
[1028.02 --> 1029.38]  control me that way
[1029.38 --> 1030.42]  okay
[1030.42 --> 1031.18]  anyways
[1031.18 --> 1034.08]  this isn't super
[1034.08 --> 1034.78]  surprising
[1034.78 --> 1036.98]  I think it's
[1036.98 --> 1037.44]  it's
[1037.44 --> 1039.12]  nice
[1039.12 --> 1044.42]  yeah
[1044.42 --> 1045.40]  people
[1045.40 --> 1046.36]  customers that opt
[1046.36 --> 1047.58]  for a full refund
[1047.58 --> 1048.36]  and I think
[1048.36 --> 1050.66]  decide to go
[1050.66 --> 1051.62]  to another brand
[1051.62 --> 1051.90]  yeah
[1051.90 --> 1052.82]  like customers
[1052.82 --> 1053.48]  who switch to
[1053.48 --> 1054.10]  another brand
[1054.10 --> 1055.34]  they still get
[1055.34 --> 1056.06]  the $25
[1056.06 --> 1056.78]  that was
[1056.78 --> 1057.72]  originally offered
[1057.72 --> 1059.08]  so if you decide
[1059.08 --> 1059.64]  to stick
[1059.64 --> 1061.02]  with Samsung
[1061.02 --> 1062.16]  I believe
[1062.16 --> 1062.80]  you get an
[1062.80 --> 1063.66]  extra $75
[1063.66 --> 1064.52]  so you get a
[1064.52 --> 1065.52]  total of $100
[1065.52 --> 1066.86]  but if you
[1066.86 --> 1068.02]  refund your phone
[1068.02 --> 1068.94]  and go with
[1068.94 --> 1069.28]  anybody
[1069.28 --> 1070.54]  you still get
[1070.54 --> 1071.32]  an extra $25
[1071.32 --> 1073.00]  I think that's
[1073.00 --> 1074.36]  kind of cool
[1074.36 --> 1076.28]  I know everyone
[1076.28 --> 1077.16]  got sort of
[1077.16 --> 1078.00]  dicked over
[1078.00 --> 1079.74]  I gotta watch
[1079.74 --> 1080.30]  my language
[1080.30 --> 1080.94]  I'm used to being
[1080.94 --> 1081.48]  able to like
[1081.48 --> 1082.92]  run my mouth a little
[1082.92 --> 1083.56]  bit when I'm at
[1083.56 --> 1084.22]  home but no
[1084.22 --> 1084.72]  this is the
[1084.72 --> 1085.20]  WAN show
[1085.20 --> 1085.94]  come on now
[1085.94 --> 1087.54]  but yeah
[1087.54 --> 1088.08]  it's
[1088.08 --> 1089.10]  you did get a
[1089.10 --> 1089.32]  little bit
[1089.32 --> 1089.78]  screwed over
[1089.78 --> 1090.30]  you had to
[1090.30 --> 1090.84]  return your
[1090.84 --> 1091.14]  phone
[1091.14 --> 1091.66]  you had this
[1091.66 --> 1092.20]  phone that
[1092.20 --> 1092.80]  was gonna
[1092.80 --> 1093.76]  possibly try
[1093.76 --> 1094.50]  to kill you
[1094.50 --> 1095.54]  and whatever
[1095.54 --> 1096.06]  whatever
[1096.06 --> 1098.60]  but
[1098.60 --> 1101.64]  I don't know
[1101.64 --> 1102.02]  they're trying to
[1102.02 --> 1102.46]  do something
[1102.46 --> 1103.34]  I just can't
[1103.34 --> 1103.96]  imagine them
[1103.96 --> 1105.10]  giving that
[1105.10 --> 1105.68]  much money
[1105.68 --> 1106.34]  back to
[1106.34 --> 1106.98]  every single
[1106.98 --> 1107.26]  person
[1107.26 --> 1107.70]  if they were
[1107.70 --> 1108.10]  trying to do
[1108.10 --> 1108.64]  like $100
[1108.64 --> 1109.40]  to everyone
[1109.40 --> 1109.88]  that was even
[1109.88 --> 1110.40]  jumping ship
[1110.40 --> 1110.86]  to Apple
[1110.86 --> 1111.72]  that seems
[1111.72 --> 1113.00]  like a huge
[1113.00 --> 1113.84]  hit to them
[1113.84 --> 1116.98]  I'm not sure
[1116.98 --> 1118.34]  we will see
[1118.34 --> 1118.92]  I keep on
[1118.92 --> 1119.50]  getting distracted
[1119.50 --> 1120.48]  by the
[1120.48 --> 1121.30]  WAN chat
[1121.30 --> 1121.84]  usually when I'm
[1121.84 --> 1122.46]  at this computer
[1122.46 --> 1123.10]  the chat isn't
[1123.10 --> 1124.10]  going this quickly
[1124.10 --> 1124.96]  because it's
[1124.96 --> 1125.82]  my little show
[1125.82 --> 1126.74]  anyways
[1126.74 --> 1128.14]  there isn't a ton
[1128.14 --> 1129.20]  to say for either
[1129.20 --> 1129.82]  of these topics
[1129.82 --> 1130.58]  and we're already
[1130.58 --> 1131.54]  into rapid fire
[1131.54 --> 1132.52]  I think that's
[1132.52 --> 1133.44]  the fastest I've
[1133.44 --> 1134.24]  ever gotten into
[1134.24 --> 1134.80]  rapid fire
[1134.80 --> 1135.26]  because there was
[1135.26 --> 1136.08]  only two main
[1136.08 --> 1137.34]  topics and both
[1137.34 --> 1138.16]  of them were
[1138.16 --> 1139.18]  extremely short
[1139.18 --> 1139.90]  for the people
[1139.90 --> 1140.80]  that just tuned
[1140.80 --> 1141.14]  in
[1141.14 --> 1142.80]  no this is not
[1142.80 --> 1143.22]  LTT
[1143.22 --> 1144.88]  there is a huge
[1144.88 --> 1146.80]  like monumental
[1146.80 --> 1148.10]  storm running
[1148.10 --> 1149.06]  through BC right
[1149.06 --> 1149.32]  now
[1149.32 --> 1150.56]  you can look it
[1150.56 --> 1151.50]  up on the news
[1151.50 --> 1152.54]  it's a big deal
[1152.54 --> 1154.72]  and the power
[1154.72 --> 1155.30]  at the office
[1155.30 --> 1156.60]  is gone
[1156.60 --> 1157.34]  so we had to
[1157.34 --> 1157.98]  stream somewhere
[1157.98 --> 1159.22]  I have pneumonia
[1159.22 --> 1159.88]  and a sinus
[1159.88 --> 1160.70]  infection and like
[1160.70 --> 1161.60]  a few other things
[1161.60 --> 1162.48]  my body's going
[1162.48 --> 1163.46]  cray cray right now
[1163.46 --> 1164.70]  so I'm infectious
[1164.70 --> 1165.82]  so I can't be
[1165.82 --> 1166.64]  near other people
[1166.64 --> 1167.56]  so I couldn't
[1167.56 --> 1168.26]  stream with other
[1168.26 --> 1168.72]  people
[1168.72 --> 1169.68]  the plan was
[1169.68 --> 1170.30]  originally that
[1170.30 --> 1170.56]  we were going
[1170.56 --> 1171.02]  to stream from
[1171.02 --> 1171.54]  Nick's house
[1171.54 --> 1172.02]  because he has
[1172.02 --> 1172.60]  like a nice
[1172.60 --> 1173.80]  looking background
[1173.80 --> 1174.38]  and stuff like
[1174.38 --> 1174.84]  that mine's
[1174.84 --> 1175.54]  kind of junky
[1175.54 --> 1176.58]  anyways whatever
[1176.58 --> 1177.40]  um
[1177.40 --> 1179.74]  and so
[1179.74 --> 1181.68]  then I got
[1181.68 --> 1182.38]  diagnosed and
[1182.38 --> 1182.68]  we were like
[1182.68 --> 1183.46]  okay it's probably
[1183.46 --> 1184.22]  not a good idea
[1184.22 --> 1185.28]  so now I'm
[1185.28 --> 1185.76]  streaming from
[1185.76 --> 1186.00]  home
[1186.00 --> 1187.44]  this is actually
[1187.44 --> 1187.98]  where I normally
[1187.98 --> 1188.62]  stream from
[1188.62 --> 1189.52]  but I don't
[1189.52 --> 1190.04]  normally stream
[1190.04 --> 1190.74]  with my camera
[1190.74 --> 1192.08]  this big
[1192.08 --> 1193.12]  people can't
[1193.12 --> 1193.82]  normally see
[1193.82 --> 1194.68]  like that it's
[1194.68 --> 1195.52]  a random spare
[1195.52 --> 1196.24]  computer set up
[1196.24 --> 1196.86]  in like my
[1196.86 --> 1197.14]  kitchen
[1197.14 --> 1200.28]  anyways
[1200.28 --> 1201.40]  um yeah
[1201.40 --> 1202.30]  so we're here
[1202.30 --> 1202.86]  nah
[1202.86 --> 1203.48]  land show's
[1203.48 --> 1204.04]  still happening
[1204.04 --> 1204.74]  yeah
[1204.74 --> 1205.96]  share it
[1205.96 --> 1206.58]  get lots of
[1206.58 --> 1206.92]  views
[1206.92 --> 1208.04]  anyways
[1208.04 --> 1208.98]  moving on
[1208.98 --> 1209.42]  uh
[1209.42 --> 1210.30]  hyperloop one
[1210.30 --> 1210.96]  and dubai
[1210.96 --> 1212.00]  future accelerators
[1212.00 --> 1212.66]  will build the
[1212.66 --> 1213.90]  first hyperloop
[1213.90 --> 1214.66]  for cargo
[1214.66 --> 1216.22]  let's actually
[1216.22 --> 1217.16]  use just
[1217.16 --> 1218.68]  the tech crunch
[1218.68 --> 1219.56]  article here
[1219.56 --> 1220.12]  so I'll post
[1220.12 --> 1220.70]  that in
[1220.70 --> 1221.28]  chat
[1221.28 --> 1226.34]  give me one
[1226.34 --> 1226.76]  second I want
[1226.76 --> 1227.10]  to clean up
[1227.10 --> 1227.54]  these tabs
[1227.54 --> 1228.70]  it is a little
[1228.70 --> 1229.26]  annoying doing
[1229.26 --> 1229.86]  land show by
[1229.86 --> 1230.44]  yourself because
[1230.44 --> 1231.32]  there's just so
[1231.32 --> 1232.78]  many little extra
[1232.78 --> 1234.04]  things to do
[1234.04 --> 1234.86]  anyways
[1234.86 --> 1236.28]  uh dubai future
[1236.28 --> 1237.00]  accelerators has
[1237.00 --> 1238.64]  created uh has
[1238.64 --> 1239.44]  been created by
[1239.44 --> 1241.64]  the uae alongside
[1241.64 --> 1242.60]  seven government
[1242.60 --> 1243.48]  entities committing
[1243.48 --> 1245.12]  to piloting
[1245.12 --> 1246.34]  cutting edge
[1246.34 --> 1247.32]  technologies for the
[1247.32 --> 1249.10]  country dfa is an
[1249.10 --> 1250.78]  initiative of the
[1250.78 --> 1251.40]  dubai future
[1251.40 --> 1252.40]  foundation and part
[1252.40 --> 1253.00]  of the federal
[1253.00 --> 1254.42]  endowment fund
[1254.42 --> 1256.34]  worth 275 million
[1256.34 --> 1257.12]  dollars it's
[1257.12 --> 1258.24]  designed to invest
[1258.24 --> 1259.34]  in innovation which
[1259.34 --> 1260.02]  will shape the
[1260.02 --> 1261.06]  future of the
[1261.06 --> 1262.08]  uae's industrial
[1262.08 --> 1263.00]  sectors including
[1263.00 --> 1264.02]  transportation so
[1264.02 --> 1264.50]  they're trying to
[1264.50 --> 1265.66]  move cargo that's
[1265.66 --> 1266.00]  where it makes
[1266.00 --> 1266.80]  sense there will
[1266.80 --> 1267.50]  be a 12-week
[1267.50 --> 1268.70]  program which has
[1268.70 --> 1269.94]  taken over 2,000
[1269.94 --> 1270.74]  applications from
[1270.74 --> 1272.46]  73 countries less
[1272.46 --> 1273.36]  than one percent of
[1273.36 --> 1274.12]  the applications were
[1274.12 --> 1275.50]  selected over 30
[1275.50 --> 1276.42]  companies have been
[1276.42 --> 1277.32]  selected to take part
[1277.32 --> 1278.32]  of the program and
[1278.32 --> 1278.94]  this includes
[1278.94 --> 1280.62]  the hyperloop one
[1280.62 --> 1281.50]  so there's a video
[1281.50 --> 1282.48]  of the hyperloop one
[1282.48 --> 1284.82]  dubai which we are
[1284.82 --> 1286.00]  going to watch here
[1286.00 --> 1287.18]  give me one second
[1287.18 --> 1289.66]  here we go
[1289.66 --> 1290.80]  we're on our way to
[1290.80 --> 1292.14]  dubai where we're
[1292.14 --> 1292.98]  going to have our
[1292.98 --> 1295.02]  first residency for
[1295.02 --> 1296.02]  installing hyperloop
[1296.02 --> 1299.60]  stop getting a
[1299.60 --> 1300.34]  hyperloop is going to
[1300.34 --> 1300.70]  be there
[1300.70 --> 1307.50]  when you have the
[1307.50 --> 1308.20]  best team in the
[1308.20 --> 1309.62]  world and a badass
[1309.62 --> 1311.48]  product you just
[1311.48 --> 1311.98]  know it's going to
[1311.98 --> 1312.28]  happen
[1312.28 --> 1316.68]  this is the war room
[1316.68 --> 1328.82]  what is this is the war
[1328.82 --> 1330.48]  room hold up come on

[1361.86 --> 1363.50]  anyways I don't have adblock
[1363.50 --> 1363.84]  on here
[1363.84 --> 1365.48]  so whatever yo

[1394.52 --> 1399.28]  god I am so sorry that I
[1399.28 --> 1400.38]  showed you guys that video
[1400.38 --> 1403.34]  I am so sorry that I
[1403.34 --> 1404.20]  played that on stream
[1404.20 --> 1406.66]  because that was literally
[1406.66 --> 1408.00]  100% useless
[1408.00 --> 1410.94]  I just wasted one minute
[1410.94 --> 1413.22]  and one second plus the
[1413.22 --> 1414.10]  amount of time that I made
[1414.10 --> 1415.04]  fun of the room that they
[1415.04 --> 1416.94]  were in of all of your
[1416.94 --> 1418.68]  lives because that was
[1418.68 --> 1420.52]  literally completely useless
[1420.52 --> 1422.62]  I apologize
[1422.62 --> 1424.56]  moving on
[1424.56 --> 1426.46]  I have nothing more to say
[1426.46 --> 1426.96]  about that
[1426.96 --> 1428.36]  because my notes were done
[1428.36 --> 1429.66]  and that video was
[1429.66 --> 1430.86]  completely useless
[1430.86 --> 1432.14]  so we're going to move on
[1432.14 --> 1433.68]  to the LCD transparent
[1433.68 --> 1434.36]  side panel
[1434.36 --> 1435.54]  that is now available
[1435.54 --> 1436.42]  for pre-order
[1436.42 --> 1438.06]  which none of you should do
[1438.06 --> 1440.28]  because pre-orders are dumb
[1440.28 --> 1441.46]  but
[1441.46 --> 1443.74]  oh
[1443.74 --> 1445.20]  that's loud
[1445.20 --> 1447.12]  please don't auto-play music
[1447.12 --> 1447.72]  on your website
[1447.72 --> 1450.00]  that makes me want to
[1450.00 --> 1451.26]  suggest not pre-ordering
[1451.26 --> 1451.76]  even more
[1451.76 --> 1452.62]  but there you go
[1452.62 --> 1453.40]  there's the link
[1453.40 --> 1454.86]  to I believe
[1454.86 --> 1456.54]  Frostwolf
[1456.54 --> 1459.40]  let me share my screen
[1459.40 --> 1460.18]  here for a second
[1460.18 --> 1463.02]  there we go
[1463.02 --> 1465.34]  Frostwolf Gaming Series
[1465.34 --> 1467.68]  it's gaming 100%
[1467.68 --> 1469.16]  if you guys could read that
[1469.16 --> 1469.42]  bit
[1469.42 --> 1470.60]  it's pretty small text
[1470.60 --> 1472.42]  and it's light gray
[1472.42 --> 1473.66]  on a white background
[1473.66 --> 1476.08]  multitasking 100%
[1476.08 --> 1476.64]  rendering
[1476.64 --> 1478.92]  95%
[1478.92 --> 1480.48]  oh yeah
[1480.48 --> 1483.70]  yay
[1483.70 --> 1486.00]  now I've been thinking
[1486.00 --> 1487.08]  about doing a
[1487.08 --> 1487.82]  like how to do
[1487.82 --> 1488.38]  one of these
[1488.38 --> 1489.46]  on your own
[1489.46 --> 1490.96]  kind of videos
[1490.96 --> 1491.88]  for a while
[1491.88 --> 1492.66]  would you guys be
[1492.66 --> 1493.48]  interested in that
[1493.48 --> 1495.08]  a lot of my DIY videos
[1495.08 --> 1496.82]  don't get a ton of views
[1496.82 --> 1498.06]  let's do it
[1498.06 --> 1499.54]  oh we can do a straw poll
[1499.54 --> 1500.18]  okay
[1500.18 --> 1500.92]  give me a second
[1500.92 --> 1503.52]  straw poll
[1503.52 --> 1504.72]  dot me
[1504.72 --> 1509.12]  make a DIY
[1509.12 --> 1511.28]  transparent
[1511.28 --> 1513.68]  lcd
[1513.68 --> 1515.52]  side panel video
[1515.52 --> 1516.94]  yes
[1516.94 --> 1517.96]  no
[1517.96 --> 1520.50]  internet
[1520.50 --> 1521.14]  drop
[1521.14 --> 1526.88]  improve spam prevention
[1526.88 --> 1527.62]  sure
[1527.62 --> 1528.56]  let's do that
[1528.56 --> 1529.48]  that sounds fun
[1529.48 --> 1531.30]  alright guys
[1531.30 --> 1532.64]  vote
[1532.64 --> 1534.72]  so like it looks
[1534.72 --> 1535.66]  really sick
[1535.66 --> 1536.92]  and the case
[1536.92 --> 1537.54]  they're showing it off
[1537.54 --> 1538.42]  here is the
[1538.42 --> 1539.82]  h440 I believe
[1539.82 --> 1540.52]  from NZXT
[1540.52 --> 1541.60]  it looks
[1541.60 --> 1542.40]  I think it looks
[1542.40 --> 1543.00]  very cool
[1543.00 --> 1544.10]  I know my keyboard
[1544.10 --> 1544.98]  is super freaking
[1544.98 --> 1545.50]  loud
[1545.50 --> 1546.82]  I am sorry
[1546.82 --> 1547.88]  um
[1547.88 --> 1549.30]  these are
[1549.30 --> 1550.46]  cherry mx blues
[1550.46 --> 1551.68]  this is the keyboard
[1551.68 --> 1552.68]  that I talked about
[1552.68 --> 1553.28]  in the video
[1553.28 --> 1554.32]  when I was like
[1554.32 --> 1555.36]  it's got some
[1555.36 --> 1556.20]  weight to it
[1556.20 --> 1557.32]  that is this keyboard
[1557.32 --> 1558.06]  right here
[1558.06 --> 1559.16]  that this is also
[1559.16 --> 1559.86]  the keyboard that I
[1559.86 --> 1560.28]  repaired
[1560.28 --> 1561.40]  this is also the
[1561.40 --> 1562.04]  keyboard that showed
[1562.04 --> 1562.88]  up in my mineral oil
[1562.88 --> 1563.14]  video
[1563.14 --> 1564.34]  this is the keyboard
[1564.34 --> 1564.90]  that shows up
[1564.90 --> 1565.28]  everywhere
[1565.28 --> 1566.66]  it's got very
[1566.66 --> 1567.26]  loud
[1567.26 --> 1568.22]  very tactile
[1568.22 --> 1569.32]  very clicky
[1569.32 --> 1570.64]  what was that
[1570.64 --> 1573.06]  oh this isn't a
[1573.06 --> 1573.32]  gif
[1573.32 --> 1573.94]  it's a youtube
[1573.94 --> 1574.52]  video
[1574.52 --> 1579.02]  is this just a
[1579.02 --> 1579.62]  youtube video
[1579.62 --> 1580.14]  that they have
[1580.14 --> 1580.76]  on repeat
[1580.76 --> 1583.96]  why would they
[1583.96 --> 1584.50]  just make it
[1584.50 --> 1584.98]  a gif
[1584.98 --> 1588.42]  what
[1588.42 --> 1591.48]  oh I kind of
[1591.48 --> 1591.92]  want that to
[1591.92 --> 1592.52]  happen again
[1592.52 --> 1593.10]  anyways
[1593.10 --> 1594.14]  this is that
[1594.14 --> 1594.62]  keyboard
[1594.62 --> 1595.58]  um
[1595.58 --> 1597.20]  which is why
[1597.20 --> 1597.74]  it's so loud
[1597.74 --> 1598.12]  so I'm sorry
[1598.12 --> 1598.48]  about that
[1598.48 --> 1598.96]  I will type
[1598.96 --> 1599.60]  as little as
[1599.60 --> 1600.02]  possible
[1600.02 --> 1600.94]  I want to see
[1600.94 --> 1601.48]  the results
[1601.48 --> 1602.36]  of that straw
[1602.36 --> 1602.72]  pole
[1602.72 --> 1603.62]  uh
[1603.62 --> 1604.00]  but I guess
[1604.00 --> 1604.40]  I should put
[1604.40 --> 1605.38]  those on screen
[1605.38 --> 1606.74]  so give me a
[1606.74 --> 1607.36]  second here
[1607.36 --> 1608.80]  I want to
[1608.80 --> 1609.58]  like I can't
[1609.58 --> 1610.02]  believe
[1610.02 --> 1612.14]  that that's
[1612.14 --> 1612.44]  just
[1612.44 --> 1613.18]  okay let's
[1613.18 --> 1613.40]  see
[1613.40 --> 1617.80]  results
[1617.80 --> 1619.86]  see look
[1619.86 --> 1620.84]  there's an ad
[1620.84 --> 1621.52]  right these are
[1621.52 --> 1621.96]  ads
[1621.96 --> 1622.36]  I don't have
[1622.36 --> 1622.74]  ad books
[1622.74 --> 1623.00]  so
[1623.00 --> 1624.56]  yes okay
[1624.56 --> 1625.24]  so everyone
[1625.24 --> 1625.94]  wants it
[1625.94 --> 1626.36]  but then
[1626.36 --> 1627.36]  I don't know
[1627.36 --> 1627.58]  I
[1627.58 --> 1629.08]  if I can find
[1629.08 --> 1629.60]  the time to do
[1629.60 --> 1630.14]  it I will
[1630.14 --> 1630.72]  but my
[1630.72 --> 1631.76]  my DIY videos
[1631.76 --> 1632.52]  have not gotten
[1632.52 --> 1633.86]  a huge amount
[1633.86 --> 1634.32]  of views
[1634.32 --> 1635.44]  but I will
[1635.44 --> 1636.32]  I will try
[1636.32 --> 1637.02]  okay
[1637.02 --> 1638.06]  I will try
[1638.06 --> 1639.46]  um but yeah
[1639.46 --> 1641.00]  people do seem
[1641.00 --> 1641.56]  to want the
[1641.56 --> 1642.46]  transparent LCD
[1642.46 --> 1643.20]  side panel thing
[1643.20 --> 1644.00]  I think that one
[1644.00 --> 1644.42]  would be
[1644.42 --> 1645.96]  maybe a little
[1645.96 --> 1646.46]  cooler
[1646.46 --> 1648.68]  than some of the
[1648.68 --> 1649.08]  other
[1649.08 --> 1650.48]  videos that I've
[1650.48 --> 1650.74]  made
[1650.74 --> 1651.68]  that would be
[1651.68 --> 1652.32]  fair
[1652.32 --> 1653.60]  oh
[1653.60 --> 1654.08]  yeah see
[1654.08 --> 1654.90]  why is it a
[1654.90 --> 1655.44]  YouTube video
[1655.44 --> 1656.30]  and then do they
[1656.30 --> 1656.76]  have it auto
[1656.76 --> 1657.92]  replaying
[1657.92 --> 1660.42]  apparently
[1660.42 --> 1660.92]  yeah
[1660.92 --> 1662.20]  what
[1662.20 --> 1663.58]  why go through
[1663.58 --> 1664.06]  the process
[1664.06 --> 1664.64]  of like
[1664.64 --> 1665.82]  making your site
[1665.82 --> 1666.60]  auto replay
[1666.60 --> 1667.10]  the same
[1667.10 --> 1667.78]  YouTube video
[1667.78 --> 1668.44]  when you could
[1668.44 --> 1668.92]  just make it
[1668.92 --> 1669.32]  a gif
[1669.32 --> 1670.40]  oh I don't
[1670.40 --> 1670.60]  know
[1670.60 --> 1671.14]  that seems
[1671.14 --> 1671.60]  crazy
[1671.60 --> 1674.86]  Anzi
[1674.86 --> 1675.40]  Frostwolf
[1675.40 --> 1676.50]  gaming series
[1676.50 --> 1678.42]  it's all
[1678.42 --> 1678.92]  in German
[1678.92 --> 1680.26]  oh
[1680.26 --> 1681.08]  nevermind
[1681.08 --> 1683.52]  not German
[1683.52 --> 1687.74]  this thing
[1687.74 --> 1688.20]  is cool
[1688.20 --> 1689.80]  I guess
[1689.80 --> 1690.10]  they want
[1690.10 --> 1690.76]  you to buy
[1690.76 --> 1692.04]  oh my
[1692.04 --> 1692.50]  god
[1692.50 --> 1692.76]  it's
[1692.76 --> 1693.62]  $500
[1693.62 --> 1696.06]  for the
[1696.06 --> 1696.40]  case
[1696.40 --> 1696.90]  and the
[1696.90 --> 1697.24]  LCD
[1697.24 --> 1697.78]  panel
[1697.78 --> 1703.02]  whoo
[1703.02 --> 1705.58]  okay
[1705.58 --> 1706.38]  let me go
[1706.38 --> 1707.10]  back to my
[1707.10 --> 1707.62]  screen real
[1707.62 --> 1708.08]  quick
[1708.08 --> 1708.74]  instead of
[1708.74 --> 1709.74]  CH440
[1709.74 --> 1710.16]  I'm going to
[1710.16 --> 1710.54]  check on
[1710.54 --> 1711.08]  Newegg
[1711.08 --> 1713.58]  Newegg.com
[1713.58 --> 1716.44]  once I'm here
[1716.44 --> 1716.94]  and it stops
[1716.94 --> 1717.46]  freaking out
[1717.46 --> 1717.88]  I'll share my
[1717.88 --> 1718.38]  screen again
[1718.38 --> 1719.88]  there we go
[1719.88 --> 1720.88]  screen share
[1720.88 --> 1722.64]  how much is
[1722.64 --> 1723.38]  an H440
[1723.38 --> 1724.16]  let's be fair
[1724.16 --> 1726.08]  it's $119
[1726.08 --> 1730.50]  this thing
[1730.50 --> 1731.86]  is expensive
[1731.86 --> 1733.54]  oh my god
[1733.54 --> 1733.94]  that's
[1733.94 --> 1735.32]  400 euros
[1735.32 --> 1740.92]  whoa
[1740.92 --> 1743.00]  that's a lot
[1743.00 --> 1743.36]  of money
[1743.36 --> 1744.86]  that's like
[1744.86 --> 1746.28]  720 Canadian
[1746.28 --> 1746.74]  dollars
[1746.74 --> 1747.24]  that someone
[1747.24 --> 1747.72]  just posted
[1747.72 --> 1748.16]  in chat
[1748.16 --> 1748.48]  and I'm
[1748.48 --> 1748.84]  pretty sure
[1748.84 --> 1749.40]  that's right
[1749.40 --> 1751.36]  oh my god
[1751.36 --> 1752.48]  I thought
[1752.48 --> 1752.92]  that was
[1752.92 --> 1753.94]  $400
[1753.94 --> 1754.70]  Canadian
[1754.70 --> 1757.34]  that is
[1757.34 --> 1757.82]  so much
[1757.82 --> 1758.14]  money
[1758.14 --> 1758.94]  okay
[1758.94 --> 1759.34]  we're going
[1759.34 --> 1759.66]  to move
[1759.66 --> 1759.94]  on
[1759.94 --> 1760.52]  I'm going
[1760.52 --> 1760.78]  to very
[1760.78 --> 1761.26]  probably
[1761.26 --> 1761.86]  do my
[1761.86 --> 1762.14]  how to
[1762.14 --> 1762.46]  make your
[1762.46 --> 1762.66]  own
[1762.66 --> 1763.26]  transparent
[1763.26 --> 1763.78]  video
[1763.78 --> 1764.30]  thing
[1764.30 --> 1764.92]  it's not
[1764.92 --> 1765.54]  that easy
[1765.54 --> 1766.08]  that's part
[1766.08 --> 1766.26]  of the
[1766.26 --> 1766.62]  problem
[1766.62 --> 1767.14]  and it's
[1767.14 --> 1767.70]  very easy
[1767.70 --> 1768.60]  to screw
[1768.60 --> 1769.04]  up
[1769.04 --> 1772.68]  that was
[1772.68 --> 1773.14]  a lot
[1773.14 --> 1773.56]  of money
[1773.56 --> 1775.70]  I don't
[1775.70 --> 1776.30]  think I could
[1776.30 --> 1776.86]  spend that
[1776.86 --> 1777.32]  much money
[1777.32 --> 1777.86]  on a
[1777.86 --> 1778.28]  singular
[1778.28 --> 1779.10]  side panel
[1779.10 --> 1781.40]  but yeah
[1781.40 --> 1782.60]  we will see
[1782.60 --> 1784.00]  apparently Foxconn
[1784.00 --> 1785.44]  deploys 40,000
[1785.44 --> 1786.48]  robots in China
[1786.48 --> 1787.22]  the last time I
[1787.22 --> 1787.98]  heard about this
[1787.98 --> 1791.66]  they had deployed
[1791.66 --> 1792.66]  a huge amount
[1792.66 --> 1793.06]  of robots
[1793.06 --> 1793.54]  but I believe
[1793.54 --> 1794.06]  it was in
[1794.06 --> 1794.68]  Taiwan
[1794.68 --> 1796.08]  and they
[1796.08 --> 1796.98]  were super
[1796.98 --> 1797.68]  proud of
[1797.68 --> 1797.90]  it
[1797.90 --> 1799.18]  which is
[1799.18 --> 1800.10]  an interesting
[1800.10 --> 1801.66]  way to look
[1801.66 --> 1802.10]  at robot
[1802.10 --> 1802.52]  replacement
[1802.52 --> 1803.64]  because usually
[1803.64 --> 1804.84]  when a company
[1804.84 --> 1806.06]  fires a huge
[1806.06 --> 1806.40]  amount of
[1806.40 --> 1806.70]  people
[1806.70 --> 1807.86]  they're like
[1807.86 --> 1808.46]  oh we're
[1808.46 --> 1809.24]  so sorry
[1809.24 --> 1809.82]  like we
[1809.82 --> 1810.24]  can't
[1810.24 --> 1811.04]  we can't
[1811.04 --> 1812.22]  manage this
[1812.22 --> 1813.14]  or the markets
[1813.14 --> 1813.70]  are shifting
[1813.70 --> 1814.94]  or like we
[1814.94 --> 1815.74]  failed in this
[1815.74 --> 1816.16]  way
[1816.16 --> 1817.48]  Foxconn lays
[1817.48 --> 1818.22]  off a huge
[1818.22 --> 1818.48]  amount of
[1818.48 --> 1819.06]  people replaces
[1819.06 --> 1819.74]  them with robots
[1819.74 --> 1820.18]  and it's like
[1820.18 --> 1821.08]  we're awesome
[1821.08 --> 1822.20]  we just replaced
[1822.20 --> 1822.98]  all these people
[1822.98 --> 1823.40]  and we don't
[1823.40 --> 1823.96]  need them
[1823.96 --> 1825.38]  screw all those
[1825.38 --> 1825.76]  people
[1825.76 --> 1826.60]  we don't need
[1826.60 --> 1827.20]  anybody
[1827.20 --> 1827.96]  we can just
[1827.96 --> 1828.64]  have robots
[1828.64 --> 1829.52]  do everything
[1829.52 --> 1830.70]  screw them all
[1830.70 --> 1832.06]  which is interesting
[1832.06 --> 1833.76]  not very conventional
[1833.76 --> 1835.72]  from what I've seen
[1835.72 --> 1836.94]  most companies do
[1836.94 --> 1838.34]  but you know
[1838.34 --> 1839.96]  eh
[1839.96 --> 1841.16]  or they just ignore it
[1841.16 --> 1841.36]  like
[1841.36 --> 1842.66]  what is it
[1842.66 --> 1843.30]  McDonald's
[1843.30 --> 1844.20]  has been trying to
[1844.20 --> 1844.92]  replace people
[1844.92 --> 1846.14]  all the freaking
[1846.14 --> 1846.62]  time
[1846.62 --> 1848.06]  using the automated
[1848.06 --> 1848.72]  telling machine
[1848.72 --> 1849.24]  things
[1849.24 --> 1851.04]  but
[1851.04 --> 1852.10]  they just don't
[1852.10 --> 1852.86]  talk about it
[1852.86 --> 1853.74]  as far as I know
[1853.74 --> 1854.20]  there's like
[1854.20 --> 1854.58]  nope
[1854.58 --> 1855.68]  nope
[1855.68 --> 1856.44]  nope
[1856.44 --> 1857.32]  nope
[1857.32 --> 1857.98]  people like
[1857.98 --> 1858.56]  these telling
[1858.56 --> 1859.36]  machine things
[1859.36 --> 1859.84]  and we're just
[1859.84 --> 1860.58]  nope
[1860.58 --> 1861.58]  it's fine
[1861.58 --> 1862.90]  anyways
[1862.90 --> 1864.84]  so Foxconn
[1864.84 --> 1865.58]  is continuing
[1865.58 --> 1866.68]  to reduce
[1866.68 --> 1867.06]  the number
[1867.06 --> 1867.56]  of workers
[1867.56 --> 1868.24]  at its plants
[1868.24 --> 1868.76]  by creating
[1868.76 --> 1869.60]  digital devices
[1869.60 --> 1870.26]  that are
[1870.26 --> 1870.96]  creating digital
[1870.96 --> 1871.32]  devices
[1871.32 --> 1871.66]  sorry
[1871.66 --> 1878.00]  Foxconn
[1878.00 --> 1878.36]  says that
[1878.36 --> 1879.00]  they can produce
[1879.00 --> 1879.68]  10,000
[1879.68 --> 1880.44]  of these robots
[1880.44 --> 1881.22]  annually
[1881.22 --> 1882.94]  for the
[1882.94 --> 1883.64]  Kunshan
[1883.64 --> 1884.18]  factory
[1884.18 --> 1884.66]  alone
[1884.66 --> 1885.20]  Foxconn
[1885.20 --> 1885.66]  has cut
[1885.66 --> 1886.64]  60,000
[1886.64 --> 1887.06]  employees
[1887.06 --> 1887.84]  so I believe
[1887.84 --> 1888.62]  that was
[1888.62 --> 1889.26]  what happened
[1889.26 --> 1890.52]  earlier this year
[1890.52 --> 1891.02]  that Linus
[1891.02 --> 1891.58]  and I talked
[1891.58 --> 1891.96]  about
[1891.96 --> 1893.64]  and they're
[1893.64 --> 1893.94]  saying
[1893.94 --> 1894.42]  with the
[1894.42 --> 1895.26]  increase
[1895.26 --> 1896.40]  of labor
[1896.40 --> 1897.10]  costs
[1897.10 --> 1897.76]  and with
[1897.76 --> 1898.12]  the younger
[1898.12 --> 1898.92]  generation's
[1898.92 --> 1899.92]  lack of interest
[1899.92 --> 1900.60]  in production
[1900.60 --> 1901.32]  line work
[1901.32 --> 1902.12]  don't think
[1902.12 --> 1902.56]  that's the
[1902.56 --> 1902.98]  problem
[1902.98 --> 1904.06]  many companies
[1904.06 --> 1904.66]  have launched
[1904.66 --> 1905.42]  huge investments
[1905.42 --> 1906.10]  into automation
[1906.10 --> 1906.64]  I think
[1906.64 --> 1907.08]  they've just
[1907.08 --> 1907.50]  done that
[1907.50 --> 1908.04]  because it's
[1908.04 --> 1909.10]  ridiculously cheap
[1909.10 --> 1909.50]  once it's
[1909.50 --> 1909.90]  implemented
[1909.90 --> 1911.46]  they also
[1911.46 --> 1911.82]  plan to
[1911.82 --> 1912.44]  build robots
[1912.44 --> 1913.50]  for medical
[1913.50 --> 1914.26]  and health
[1914.26 --> 1914.82]  applications
[1914.82 --> 1915.66]  so I think
[1915.66 --> 1916.40]  Foxconn is
[1916.40 --> 1917.32]  trying to
[1917.32 --> 1919.40]  let me jump
[1919.40 --> 1919.80]  to the
[1919.80 --> 1920.34]  China News
[1920.34 --> 1920.88]  website
[1920.88 --> 1925.58]  here we go
[1925.58 --> 1926.64]  I think
[1926.64 --> 1928.08]  Foxconn is
[1928.08 --> 1929.16]  trying to
[1929.16 --> 1929.62]  automate
[1929.62 --> 1930.70]  their own
[1930.70 --> 1931.34]  business
[1931.34 --> 1932.50]  to save
[1932.50 --> 1933.16]  money on
[1933.16 --> 1933.56]  labor
[1933.56 --> 1934.64]  but also
[1934.64 --> 1935.48]  as kind of
[1935.48 --> 1936.40]  an advertisement
[1936.40 --> 1937.08]  to other
[1937.08 --> 1937.56]  businesses
[1937.56 --> 1938.82]  showing off
[1938.82 --> 1939.12]  look
[1939.12 --> 1939.52]  look at
[1939.52 --> 1939.78]  look at
[1939.78 --> 1940.02]  what we
[1940.02 --> 1940.28]  can do
[1940.28 --> 1940.70]  we make
[1940.70 --> 1941.38]  relatively
[1941.38 --> 1941.78]  highly
[1941.78 --> 1942.36]  advanced
[1942.36 --> 1943.42]  things
[1943.42 --> 1944.38]  we manufacture
[1944.38 --> 1944.94]  relatively
[1944.94 --> 1945.60]  highly advanced
[1945.60 --> 1945.94]  things
[1945.94 --> 1946.80]  and we do
[1946.80 --> 1946.98]  it
[1946.98 --> 1947.78]  automated
[1947.78 --> 1948.82]  and then
[1948.82 --> 1949.22]  they're gonna
[1949.22 --> 1949.48]  be like
[1949.48 --> 1950.10]  look we can
[1950.10 --> 1950.70]  make these
[1950.70 --> 1951.46]  robots for
[1951.46 --> 1951.98]  you for
[1951.98 --> 1952.64]  your applications
[1952.64 --> 1953.18]  as well
[1953.18 --> 1954.28]  and I
[1954.28 --> 1954.80]  believe they
[1954.80 --> 1955.20]  want that
[1955.20 --> 1955.58]  to be a
[1955.58 --> 1956.52]  huge part
[1956.52 --> 1956.88]  of their
[1956.88 --> 1957.56]  model
[1957.56 --> 1959.64]  so
[1959.64 --> 1960.78]  yeah
[1960.78 --> 1961.68]  I think
[1961.68 --> 1962.24]  that's honestly
[1962.24 --> 1962.84]  about it
[1962.84 --> 1963.78]  Foxconn wants
[1963.78 --> 1964.28]  to kind of
[1964.28 --> 1964.78]  rule the world
[1964.78 --> 1965.44]  with robots
[1965.44 --> 1966.30]  and they're
[1966.30 --> 1966.70]  not shy
[1966.70 --> 1967.12]  about that
[1967.12 --> 1967.46]  at all
[1967.46 --> 1967.92]  I think
[1967.92 --> 1968.20]  they're gonna
[1968.20 --> 1968.88]  brag about it
[1968.88 --> 1969.46]  every single
[1969.46 --> 1969.82]  time it
[1969.82 --> 1970.20]  happens
[1970.20 --> 1971.12]  because they
[1971.12 --> 1971.50]  want to
[1971.50 --> 1971.88]  start
[1971.88 --> 1974.32]  making that
[1974.32 --> 1974.64]  money
[1974.64 --> 1975.76]  off robots
[1975.76 --> 1976.52]  so
[1976.52 --> 1977.60]  yeah
[1977.60 --> 1978.48]  anyways
[1978.48 --> 1979.42]  someone just
[1979.42 --> 1980.04]  reminded me
[1980.04 --> 1980.60]  so I think
[1980.60 --> 1980.90]  I'm gonna
[1980.90 --> 1981.72]  do it now
[1981.72 --> 1982.42]  give me one
[1982.42 --> 1983.06]  quick second
[1983.06 --> 1987.02]  usually these
[1987.02 --> 1987.44]  are kind
[1987.44 --> 1988.08]  of
[1988.08 --> 1989.34]  Linus's
[1989.34 --> 1989.70]  thing
[1989.70 --> 1990.72]  but
[1990.72 --> 1991.58]  here we
[1991.58 --> 1991.96]  go
[1991.96 --> 1992.90]  sponsor
[1992.90 --> 1993.50]  spots
[1993.50 --> 1994.46]  first one
[1994.46 --> 1995.00]  Mack
[1995.00 --> 1995.40]  Weldon
[1995.40 --> 1996.80]  this shirt
[1996.80 --> 1997.98]  it looks
[1997.98 --> 1998.68]  fantastic
[1998.68 --> 1999.76]  if I do
[1999.76 --> 2000.22]  say so
[2000.22 --> 2000.60]  myself
[2000.60 --> 2002.02]  I like
[2002.02 --> 2002.54]  it a lot
[2002.54 --> 2003.22]  I don't
[2003.22 --> 2003.48]  think I've
[2003.48 --> 2003.88]  ever shown
[2003.88 --> 2004.44]  off a shirt
[2004.44 --> 2005.08]  on the show
[2005.08 --> 2005.54]  before
[2005.54 --> 2006.78]  but you know
[2006.78 --> 2007.54]  it's fine
[2007.54 --> 2008.12]  it's comfortable
[2008.12 --> 2008.62]  it feels
[2008.62 --> 2008.98]  nice
[2008.98 --> 2009.72]  I'm wearing
[2009.72 --> 2010.18]  it right
[2010.18 --> 2010.40]  now
[2010.40 --> 2010.66]  it's a
[2010.66 --> 2010.84]  Mack
[2010.84 --> 2011.08]  Weldon
[2011.08 --> 2011.32]  shirt
[2011.32 --> 2011.70]  as you
[2011.70 --> 2011.92]  know
[2011.92 --> 2012.40]  Mack
[2012.40 --> 2012.68]  Weldon
[2012.68 --> 2012.98]  believes
[2012.98 --> 2013.48]  in smart
[2013.48 --> 2013.90]  design
[2013.90 --> 2014.38]  premium
[2014.38 --> 2014.98]  fabrics
[2014.98 --> 2015.62]  and simple
[2015.62 --> 2016.12]  shopping
[2016.12 --> 2018.04]  yeah
[2018.04 --> 2018.62]  we've
[2018.62 --> 2019.50]  bought
[2019.50 --> 2020.00]  underwear
[2020.00 --> 2020.98]  this shirt
[2020.98 --> 2021.46]  and some
[2021.46 --> 2021.92]  socks
[2021.92 --> 2022.32]  they all
[2022.32 --> 2022.90]  feel great
[2022.90 --> 2023.52]  it was easy
[2023.52 --> 2023.94]  to buy
[2023.94 --> 2026.44]  they have
[2026.44 --> 2026.76]  a line
[2026.76 --> 2027.22]  of silver
[2027.22 --> 2027.64]  underwear
[2027.64 --> 2028.16]  which I'm
[2028.16 --> 2028.44]  not going
[2028.44 --> 2028.74]  to show
[2028.74 --> 2029.46]  you
[2029.46 --> 2032.68]  because
[2032.68 --> 2033.06]  twitch
[2033.06 --> 2033.98]  but they're
[2033.98 --> 2034.40]  comfortable
[2034.40 --> 2036.14]  the silver
[2036.14 --> 2036.58]  which is
[2036.58 --> 2036.80]  weaved
[2036.80 --> 2037.08]  into the
[2037.08 --> 2037.38]  fabric
[2037.38 --> 2037.66]  helps
[2037.66 --> 2038.10]  eliminate
[2038.10 --> 2038.88]  odors
[2038.88 --> 2040.48]  you can
[2040.48 --> 2040.86]  look up
[2040.86 --> 2041.30]  how that
[2041.30 --> 2041.60]  works
[2041.60 --> 2042.62]  they want
[2042.62 --> 2042.78]  you to
[2042.78 --> 2042.92]  be
[2042.92 --> 2043.28]  comfortable
[2043.28 --> 2043.86]  so if
[2043.86 --> 2044.02]  you don't
[2044.02 --> 2044.32]  like your
[2044.32 --> 2044.76]  first pair
[2044.76 --> 2045.04]  you can
[2045.04 --> 2045.46]  keep it
[2045.46 --> 2046.08]  and they
[2046.08 --> 2046.40]  will still
[2046.40 --> 2046.86]  refund you
[2046.86 --> 2047.36]  no questions
[2047.36 --> 2047.76]  asked
[2047.76 --> 2050.14]  maybe
[2050.14 --> 2050.36]  don't
[2050.36 --> 2050.64]  be a
[2050.64 --> 2050.88]  jerk
[2050.88 --> 2051.66]  and just
[2051.66 --> 2052.26]  do that
[2052.26 --> 2052.54]  knowing
[2052.54 --> 2052.92]  that you're
[2052.92 --> 2053.20]  going to
[2053.20 --> 2053.68]  request
[2053.68 --> 2054.10]  the refund
[2054.10 --> 2054.62]  but if
[2054.62 --> 2054.96]  you don't
[2054.96 --> 2055.26]  actually
[2055.26 --> 2055.68]  like it
[2055.68 --> 2055.98]  you can
[2055.98 --> 2056.28]  request
[2056.28 --> 2056.72]  a refund
[2056.72 --> 2057.32]  everything
[2057.32 --> 2057.92]  is good
[2057.92 --> 2058.42]  they're
[2058.42 --> 2059.02]  nice guys
[2059.02 --> 2059.72]  not only
[2059.72 --> 2059.90]  does
[2059.90 --> 2060.18]  Mack
[2060.18 --> 2060.48]  Weldon
[2060.48 --> 2060.84]  do

[2061.26 --> 2061.72]  socks
[2061.72 --> 2062.44]  and shirts
[2062.44 --> 2062.78]  they all
[2062.78 --> 2063.26]  look good
[2063.26 --> 2063.96]  they perform
[2063.96 --> 2064.34]  well
[2064.34 --> 2065.24]  as well
[2065.24 --> 2065.84]  which is
[2065.84 --> 2066.14]  great
[2066.14 --> 2066.80]  I haven't
[2066.80 --> 2067.10]  used
[2067.10 --> 2067.40]  this
[2067.40 --> 2067.80]  to work
[2067.80 --> 2067.96]  out
[2067.96 --> 2068.12]  in

[2068.50 --> 2068.86]  this is
[2068.86 --> 2069.06]  the first
[2069.06 --> 2069.30]  day I've
[2069.30 --> 2069.66]  had it
[2069.66 --> 2070.28]  and I have
[2070.28 --> 2070.60]  pneumonia
[2070.60 --> 2071.48]  so that
[2071.48 --> 2071.90]  wouldn't work
[2071.90 --> 2072.28]  out very
[2072.28 --> 2072.70]  well would
[2072.70 --> 2072.84]  it
[2072.84 --> 2073.52]  but I
[2073.52 --> 2074.04]  did work

[2277.82 --> 2278.58]  is not
[2278.58 --> 2279.10]  the easiest
[2279.10 --> 2279.48]  thing
[2279.48 --> 2280.10]  so I don't
[2280.10 --> 2280.34]  know how
[2280.34 --> 2280.76]  long this
[2280.76 --> 2281.06]  show is
[2281.06 --> 2281.28]  going to
[2281.28 --> 2281.48]  go
[2281.48 --> 2282.02]  but I
[2282.02 --> 2282.14]  don't
[2282.14 --> 2282.38]  want to
[2282.38 --> 2282.70]  stop
[2282.70 --> 2283.40]  you guys
[2283.40 --> 2283.98]  right when
[2283.98 --> 2284.22]  I just
[2284.22 --> 2284.48]  did the
[2284.48 --> 2284.76]  sponsor
[2284.76 --> 2285.20]  spots
[2285.20 --> 2285.60]  because
[2285.60 --> 2285.82]  that
[2285.82 --> 2286.22]  seems
[2286.22 --> 2286.92]  super
[2286.92 --> 2287.28]  lame
[2287.28 --> 2287.98]  so I'm
[2287.98 --> 2288.14]  going to
[2288.14 --> 2288.30]  keep
[2288.30 --> 2288.62]  going
[2288.62 --> 2290.00]  we're
[2290.00 --> 2290.20]  going to
[2290.20 --> 2290.42]  move
[2290.42 --> 2290.86]  up
[2290.86 --> 2291.66]  soylent
[2291.66 --> 2292.12]  halt
[2292.12 --> 2292.62]  sales
[2292.62 --> 2293.10]  of their
[2293.10 --> 2293.82]  bars
[2293.82 --> 2295.04]  investigation
[2295.04 --> 2295.84]  into their
[2295.84 --> 2296.40]  illness
[2296.40 --> 2297.02]  stuff
[2297.02 --> 2297.68]  continues
[2297.68 --> 2298.14]  my mom
[2298.14 --> 2298.70]  even called
[2298.70 --> 2299.06]  me about
[2299.06 --> 2299.28]  this
[2299.28 --> 2299.56]  because my
[2299.56 --> 2300.04]  mom knows
[2300.04 --> 2300.48]  that I'm
[2300.48 --> 2300.82]  kind of
[2300.82 --> 2301.10]  into
[2301.10 --> 2301.82]  you know
[2301.82 --> 2302.30]  squarespace
[2302.30 --> 2303.00]  and stuff
[2303.00 --> 2303.72]  or what
[2303.72 --> 2304.72]  soylent
[2304.72 --> 2305.98]  anyways
[2305.98 --> 2306.82]  can't blame
[2306.82 --> 2307.14]  that one
[2307.14 --> 2307.56]  on pneumonia
[2307.56 --> 2309.22]  so she was
[2309.22 --> 2309.66]  worried that
[2309.66 --> 2310.12]  I was eating
[2310.12 --> 2310.86]  these bars
[2310.86 --> 2311.32]  this is
[2311.32 --> 2312.18]  so normally
[2312.18 --> 2312.64]  squarespace
[2312.64 --> 2313.20]  deals in
[2313.20 --> 2313.78]  liquidy
[2313.78 --> 2314.14]  stuff
[2314.14 --> 2315.00]  originally it
[2315.00 --> 2315.56]  was a mix
[2315.56 --> 2315.84]  that you
[2315.84 --> 2316.20]  mix with
[2316.20 --> 2316.66]  water
[2316.66 --> 2317.16]  then they
[2317.16 --> 2317.54]  started just
[2317.54 --> 2317.86]  coming in
[2317.86 --> 2318.44]  the bottles
[2318.44 --> 2319.28]  or the mix
[2319.28 --> 2319.68]  and then
[2319.68 --> 2320.30]  they had the
[2320.30 --> 2320.80]  bottle that
[2320.80 --> 2321.20]  has some
[2321.20 --> 2321.98]  coffee stuff
[2321.98 --> 2322.34]  in it
[2322.34 --> 2322.92]  and then
[2322.92 --> 2323.22]  they started
[2323.22 --> 2323.52]  trying to
[2323.52 --> 2323.88]  make these
[2323.88 --> 2324.30]  bars
[2324.30 --> 2330.78]  but apparently
[2330.78 --> 2331.82]  a few people
[2331.82 --> 2332.46]  got ill
[2332.46 --> 2332.96]  after eating
[2332.96 --> 2333.32]  some of the
[2333.32 --> 2334.36]  soylent snack
[2334.36 --> 2334.96]  bars and it
[2334.96 --> 2335.76]  was because
[2335.76 --> 2336.60]  of the
[2336.60 --> 2337.20]  soylent snack
[2337.20 --> 2337.54]  bars
[2337.54 --> 2338.56]  possibly
[2338.56 --> 2339.36]  I don't know
[2339.36 --> 2339.70]  if that's
[2339.70 --> 2340.18]  completely
[2340.18 --> 2340.74]  confirmed
[2340.74 --> 2341.44]  but it's
[2341.44 --> 2342.00]  pretty sure
[2342.00 --> 2342.60]  at this point
[2342.60 --> 2343.50]  soylent has
[2343.50 --> 2344.32]  halted all of
[2344.32 --> 2344.78]  their sales
[2344.78 --> 2345.10]  and their
[2345.10 --> 2345.54]  shipments
[2345.54 --> 2346.10]  and have
[2346.10 --> 2346.74]  asked people
[2346.74 --> 2347.80]  to throw
[2347.80 --> 2348.24]  the bars
[2348.24 --> 2348.78]  away
[2348.78 --> 2350.54]  and is
[2350.54 --> 2351.22]  refunding
[2351.22 --> 2351.64]  people
[2351.64 --> 2352.80]  did I say
[2352.80 --> 2353.20]  Squarespace
[2353.20 --> 2353.66]  again?
[2354.32 --> 2354.62]  did I
[2354.62 --> 2354.98]  seriously
[2354.98 --> 2355.54]  do that?
[2359.04 --> 2360.02]  my bad
[2360.02 --> 2360.42]  I didn't
[2360.42 --> 2360.86]  mean to
[2360.86 --> 2361.64]  I'm sorry
[2361.64 --> 2362.42]  anyways
[2362.42 --> 2364.36]  they're reaching
[2364.36 --> 2365.20]  out via email
[2365.20 --> 2366.26]  to customers
[2366.26 --> 2367.76]  who have
[2367.76 --> 2368.72]  ordered bars
[2368.72 --> 2369.64]  in the past
[2369.64 --> 2370.16]  blah blah blah
[2370.16 --> 2370.32]  blah blah
[2370.32 --> 2372.12]  let's go to
[2372.12 --> 2373.12]  their blog
[2373.12 --> 2373.94]  real quick
[2373.94 --> 2374.46]  let's check
[2374.46 --> 2375.00]  this out
[2375.00 --> 2375.78]  yes I did
[2375.78 --> 2376.50]  I'm sorry
[2376.50 --> 2377.30]  I'm talking
[2377.30 --> 2378.16]  about soylent
[2378.16 --> 2378.94]  Squarespace
[2378.94 --> 2379.52]  is stuck
[2379.52 --> 2380.06]  in my head
[2380.06 --> 2380.94]  sometimes I
[2380.94 --> 2381.24]  do these
[2381.24 --> 2381.88]  weird things
[2381.88 --> 2382.24]  where I
[2382.24 --> 2382.80]  see a word
[2382.80 --> 2383.20]  that starts
[2383.20 --> 2383.64]  with a certain
[2383.64 --> 2384.00]  letter
[2384.00 --> 2384.66]  and then
[2384.66 --> 2385.50]  every other
[2385.50 --> 2386.04]  word that
[2386.04 --> 2386.42]  starts with
[2386.42 --> 2386.86]  that letter
[2386.86 --> 2388.10]  becomes that
[2388.10 --> 2388.86]  word for
[2388.86 --> 2389.46]  some reason
[2389.46 --> 2390.64]  anyways
[2390.64 --> 2391.84]  this is
[2391.84 --> 2392.40]  soylent we're
[2392.40 --> 2392.84]  talking about
[2392.84 --> 2393.52]  not Squarespace
[2393.52 --> 2394.36]  Squarespace is
[2394.36 --> 2394.82]  fine
[2394.82 --> 2395.82]  Squarespace is
[2395.82 --> 2396.88]  not recalling
[2396.88 --> 2398.08]  nutritional bars
[2398.08 --> 2398.58]  for making
[2398.58 --> 2399.28]  people sick
[2399.28 --> 2400.06]  Squarespace
[2400.06 --> 2401.40]  makes great
[2401.40 --> 2401.80]  looking
[2401.80 --> 2403.14]  helps you
[2403.14 --> 2403.86]  make great

[2406.88 --> 2407.78]  Squarespace.com
[2407.78 --> 2408.32]  looks kind of
[2408.32 --> 2408.64]  wonderful
[2408.64 --> 2409.52]  anyways
[2409.52 --> 2410.40]  soylent
[2410.40 --> 2412.56]  yeah
[2412.56 --> 2414.14]  there's
[2414.14 --> 2415.40]  they're offering
[2415.40 --> 2416.54]  if they haven't
[2416.54 --> 2417.20]  contacted you
[2417.20 --> 2417.58]  and you're like
[2417.58 --> 2418.16]  what the hell
[2418.16 --> 2419.04]  and you've ordered
[2419.04 --> 2419.84]  some bars you can
[2419.84 --> 2420.70]  contact them at
[2420.70 --> 2421.16]  info at
[2421.16 --> 2422.16]  soylent.com
[2422.16 --> 2422.74]  I almost just said
[2422.74 --> 2423.10]  info at
[2423.10 --> 2424.02]  linusmediagroup.com
[2424.02 --> 2426.84]  oh it's not even
[2426.84 --> 2427.48]  an email
[2427.48 --> 2430.12]  okay
[2430.12 --> 2432.64]  we are deeply
[2432.64 --> 2433.28]  sorry if any
[2433.28 --> 2434.08]  customer had any
[2434.08 --> 2435.10]  negative experiences
[2435.10 --> 2435.72]  with the soylent
[2435.72 --> 2436.74]  bar I was
[2436.74 --> 2437.64]  reading on I
[2437.64 --> 2438.58]  believe was it
[2438.58 --> 2439.20]  their Instagram
[2439.20 --> 2439.92]  or their Twitter
[2439.92 --> 2440.28]  or something
[2440.28 --> 2440.92]  comments that
[2440.92 --> 2441.46]  people had
[2441.46 --> 2442.24]  and there was a
[2442.24 --> 2443.06]  bunch of people
[2443.06 --> 2443.74]  saying that they
[2443.74 --> 2444.90]  had eaten and
[2444.90 --> 2446.04]  consumed the bars
[2446.04 --> 2446.90]  and had no
[2446.90 --> 2447.72]  problems with it
[2447.72 --> 2448.38]  at all
[2448.38 --> 2450.82]  but there was
[2450.82 --> 2451.84]  also people
[2451.84 --> 2453.14]  that were
[2453.14 --> 2453.84]  claiming that
[2453.84 --> 2454.58]  they did have
[2454.58 --> 2455.32]  problems so
[2455.32 --> 2456.16]  seriously if you
[2456.16 --> 2456.66]  have any of
[2456.66 --> 2457.24]  these bars
[2457.24 --> 2458.66]  unless it's for
[2458.66 --> 2459.16]  a prank and
[2459.16 --> 2459.36]  you're gonna
[2459.36 --> 2459.98]  no I'm not
[2459.98 --> 2460.38]  even gonna go
[2460.38 --> 2460.98]  there nope
[2460.98 --> 2461.52]  nope nope
[2461.52 --> 2463.12]  just return
[2463.12 --> 2464.54]  them or throw
[2464.54 --> 2465.66]  them away and
[2465.66 --> 2466.46]  get your refund
[2466.46 --> 2468.14]  similar to the
[2468.14 --> 2468.86]  Samsung phone
[2468.86 --> 2469.74]  if you're someone
[2469.74 --> 2470.60]  who is eating
[2470.60 --> 2472.22]  soylent bars and
[2472.22 --> 2473.16]  bought a note
[2473.16 --> 2473.58]  7
[2473.58 --> 2477.14]  you just didn't
[2477.14 --> 2477.76]  have a lot of
[2477.76 --> 2478.56]  luck with your
[2478.56 --> 2479.50]  purchasing decisions
[2479.50 --> 2480.32]  recently did you
[2480.32 --> 2482.12]  I'm sorry to hear
[2482.12 --> 2483.50]  that I feel for
[2483.50 --> 2484.42]  you I hope you
[2484.42 --> 2485.36]  get your refunds
[2485.36 --> 2486.26]  and hope everything
[2486.26 --> 2486.92]  goes okay
[2486.92 --> 2488.54]  that's that's all
[2488.54 --> 2489.30]  I have to say
[2489.30 --> 2491.10]  your refunds
[2491.10 --> 2491.68]  are not going
[2491.68 --> 2492.02]  great
[2492.02 --> 2495.18]  so someone in
[2495.18 --> 2495.68]  the chat said
[2495.68 --> 2496.16]  an allergy
[2496.16 --> 2497.16]  problem possibly
[2497.16 --> 2497.96]  I know soylent
[2497.96 --> 2498.64]  in the past
[2498.64 --> 2500.42]  has had some
[2500.42 --> 2501.36]  minor issues
[2501.36 --> 2501.86]  with their
[2501.86 --> 2502.72]  quality control
[2502.72 --> 2503.26]  so I wonder
[2503.26 --> 2503.82]  if it's something
[2503.82 --> 2504.54]  going on with
[2504.54 --> 2505.50]  how they made
[2505.50 --> 2506.20]  the bar as
[2506.20 --> 2507.36]  well let me
[2507.36 --> 2508.14]  just check this
[2508.14 --> 2509.12]  really quick
[2509.12 --> 2509.74]  nope that's an
[2509.74 --> 2510.32]  email a lot of
[2510.32 --> 2511.08]  hangouts I'm
[2511.08 --> 2511.50]  just wondering
[2511.50 --> 2512.86]  if Nick is
[2512.86 --> 2513.52]  gonna send me
[2513.52 --> 2514.02]  a message being
[2514.02 --> 2514.62]  like yo dude
[2514.62 --> 2515.24]  you screwed up
[2515.24 --> 2515.82]  I don't know
[2515.82 --> 2516.14]  if I did
[2516.14 --> 2516.62]  something wrong
[2516.62 --> 2518.86]  moving on
[2518.86 --> 2526.44]  I need to
[2526.44 --> 2526.84]  figure out
[2526.84 --> 2527.40]  where I'm
[2527.40 --> 2527.88]  going
[2527.88 --> 2530.36]  oh
[2530.36 --> 2532.52]  what
[2532.52 --> 2533.30]  I didn't even
[2533.30 --> 2533.80]  know this was
[2533.80 --> 2534.28]  a thing
[2534.28 --> 2535.38]  and this is
[2535.38 --> 2536.12]  gonna make me
[2536.12 --> 2537.22]  really super
[2537.22 --> 2537.86]  sad
[2537.86 --> 2540.36]  the title of
[2540.36 --> 2540.76]  this is
[2540.76 --> 2541.30]  Star Citizen
[2541.30 --> 2542.18]  single player
[2542.18 --> 2542.88]  is delayed
[2542.88 --> 2543.70]  indefinitely
[2543.70 --> 2547.80]  what
[2547.80 --> 2552.48]  what
[2552.48 --> 2554.22]  I'm so sad
[2554.22 --> 2554.58]  right now
[2554.58 --> 2554.92]  what
[2554.92 --> 2558.30]  cloud
[2558.30 --> 2558.64]  imperium
[2558.64 --> 2559.14]  games has
[2559.14 --> 2559.40]  announced
[2559.40 --> 2559.96]  that Star Citizen
[2559.96 --> 2560.50]  single player
[2560.50 --> 2561.08]  campaign will
[2561.08 --> 2561.58]  be delayed
[2561.58 --> 2562.26]  indefinitely
[2562.26 --> 2563.36]  reason being
[2563.36 --> 2563.94]  is that there
[2563.94 --> 2564.40]  are huge
[2564.40 --> 2565.10]  chunks of it
[2565.10 --> 2565.98]  still unfinished
[2565.98 --> 2567.44]  CIG had
[2567.44 --> 2568.28]  originally promised
[2568.28 --> 2568.92]  that this mode
[2568.92 --> 2569.26]  would ship
[2569.26 --> 2569.84]  in 2016
[2569.84 --> 2570.62]  okay I think
[2570.62 --> 2571.24]  we all knew
[2571.24 --> 2572.52]  that wasn't
[2572.52 --> 2573.08]  gonna happen
[2573.08 --> 2575.12]  but now
[2575.12 --> 2575.50]  that won't
[2575.50 --> 2576.16]  be happening
[2576.16 --> 2579.40]  part of the
[2579.40 --> 2579.94]  problem comes
[2579.94 --> 2580.42]  from them
[2580.42 --> 2581.40]  overhauling
[2581.40 --> 2582.06]  their engine
[2582.06 --> 2582.92]  which some
[2582.92 --> 2583.88]  CIG developers
[2583.88 --> 2584.84]  say it's been
[2584.84 --> 2585.98]  more work than
[2585.98 --> 2587.20]  creating a new
[2587.20 --> 2588.20]  one from scratch
[2588.20 --> 2589.24]  full games
[2589.24 --> 2589.86]  release date
[2589.86 --> 2590.72]  is unknown
[2590.72 --> 2596.68]  so these are
[2596.68 --> 2597.28]  their current
[2597.28 --> 2599.26]  problems that
[2599.26 --> 2599.80]  they have
[2599.80 --> 2603.64]  pathfinding
[2603.64 --> 2604.00]  logic
[2604.00 --> 2604.66]  full animation

[2605.18 --> 2606.38]  improved combat
[2606.38 --> 2606.82]  logic
[2606.82 --> 2607.60]  mission system
[2607.60 --> 2608.08]  integration
[2608.08 --> 2609.06]  enhanced flight
[2609.06 --> 2609.30]  AI
[2609.30 --> 2610.46]  those are some
[2610.46 --> 2611.02]  pretty core
[2611.02 --> 2612.04]  concept issues
[2612.04 --> 2613.10]  this does seem
[2613.10 --> 2613.74]  a little click
[2613.74 --> 2614.30]  baity though
[2614.30 --> 2615.32]  I guess I
[2615.32 --> 2615.94]  didn't share my
[2615.94 --> 2616.52]  screen that would
[2616.52 --> 2617.00]  be a slight
[2617.00 --> 2617.64]  problem if you
[2617.64 --> 2618.18]  wanted to read
[2618.18 --> 2618.86]  along with me
[2618.86 --> 2619.60]  there we go
[2619.60 --> 2622.72]  does seem a
[2622.72 --> 2623.16]  little click
[2623.16 --> 2623.46]  baity
[2623.46 --> 2625.62]  let me
[2625.62 --> 2626.56]  look up
[2626.56 --> 2627.26]  real quick
[2627.26 --> 2630.68]  indefinitely
[2630.68 --> 2633.12]  yeah so
[2633.12 --> 2633.80]  indefinitely
[2633.80 --> 2634.92]  literally means
[2634.92 --> 2636.02]  for an unlimited
[2636.02 --> 2638.30]  or unspecified
[2638.30 --> 2639.02]  period of time
[2639.02 --> 2640.12]  I think
[2640.12 --> 2640.94]  normally when
[2640.94 --> 2641.62]  people say
[2641.62 --> 2642.60]  indefinitely
[2642.60 --> 2644.22]  they kind of
[2644.22 --> 2645.42]  usually mean the
[2645.42 --> 2646.44]  unlimited side of
[2646.44 --> 2648.00]  things as in
[2648.00 --> 2649.10]  it's not
[2649.10 --> 2649.60]  happening
[2649.60 --> 2651.56]  I don't think
[2651.56 --> 2652.62]  that's at all
[2652.62 --> 2653.86]  what CIG
[2653.86 --> 2655.20]  said because I
[2655.20 --> 2655.96]  watched this
[2655.96 --> 2656.92]  live stream and
[2656.92 --> 2657.42]  I was like I
[2657.42 --> 2657.80]  don't remember
[2657.80 --> 2658.42]  them saying
[2658.42 --> 2660.56]  that so it
[2660.56 --> 2661.26]  was delayed
[2661.26 --> 2662.40]  I'm pretty sure
[2662.40 --> 2663.72]  we all knew
[2663.72 --> 2664.52]  this was going
[2664.52 --> 2665.06]  to be a thing
[2665.06 --> 2665.88]  we all knew it
[2665.88 --> 2666.22]  wasn't going to
[2666.22 --> 2666.98]  release in 2016
[2666.98 --> 2668.30]  so they still
[2668.30 --> 2668.94]  have problems
[2668.94 --> 2669.30]  which are

[2677.10 --> 2678.46]  GPU and CPU
[2678.46 --> 2679.28]  optimizations
[2679.28 --> 2681.38]  there's a lot
[2681.38 --> 2682.22]  for them to do
[2682.22 --> 2688.90]  but I think a
[2688.90 --> 2690.44]  more proper way
[2690.44 --> 2690.96]  to say it
[2690.96 --> 2691.68]  would be
[2691.68 --> 2693.18]  delayed
[2693.18 --> 2694.54]  maybe not
[2694.54 --> 2695.16]  delayed
[2695.16 --> 2695.66]  indefinitely
[2695.66 --> 2699.66]  that's all I
[2699.66 --> 2700.04]  would say
[2700.04 --> 2703.14]  there's some
[2703.14 --> 2703.80]  debate in the
[2703.80 --> 2704.36]  chat over
[2704.36 --> 2704.84]  whether or not
[2704.84 --> 2705.18]  indefinitely
[2705.18 --> 2706.10]  means forever
[2706.10 --> 2707.06]  permanently
[2707.06 --> 2708.08]  or if it
[2708.08 --> 2708.72]  means just a
[2708.72 --> 2709.14]  short period
[2709.14 --> 2709.60]  of time
[2709.60 --> 2711.82]  however you
[2711.82 --> 2712.32]  take it is
[2712.32 --> 2712.78]  however you
[2712.78 --> 2713.28]  take it
[2713.28 --> 2714.14]  but literally
[2714.14 --> 2714.88]  part of the
[2714.88 --> 2715.62]  definition is
[2715.62 --> 2716.06]  that it's
[2716.06 --> 2716.84]  possibly an
[2716.84 --> 2717.64]  unlimited amount
[2717.64 --> 2718.12]  of time
[2718.12 --> 2719.62]  so I'm going
[2719.62 --> 2720.24]  to go with
[2720.24 --> 2722.14]  that they
[2722.14 --> 2722.60]  probably should
[2722.60 --> 2722.88]  have just
[2722.88 --> 2723.48]  said delay
[2723.48 --> 2724.10]  instead of
[2724.10 --> 2724.40]  delayed
[2724.40 --> 2724.86]  indefinitely
[2724.86 --> 2726.02]  anyways
[2726.02 --> 2727.76]  apparently a
[2727.76 --> 2728.56]  Chinese company
[2728.56 --> 2729.12]  has bought a
[2729.12 --> 2730.06]  major stake
[2730.06 --> 2731.44]  in Newegg
[2731.44 --> 2732.82]  this was posted
[2732.82 --> 2733.42]  in the Wall
[2733.42 --> 2734.26]  Street Journal
[2734.26 --> 2736.58]  that's kind of
[2736.58 --> 2736.82]  interesting
[2736.82 --> 2737.52]  Paul and Kyle
[2737.52 --> 2738.04]  and Steve
[2738.04 --> 2738.56]  and all them
[2738.56 --> 2739.08]  don't work
[2739.08 --> 2739.72]  there anymore
[2739.72 --> 2740.86]  China firm
[2740.86 --> 2741.54]  expected to
[2741.54 --> 2742.24]  invest 20
[2742.24 --> 2742.94]  billion to
[2742.94 --> 2743.76]  30 billion
[2743.76 --> 2744.36]  dollars
[2744.36 --> 2750.40]  I don't
[2750.40 --> 2751.06]  think that's
[2751.06 --> 2752.26]  just in
[2752.26 --> 2752.80]  Newegg
[2752.80 --> 2753.40]  I think that's
[2753.40 --> 2753.82]  in a bunch
[2753.82 --> 2754.12]  of different
[2754.12 --> 2754.40]  things
[2754.40 --> 2755.26]  to read the
[2755.26 --> 2755.72]  full story
[2755.72 --> 2756.12]  subscribe
[2756.12 --> 2756.82]  or sign
[2756.82 --> 2757.14]  in
[2757.14 --> 2760.46]  I don't
[2760.46 --> 2760.76]  have a
[2760.76 --> 2761.08]  Wall Street
[2761.08 --> 2761.38]  Journal
[2761.38 --> 2761.76]  account
[2761.76 --> 2762.92]  so we're
[2762.92 --> 2763.26]  not going
[2763.26 --> 2763.56]  to look
[2763.56 --> 2763.86]  at this
[2763.86 --> 2764.20]  article
[2764.20 --> 2764.70]  I'm just
[2764.70 --> 2764.94]  going to
[2764.94 --> 2765.30]  talk to
[2765.30 --> 2765.58]  you about
[2765.58 --> 2765.86]  what's
[2765.86 --> 2766.28]  inside
[2766.28 --> 2766.58]  because
[2766.58 --> 2766.76]  whoever
[2766.76 --> 2766.98]  made
[2766.98 --> 2767.14]  the
[2767.14 --> 2767.40]  notes
[2767.40 --> 2767.60]  for
[2767.60 --> 2767.88]  this
[2767.88 --> 2768.70]  apparently
[2768.70 --> 2769.04]  does
[2769.04 --> 2769.32]  have a
[2769.32 --> 2769.64]  Wall Street
[2769.64 --> 2769.90]  Journal
[2769.90 --> 2770.30]  account
[2770.30 --> 2771.84]  reports
[2771.84 --> 2772.42]  in September
[2772.42 --> 2773.52]  of significant
[2773.52 --> 2774.04]  investment
[2774.04 --> 2775.48]  from Hangzhou
[2775.48 --> 2776.28]  Liaison
[2776.28 --> 2777.18]  Interactive
[2777.18 --> 2778.04]  Information
[2778.04 --> 2778.86]  Technology
[2778.86 --> 2779.36]  Company
[2779.36 --> 2779.84]  Limited
[2779.84 --> 2781.80]  which would
[2781.80 --> 2782.44]  allow Newegg
[2782.44 --> 2783.40]  to accelerate
[2783.40 --> 2784.06]  their pursuit
[2784.06 --> 2784.94]  of the company's
[2784.94 --> 2786.00]  strategic initiative
[2786.00 --> 2787.32]  has resulted
[2787.32 --> 2788.30]  in a bid
[2788.30 --> 2789.30]  towards controlling
[2789.30 --> 2789.94]  a majority
[2789.94 --> 2791.08]  of the company's
[2791.08 --> 2791.48]  shares
[2791.48 --> 2791.98]  wow
[2791.98 --> 2793.06]  deal
[2793.06 --> 2793.98]  is estimated
[2793.98 --> 2794.46]  to be around
[2794.46 --> 2796.26]  2.63 billion
[2796.26 --> 2796.86]  dollars
[2796.86 --> 2797.82]  will add
[2797.82 --> 2798.26]  Liaison
[2798.26 --> 2799.04]  Interactive
[2799.04 --> 2800.18]  in bolstering
[2800.18 --> 2800.78]  its global
[2800.78 --> 2801.12]  comp
[2801.12 --> 2801.86]  will aid
[2801.86 --> 2802.56]  not add
[2802.56 --> 2803.58]  I can read
[2803.58 --> 2804.58]  in bolstering
[2804.58 --> 2805.10]  its global
[2805.10 --> 2805.78]  competitiveness
[2805.78 --> 2806.36]  allowing for
[2806.36 --> 2806.86]  a large
[2806.86 --> 2807.30]  expansion
[2807.30 --> 2807.74]  into the
[2807.74 --> 2808.02]  American
[2808.02 --> 2808.44]  market
[2808.44 --> 2809.12]  so I think
[2809.12 --> 2809.34]  they're just
[2809.34 --> 2809.82]  like straight
[2809.82 --> 2810.48]  up buying
[2810.48 --> 2810.96]  their way
[2810.96 --> 2811.36]  into the
[2811.36 --> 2811.72]  states
[2811.72 --> 2812.72]  that is
[2812.72 --> 2813.20]  pretty
[2813.20 --> 2814.02]  intense
[2814.02 --> 2816.90]  yikes
[2816.90 --> 2820.42]  won
[2820.42 --> 2821.14]  not dollars
[2821.14 --> 2822.14]  nope
[2822.14 --> 2823.14]  2.63
[2823.14 --> 2823.76]  billion
[2823.76 --> 2824.58]  US dollars
[2824.58 --> 2825.60]  I will
[2825.60 --> 2825.92]  literally
[2825.92 --> 2826.32]  post
[2826.32 --> 2826.58]  that
[2826.58 --> 2826.90]  number
[2826.90 --> 2827.78]  in the
[2827.78 --> 2828.10]  chat
[2828.10 --> 2828.82]  there you
[2828.82 --> 2829.08]  go
[2829.08 --> 2829.58]  literally
[2829.58 --> 2830.18]  says
[2830.18 --> 2831.36]  USD
[2831.36 --> 2833.50]  USD
[2833.50 --> 2834.74]  so yep
[2834.74 --> 2835.72]  2.63
[2835.72 --> 2836.12]  billion
[2836.12 --> 2836.50]  USD
[2836.50 --> 2837.00]  they're
[2837.00 --> 2837.40]  buying
[2837.40 --> 2838.16]  a
[2838.16 --> 2840.04]  controlling
[2840.04 --> 2840.44]  share
[2840.44 --> 2840.70]  of the
[2840.70 --> 2841.00]  company
[2841.00 --> 2841.44]  so that's
[2841.44 --> 2842.22]  over 50%
[2842.22 --> 2843.76]  or that's
[2843.76 --> 2844.68]  okay
[2844.68 --> 2845.06]  that's not
[2845.06 --> 2845.42]  necessarily
[2845.42 --> 2845.82]  true
[2845.82 --> 2850.42]  anyways
[2850.42 --> 2851.10]  it's probably
[2851.10 --> 2851.46]  a huge
[2851.46 --> 2851.74]  portion
[2851.74 --> 2851.92]  of the
[2851.92 --> 2852.20]  company
[2852.20 --> 2852.76]  I think
[2852.76 --> 2852.88]  they're
[2852.88 --> 2853.08]  buying
[2853.08 --> 2853.38]  a very
[2853.38 --> 2853.74]  massive
[2853.74 --> 2854.04]  amount
[2854.04 --> 2856.74]  apparently
[2856.74 --> 2857.26]  HP
[2857.26 --> 2857.74]  is going
[2857.74 --> 2858.20]  to axe
[2858.20 --> 2858.52]  up to
[2858.52 --> 2859.28]  4,000
[2859.28 --> 2859.80]  jobs
[2859.80 --> 2860.12]  over the
[2860.12 --> 2860.32]  next
[2860.32 --> 2860.66]  three
[2860.66 --> 2861.20]  years
[2861.20 --> 2862.28]  this is
[2862.28 --> 2862.46]  an
[2862.46 --> 2862.78]  Ars
[2862.78 --> 2863.20]  Technica
[2863.20 --> 2863.64]  article
[2863.64 --> 2863.96]  Ars
[2863.96 --> 2864.28]  Technica
[2864.28 --> 2864.56]  is
[2864.56 --> 2865.58]  pretty
[2865.58 --> 2866.10]  awesome
[2866.10 --> 2870.92]  HP
[2870.92 --> 2871.30]  axing
[2871.30 --> 2871.78]  4,000
[2871.78 --> 2872.14]  jobs
[2872.14 --> 2872.38]  isn't
[2872.38 --> 2872.60]  pretty
[2872.60 --> 2872.94]  awesome
[2872.94 --> 2873.20]  though
[2873.20 --> 2873.80]  CEO
[2873.80 --> 2874.50]  Dion
[2874.50 --> 2875.40]  Weasler
[2875.40 --> 2876.06]  really hope
[2876.06 --> 2876.36]  I said
[2876.36 --> 2876.54]  that
[2876.54 --> 2876.88]  correctly
[2876.88 --> 2877.32]  says
[2877.32 --> 2877.64]  markets
[2877.64 --> 2877.84]  are
[2877.84 --> 2878.40]  challenging
[2878.40 --> 2878.88]  but the
[2878.88 --> 2879.16]  vendor
[2879.16 --> 2879.48]  is
[2879.48 --> 2879.92]  confident
[2879.92 --> 2880.20]  with
[2880.20 --> 2880.38]  their
[2880.38 --> 2880.96]  strategy
[2880.96 --> 2881.44]  planning
[2881.44 --> 2881.80]  to trim
[2881.80 --> 2882.28]  workforce
[2882.28 --> 2882.84]  up to
[2882.84 --> 2883.88]  18%
[2883.88 --> 2884.54]  with the
[2884.54 --> 2884.98]  loss of
[2884.98 --> 2885.32]  between
[2885.32 --> 2886.06]  3,000
[2886.06 --> 2886.78]  and 4,000
[2886.78 --> 2887.12]  jobs
[2887.12 --> 2888.22]  by 2019
[2888.22 --> 2889.76]  so if
[2889.76 --> 2890.14]  you work
[2890.14 --> 2890.64]  at HP
[2890.64 --> 2892.06]  possibly
[2892.06 --> 2893.06]  a good
[2893.06 --> 2893.78]  time to
[2893.78 --> 2894.38]  try to
[2894.38 --> 2895.04]  find an
[2895.04 --> 2895.36]  out
[2895.36 --> 2896.48]  maybe it's
[2896.48 --> 2896.80]  because they're
[2896.80 --> 2897.28]  trying to sell
[2897.28 --> 2897.80]  stuff like
[2897.80 --> 2898.22]  this
[2898.22 --> 2900.18]  I don't know
[2900.18 --> 2901.50]  like I used
[2901.50 --> 2902.14]  to work at a
[2902.14 --> 2902.66]  Best Buy
[2902.66 --> 2904.24]  for a
[2904.24 --> 2904.76]  few years
[2904.76 --> 2905.50]  on and
[2905.50 --> 2905.68]  off
[2905.68 --> 2905.90]  in the
[2905.90 --> 2906.18]  summers
[2906.18 --> 2906.70]  between
[2906.70 --> 2907.16]  school
[2907.16 --> 2907.34]  to
[2907.34 --> 2907.76]  save
[2907.76 --> 2908.14]  money
[2908.14 --> 2909.02]  these
[2909.02 --> 2909.28]  kind
[2909.28 --> 2909.40]  of
[2909.40 --> 2909.80]  things
[2909.80 --> 2910.62]  never
[2910.62 --> 2911.02]  ever
[2911.02 --> 2911.58]  sold
[2911.58 --> 2913.76]  like I
[2913.76 --> 2914.06]  actually
[2914.06 --> 2914.38]  don't
[2914.38 --> 2914.60]  think
[2914.60 --> 2914.80]  we
[2914.80 --> 2915.18]  ever
[2915.18 --> 2915.58]  sold
[2915.58 --> 2915.86]  one
[2915.86 --> 2917.08]  in the
[2917.08 --> 2917.44]  entire
[2917.44 --> 2917.80]  time
[2917.80 --> 2918.06]  that I
[2918.06 --> 2918.18]  was
[2918.18 --> 2918.48]  there
[2918.48 --> 2919.96]  why
[2919.96 --> 2920.22]  are you
[2920.22 --> 2920.40]  still
[2920.40 --> 2920.68]  making
[2920.68 --> 2920.92]  this
[2920.92 --> 2921.32]  maybe
[2921.32 --> 2921.70]  okay
[2921.70 --> 2922.40]  let me
[2922.40 --> 2922.68]  see
[2922.68 --> 2923.14]  in
[2923.14 --> 2923.60]  the
[2923.60 --> 2924.72]  let's
[2924.72 --> 2924.92]  do a
[2924.92 --> 2931.96]  all in
[2931.96 --> 2932.20]  one
[2932.20 --> 2933.18]  all in
[2933.18 --> 2933.94]  one
[2933.94 --> 2935.96]  windows
[2935.96 --> 2936.86]  pc
[2936.86 --> 2938.28]  yes
[2938.28 --> 2939.20]  no
[2939.20 --> 2941.74]  so this
[2941.74 --> 2942.02]  is kind
[2942.02 --> 2942.24]  of a
[2942.24 --> 2942.44]  weird
[2942.44 --> 2942.88]  question
[2942.88 --> 2943.28]  because I'm
[2943.28 --> 2943.68]  saying all
[2943.68 --> 2943.98]  in one
[2943.98 --> 2944.76]  windows pc
[2944.76 --> 2945.72]  yes or
[2945.72 --> 2945.96]  no
[2945.96 --> 2947.60]  but I'm
[2947.60 --> 2948.10]  defining it
[2948.10 --> 2948.48]  by like
[2948.48 --> 2949.00]  are you
[2949.00 --> 2949.50]  interested
[2949.50 --> 2949.98]  do you
[2949.98 --> 2950.50]  know people
[2950.50 --> 2950.80]  that are
[2950.80 --> 2951.24]  interested
[2951.24 --> 2951.88]  yes or
[2951.88 --> 2952.08]  no
[2952.08 --> 2952.72]  that's
[2952.72 --> 2952.96]  kind of
[2952.96 --> 2953.24]  where I'm
[2953.24 --> 2953.64]  going with
[2953.64 --> 2953.84]  that
[2953.84 --> 2954.50]  but I'm
[2954.50 --> 2954.94]  interested to
[2954.94 --> 2955.18]  see what
[2955.18 --> 2955.60]  people say
[2955.60 --> 2956.26]  because like
[2956.26 --> 2957.28]  seriously I
[2957.28 --> 2957.88]  don't I've
[2957.88 --> 2958.36]  I don't think
[2958.36 --> 2958.82]  I've ever
[2958.82 --> 2959.40]  seen one
[2959.40 --> 2959.94]  in someone's
[2959.94 --> 2960.34]  home
[2960.34 --> 2962.72]  we had
[2962.72 --> 2963.54]  two at
[2963.54 --> 2963.86]  the best
[2963.86 --> 2964.26]  buy that
[2964.26 --> 2964.60]  I worked
[2964.60 --> 2965.22]  at and
[2965.22 --> 2965.54]  no one
[2965.54 --> 2966.38]  ever bought
[2966.38 --> 2967.24]  them ever
[2967.24 --> 2969.92]  if someone
[2969.92 --> 2970.58]  did end up
[2970.58 --> 2970.88]  buying them
[2970.88 --> 2971.24]  they were so
[2971.24 --> 2972.20]  heavily discounted
[2972.20 --> 2972.58]  by the time
[2972.58 --> 2972.86]  that I was
[2972.86 --> 2973.36]  leaving that
[2973.36 --> 2974.00]  someone probably
[2974.00 --> 2974.46]  got it for
[2974.46 --> 2975.20]  like 50%
[2975.20 --> 2975.46]  of the
[2975.46 --> 2975.74]  freaking
[2975.74 --> 2976.26]  cost
[2976.26 --> 2977.58]  that has
[2977.58 --> 2977.98]  3d
[2977.98 --> 2978.30]  scanning
[2978.30 --> 2978.68]  abilities
[2978.68 --> 2979.08]  with intel
[2979.08 --> 2979.54]  real sense
[2979.54 --> 2980.30]  great you
[2980.30 --> 2980.56]  could just
[2980.56 --> 2981.18]  buy a real
[2981.18 --> 2981.84]  sense camera
[2981.84 --> 2982.60]  and then have
[2982.60 --> 2983.16]  it anyways
[2983.16 --> 2983.76]  on a normal
[2983.76 --> 2984.26]  computer
[2984.50 --> 2986.04]  why does it
[2986.04 --> 2986.40]  matter
[2986.40 --> 2988.90]  I don't know
[2988.90 --> 2990.36]  this is stupid
[2990.36 --> 2991.62]  I'm not
[2991.62 --> 2992.22]  I'm not into
[2992.22 --> 2992.88]  the windows
[2992.88 --> 2993.80]  all-in-ones
[2993.80 --> 2994.62]  kind of weird
[2994.62 --> 2995.56]  let's see the
[2995.56 --> 2996.44]  results on this
[2996.44 --> 2998.66]  so
[2998.66 --> 2999.44]  whoop
[2999.44 --> 3000.44]  yeah
[3000.44 --> 3001.76]  I want that
[3001.76 --> 3002.46]  I want to do
[3002.46 --> 3002.88]  that
[3002.88 --> 3006.86]  so we can
[3006.86 --> 3007.20]  see
[3007.20 --> 3008.42]  maybe
[3008.42 --> 3009.40]  hey look
[3009.40 --> 3010.08]  best buy
[3010.08 --> 3012.36]  oh man
[3012.36 --> 3013.14]  um
[3013.14 --> 3013.82]  you guys can't
[3013.82 --> 3014.22]  even see that
[3014.22 --> 3014.68]  that's an ad
[3014.68 --> 3015.08]  on my other
[3015.08 --> 3015.44]  monitor
[3015.44 --> 3016.14]  jeez
[3016.14 --> 3017.54]  so many ads
[3017.54 --> 3018.68]  um
[3018.68 --> 3019.82]  all-in-one
[3019.82 --> 3020.22]  pc
[3020.22 --> 3021.94]  74% of people
[3021.94 --> 3023.20]  not interested
[3023.20 --> 3023.76]  at all
[3023.76 --> 3024.40]  and don't know
[3024.40 --> 3024.90]  anyone that's
[3024.90 --> 3025.20]  interested
[3025.20 --> 3026.42]  14% of people
[3026.42 --> 3027.92]  might know
[3027.92 --> 3028.44]  someone that's
[3028.44 --> 3028.76]  interested
[3028.76 --> 3029.44]  or be
[3029.44 --> 3029.92]  slightly
[3029.92 --> 3030.36]  interested
[3030.36 --> 3030.80]  at all
[3030.80 --> 3031.20]  and then
[3031.20 --> 3032.04]  12% of people
[3032.04 --> 3032.44]  are voting
[3032.44 --> 3032.90]  turnip
[3032.90 --> 3034.30]  awesome
[3034.30 --> 3035.80]  super great
[3035.80 --> 3037.52]  I don't know
[3037.52 --> 3037.94]  guys
[3037.94 --> 3039.08]  maybe that's
[3039.08 --> 3039.52]  just the wrong
[3039.52 --> 3040.02]  product
[3040.02 --> 3041.62]  but anyways
[3041.62 --> 3042.52]  they're planning
[3042.52 --> 3043.12]  on shaving
[3043.12 --> 3044.08]  millions
[3044.08 --> 3045.18]  of the company's
[3045.18 --> 3045.98]  costs by
[3045.98 --> 3046.62]  laying off
[3046.62 --> 3047.22]  those workers
[3047.22 --> 3048.06]  the tech giant
[3048.06 --> 3048.90]  staff headcount
[3048.90 --> 3049.46]  as of last
[3049.46 --> 3049.98]  november stood
[3049.98 --> 3050.92]  at 50,000
[3050.92 --> 3051.40]  workers
[3051.40 --> 3052.62]  um
[3052.62 --> 3053.20]  that's
[3053.20 --> 3054.38]  pretty intense
[3054.38 --> 3054.98]  apparently
[3054.98 --> 3055.58]  the job
[3055.58 --> 3056.18]  cuts would
[3056.18 --> 3057.22]  begin in
[3057.22 --> 3057.70]  2017
[3057.70 --> 3058.58]  and be
[3058.58 --> 3059.02]  done by
[3059.02 --> 3059.60]  2019
[3059.60 --> 3060.34]  so again
[3060.34 --> 3060.70]  if you work
[3060.70 --> 3060.98]  at hp
[3060.98 --> 3061.46]  right now
[3061.46 --> 3062.42]  heads up
[3062.42 --> 3063.40]  um
[3063.40 --> 3063.84]  hp
[3063.84 --> 3064.52]  anticipates
[3064.52 --> 3064.88]  to be
[3064.88 --> 3066.26]  in connection
[3066.26 --> 3066.58]  with the
[3066.58 --> 3066.78]  plan
[3066.78 --> 3066.92]  to
[3066.92 --> 3071.56]  350 million
[3071.56 --> 3072.14]  to 500
[3072.14 --> 3072.58]  million
[3072.58 --> 3073.80]  in restructuring
[3073.80 --> 3074.18]  and other
[3074.18 --> 3074.68]  charges
[3074.68 --> 3075.80]  due to
[3075.80 --> 3076.44]  both labor
[3076.44 --> 3077.08]  and non-labor
[3077.08 --> 3077.72]  actions
[3077.72 --> 3078.76]  of these
[3078.76 --> 3079.10]  amounts
[3079.10 --> 3079.46]  hp
[3079.46 --> 3080.08]  expects
[3080.08 --> 3080.80]  to incur
[3080.80 --> 3081.40]  approximately
[3081.40 --> 3082.50]  200 million
[3082.50 --> 3083.40]  in labor
[3083.40 --> 3083.78]  costs
[3083.78 --> 3084.32]  related to
[3084.32 --> 3084.76]  workforce
[3084.76 --> 3085.34]  reductions
[3085.34 --> 3087.30]  the printer
[3087.30 --> 3087.70]  and pc
[3087.70 --> 3088.02]  maker
[3088.02 --> 3088.86]  predicts
[3088.86 --> 3089.68]  from the
[3089.68 --> 3090.04]  that
[3090.04 --> 3090.56]  from
[3090.56 --> 3091.28]  2020
[3091.28 --> 3091.82]  the layoffs
[3091.82 --> 3092.38]  will generate
[3092.38 --> 3093.04]  gross annual
[3093.04 --> 3093.60]  run rate
[3093.60 --> 3094.06]  savings
[3094.06 --> 3094.74]  of approximately
[3094.74 --> 3095.62]  200 to 300
[3095.62 --> 3095.98]  million
[3095.98 --> 3096.86]  so it'll cost
[3096.86 --> 3097.32]  them a lot
[3097.32 --> 3098.52]  up front
[3098.52 --> 3098.92]  and they're
[3098.92 --> 3099.32]  hoping that
[3099.32 --> 3099.62]  they save
[3099.62 --> 3100.06]  money in the
[3100.06 --> 3100.48]  long run
[3100.48 --> 3101.24]  that is
[3101.24 --> 3101.86]  pretty brutal
[3101.86 --> 3104.00]  i don't
[3104.00 --> 3104.28]  know
[3104.28 --> 3106.84]  poor
[3106.84 --> 3107.70]  people that
[3107.70 --> 3108.40]  work at hp
[3108.40 --> 3111.58]  i have a hard
[3111.58 --> 3112.24]  time ever really
[3112.24 --> 3112.98]  feeling that bad
[3112.98 --> 3113.44]  for hp
[3113.44 --> 3114.18]  but poor
[3114.18 --> 3114.64]  people that
[3114.64 --> 3115.22]  work at hp
[3115.22 --> 3117.04]  anyways
[3117.04 --> 3118.18]  moving on
[3118.18 --> 3119.70]  apparently
[3119.70 --> 3120.48]  there's a rumor
[3120.48 --> 3121.62]  that more
[3121.62 --> 3123.58]  nintendo nx
[3123.58 --> 3125.00]  leaks have
[3125.00 --> 3125.30]  happened
[3125.30 --> 3125.82]  including a
[3125.82 --> 3126.10]  price
[3126.10 --> 3126.38]  apparently
[3126.38 --> 3126.78]  will cost
[3126.78 --> 3127.70]  300 for
[3127.70 --> 3128.26]  the system
[3128.26 --> 3129.44]  and 400
[3129.44 --> 3131.16]  for a bundle
[3131.16 --> 3131.66]  these are
[3131.66 --> 3132.58]  us dollars
[3132.58 --> 3134.32]  because from
[3134.32 --> 3134.78]  a source
[3134.78 --> 3135.44]  over reddit
[3135.44 --> 3136.06]  so we all
[3136.06 --> 3136.54]  know that
[3136.54 --> 3137.36]  is just
[3137.36 --> 3138.48]  definitely
[3138.48 --> 3139.36]  genuine
[3139.36 --> 3140.94]  totally
[3140.94 --> 3141.90]  will launch
[3141.90 --> 3142.78]  with zelda
[3142.78 --> 3144.38]  and an
[3144.38 --> 3145.04]  unspecified
[3145.04 --> 3145.78]  mario title
[3145.78 --> 3148.80]  i don't think
[3148.80 --> 3149.22]  it launching
[3149.22 --> 3149.90]  with zelda
[3149.90 --> 3150.38]  was super
[3150.38 --> 3150.90]  surprising
[3150.90 --> 3151.86]  okay good
[3151.86 --> 3152.12]  i'm not
[3152.12 --> 3152.52]  signed into
[3152.52 --> 3152.86]  the forum
[3152.86 --> 3153.72]  so i will
[3153.72 --> 3154.44]  video share
[3154.44 --> 3154.92]  here
[3154.92 --> 3155.38]  i just
[3155.38 --> 3155.62]  made
[3155.62 --> 3156.32]  to make
[3156.32 --> 3156.56]  sure i
[3156.56 --> 3156.74]  wasn't
[3156.74 --> 3157.00]  signed
[3157.00 --> 3157.82]  in
[3157.82 --> 3160.42]  apparently
[3160.42 --> 3161.08]  aiming for
[3161.08 --> 3162.06]  1080p60
[3162.06 --> 3163.36]  aiming for
[3163.36 --> 3164.00]  900p
[3164.00 --> 3164.54]  in handheld
[3164.54 --> 3165.10]  mode
[3165.10 --> 3166.18]  whatever
[3166.18 --> 3166.54]  handheld
[3166.54 --> 3166.80]  mode
[3166.80 --> 3167.28]  necessarily
[3167.28 --> 3167.76]  is
[3167.76 --> 3168.02]  i think
[3168.02 --> 3168.32]  it's still
[3168.32 --> 3168.58]  up in
[3168.58 --> 3168.80]  the air
[3168.80 --> 3169.04]  a little
[3169.04 --> 3169.34]  bit
[3169.34 --> 3171.86]  the source
[3171.86 --> 3172.28]  is this
[3172.28 --> 3172.62]  youtube
[3172.62 --> 3173.26]  thing
[3173.26 --> 3173.66]  so i'm
[3173.66 --> 3173.86]  not going
[3173.86 --> 3174.10]  to click
[3174.10 --> 3174.42]  on that
[3174.42 --> 3175.02]  just in
[3175.02 --> 3175.34]  case
[3175.34 --> 3175.72]  because who
[3175.72 --> 3176.06]  knows
[3176.06 --> 3178.16]  but yeah
[3178.16 --> 3179.86]  there we
[3179.86 --> 3180.22]  go
[3180.22 --> 3184.44]  not super
[3184.44 --> 3184.86]  interesting
[3184.86 --> 3185.46]  i don't know
[3185.46 --> 3185.90]  i'm super
[3185.90 --> 3186.90]  excited for
[3186.90 --> 3188.60]  vnx but
[3188.60 --> 3190.14]  i i
[3190.14 --> 3191.14]  don't know
[3191.14 --> 3191.64]  if this is a
[3191.64 --> 3192.32]  problem or not
[3192.32 --> 3192.74]  but i just
[3192.74 --> 3193.20]  don't really
[3193.20 --> 3193.60]  get that
[3193.60 --> 3194.20]  excited for
[3194.20 --> 3194.58]  rumors
[3194.58 --> 3197.00]  like the
[3197.00 --> 3197.34]  price on
[3197.34 --> 3197.82]  that isn't
[3197.82 --> 3198.58]  too bad
[3198.58 --> 3199.64]  300 for
[3199.64 --> 3200.24]  the system
[3200.24 --> 3201.28]  is the
[3201.28 --> 3202.00]  same price
[3202.00 --> 3202.30]  as an
[3202.30 --> 3202.70]  xbox
[3202.70 --> 3203.40]  one s
[3203.40 --> 3205.04]  the bundle
[3205.04 --> 3205.84]  i wonder what
[3205.84 --> 3206.22]  that's about
[3206.22 --> 3206.66]  because a
[3206.66 --> 3207.44]  hundred dollars
[3207.44 --> 3208.20]  more for a
[3208.20 --> 3208.94]  bundle maybe
[3208.94 --> 3209.62]  that's if you
[3209.62 --> 3210.44]  get zelda
[3210.44 --> 3211.52]  and mario
[3211.52 --> 3212.84]  that can maybe
[3212.84 --> 3213.30]  make a little
[3213.30 --> 3213.86]  bit of sense
[3213.86 --> 3214.64]  not entirely
[3214.64 --> 3215.64]  sure but
[3215.64 --> 3216.54]  yeah bundle
[3216.54 --> 3217.32]  price there
[3217.32 --> 3218.26]  who knows
[3218.26 --> 3219.42]  we're seriously
[3219.42 --> 3219.92]  running out of
[3219.92 --> 3220.84]  topics this was a
[3220.84 --> 3221.98]  very very short
[3221.98 --> 3222.38]  week
[3222.38 --> 3223.86]  um
[3223.86 --> 3226.44]  valve has
[3226.44 --> 3226.92]  showed off a
[3226.92 --> 3227.70]  vr prototype
[3227.70 --> 3228.50]  this is something
[3228.50 --> 3229.22]  i can easily
[3229.22 --> 3229.86]  talk about
[3229.86 --> 3231.70]  let's go to
[3231.70 --> 3232.50]  video share
[3232.50 --> 3233.04]  so new
[3233.04 --> 3233.96]  controller there
[3233.96 --> 3235.76]  which uh
[3235.76 --> 3236.96]  looks
[3236.96 --> 3239.08]  pretty weird
[3239.08 --> 3242.48]  i don't know
[3242.48 --> 3243.04]  what's going
[3243.04 --> 3243.68]  on there
[3243.68 --> 3248.22]  it's going
[3248.22 --> 3248.66]  around his
[3248.66 --> 3249.30]  wrist and
[3249.30 --> 3249.64]  there's something
[3249.64 --> 3250.24]  on the back
[3250.24 --> 3250.80]  of his hand
[3250.80 --> 3251.22]  and then there's
[3251.22 --> 3251.64]  like this
[3251.64 --> 3253.56]  thing in the
[3253.56 --> 3254.00]  middle of his
[3254.00 --> 3254.46]  hand which
[3254.46 --> 3255.06]  looks like you
[3255.06 --> 3255.54]  would hold on
[3255.54 --> 3256.08]  a trigger
[3256.08 --> 3258.26]  it looks very
[3258.26 --> 3259.12]  odd i don't
[3259.12 --> 3259.70]  really know
[3259.70 --> 3260.76]  what else to
[3260.76 --> 3261.40]  say other than
[3261.40 --> 3261.82]  that it looks
[3261.82 --> 3262.44]  very odd
[3262.44 --> 3263.40]  you can see
[3263.40 --> 3264.06]  what i've maybe
[3264.06 --> 3264.88]  been looking for
[3264.88 --> 3265.44]  on amazon
[3265.44 --> 3266.02]  lately
[3266.02 --> 3268.78]  anyways but
[3268.78 --> 3269.44]  yeah looks
[3269.44 --> 3269.94]  kind of weird
[3269.94 --> 3270.64]  i don't know
[3270.64 --> 3271.02]  what's going on
[3271.02 --> 3271.50]  with that but
[3271.50 --> 3272.20]  it does look
[3272.20 --> 3272.92]  also super
[3272.92 --> 3273.84]  prototypey so
[3273.84 --> 3274.58]  other things
[3274.58 --> 3275.18]  could happen
[3275.18 --> 3276.48]  and that's all
[3276.48 --> 3277.12]  they're really
[3277.12 --> 3277.84]  showing off
[3277.84 --> 3278.68]  apparently wow
[3278.68 --> 3279.24]  this article
[3279.24 --> 3279.92]  was not nearly
[3279.92 --> 3280.50]  as interesting
[3280.50 --> 3281.10]  as it could
[3281.10 --> 3281.48]  have been
[3281.48 --> 3283.60]  i can make
[3283.60 --> 3284.38]  those pictures
[3284.38 --> 3284.72]  bigger
[3284.72 --> 3285.48]  yep there
[3285.48 --> 3285.80]  we go
[3285.80 --> 3287.04]  that looks
[3287.04 --> 3290.18]  not comfortable
[3290.18 --> 3293.10]  but again
[3293.10 --> 3293.76]  it's a prototype
[3293.76 --> 3294.52]  it'll get better
[3294.52 --> 3295.96]  even the leds
[3295.96 --> 3296.30]  and stuff
[3296.30 --> 3296.90]  are exposed
[3296.90 --> 3298.56]  IR leds
[3298.56 --> 3300.54]  so yeah
[3300.54 --> 3301.16]  it'll get better
[3301.16 --> 3302.24]  controller sits
[3302.24 --> 3302.82]  in the palm of your
[3302.82 --> 3303.36]  hand and doesn't
[3303.36 --> 3303.92]  extend much
[3303.92 --> 3304.56]  around the outside
[3304.56 --> 3305.10]  and then i guess
[3305.10 --> 3305.62]  they're moving
[3305.62 --> 3306.86]  that big ring
[3306.86 --> 3307.44]  to just like the
[3307.44 --> 3308.16]  back of your wrist
[3308.16 --> 3309.62]  mainly compacting
[3309.62 --> 3309.98]  it more
[3309.98 --> 3311.80]  it does look like
[3311.80 --> 3312.40]  it'll probably
[3312.40 --> 3313.54]  honestly be better
[3313.54 --> 3315.86]  um than what
[3315.86 --> 3316.74]  they currently have
[3316.74 --> 3317.70]  but i don't
[3317.70 --> 3320.06]  know if i'm more
[3320.06 --> 3320.82]  interested in that
[3320.82 --> 3322.36]  than the touch
[3322.36 --> 3323.04]  controllers the
[3323.04 --> 3323.76]  touch controllers are
[3323.76 --> 3324.58]  a pretty good
[3324.58 --> 3326.58]  implementation of
[3326.58 --> 3327.42]  VR controllers to
[3327.42 --> 3328.36]  be completely honest
[3328.36 --> 3331.08]  it's pretty brutal
[3331.08 --> 3332.38]  it's gonna be a much
[3332.38 --> 3333.22]  more interesting fight
[3333.22 --> 3333.96]  once those touch
[3333.96 --> 3334.70]  controllers come out
[3334.70 --> 3335.14]  we've already
[3335.14 --> 3336.02]  ordered some by the
[3336.02 --> 3337.08]  way so once
[3337.08 --> 3337.58]  they're released
[3337.58 --> 3338.24]  hopefully we'll get
[3338.24 --> 3338.88]  those pretty quick
[3338.88 --> 3339.40]  and i'll get a
[3339.40 --> 3340.56]  review that no one
[3340.56 --> 3341.70]  will watch of the
[3341.70 --> 3342.54]  oculus touch
[3342.54 --> 3343.18]  controllers out
[3343.18 --> 3343.82]  which will be
[3343.82 --> 3345.00]  great yeah
[3345.00 --> 3345.62]  that'll be good
[3345.62 --> 3347.80]  um bmw put
[3347.80 --> 3348.96]  self-driving into
[3348.96 --> 3349.90]  the spotlight with
[3349.90 --> 3351.10]  the new 5 series
[3351.10 --> 3352.66]  so i'm gonna post
[3352.66 --> 3353.60]  this in the chat
[3353.60 --> 3354.62]  as well
[3354.62 --> 3355.64]  um
[3355.64 --> 3358.76]  there we go
[3358.76 --> 3360.90]  uh so more
[3360.90 --> 3362.62]  to do more to
[3362.62 --> 3363.34]  the 5 series
[3363.34 --> 3364.18]  than just a set of
[3364.18 --> 3364.80]  radar-driven
[3364.80 --> 3365.42]  cruise control
[3365.42 --> 3365.90]  systems
[3365.90 --> 3367.56]  there's there's
[3367.56 --> 3368.32]  more to us than
[3368.32 --> 3369.76]  just some radar-driven
[3369.76 --> 3370.38]  cruise control
[3370.38 --> 3370.84]  systems
[3370.84 --> 3372.10]  we go deeper than
[3372.10 --> 3372.36]  that
[3372.36 --> 3374.20]  that's what bmw is
[3374.20 --> 3374.78]  trying to say
[3374.78 --> 3375.90]  it also takes care of
[3375.90 --> 3377.18]  acceleration steering and
[3377.18 --> 3379.14]  braking up to 210
[3379.14 --> 3380.78]  kilometers per hour
[3380.78 --> 3382.50]  or 130 miles per
[3382.50 --> 3382.72]  hour
[3382.72 --> 3384.02]  it uses a camera
[3384.02 --> 3384.98]  mounted on the front
[3384.98 --> 3385.98]  the system will also
[3385.98 --> 3387.60]  automatically adapt to
[3387.60 --> 3389.34]  changing speed limits
[3389.34 --> 3390.80]  although drivers can
[3390.80 --> 3392.26]  force a car to push
[3392.26 --> 3393.26]  15 kilometers per
[3393.26 --> 3395.10]  hour or 9 miles per
[3395.10 --> 3396.32]  hour above if they
[3396.32 --> 3396.88]  want
[3396.88 --> 3401.88]  interesting
[3401.88 --> 3403.66]  so i wonder if
[3403.66 --> 3405.26]  that's a pre-programmed
[3405.26 --> 3406.96]  pushing it above
[3406.96 --> 3408.24]  because this is using
[3408.24 --> 3409.14]  drive assist so
[3409.14 --> 3409.94]  they're okay to
[3409.94 --> 3410.68]  clarify there
[3410.68 --> 3411.64]  they're not like
[3411.64 --> 3413.10]  capping how fast you
[3413.10 --> 3414.32]  can drive by slightly
[3414.32 --> 3415.50]  above the speed limit
[3415.50 --> 3418.14]  i think it's when
[3418.14 --> 3419.50]  you have the like
[3419.50 --> 3420.66]  lane assist auto
[3420.66 --> 3421.74]  driving thing enabled
[3421.74 --> 3422.64]  that you can only go
[3422.64 --> 3423.42]  slightly above
[3423.42 --> 3425.68]  it's kind of
[3425.68 --> 3426.10]  interesting
[3426.10 --> 3427.40]  new 5 series releases
[3427.40 --> 3429.08]  on february 11th of
[3429.08 --> 3429.74]  2017
[3429.74 --> 3431.46]  and there was not
[3431.46 --> 3432.76]  very much in terms of
[3432.76 --> 3433.44]  further information
[3433.44 --> 3433.76]  there
[3433.76 --> 3435.22]  it is controlled by the
[3435.22 --> 3436.06]  driver so autonomous
[3436.06 --> 3437.06]  drive isn't technically
[3437.06 --> 3437.74]  at fault
[3437.74 --> 3440.00]  if you get a speeding
[3440.00 --> 3441.06]  ticket that
[3441.06 --> 3442.98]  results from you
[3442.98 --> 3444.14]  forcing the autonomous
[3444.14 --> 3445.14]  driving to go above
[3445.14 --> 3446.34]  what it wants to
[3446.34 --> 3447.22]  that kind of makes
[3447.22 --> 3447.50]  sense
[3447.50 --> 3449.30]  i mean that
[3449.30 --> 3450.38]  completely makes sense
[3450.38 --> 3450.76]  sorry
[3450.76 --> 3456.34]  google's deep mind
[3456.34 --> 3458.14]  ai team has a
[3458.14 --> 3459.20]  memory boosted ai
[3459.20 --> 3459.88]  that can help you
[3459.88 --> 3460.98]  navigate the subway
[3460.98 --> 3462.70]  they develop a
[3462.70 --> 3463.80]  memory boosted neural
[3463.80 --> 3464.74]  network that can
[3464.74 --> 3466.08]  create and work with
[3466.08 --> 3467.02]  sophisticated data
[3467.02 --> 3467.94]  structures which is
[3467.94 --> 3468.68]  the deep mind ai
[3468.68 --> 3469.50]  team i believe we
[3469.50 --> 3470.12]  already knew that
[3470.12 --> 3471.74]  it has an example of
[3471.74 --> 3472.52]  the map of the
[3472.52 --> 3473.24]  london underground
[3473.24 --> 3474.10]  let's see if we can
[3474.10 --> 3474.44]  actually
[3474.44 --> 3476.18]  see this
[3476.18 --> 3481.10]  nope
[3481.10 --> 3482.52]  oh man
[3482.52 --> 3483.66]  news was really
[3483.66 --> 3484.70]  weak this week
[3484.70 --> 3485.76]  see what i did
[3485.76 --> 3486.02]  there
[3486.02 --> 3487.30]  same
[3487.30 --> 3488.34]  same sounding word
[3488.34 --> 3489.00]  different natural
[3489.00 --> 3489.32]  word
[3489.32 --> 3490.70]  people trying to
[3490.70 --> 3491.52]  squish on the subway
[3491.52 --> 3492.80]  and no examples
[3492.80 --> 3493.40]  whoa
[3493.40 --> 3494.14]  oh wait
[3494.14 --> 3497.02]  nope
[3497.02 --> 3498.64]  nope
[3498.64 --> 3500.08]  thanks
[3500.08 --> 3500.64]  and gadget
[3500.64 --> 3506.62]  yeah so there's
[3506.62 --> 3507.64]  no examples at
[3507.64 --> 3507.92]  all
[3507.92 --> 3510.56]  there's really not
[3510.56 --> 3511.44]  much else to say
[3511.44 --> 3512.70]  the examples are
[3512.70 --> 3514.16]  like if they decide to
[3514.16 --> 3514.84]  do it this way
[3514.84 --> 3516.46]  that would be cool
[3516.46 --> 3518.06]  so they're saying
[3518.06 --> 3519.28]  example if it has a map
[3519.28 --> 3520.00]  of london underground
[3520.00 --> 3521.12]  it could figure out
[3521.12 --> 3521.84]  the quickest path
[3521.84 --> 3522.74]  from stop to stop
[3522.74 --> 3523.36]  to tell you where
[3523.36 --> 3523.96]  you'd end up
[3523.96 --> 3525.08]  after following a
[3525.08 --> 3525.76]  route sequence
[3525.76 --> 3528.98]  meaning that google's
[3528.98 --> 3529.64]  memory based
[3529.64 --> 3530.54]  uh
[3530.54 --> 3531.34]  or memory boosted
[3531.34 --> 3531.88]  ai could
[3531.88 --> 3532.92]  help you get from
[3532.92 --> 3533.80]  train to train
[3533.80 --> 3534.34]  if you're wondering
[3534.34 --> 3535.00]  where to go
[3535.00 --> 3536.02]  to be completely
[3536.02 --> 3536.92]  honest i was in
[3536.92 --> 3537.76]  london not that long
[3537.76 --> 3538.32]  ago and their
[3538.32 --> 3538.92]  underground is
[3538.92 --> 3540.06]  pretty easy to
[3540.06 --> 3540.58]  figure out
[3540.58 --> 3541.58]  um
[3541.58 --> 3545.48]  but some of them
[3545.48 --> 3546.34]  aren't so that
[3546.34 --> 3546.92]  could be rather
[3546.92 --> 3547.28]  helpful
[3547.28 --> 3548.90]  um yeah
[3548.90 --> 3550.86]  that's that's
[3550.86 --> 3551.80]  pretty much all
[3551.80 --> 3552.86]  there is to that
[3552.86 --> 3553.74]  and then we only
[3553.74 --> 3554.76]  have one topic
[3554.76 --> 3555.14]  left
[3555.14 --> 3558.90]  but the show's
[3558.90 --> 3559.78]  like barely been
[3559.78 --> 3560.48]  going on for an
[3560.48 --> 3561.38]  hour so
[3561.38 --> 3563.48]  not entirely sure
[3563.48 --> 3564.20]  what i'm gonna do
[3564.20 --> 3564.58]  then
[3564.58 --> 3565.76]  colton like
[3565.76 --> 3566.82]  warned me today
[3566.82 --> 3567.56]  he was like
[3567.56 --> 3568.36]  there's not much
[3568.36 --> 3568.88]  in the dock
[3568.88 --> 3569.82]  because we ran
[3569.82 --> 3570.32]  out of power
[3570.32 --> 3570.92]  part right through
[3570.92 --> 3571.32]  the day
[3571.32 --> 3573.46]  so yeah
[3573.46 --> 3574.70]  um but
[3574.70 --> 3575.54]  anyways i'm gonna
[3575.54 --> 3576.60]  talk about a
[3576.60 --> 3577.90]  nikon dslr
[3577.90 --> 3579.16]  with sub-zero
[3579.16 --> 3580.28]  peltier cooling
[3580.28 --> 3581.48]  uh it says
[3581.48 --> 3582.78]  the astronomer's
[3582.78 --> 3583.72]  camera of choice
[3583.72 --> 3585.82]  okay
[3585.82 --> 3588.32]  why
[3588.32 --> 3590.62]  whoa
[3590.62 --> 3591.60]  okay look at
[3591.60 --> 3592.04]  this thing
[3592.04 --> 3593.40]  okay i finally
[3593.40 --> 3593.68]  have something
[3593.68 --> 3594.22]  cool to show
[3594.22 --> 3594.68]  you guys
[3594.68 --> 3595.66]  what
[3595.66 --> 3598.48]  that's nuts
[3598.48 --> 3603.32]  why would
[3603.32 --> 3604.06]  you need that
[3604.06 --> 3606.58]  oh my god
[3606.58 --> 3607.44]  that is crazy
[3607.44 --> 3610.60]  increasing image
[3610.60 --> 3611.78]  sensor sensitivity
[3611.78 --> 3612.58]  oh
[3612.58 --> 3613.96]  that's pretty
[3613.96 --> 3614.30]  cool
[3614.30 --> 3615.50]  i bet you
[3615.50 --> 3616.14]  brandon would
[3616.14 --> 3617.04]  be way more
[3617.04 --> 3618.20]  interesting to
[3618.20 --> 3619.52]  uh talk to
[3619.52 --> 3620.52]  about this
[3620.52 --> 3621.10]  because i have
[3621.10 --> 3621.84]  no idea why
[3621.84 --> 3622.38]  you would ever
[3622.38 --> 3623.78]  need a giant
[3623.78 --> 3624.60]  peltier cooler
[3624.60 --> 3625.40]  on your camera
[3625.40 --> 3626.90]  but he probably
[3626.90 --> 3627.28]  does
[3627.28 --> 3628.14]  there's a view
[3628.14 --> 3628.62]  from the front
[3628.62 --> 3629.04]  so you can see
[3629.04 --> 3629.60]  it sticking out of
[3629.60 --> 3629.96]  the back
[3629.96 --> 3631.02]  sensor cooling
[3631.02 --> 3631.78]  system for a
[3631.78 --> 3632.98]  very for very
[3632.98 --> 3633.76]  low electric
[3633.76 --> 3634.30]  noise
[3634.30 --> 3634.94]  gotcha that
[3634.94 --> 3635.50]  makes sense
[3635.50 --> 3638.50]  then it has
[3638.50 --> 3638.84]  like
[3638.84 --> 3640.46]  an anti-doing
[3640.46 --> 3641.12]  system
[3641.12 --> 3643.22]  modified filter
[3643.22 --> 3643.76]  for increased
[3643.76 --> 3644.32]  sensitivity
[3644.32 --> 3646.84]  used without
[3646.84 --> 3647.40]  battery
[3647.40 --> 3648.34]  okay
[3648.34 --> 3651.24]  interesting
[3651.24 --> 3653.84]  interesting
[3653.84 --> 3655.10]  i wish they
[3655.10 --> 3655.76]  had a video
[3655.76 --> 3661.24]  this is
[3661.24 --> 3661.80]  apparently an
[3661.80 --> 3662.34]  example of
[3662.34 --> 3662.70]  the kind
[3662.70 --> 3663.06]  of photos
[3663.06 --> 3663.34]  you can
[3663.34 --> 3663.74]  take with
[3663.74 --> 3663.88]  the
[3663.88 --> 3664.34]  nikon
[3664.34 --> 3666.90]  d5500a
[3666.90 --> 3667.62]  cooled
[3667.62 --> 3668.24]  camera
[3668.24 --> 3669.44]  with a
[3669.44 --> 3670.24]  refactor
[3670.24 --> 3670.88]  telescope
[3670.88 --> 3671.52]  attached to
[3671.52 --> 3671.94]  the front
[3671.94 --> 3674.14]  i mean
[3674.14 --> 3674.44]  it's a
[3674.44 --> 3674.64]  cool
[3674.64 --> 3675.06]  photo
[3675.06 --> 3677.92]  people are
[3677.92 --> 3678.32]  asking where
[3678.32 --> 3679.10]  linus is
[3679.10 --> 3679.64]  uh
[3679.64 --> 3680.08]  linus had
[3680.08 --> 3680.52]  a baby
[3680.52 --> 3682.40]  so for
[3682.40 --> 3682.98]  those who
[3682.98 --> 3683.78]  didn't catch
[3683.78 --> 3684.10]  the very
[3684.10 --> 3684.50]  beginning of
[3684.50 --> 3684.86]  the stream
[3684.86 --> 3686.10]  and i'm
[3686.10 --> 3686.42]  definitely
[3686.42 --> 3687.10]  buying time
[3687.10 --> 3687.68]  here because
[3687.68 --> 3688.18]  i haven't been
[3688.18 --> 3688.92]  doing wanshow
[3688.92 --> 3689.44]  long enough
[3689.44 --> 3689.86]  and there is
[3689.86 --> 3690.38]  no topics
[3690.38 --> 3690.70]  left
[3690.70 --> 3692.36]  um linus is
[3692.36 --> 3692.92]  out with a
[3692.92 --> 3693.32]  new baby
[3693.32 --> 3694.24]  he had his
[3694.24 --> 3695.00]  third baby
[3695.00 --> 3695.68]  everything went
[3695.68 --> 3696.36]  fine they're
[3696.36 --> 3697.02]  doing well
[3697.02 --> 3697.92]  but they are
[3697.92 --> 3698.42]  at home
[3698.42 --> 3699.44]  um so he
[3699.44 --> 3700.32]  was not at
[3700.32 --> 3702.04]  work um
[3702.04 --> 3702.96]  and then
[3702.96 --> 3704.12]  so linus and
[3704.12 --> 3704.72]  yvonne are
[3704.72 --> 3705.48]  both on
[3705.48 --> 3706.32]  maternity leave
[3706.32 --> 3706.96]  trying to take
[3706.96 --> 3707.38]  time to
[3707.38 --> 3707.80]  themselves
[3707.80 --> 3708.72]  and while
[3708.72 --> 3709.52]  they're gone
[3709.52 --> 3711.44]  all possible
[3711.44 --> 3712.16]  shit is hitting
[3712.16 --> 3712.62]  the fan
[3712.62 --> 3713.80]  so there's a
[3713.80 --> 3714.44]  giant
[3714.44 --> 3715.60]  giant storm
[3715.60 --> 3716.16]  let me see
[3716.16 --> 3716.46]  if i can
[3716.46 --> 3717.00]  actually find
[3717.00 --> 3717.32]  this
[3717.32 --> 3718.16]  fuck it
[3718.16 --> 3718.56]  i mean
[3718.56 --> 3719.08]  whoop
[3719.08 --> 3722.10]  oh
[3722.10 --> 3722.72]  i'm used
[3722.72 --> 3723.16]  to be able
[3723.16 --> 3724.08]  to swear
[3724.08 --> 3724.62]  when i'm
[3724.62 --> 3725.16]  streaming in
[3725.16 --> 3725.60]  this area
[3725.60 --> 3726.00]  because this
[3726.00 --> 3726.22]  is my
[3726.22 --> 3726.54]  personal
[3726.54 --> 3726.90]  streaming
[3726.90 --> 3727.34]  area
[3727.34 --> 3729.44]  i'm sorry
[3729.44 --> 3731.58]  okay
[3731.58 --> 3732.60]  um
[3732.60 --> 3735.08]  bc storm
[3735.08 --> 3740.58]  here we
[3740.58 --> 3740.96]  go
[3740.96 --> 3742.64]  here we
[3742.64 --> 3744.16]  here's a
[3744.16 --> 3744.64]  topic
[3744.64 --> 3745.34]  we're gonna
[3745.34 --> 3746.10]  move on
[3746.10 --> 3746.54]  uh
[3746.54 --> 3746.58]  75 000 customers
[3746.58 --> 3747.12]  without power
[3747.12 --> 3747.92]  at height of
[3747.92 --> 3748.54]  second
[3748.54 --> 3749.64]  um
[3749.64 --> 3750.96]  bc storm
[3750.96 --> 3752.26]  is this even
[3752.26 --> 3753.02]  what's happening
[3753.02 --> 3753.56]  right now
[3753.56 --> 3754.52]  yes this is an
[3754.52 --> 3755.38]  article from today
[3755.38 --> 3756.22]  so i did find
[3756.22 --> 3757.06]  the correct thing
[3757.06 --> 3757.96]  you can see
[3757.96 --> 3759.02]  trees being pulled
[3759.02 --> 3759.44]  out of the
[3759.44 --> 3760.38]  freaking ground
[3760.38 --> 3761.60]  trees falling
[3761.60 --> 3762.24]  over onto
[3762.24 --> 3763.50]  telephone lines
[3763.50 --> 3764.58]  i believe this is
[3764.58 --> 3764.98]  three different
[3764.98 --> 3765.58]  pictures of the
[3765.58 --> 3766.36]  same thing
[3766.36 --> 3767.04]  let's play this
[3767.04 --> 3767.92]  video from pat
[3767.92 --> 3768.40]  wong
[3768.40 --> 3770.40]  uh
[3770.40 --> 3771.72]  some waves
[3771.72 --> 3772.66]  and wind
[3772.66 --> 3773.44]  flying around
[3773.44 --> 3774.52]  uh anyways
[3774.52 --> 3775.44]  we don't have
[3775.44 --> 3776.18]  power at the
[3776.18 --> 3777.40]  office right now
[3777.40 --> 3778.74]  um so we
[3778.74 --> 3779.36]  weren't able to
[3779.36 --> 3780.10]  do the wanshow
[3780.10 --> 3780.90]  from the office
[3780.90 --> 3781.58]  we were going
[3781.58 --> 3782.36]  to do the wanshow
[3782.36 --> 3783.28]  from nick's house
[3783.28 --> 3784.92]  and i was going
[3784.92 --> 3785.82]  to co-stream
[3785.82 --> 3786.88]  it with either
[3786.88 --> 3787.38]  colton
[3787.38 --> 3787.90]  terran
[3787.90 --> 3788.56]  or nick
[3788.56 --> 3790.40]  um but then
[3790.40 --> 3792.10]  the problem
[3792.10 --> 3793.26]  with co-streaming
[3793.26 --> 3794.06]  it with colton
[3794.06 --> 3794.90]  terran or nick
[3794.90 --> 3796.10]  is that
[3796.10 --> 3797.68]  today i just
[3797.68 --> 3798.38]  got diagnosed
[3798.38 --> 3799.30]  with pneumonia
[3799.30 --> 3800.74]  a sinus
[3800.74 --> 3801.38]  infection
[3801.38 --> 3802.58]  and i have
[3802.58 --> 3803.20]  some problem
[3803.20 --> 3803.98]  with my neck
[3803.98 --> 3804.96]  which is causing
[3804.96 --> 3805.84]  muscle tightening
[3805.84 --> 3806.90]  which is being
[3806.90 --> 3807.96]  amplified by the
[3807.96 --> 3809.26]  coughing and
[3809.26 --> 3810.04]  the sneezing
[3810.04 --> 3810.88]  from the
[3810.88 --> 3811.62]  pneumonia and
[3811.62 --> 3812.04]  the sinus
[3812.04 --> 3812.56]  infection
[3812.56 --> 3813.66]  which is causing
[3813.66 --> 3814.20]  a headache
[3814.20 --> 3816.08]  boom
[3816.08 --> 3817.48]  triple whammy
[3817.48 --> 3820.12]  so giant storm
[3820.12 --> 3821.48]  baby just got
[3821.48 --> 3821.90]  here
[3821.90 --> 3823.56]  i'm sick
[3823.56 --> 3824.32]  literally three
[3824.32 --> 3824.98]  times over
[3824.98 --> 3827.36]  so that's why
[3827.36 --> 3827.98]  the show is
[3827.98 --> 3828.38]  here
[3828.38 --> 3831.18]  at my house
[3831.18 --> 3831.92]  and not
[3831.92 --> 3832.58]  somewhere else
[3832.58 --> 3833.58]  because i can't
[3833.58 --> 3834.50]  co-host it at
[3834.50 --> 3835.24]  somewhere else's
[3835.24 --> 3836.18]  at someone else's
[3836.18 --> 3837.24]  house because i
[3837.24 --> 3838.02]  will make them
[3838.02 --> 3839.18]  horribly horribly
[3839.18 --> 3839.62]  sick
[3839.62 --> 3841.52]  so uh
[3841.52 --> 3842.40]  yeah that's what
[3842.40 --> 3843.04]  we got for
[3843.04 --> 3843.36]  now
[3843.36 --> 3844.50]  back to
[3844.50 --> 3845.42]  uh
[3845.42 --> 3846.74]  video share
[3846.74 --> 3847.58]  this is talking
[3847.58 --> 3848.52]  more about the
[3848.52 --> 3849.04]  storm that's
[3849.04 --> 3849.74]  hitting bc
[3849.74 --> 3850.14]  here
[3850.14 --> 3851.56]  um
[3851.56 --> 3854.66]  apparently you
[3854.66 --> 3855.32]  can't see the
[3855.32 --> 3856.14]  dock there's a
[3856.14 --> 3856.74]  dock here
[3856.74 --> 3857.66]  because it's just
[3857.66 --> 3858.20]  covered up by
[3858.20 --> 3858.56]  water
[3858.56 --> 3859.58]  this storm that's
[3859.58 --> 3860.42]  hitting us is the
[3860.42 --> 3862.14]  remnants of a
[3862.14 --> 3863.78]  typhoon i believe
[3863.78 --> 3864.66]  it's the like
[3864.66 --> 3866.24]  typhoon's gone but
[3866.24 --> 3867.18]  energy from the
[3867.18 --> 3867.84]  typhoon is still
[3867.84 --> 3868.18]  coming
[3868.18 --> 3869.26]  apparently there's
[3869.26 --> 3869.86]  still a third
[3869.86 --> 3870.64]  storm on its
[3870.64 --> 3871.84]  way that's
[3871.84 --> 3872.42]  expected on
[3872.42 --> 3873.34]  saturday that's
[3873.34 --> 3875.22]  tomorrow when
[3875.22 --> 3876.02]  the remnants of
[3876.02 --> 3877.00]  super typhoon
[3877.00 --> 3878.40]  songda will be
[3878.40 --> 3879.22]  arriving then
[3879.22 --> 3881.16]  so there's gonna
[3881.16 --> 3881.72]  be even more
[3881.72 --> 3882.38]  power outages
[3882.38 --> 3883.48]  there's a lot of
[3883.48 --> 3884.36]  fire engines and
[3884.36 --> 3885.12]  stuff running around
[3885.12 --> 3885.60]  all over the
[3885.60 --> 3887.42]  place um i wish
[3887.42 --> 3888.16]  i didn't have
[3888.16 --> 3889.06]  pneumonia and a
[3889.06 --> 3889.88]  sinus infection and
[3889.88 --> 3890.52]  a neck problem
[3890.52 --> 3891.56]  because i'd love to
[3891.56 --> 3893.18]  be outside trying
[3893.18 --> 3894.72]  to haul trees off
[3894.72 --> 3896.14]  roads and make
[3896.14 --> 3896.66]  sure that people
[3896.66 --> 3897.70]  are okay i've
[3897.70 --> 3898.18]  already messaged
[3898.18 --> 3898.66]  my neighbors
[3898.66 --> 3899.54]  upstairs and
[3899.54 --> 3900.20]  told them like
[3900.20 --> 3901.54]  hey i've got
[3901.54 --> 3902.82]  non-perishable food
[3902.82 --> 3904.34]  and blankets and
[3904.34 --> 3904.90]  a lot of board
[3904.90 --> 3905.98]  games so if you
[3905.98 --> 3907.60]  guys if we run
[3907.60 --> 3908.38]  out of power we
[3908.38 --> 3909.14]  can kind of
[3909.14 --> 3910.08]  hubble up a
[3910.08 --> 3910.48]  little bit
[3910.48 --> 3911.28]  actually no we
[3911.28 --> 3911.80]  can't i have
[3911.80 --> 3912.48]  pneumonia forgot
[3912.48 --> 3913.24]  about that part
[3913.24 --> 3914.26]  i can give you
[3914.26 --> 3915.22]  guys board games
[3915.22 --> 3916.06]  and things if you
[3916.06 --> 3917.22]  need them um
[3917.22 --> 3917.94]  but then i was
[3917.94 --> 3918.44]  sure they were
[3918.44 --> 3919.24]  ready so i
[3919.24 --> 3919.82]  messaged them but
[3919.82 --> 3920.68]  i'm sure you're
[3920.68 --> 3921.72]  probably fine and
[3921.72 --> 3922.16]  they were like
[3922.16 --> 3923.24]  yep we're good
[3923.24 --> 3924.36]  we got lots of
[3924.36 --> 3925.30]  non-perishable food
[3925.30 --> 3926.26]  and blankets and
[3926.26 --> 3926.82]  board games and
[3926.82 --> 3927.32]  if you need
[3927.32 --> 3928.76]  those too so
[3928.76 --> 3929.56]  yeah between
[3929.56 --> 3930.48]  myself and the
[3930.48 --> 3931.12]  upstairs neighbors
[3931.12 --> 3932.56]  we'll all be
[3932.56 --> 3933.40]  fine don't worry
[3933.40 --> 3934.66]  about us um
[3934.66 --> 3937.14]  but yeah
[3937.14 --> 3938.14]  haul trees with
[3938.14 --> 3938.76]  your convertible
[3938.76 --> 3939.42]  no my
[3939.42 --> 3940.64]  convertible is
[3940.64 --> 3942.34]  super dead um
[3942.34 --> 3943.28]  i guess you
[3943.28 --> 3943.82]  haven't heard the
[3943.82 --> 3944.68]  updates there's a
[3944.68 --> 3945.36]  video i'm not
[3945.36 --> 3945.84]  going to link it
[3945.84 --> 3946.22]  because it's
[3946.22 --> 3946.80]  self-promotion
[3946.80 --> 3947.82]  whatever stuff but
[3947.82 --> 3948.38]  there's a video
[3948.38 --> 3949.76]  my fuel injectors
[3949.76 --> 3950.28]  and fuel pump
[3950.28 --> 3951.60]  blew up while i
[3951.60 --> 3952.24]  was on a bridge
[3952.24 --> 3952.96]  and now i have a
[3952.96 --> 3954.00]  new car it's it's
[3954.00 --> 3954.88]  been years man

[3957.78 --> 3958.76]  oh playstation
[3958.76 --> 3959.56]  vr someone does
[3959.56 --> 3960.24]  a playstation vr
[3960.24 --> 3961.10]  chat i'm really
[3961.10 --> 3962.42]  hurting for topics
[3962.42 --> 3963.24]  because i'm done
[3963.24 --> 3964.90]  the whole land show
[3964.90 --> 3965.82]  doc because nothing
[3965.82 --> 3966.60]  really happened this
[3966.60 --> 3968.24]  week um but
[3968.24 --> 3969.46]  yeah playstation vr
[3969.46 --> 3970.54]  we have an order in
[3970.54 --> 3972.20]  for that we will be
[3972.20 --> 3973.78]  checking it out um
[3973.78 --> 3975.22]  from what i've seen
[3975.22 --> 3976.54]  so far it's not
[3976.54 --> 3979.04]  going to uh blow
[3979.04 --> 3980.18]  my mind at all
[3980.18 --> 3982.42]  but it looks it
[3982.42 --> 3983.16]  looks it looks
[3983.16 --> 3984.96]  interesting i don't
[3984.96 --> 3986.20]  i don't like the
[3986.20 --> 3986.68]  idea that you
[3986.68 --> 3987.48]  can't turn around
[3987.48 --> 3991.52]  um but
[3991.52 --> 3993.52]  kind of bugs me
[3993.52 --> 3995.16]  yeah yeah
[3995.16 --> 3996.28]  on the spectrum
[3996.28 --> 3997.20]  of things here
[3997.20 --> 3998.10]  let's do
[3998.10 --> 4000.90]  let's do a
[4000.90 --> 4001.98]  land show first
[4001.98 --> 4003.88]  uh we're gonna do
[4003.88 --> 4005.00]  ghetto painting
[4005.00 --> 4005.72]  with luke
[4005.72 --> 4008.98]  so let's go video
[4008.98 --> 4009.42]  share
[4009.42 --> 4011.50]  so on the spectrum
[4011.50 --> 4012.20]  of vr
[4012.20 --> 4014.58]  you have
[4014.58 --> 4018.86]  uh let's go
[4018.86 --> 4020.64]  opaque
[4020.64 --> 4026.96]  oh man writing and
[4026.96 --> 4027.66]  paint is pretty
[4027.66 --> 4028.22]  difficult
[4028.22 --> 4032.10]  and transparent
[4032.10 --> 4038.52]  this is gonna be
[4038.52 --> 4039.20]  everyone's favorite
[4039.20 --> 4039.90]  part of the show
[4039.90 --> 4041.22]  right this is just
[4041.22 --> 4042.18]  the best thing
[4042.18 --> 4043.66]  that's ever happened
[4043.66 --> 4044.46]  on land show right
[4044.46 --> 4045.32]  totally
[4045.32 --> 4046.82]  hell yeah
[4046.82 --> 4049.22]  and then let's go
[4049.22 --> 4051.22]  uh
[4051.22 --> 4054.22]  free
[4054.22 --> 4057.76]  oh
[4057.76 --> 4059.32]  oh
[4059.32 --> 4061.16]  and then tethered
[4061.16 --> 4068.26]  so on this spectrum
[4068.26 --> 4068.98]  thing
[4068.98 --> 4070.16]  you've got like
[4070.16 --> 4071.28]  opaque and tethered
[4071.28 --> 4071.86]  so you've got
[4071.86 --> 4072.88]  okay so
[4072.88 --> 4074.04]  vive
[4074.04 --> 4075.38]  oculus
[4075.38 --> 4077.28]  um
[4077.28 --> 4078.04]  the
[4078.04 --> 4079.88]  sony
[4079.88 --> 4080.76]  thing
[4080.76 --> 4082.40]  and a few
[4082.40 --> 4082.90]  others
[4082.90 --> 4084.38]  on the
[4084.38 --> 4085.10]  oh okay so
[4085.10 --> 4085.86]  free doesn't mean
[4085.86 --> 4086.20]  like
[4086.20 --> 4087.88]  money free
[4087.88 --> 4088.50]  free means
[4088.50 --> 4089.40]  there's no tether
[4089.40 --> 4090.60]  um
[4090.60 --> 4091.86]  i was gonna do
[4091.86 --> 4092.50]  no tether
[4092.50 --> 4093.02]  and then i was like
[4093.02 --> 4093.76]  it's just too much
[4093.76 --> 4094.04]  writing
[4094.04 --> 4095.12]  uh so
[4095.12 --> 4096.40]  opaque and
[4096.40 --> 4096.96]  free
[4096.96 --> 4097.76]  you've got like
[4097.76 --> 4098.32]  the
[4098.32 --> 4099.30]  uh
[4099.30 --> 4100.00]  google
[4100.00 --> 4100.80]  dream
[4100.80 --> 4101.54]  thing
[4101.54 --> 4102.84]  and you've got
[4102.84 --> 4104.02]  samsung's
[4104.02 --> 4105.16]  gear vr
[4105.16 --> 4106.52]  uh
[4106.52 --> 4107.74]  transparent and
[4107.74 --> 4108.30]  tethered
[4108.30 --> 4109.38]  there is one of
[4109.38 --> 4109.80]  these
[4109.80 --> 4110.46]  but i don't
[4110.46 --> 4110.92]  remember what
[4110.92 --> 4111.70]  it's called
[4111.70 --> 4112.46]  and then
[4112.46 --> 4113.44]  transparent and
[4113.44 --> 4114.36]  no tethered
[4114.36 --> 4115.84]  you've got the
[4115.84 --> 4118.12]  microsoft hololens
[4118.12 --> 4119.38]  um
[4119.38 --> 4122.16]  wow that's
[4122.16 --> 4122.52]  terrible
[4122.52 --> 4124.36]  in this
[4124.36 --> 4124.92]  spectrum
[4124.92 --> 4125.82]  is where you're
[4125.82 --> 4126.98]  seeing most of
[4126.98 --> 4127.76]  the performance
[4127.76 --> 4128.64]  right now
[4128.64 --> 4129.42]  opaque and
[4129.42 --> 4129.96]  tethered
[4129.96 --> 4130.90]  so you've got
[4130.90 --> 4131.84]  like the vive
[4131.84 --> 4132.84]  and the oculus
[4132.84 --> 4133.68]  rift because
[4133.68 --> 4134.82]  they're tethered
[4134.82 --> 4135.44]  which is where
[4135.44 --> 4136.56]  you get a lot
[4136.56 --> 4137.50]  of the computational
[4137.50 --> 4138.22]  power
[4138.22 --> 4139.42]  um
[4139.42 --> 4139.88]  but
[4139.88 --> 4140.48]  they're
[4140.48 --> 4141.66]  opaque
[4141.66 --> 4142.92]  so they don't
[4142.92 --> 4143.84]  have to deal
[4143.84 --> 4144.46]  with the
[4144.46 --> 4145.58]  environment around
[4145.58 --> 4145.88]  you
[4145.88 --> 4146.48]  opaque
[4146.48 --> 4147.20]  okay so
[4147.20 --> 4147.90]  opaque and
[4147.90 --> 4148.32]  transparent
[4148.32 --> 4149.56]  is like
[4149.56 --> 4150.86]  if you have
[4150.86 --> 4151.92]  an oculus
[4151.92 --> 4152.50]  rift
[4152.50 --> 4155.18]  there's
[4155.18 --> 4156.06]  something blocking
[4156.06 --> 4156.68]  your vision
[4156.68 --> 4157.66]  so you can't
[4157.66 --> 4158.16]  see
[4158.16 --> 4159.48]  outwards
[4159.48 --> 4160.64]  with a
[4160.64 --> 4161.38]  hollow lens
[4161.38 --> 4162.68]  it's
[4162.68 --> 4163.38]  transparent
[4163.38 --> 4164.24]  so that you
[4164.24 --> 4164.74]  can see
[4164.74 --> 4165.34]  through it
[4165.34 --> 4165.66]  and you can
[4165.66 --> 4166.22]  still see the
[4166.22 --> 4166.68]  walls and
[4166.68 --> 4167.14]  people that are
[4167.14 --> 4167.70]  in the room
[4167.70 --> 4169.12]  opaque is
[4169.12 --> 4170.10]  non-transparent
[4170.10 --> 4170.78]  i just realized
[4170.78 --> 4171.38]  people might not
[4171.38 --> 4171.98]  know what opaque
[4171.98 --> 4173.22]  means so opaque
[4173.22 --> 4173.86]  means you can't
[4173.86 --> 4174.42]  see through it
[4174.42 --> 4175.14]  so when you're
[4175.14 --> 4175.94]  wearing a rift
[4175.94 --> 4177.22]  or a vive
[4177.22 --> 4178.20]  you purposefully
[4178.20 --> 4179.50]  cannot see the
[4179.50 --> 4179.96]  things that are
[4179.96 --> 4180.38]  in the room
[4180.38 --> 4180.90]  with you
[4180.90 --> 4182.14]  when you're
[4182.14 --> 4182.98]  wearing a
[4182.98 --> 4183.98]  microsoft hololens
[4183.98 --> 4185.14]  you can purposefully
[4185.14 --> 4186.00]  see the things
[4186.00 --> 4186.42]  that are in the
[4186.42 --> 4187.30]  room with you
[4187.30 --> 4188.72]  um
[4188.72 --> 4191.16]  halo lens
[4191.16 --> 4191.54]  is ar
[4191.54 --> 4192.18]  not vr
[4192.18 --> 4193.90]  uh
[4193.90 --> 4196.30]  you meant
[4196.30 --> 4197.64]  it's
[4197.64 --> 4198.12]  okay
[4198.12 --> 4205.54]  there's augmented
[4205.54 --> 4206.70]  virtual reality
[4206.70 --> 4208.66]  avr
[4208.66 --> 4210.84]  and then
[4210.84 --> 4211.58]  there's
[4211.58 --> 4213.84]  virtual
[4213.84 --> 4215.38]  because
[4215.38 --> 4216.44]  you can
[4216.44 --> 4217.54]  the definitions
[4217.54 --> 4218.10]  of all these
[4218.10 --> 4218.90]  things get very
[4218.90 --> 4219.36]  mixed up
[4219.36 --> 4219.98]  but this is just
[4219.98 --> 4220.64]  the graph of
[4220.64 --> 4221.24]  headsets
[4221.24 --> 4222.12]  not those
[4222.12 --> 4222.58]  things
[4222.58 --> 4224.08]  specifically
[4224.08 --> 4224.80]  don't worry
[4224.80 --> 4225.58]  about ar
[4225.58 --> 4226.06]  vr
[4226.06 --> 4226.38]  any like
[4226.38 --> 4226.68]  stuff
[4226.68 --> 4227.62]  this is just
[4227.62 --> 4228.76]  headsets
[4228.76 --> 4229.80]  um
[4229.80 --> 4230.96]  so with
[4230.96 --> 4231.82]  sony coming in
[4231.82 --> 4232.34]  here and doing
[4232.34 --> 4232.82]  this
[4232.82 --> 4234.20]  the main benefit
[4234.20 --> 4234.22]  the main benefit
[4234.22 --> 4234.70]  that you get
[4234.70 --> 4235.26]  from opaque
[4235.26 --> 4235.70]  tethered
[4235.70 --> 4236.26]  headsets
[4236.26 --> 4237.14]  is the
[4237.14 --> 4237.66]  performance
[4237.66 --> 4238.18]  side of
[4238.18 --> 4238.52]  things
[4238.52 --> 4240.10]  and the
[4240.10 --> 4240.86]  playstation 4
[4240.86 --> 4241.54]  doesn't have a
[4241.54 --> 4241.80]  ton of
[4241.80 --> 4242.44]  performance
[4242.44 --> 4248.04]  so
[4248.04 --> 4253.30]  i don't
[4253.30 --> 4253.98]  know
[4253.98 --> 4260.52]  avr
[4260.52 --> 4262.00]  ar
[4262.00 --> 4262.54]  is still
[4262.54 --> 4262.96]  vr
[4262.96 --> 4263.32]  but if
[4263.32 --> 4263.52]  it's
[4263.52 --> 4263.88]  ar
[4263.88 --> 4264.10]  and
[4264.10 --> 4264.44]  vr
[4264.44 --> 4264.64]  it's
[4264.64 --> 4264.82]  still
[4264.82 --> 4265.14]  ar
[4265.14 --> 4265.60]  yeah
[4265.60 --> 4266.44]  i know
[4266.44 --> 4267.30]  but there's
[4267.30 --> 4267.58]  other
[4267.58 --> 4268.12]  just
[4268.12 --> 4269.64]  don't worry
[4269.64 --> 4270.04]  about it
[4270.04 --> 4270.70]  like i said
[4270.70 --> 4271.04]  i was just
[4271.04 --> 4271.48]  talking about
[4271.48 --> 4272.06]  headsets in
[4272.06 --> 4272.40]  general
[4272.40 --> 4273.10]  calm your
[4273.10 --> 4273.38]  tits
[4273.38 --> 4273.70]  and sit
[4273.70 --> 4273.94]  down
[4273.94 --> 4275.20]  um
[4275.20 --> 4276.02]  man
[4276.02 --> 4276.46]  i have to
[4276.46 --> 4276.86]  remember that
[4276.86 --> 4277.18]  i'm not
[4277.18 --> 4277.66]  allowed to
[4277.66 --> 4278.20]  say
[4278.20 --> 4279.00]  swear words
[4279.00 --> 4279.44]  and stuff
[4279.44 --> 4280.38]  because it's
[4280.38 --> 4280.88]  the wancho
[4280.88 --> 4281.26]  still
[4281.26 --> 4283.84]  look look so

[4284.46 --> 4284.98]  of am i don't
[4284.98 --> 4285.34]  have any more
[4285.34 --> 4286.14]  topics to do
[4286.14 --> 4287.62]  the the doc is
[4287.62 --> 4288.48]  literally done
[4288.48 --> 4289.32]  but i haven't been
[4289.32 --> 4289.92]  streaming for that
[4289.92 --> 4290.44]  long so i don't
[4290.44 --> 4290.68]  know what i'm
[4290.68 --> 4291.88]  gonna talk about
[4291.88 --> 4292.22]  anymore
[4292.22 --> 4294.48]  i guess okay i'll
[4294.48 --> 4295.06]  talk about this
[4295.06 --> 4296.22]  i went down to
[4296.22 --> 4298.06]  microsoft um
[4298.06 --> 4299.58]  in redmond
[4299.58 --> 4300.52]  they're about three
[4300.52 --> 4302.10]  hours below us
[4302.10 --> 4302.76]  on the map
[4302.76 --> 4303.98]  so brian and i
[4303.98 --> 4304.88]  drove there last
[4304.88 --> 4305.76]  week to check
[4305.76 --> 4306.28]  them out
[4306.28 --> 4307.80]  uh we thought
[4307.80 --> 4308.34]  that we were going
[4308.34 --> 4309.02]  down there to check
[4309.02 --> 4309.80]  out a hololens
[4309.80 --> 4311.24]  demo and i was
[4311.24 --> 4312.72]  expecting they
[4312.72 --> 4313.68]  they told us that
[4313.68 --> 4314.08]  we weren't going
[4314.08 --> 4315.86]  to be allowed to
[4315.86 --> 4317.40]  uh film like at
[4317.40 --> 4319.56]  all which was
[4319.56 --> 4320.46]  gonna suck but i
[4320.46 --> 4321.02]  was gonna try to
[4321.02 --> 4323.22]  do like a hololens
[4323.22 --> 4324.40]  impressions video
[4324.40 --> 4327.42]  where i just use
[4327.42 --> 4329.24]  their b-roll and
[4329.24 --> 4329.82]  don't get to
[4329.82 --> 4331.14]  actually show you
[4331.14 --> 4333.42]  guys any of me
[4333.42 --> 4334.34]  actually trying it
[4334.34 --> 4334.68]  and i was like
[4334.68 --> 4335.06]  this is gonna be
[4335.06 --> 4336.12]  kind of weird but
[4336.12 --> 4336.94]  i really want to
[4336.94 --> 4337.96]  try hololens so
[4337.96 --> 4340.26]  whatever the
[4340.26 --> 4341.10]  hololens demo we
[4341.10 --> 4341.52]  ended up getting
[4341.52 --> 4342.16]  was only like two
[4342.16 --> 4342.74]  minutes long
[4342.74 --> 4343.48]  anyways i talked
[4343.48 --> 4343.90]  about that a
[4343.90 --> 4344.42]  little bit on a
[4344.42 --> 4346.06]  previous show but
[4346.06 --> 4347.70]  some things that we
[4347.70 --> 4348.60]  did get to see
[4348.60 --> 4350.88]  was their advanced
[4350.88 --> 4351.76]  prototyping and
[4351.76 --> 4352.42]  hardware engineering
[4352.42 --> 4353.80]  labs exclusive
[4353.80 --> 4355.38]  tour super cool
[4355.38 --> 4355.92]  went to go see
[4355.92 --> 4356.64]  that with judder
[4356.64 --> 4357.24]  from your average
[4357.24 --> 4358.20]  consumer and
[4358.20 --> 4359.22]  austin evans from
[4359.22 --> 4362.04]  austin evans um
[4362.04 --> 4363.44]  so that was
[4363.44 --> 4364.40]  awesome it was
[4364.40 --> 4364.84]  cool hanging out
[4364.84 --> 4365.44]  with those guys and
[4365.44 --> 4365.92]  it was cool checking
[4365.92 --> 4366.66]  that place out and
[4366.66 --> 4367.10]  there's a video
[4367.10 --> 4368.66]  coming about that
[4368.66 --> 4370.12]  whole deal soon
[4370.12 --> 4371.70]  it's pretty sweet
[4371.70 --> 4373.86]  um i it could
[4373.86 --> 4374.62]  have been better if
[4374.62 --> 4375.36]  i knew i was going
[4375.36 --> 4375.92]  to even be able to
[4375.92 --> 4376.56]  do that but they
[4376.56 --> 4377.26]  didn't tell us that
[4377.26 --> 4377.80]  that was happening
[4377.80 --> 4378.54]  before we went down
[4378.54 --> 4380.12]  so i wasn't ready for
[4380.12 --> 4381.06]  like a factory tour
[4381.06 --> 4381.58]  kind of deal
[4381.58 --> 4386.54]  so yeah could have
[4386.54 --> 4387.82]  been better but i
[4387.82 --> 4388.42]  hope that video will
[4388.42 --> 4389.50]  be pretty cool also
[4389.50 --> 4390.18]  we checked out the
[4390.18 --> 4392.44]  garage um which i
[4392.44 --> 4394.58]  will garage dot
[4394.58 --> 4397.96]  microsoft dot com
[4397.96 --> 4399.58]  which is this thing
[4399.58 --> 4403.36]  so like they have
[4403.36 --> 4405.28]  makerspaces on campus
[4405.28 --> 4406.88]  where employees are
[4406.88 --> 4408.40]  encouraged to like do
[4408.40 --> 4410.60]  cool stuff so you
[4410.60 --> 4411.54]  can go like all right
[4411.54 --> 4412.72]  let's look at mobile
[4412.72 --> 4415.50]  only so there's two
[4415.50 --> 4417.08]  completed garage apps
[4417.08 --> 4420.00]  called sprightly and
[4420.00 --> 4422.32]  kaizala i
[4422.32 --> 4423.42]  don't know what
[4423.42 --> 4424.36]  those are create
[4424.36 --> 4425.16]  catalog create
[4425.16 --> 4426.62]  catalogs e-cards and
[4426.62 --> 4427.52]  more for your business
[4427.52 --> 4428.38]  and personal needs
[4428.38 --> 4430.00]  okay i don't know
[4430.00 --> 4431.54]  but there's here let's
[4431.54 --> 4431.94]  look at what's
[4431.94 --> 4432.74]  currently being worked
[4432.74 --> 4434.24]  on so there's a huge
[4434.24 --> 4435.00]  run of projects in
[4435.00 --> 4435.88]  here right now i know
[4435.88 --> 4436.70]  okay i've seen this
[4436.70 --> 4437.80]  one before trip tracker
[4437.80 --> 4439.18]  so this one
[4439.18 --> 4442.32]  automatically maps all
[4442.32 --> 4443.00]  of your trips that
[4443.00 --> 4444.10]  you've done it it
[4444.10 --> 4445.52]  knows if you're driving
[4445.52 --> 4447.36]  running biking all
[4447.36 --> 4448.10]  that kind of stuff
[4448.10 --> 4448.94]  blah blah blah blah
[4448.94 --> 4450.54]  so if you went for a
[4450.54 --> 4451.42]  bike ride but like
[4451.42 --> 4452.78]  forgot to be like
[4452.78 --> 4454.58]  hey i'm going for a
[4454.58 --> 4456.20]  bike ride phone it
[4456.20 --> 4457.06]  can still track all
[4457.06 --> 4458.56]  all that for you
[4458.56 --> 4460.64]  um and luckily it's
[4460.64 --> 4462.18]  not super crazy
[4462.18 --> 4463.74]  insanely creepy
[4463.74 --> 4466.62]  um because you can
[4466.62 --> 4467.28]  turn it off
[4467.28 --> 4468.96]  which is fun
[4468.96 --> 4470.40]  being able to turn
[4470.40 --> 4471.10]  it off is great
[4471.10 --> 4472.24]  could you do a q a
[4472.24 --> 4474.18]  i can always do a q a
[4474.18 --> 4475.24]  just ask a question
[4475.24 --> 4477.52]  tag myself in chat

[4478.32 --> 4480.18]  in as lanus in this
[4480.18 --> 4481.66]  thing so if you do
[4481.66 --> 4483.04]  like an at tag for me

[4484.12 --> 4485.06]  up as like red or

[4486.34 --> 4487.40]  god now everyone knows
[4487.40 --> 4490.08]  that um but yeah you
[4490.08 --> 4490.88]  can just do that and
[4490.88 --> 4491.40]  then i'll see your
[4491.40 --> 4492.42]  question in chat and
[4492.42 --> 4493.40]  it'll be it'll be easy
[4493.40 --> 4496.78]  to do no big deal um
[4496.78 --> 4497.66]  but yeah they have
[4497.66 --> 4499.60]  tons of these my
[4499.60 --> 4501.58]  mustache dot net you

[4517.50 --> 4517.88]  god
[4517.88 --> 4528.98]  so many people talking
[4528.98 --> 4530.32]  about different things

[4542.98 --> 4544.26]  to be true or not
[4544.26 --> 4547.22]  redstone 2 windows 10

[4549.92 --> 4550.76]  idea what this is talking
[4550.76 --> 4552.56]  about windows 10
[4552.56 --> 4554.30]  redstone 2 is referred
[4554.30 --> 4555.38]  internally as version
[4555.38 --> 4556.22]  1703
[4556.22 --> 4562.98]  it's considered the biggest
[4562.98 --> 4564.98]  feature upgrade to come to
[4564.98 --> 4566.14]  windows 10 since it's
[4566.14 --> 4567.76]  launched since it's
[4567.76 --> 4569.80]  launched when is it
[4569.80 --> 4572.80]  coming spring of 2017
[4572.80 --> 4577.48]  okay holy crap i'm bored
[4577.48 --> 4578.98]  come on boys we need better
[4578.98 --> 4580.08]  news topics than that
[4580.08 --> 4581.82]  come on now
[4581.82 --> 4585.70]  forever ago in ltt there was a
[4585.70 --> 4587.70]  new video of a new set what
[4587.70 --> 4590.02]  is that what is what are you
[4590.02 --> 4590.96]  what
[4590.96 --> 4593.92]  when are you going to upgrade
[4593.92 --> 4595.20]  your new cpu still running a
[4595.20 --> 4596.96]  2600k right i am still running a
[4596.96 --> 4597.78]  2600k
[4597.78 --> 4601.78]  my upgrade to cpu will be
[4601.78 --> 4603.36]  happening fairly soon all the
[4603.36 --> 4604.56]  parts of my new personal rig are
[4604.56 --> 4604.92]  here
[4604.92 --> 4606.92]  um but i didn't think they're
[4606.92 --> 4607.90]  going to be here until the end
[4607.90 --> 4609.52]  of november so the mod that i
[4609.52 --> 4611.18]  want to do to the case is still
[4611.18 --> 4613.58]  gonna take a little while
[4613.58 --> 4615.24]  um so
[4615.24 --> 4620.14]  yeah i don't know if i want to
[4620.14 --> 4622.26]  just show building the computer
[4622.26 --> 4625.64]  uh in a very normal way by just
[4625.64 --> 4627.18]  kind of plugging things in that
[4627.18 --> 4628.84]  are really expensive and then being
[4628.84 --> 4632.14]  like hey personal rig update i i
[4632.14 --> 4633.68]  think people will be like yo that's
[4633.68 --> 4635.40]  pretty boring uh so i kind of want
[4635.40 --> 4638.40]  to do the mod as well and the mod is
[4638.40 --> 4640.06]  going to be rather difficult and
[4640.06 --> 4641.52]  sourcing the stuff for it is going
[4641.52 --> 4642.44]  to be rather difficult
[4642.44 --> 4644.44]  um so
[4644.44 --> 4648.02]  yeah it's going to take a little bit
[4648.02 --> 4650.14]  but it should be before the end of
[4650.14 --> 4653.42]  november that you guys okay that my
[4653.42 --> 4654.62]  personal rig update is done
[4654.62 --> 4657.28]  i don't know when you guys are going
[4657.28 --> 4659.88]  to see it because of editing queue and
[4659.88 --> 4662.34]  vessel queue and waiting for all the
[4662.34 --> 4664.06]  other things to get out of the way queue
[4664.06 --> 4667.06]  and then youtube and blah blah blah
[4667.06 --> 4669.92]  but the video should be done before
[4669.92 --> 4673.42]  the end of november anyways guys i
[4673.42 --> 4676.44]  think that's going to be it for the
[4676.44 --> 4676.98]  wan show
[4676.98 --> 4681.52]  um honestly i am exhausted from all the
[4681.52 --> 4683.06]  different various ways that i'm sick
[4683.06 --> 4685.00]  and there's no more topics left and
[4685.00 --> 4686.60]  there hasn't been for the last 20
[4686.60 --> 4689.26]  freaking minutes so i am going to end
[4689.26 --> 4691.76]  the stream um also i need to fight
[4691.76 --> 4693.26]  through figuring out how to even
[4693.26 --> 4694.72]  upload this thing because usually i
[4694.72 --> 4696.38]  don't do that usually linus does that
[4696.38 --> 4699.00]  um i even screwed up a bit of the
[4699.00 --> 4700.84]  pre-show by not putting a youtube
[4700.84 --> 4702.60]  video up that the show was live which
[4702.60 --> 4704.28]  is probably why there isn't very many
[4704.28 --> 4705.06]  viewers right now
[4705.06 --> 4708.26]  anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this
[4708.98 --> 4715.64]  speaking of not feeling great uh yeah
[4715.64 --> 4718.78]  i will be someone just asked if i'm
[4718.78 --> 4720.44]  streaming yes i will be doing my
[4720.44 --> 4722.64]  stream i don't know if i'm gonna run
[4722.64 --> 4725.16]  out of power or not so i don't know
[4725.16 --> 4726.70]  how that's gonna go but i will be doing
[4726.70 --> 4729.34]  my stream not immediately because i need
[4729.34 --> 4731.80]  to take some drugs that i have for my
[4731.80 --> 4734.28]  pneumonia stuff and i need to get this
[4734.28 --> 4735.66]  all uploaded and make sure that i do it
[4735.66 --> 4737.76]  properly because the archive is important
[4737.76 --> 4741.64]  so yes see you guys later after party
[4741.64 --> 4743.38]  will be happening and it will be like an
[4743.38 --> 4746.06]  actual after party this time because i
[4746.06 --> 4747.64]  just hosted the show and stuff so we
