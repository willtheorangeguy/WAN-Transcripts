[0.00 --> 9.88]  okay so uh we'll start the show with the traditional apology i'm sorry for being late
[9.88 --> 19.52]  yep however whoa we're really late yeah okay it's actually my fault this time i think it's
[19.52 --> 23.82]  mostly your fault i could have been more prepared but i've been working on a video that i'm like
[23.82 --> 29.60]  really really excited about and i kind of got carried away doing a last minute processor swap
[29.60 --> 35.98]  so that i could like see more numbers when i'm done the wan show and be all excited about how wrong
[35.98 --> 41.36]  that i was for my side of things people might be slightly excited people often complain about
[41.36 --> 48.70]  multi-part content and wanting really long videos you're getting one it took them like half an hour
[48.70 --> 55.28]  to film one video i think it was more than one it was was it really i started filming at about
[55.28 --> 63.08]  okay so i think it was half an hour for one video 15 minutes yeah so but that half an hour video
[63.08 --> 70.96]  wasn't like six takes of a five minute video no that was like probably about a 17 minute 18 minute video
[70.96 --> 78.94]  so all like deep dive technical yep basically if you're upset that we haven't really talked much
[78.94 --> 84.06]  about vulcan and direct x12 luke took it upon himself to make up for lost time
[84.06 --> 92.06]  by spending a lot of time working on one ginormous thing that will hopefully cover us for like
[92.06 --> 103.04]  at least a while yes oh geez um so the one that i'm working on is actually um about the most wrong
[103.04 --> 113.58]  that i have been about how to configure a computer in probably a decade like we're talking i spent you
[113.58 --> 121.42]  know three times as much on a component that performs 60 as well as something else that i could have bought
[121.42 --> 130.18]  wow like i i done goofed i done goofed and and you guys are gonna you guys are gonna find this
[130.18 --> 134.96]  super hilarious i'm sure people love that stuff yeah yeah you guys are gonna find this like super
[134.96 --> 143.20]  hilarious for sure because the machine or machines in question were actually the subject of multi-part
[143.20 --> 150.62]  videos previously on the channel and are a key component of our editing workflow here at linus
[150.62 --> 155.20]  media group are you gonna have a multi-part video explaining why your previous multi-part video was bad
[155.20 --> 161.84]  no i think i'm just gonna i think i'm just gonna no says yes no taryn's wrong i think it's just
[161.84 --> 170.36]  gonna be the one video and i'm gonna i'm gonna quantify everything that's wrong um count in chat go
[170.36 --> 179.48]  whatever doritos doritos is illuminati i don't even i don't i think that there's a cultural gap
[179.48 --> 189.60]  between me and twitch chat okay not to like anyways uh my twitch chat after the wan show
[189.60 --> 195.80]  yeah is drastically different than the wan show twitch chat so it has far less cancer or more cancer
[195.80 --> 200.90]  far less far less it's like slow it's a slow check is like a fraction of the people are there
[200.90 --> 206.54]  but then like they're like talking about computer topics and like everyone's on point like when i
[206.54 --> 209.90]  screw up in the game there will be some guys like haha and then other people will be like you got
[209.90 --> 216.02]  it next time and like it's completely like everyone's really nice like you know you're jinxing it right
[216.02 --> 220.28]  now though right probably like like you you know what's gonna happen in your after part are you
[220.28 --> 225.68]  doing an after party stream tonight yeah but they'll forget by then so the internet never forgets
[225.68 --> 232.42]  it's like an elephant okay it's a series of elephant tubes it depends the internet both forgets extremely
[232.42 --> 237.48]  quickly and never forgets because like oh yeah guys this game sucked let's never pre-order another
[237.48 --> 246.46]  game whoa this new game looks really cool is that a new call of duty yeah is it with old guns this time
[246.46 --> 250.72]  hey no one's told us anything really about no man's sky let's all pre-order
[250.72 --> 263.10]  um all right so we got a lot of great topics for you guys today i feel like i feel like okay okay i feel
[263.10 --> 274.06]  like two things one i feel like the wan show is gonna have as its first primary topic from now until early
[274.06 --> 283.00]  2017 when it launches some kind of news about amd zen and number two is i'm feeling the battered wife
[283.00 --> 288.44]  syndrome a little bit right now because this is how amd behaved every other time they launched something
[288.44 --> 299.50]  that was unexceptional the hype train for zen is so strong between the leaks and the leaks like the actual
[299.50 --> 307.08]  leaks and the ones where amd is just like you want to see you want to see one benchmark can i just see
[307.08 --> 311.54]  one benchmark you know between between we almost just got banned off twitch i didn't show i didn't
[311.54 --> 315.58]  show the nip i didn't show the nip i just i just i was teasing the nip i wasn't showing the nip he
[315.58 --> 319.66]  actually even like covered it so that he couldn't screw up and i could not get kicked off of twitch
[319.66 --> 325.66]  for that unless twitch altered their rules to be like don't be weird on twitch but they would ban
[325.66 --> 330.96]  everyone everybody gone everyone's gone everyone in the chat you're gone the entire creative section
[330.96 --> 340.26]  just like implodes immediately half the staff gone yeah yeah um so we've got some more news about zen
[340.26 --> 348.96]  uh we've also got what's inside microsoft's hololens and how it works no this is not a video where
[348.96 --> 355.86]  uh you know my buddy cuts open the hololens i actually met the what's inside yeah i tell you
[355.86 --> 359.32]  that i was just gonna say you i think buddy is a strong word but i met him met him once yeah i
[359.32 --> 364.32]  haven't met his son though you can now say that you are deep friends deep friend yes i can now say
[364.32 --> 371.20]  that i know an internet celebrity yeah what else we got for time i do too i've met day nine before
[371.20 --> 379.64]  dagger right right through my heart that was actually a really cool moment anyways uh we also
[379.64 --> 387.62]  have pci express 4.0 uh which brings 16 or well okay the main part that i like is 300 watts at the
[387.62 --> 393.76]  slot or not like the main interesting part i don't know that i like that i'm doing my door i'm doing my
[393.76 --> 401.14]  pci express 4.0 excitement you like the 300 watts thing okay he just wants to dance i think at this
[401.14 --> 402.26]  point also
[402.26 --> 418.16]  which is actually really cool i don't know if that's like super directly related to what we normally talk
[418.16 --> 419.02]  about intro
[423.76 --> 428.30]  apparently the 300 watts
[428.30 --> 445.98]  i think
[445.98 --> 453.14]  cool and master for full info but what what is this what does this even mean
[453.14 --> 458.88]  i guess you'll have to stay tuned to find out if you want to know about the company like who the
[458.88 --> 464.48]  ceo is what they're like the mission statement is and stuff go to coolermaster.com and click the
[464.48 --> 468.42]  hopefully exists about us button if they were smarter they would have just named the company
[468.42 --> 472.64]  after the ceo and then you wouldn't even have to go to the website to know the ceo's name
[472.64 --> 479.46]  you would just have to know what the website is or the youtube channel or the twitter handle
[479.46 --> 484.10]  but your last name or the facebook page so what if it's torvalds or what if it's media
[484.10 --> 489.26]  your last you should legally change your last name to linus media
[489.26 --> 492.36]  change your middle name to tech
[492.36 --> 496.28]  linus tech media group
[496.28 --> 497.84]  sebastian
[497.84 --> 499.02]  ho
[499.02 --> 501.84]  there you go add them all in there
[501.84 --> 508.80]  all right um what are we talking about i don't even i don't even know i feel like this week
[509.36 --> 517.92]  has just been crazy like i filmed six videos this week um we're trying to we're trying to build up a
[517.92 --> 524.56]  buffer for when as some of you know i'm having another small human join my family very very shortly
[524.56 --> 529.52]  you're insane you didn't know that oh i knew that oh i was just insane i was like how did you not know
[529.52 --> 535.92]  that you know that's why we're busting our butts right now right so i'll be taking hopefully a few
[535.92 --> 542.64]  weeks off when that happens uh close to the end of september um and the idea is that by that time
[542.64 --> 548.72]  luke and i will have built up enough of a content buffer that they can get by without me just fine
[548.72 --> 554.48]  without missing any of our daily uploads and without luke uh being at the office literally 16 hours a day
[554.48 --> 558.64]  like i'm pretty sure was the case last time i tried to go anywhere or do anything yeah
[560.32 --> 562.80]  pulled double shifts i mean i was two people that was
[566.88 --> 572.00]  i mean okay that was also a particularly horrible situation because that was right
[572.00 --> 577.60]  so aside from trying to create a buffer for me to be gone we were creating the buffer to launch vessel
[578.24 --> 582.88]  and during that while you were gone we launched vessel and i had to do like
[582.88 --> 589.04]  oh yeah tons of stuff for that yeah let's just say not everyone was happy about the vessel launch
[590.00 --> 595.20]  and someone had to do damage control and my internet we could go back and find the tweets
[595.20 --> 601.76]  of my internet it wasn't just me to be clear just like nick light was huge during that if anyone was on
[601.76 --> 606.64]  the forums really you're gonna go after his weight when you're trying to be nice to him
[608.24 --> 615.28]  if anything he weighed less then he was wow he was servicing questions he's watching the show
[616.72 --> 625.28]  oh god he's been taking shots at me for being old okay okay which is something i have less control over
[625.28 --> 631.04]  you know you didn't even call out that it was like your birthday really oh no not really yeah
[631.04 --> 635.76]  you had the cake there but you didn't talk about it oh yeah i had cake i forgot to eat it and it was
[635.76 --> 639.92]  like out in the hot warehouse the whole time we were on one show i was just like nope this is awful
[641.04 --> 647.60]  well it had that stuff yeah probably awful anyways fondant fondant yeah fondant should be banned
[647.60 --> 655.68]  it shouldn't be called food yeah because it's awful i mean with that said plasticine material two two of
[655.68 --> 662.08]  the most memorable cakes i've ever had were made out of fondant there was the noctua fan from the uh
[662.08 --> 670.16]  from the forum guys and then there was the tv cake fan is that the one tv cake yeah it had a tv on top i
[670.16 --> 675.04]  don't know if you look that closely it was from lg you know those guys they're just like they're crazy if
[675.04 --> 683.68]  they can make a linus from something they seem to just do it yeah socks yeah like a box of cake i
[683.68 --> 690.00]  actually still have all those socks i i part of me wants to wear well they're it's funny because
[690.00 --> 696.56]  they're like thin they're like dress socks but they're hideous oh so i'm kind of sitting here going
[696.56 --> 708.56]  what are you where did they find you what are you for yeah what what do you do i pass butter oh
[709.28 --> 714.96]  you pass butter that's a don't it the conversation actually goes the other way it's like what do i do
[714.96 --> 720.80]  it says you pass butter yeah oh god it's from rick and morty okay don't worry about it okay
[720.80 --> 729.44]  cool all right so our original article here is from extreme it's like tech but extreme extreme
[729.44 --> 735.20]  we should change it to like linus extreme tech tips linus tech tips extreme tech tip media extreme
[735.20 --> 738.88]  linus sebastian it's more linus than you can handle
[738.88 --> 750.08]  um all right so basically in a nutshell uh amd unveiled some information at hot chips
[751.44 --> 759.68]  um about the upcoming zen cpu core and architecture uh zen's design goals are to intelligently share
[759.68 --> 765.92]  resources between cpu cores while simultaneously hitting higher frequencies and higher execution
[765.92 --> 772.08]  efficiencies than amd's previous cpu core k10 which is good because if they had been hoping to hit
[772.08 --> 779.04]  lower frequencies while not sharing resources between cores and being less efficient then that
[779.04 --> 783.12]  would be a terrible goal i'm glad amd is clarifying these things a lot of this stuff is that way i mean
[783.12 --> 789.92]  i was wondering i have to confess i was wondering like when we went from uh what was that flagship six
[789.92 --> 795.52]  core that they actually they uh they replaced with the fx whatever you can stand can't remember what
[795.52 --> 800.56]  you don't have to not be in the camera it's fine shoot what was it when they introduced a new
[800.56 --> 805.44]  architecture that was actually clock for clock worse than the previous one i can't can't remember
[805.44 --> 815.20]  anymore it was the 10 10 90. i try to not remember oh yeah 10 90t had better ipc than the fx 8 core that
[815.20 --> 822.08]  followed it and i was just kind of like how did you pull that off um there's there's other like
[822.08 --> 826.72]  relatively like okay i hope that would happen considering you haven't released a processor in
[826.72 --> 834.16]  this long like faster l2 cache faster l3 cache larger everything yeah two threads per core which
[834.16 --> 842.24]  we already knew yeah so it'll have not hyper threading yeah it'll smt yes um what else we got branch
[842.24 --> 847.92]  mispredict has been simultaneous multi-threading just in case you didn't uh larger retire eight ops like the
[847.92 --> 854.96]  brand ambiguous term quad issue full point unit better cache system lower power aggressive clock
[854.96 --> 864.96]  gating with multi-level regions um a lot of this is like stuff that too vague is my criticism because
[864.96 --> 868.88]  like obviously these things are going to be better i would really hope they would be considering you're
[868.88 --> 873.12]  saying that they're going to compete with modern intel processors so they would need to be better than what
[873.12 --> 880.08]  you had before so there's a bunch of like slides and stuff if you want to see them so why don't you
[880.08 --> 891.52]  slide sorry oh slide sorry i'll stop singing that now um so there you go uh zen will be really good
[892.08 --> 897.12]  we promise this time yay all right next up this was originally posted on the forum by
[897.12 --> 904.80]  op it's me is that their name or is colton trying to say he would be original poster yeah okay it's
[904.80 --> 910.40]  probably the person who posted is the name all right so the original article here is from tom's
[910.40 --> 920.08]  hardware uh uh mic cracking popping stuff um fix the mic audio is cracking there's like enough people
[920.08 --> 928.40]  spamming it that it might actually be true or maybe not um are we just leaning too close to it maybe
[929.20 --> 929.60]  okay
[932.00 --> 940.48]  because i can like sort of hear it somewhat in my ears okay um is it still popping if i'm back here nope
[940.48 --> 945.44]  i don't think so is it popping if i'm here not right now no okay
[949.44 --> 950.16]  rencho
[952.72 --> 957.36]  i mean i didn't change anything but that doesn't mean it's completely impossible that someone came
[957.36 --> 962.80]  onto the set and moved dials around just because they hate me personally i mean there's enough people
[962.80 --> 969.60]  working here now that it is possible but even if only half of them hated me there's enough people that
[969.60 --> 974.88]  you know someone might that's i don't think any i don't think anyone who works here hates me brandon
[975.68 --> 982.16]  you know yeah i'm not convinced brandon can hate yeah goodbye unless it's like a really shitty sd card
[985.52 --> 992.80]  yeah brandon is not not a huge fan of uh bad sd cards yeah all right let's talk what's inside oops
[993.60 --> 998.72]  oh i don't know what i had on my screen that whole time well hopefully nothing incriminating
[998.72 --> 1002.56]  what's inside microsoft's hololens and how it works
[1004.80 --> 1011.28]  kind of kind of so there's an oled screen which is not super surprising uh the components of the
[1012.24 --> 1016.64]  optical optical i've done way too many videos in the last little bit the components of the optical
[1016.64 --> 1024.24]  system break down into micro display imaging optics waveguide combiner cool and gratings that perform
[1024.24 --> 1032.32]  uh exit people expansion they're the the like the the compute inside of it contains a custom main
[1032.32 --> 1040.00]  board so we're not really going to know what is up with that 64 gigs of emmc uh 2 gigs of lp ddr3 ram
[1040.00 --> 1048.96]  it's based on x86 and runs so surprisingly windows 10 um it has a cherry trail soc wi-fi bluetooth
[1048.96 --> 1055.84]  connectivity and four microphones i'm not entirely sure why there's four microphones so with a vr head
[1055.84 --> 1061.76]  mounted display you've effectively got two tiny monitors that are millimeters from your face
[1062.72 --> 1070.96]  by contrast the hololens spits out a projected image which is then combined diffracted and layered
[1070.96 --> 1078.08]  to produce images that you can see within a space yeah you have to do that type of projection stuff at least
[1078.08 --> 1085.84]  right now in order to um create the hologram like effect so right now the hologram like effect can
[1085.84 --> 1092.16]  be created several meters away which is probably why they do all of these demos like in a house
[1092.16 --> 1096.16]  yeah you're not going to be you're not going to be projecting holograms you're not going to see
[1096.16 --> 1102.64]  charizard on a mountain yeah yeah sorry what on a mountain charizard charizard okay it's like the the
[1102.64 --> 1107.68]  pokemon go trailers i thought you said joan of arc and i was like i don't know what well so i had my
[1107.68 --> 1113.04]  headphones in because i was okay yeah i'm not going to see joan of arc on a mountain it's like it's
[1113.04 --> 1120.40]  like usually when i have a wet dream that's not how it goes i don't think joan of arc was a sex symbol
[1121.04 --> 1128.56]  no no no i mean it's possible you know clone high okay yeah like if you're really into tunes or whatever
[1128.56 --> 1132.88]  yeah um sorry what are we talking about apparently okay sensors so
[1132.88 --> 1138.72]  there's there's a sensor bar you guys wait okay can we straw poll for a quick second do they know
[1138.72 --> 1146.08]  what clone high is i i don't know i'd sure i'll drop a straw poll actually you can do them now because
[1146.08 --> 1153.84]  we can screen share you but it's okay i'm already doing it okay clone hi yes no turn it
[1153.84 --> 1163.44]  okay here we go let's see what we got i just because like i really i wonder now okay guys hit
[1163.44 --> 1168.64]  that straw poll hit that straw poll i've been wondering lately like how out of date some of
[1168.64 --> 1175.20]  our references may be i know i know i i i am out of date any reference to me feels inherently the
[1175.20 --> 1180.72]  majority says no wow there are more trump voters in our audience today than you said trump
[1181.36 --> 1188.56]  i said include turn up no that definitely peaked a little by the way yeah okay so we have more trump
[1188.56 --> 1192.08]  voters and i thought we didn't have any trump voters left i thought they all hated me
[1193.36 --> 1201.76]  either for being canadian or for building a computer trump themed pc i am sort of surprised that didn't like
[1202.64 --> 1209.44]  get trending somewhere for political reason i am i'm a little surprised myself that video just
[1210.00 --> 1214.40]  largely seem to have been disliked by everyone trump supporters and non-trump supporters alike
[1215.52 --> 1224.08]  just like go back to canadian politics talk about justin trudeau like okay he boxes and not that many
[1224.08 --> 1232.80]  things interesting happen in canada well there was elbow gate which is you know i love it god i think i
[1232.80 --> 1233.68]  think i just got triggered
[1237.68 --> 1244.08]  all right back to hololens so there's a sensor bar on the hololens that's comprised of four
[1244.08 --> 1251.60]  environment understanding cameras two on each side so there's a depth camera an ambient light sensor
[1252.32 --> 1258.32]  and a two megapixel photo slash hd video camera some of these are off the shelf parts while microsoft
[1258.32 --> 1263.44]  built the others so when you first said environment understanding cameras like i get it but i wasn't
[1263.44 --> 1268.16]  shifted back into talking about the hololens yet so i thought it was like they're not environmentally
[1268.16 --> 1273.04]  friendly but they get that they're not environmentally friendly and it's okay are you getting triggered
[1273.04 --> 1283.04]  some more like is this just no oh dear no no that's fine um so the environment sensing cameras provide
[1283.04 --> 1288.56]  the basis for head tracking because if you're going to project images out there they have to rotate and
[1288.56 --> 1294.08]  they have to change in size uh according to how you move your head around so that's why you need these
[1294.08 --> 1299.20]  cameras uh there's a time of flight so the time of flight depth cameras serve two roles they help with
[1299.20 --> 1305.44]  hand tracking and they perform surface reconstruction these sensors work with the optics module and the
[1305.44 --> 1314.96]  imu so that's pretty cool i guess um the word on the street as because all of this is just like for
[1314.96 --> 1320.24]  us because we don't have a unit uh for us this is just kind of like cool that sounds like a lot of
[1320.24 --> 1327.04]  cool technology um but the word on the street is luke might get a chance to try it maybe which i'm
[1327.04 --> 1333.84]  really interested in because it's another computer on your head thing right which is but it's like
[1334.40 --> 1340.64]  an excessively expensive one right maybe they'll do it right and it's also not trying because well
[1340.64 --> 1345.52]  the head mounted computer it's not trying to do full vr yeah and the head mounted computer too
[1346.32 --> 1353.28]  is not about it not being expensive you could build the most expensive head mounted computer and it
[1353.28 --> 1360.16]  wouldn't overcome any of the problems you or i have with it yeah the weight the heat the size it
[1360.16 --> 1365.84]  it might help those things but not overcome them yeah wouldn't overcome them for sure whereas this
[1365.84 --> 1373.04]  isn't trying to be that the projections that it puts in front of you don't need to be rendered on dual
[1373.04 --> 1378.56]  gtx titan xps in order for them to look good and you don't have to render an entire field of vision
[1378.56 --> 1383.60]  scene yes you just have to render parts of it and stuff like it should this does make more sense
[1385.20 --> 1390.56]  but it also since the very beginning i don't know about you but to me has felt like this weird snake
[1390.56 --> 1397.12]  oil combination where it has like existed and not really existed and like they they did this one like
[1397.12 --> 1401.76]  they they showed it off and then they didn't really talk about it for a long time and then they don't
[1401.76 --> 1407.28]  talk about it for a long time it's just like what what is this thing yeah i guess it feels kind of like
[1407.28 --> 1412.88]  um it feels kind of like you know one of those games that's in development forever where they
[1412.88 --> 1419.12]  kind of like they show off like a working demo at some point really early on yeah and then it's like
[1419.12 --> 1424.00]  where did it go and then a year later it's a completely different game because yeah it's not
[1424.00 --> 1428.56]  an rts anymore it's like a it's a first person shooter now do you remember the presence demo i don't
[1428.56 --> 1432.88]  know if i showed it to you no the hololens presence demo they did they did this thing where they they
[1432.88 --> 1438.88]  were in two very different rooms but they put furniture and stuff in the same locations yeah i
[1438.88 --> 1443.04]  did see i did see the presence yeah i thought you were talking about a game demo no no no i thought
[1443.04 --> 1448.00]  you meant oh that makes sense yeah did you see the presence demo yeah i know i got you no um but
[1448.00 --> 1453.28]  basically what they did starcraft ghost they made it so that because the furniture was in the same
[1453.28 --> 1457.60]  positions and a lot of it was like dense furniture so it wouldn't squish when people sat in it um but
[1457.60 --> 1461.76]  people could sit around in this room and as long as they didn't sit on each other because that would
[1461.76 --> 1467.68]  be possible um or even if they did i mean hey but the future is uh future is exciting the future is
[1467.68 --> 1474.48]  accepting um so like you could sit in a room and have like what they were displaying was like a family
[1474.48 --> 1481.92]  gathering like with your with people all over the world and like that's super holy crap really cool but
[1481.92 --> 1488.08]  what they showed it often was like this incredibly expensive cameras all over the place custom room
[1488.08 --> 1493.20]  yes and you had to have the exact same version of it in multiple places around the world and like this
[1493.20 --> 1498.40]  insanely expensive headset and all this kind of stuff and it was like one little demo that like some
[1498.40 --> 1505.84]  engineers did in a back room and then it's just gone i'm just like what like what's so cool where did
[1505.84 --> 1512.80]  it go i don't oh i don't know so i would i would love to see your thoughts or see hear your thoughts
[1512.80 --> 1517.68]  on it um i could yeah it could be both we do make videos that is sort of a thing that we do yeah i really
[1517.68 --> 1524.64]  hope we get to check it out because i'm rather excited all right speaking of things that i am excited
[1524.64 --> 1534.16]  about the op is it's me i'll show you the link and the original article is from tom's hardware
[1536.48 --> 1546.00]  pci express 4.0 because i was really feeling like pci express 3.0 were you was just not web 2.0 enough
[1546.00 --> 1554.00]  were you from a consumer standpoint actually no yeah no i'm not feeling like that at all i feel like
[1554.00 --> 1561.84]  if anything this is going to be completely meaningless for the general consumer um
[1561.84 --> 1570.88]  um we're already at the point where unless you're running more than two graphics cards in sli or
[1570.88 --> 1578.24]  crossfire there is almost nothing you could put in your computer that would give you any reason to
[1578.24 --> 1584.40]  need more than the pci express bandwidth that's already available on intel's mainstream platform
[1585.04 --> 1594.64]  let alone on the enthusiast lga 2011 3 x99 platform so that's 20 pcie slots of which four are handled
[1594.64 --> 1600.72]  through uh dmi i think it's called whatever the replacement for the self bridge is that
[1600.72 --> 1613.52]  uh that system whatever anyway um words fail me doesn't happen often um but but for like enterprise
[1613.52 --> 1619.60]  customers where basically they they they can't have enough high speed connectivity to the cpu
[1620.32 --> 1630.88]  this i guess will be very cool uh i guess it'll also enable faster ssds um so nvme pci express ssds
[1630.88 --> 1638.16]  because even with maybe maybe it doesn't matter that you can have a pcie gen 4 16x slot
[1638.16 --> 1646.00]  maybe it's more important that your 2x slot on your laptop can do like double the bandwidth to an
[1646.00 --> 1652.00]  ndme ssd that it used to be able to do maybe we'll see an impact there although quite frankly it's been
[1652.00 --> 1657.76]  a long time since i've really felt like a faster ssd makes a huge difference to the day-to-day use of my
[1657.76 --> 1664.64]  computer i think you were running an ocz octane until like six months ago yep which was like a sata 2 ssd
[1664.64 --> 1670.40]  and now i literally don't even know the name of my ssd and it's fine um like i was talking to uh
[1670.40 --> 1677.28]  anthony from ncix the other day he's trying to upgrade his x79 system to x99 um because he wants
[1677.28 --> 1678.72]  to run nvme and i was just like
[1682.48 --> 1687.68]  yeah i'm sure like it is faster yeah and if you put them beside each other you can tell you can tell
[1687.68 --> 1696.88]  but it's not like the it's not like the moment that i had you know like like like moment that i
[1696.88 --> 1702.08]  had when i first installed a dual core processor in my machine or the first time you ever installed an
[1702.08 --> 1708.96]  ssd or the first time i installed an ssd those were like wow this is a new generation of computing
[1708.96 --> 1717.44]  yeah um then when i put that athlon 64 x2 4400 plus still the most expensive single component i
[1717.44 --> 1725.52]  have spent my own money on i paid like 800 plus dollars for a cpu but it was relatively speaking
[1725.52 --> 1730.48]  worth it sort of um because it was very different than any other experience you have i just don't
[1730.48 --> 1737.20]  feel that way about nvme ssds yeah um anyway i guess we could tell you there is like the the like
[1738.00 --> 1745.44]  glass kind of wow this is beautiful combination of getting a ridiculously good monitor that's like
[1745.44 --> 1750.64]  the say the 165 hertz asus yep remember the first time you tried that and you're like whoa yeah you
[1750.64 --> 1757.36]  combine that and like an nvme drive and like that kind of tier high-end system you can feel it and it's
[1757.36 --> 1763.20]  nice yeah because everything is just but it's not the same yeah it's not quite like that and you know
[1763.20 --> 1768.96]  what actually i would say that a high refresh rate ultra wide monitor was probably a similar
[1768.96 --> 1776.56]  experience for me i know you don't necessarily buy into the ultra wide like i do but for productivity
[1777.04 --> 1781.60]  right i really like my ultra wide for work here right i don't know if i'd want one at home if i did
[1781.60 --> 1787.36]  want one at home it would go over and tilt down above other monitors right and i would put like chats
[1787.36 --> 1792.08]  up there and web browser stuff because i like doing productivity stuff on them not a huge fan of gaming
[1792.08 --> 1796.64]  on ultra wides watching youtube videos on ultra wides is sweet there's a new one coming would be
[1796.64 --> 1805.68]  sweet um lg has a 38 inch ultra wide coming that is a 1600 vertical by whatever that works out to
[1805.68 --> 1812.16]  horizontally i'm actually going to be doing a review of it soon it looks pretty beastly i don't know if
[1812.16 --> 1817.44]  it's going to make i don't know what 38 inches is going to kind of feel like right in front of my face
[1817.44 --> 1823.20]  kind of you know that's a lot of inches in my face yeah um but we'll see maybe i can handle it
[1824.08 --> 1830.32]  so we haven't actually said anything about pc express 4.0 so it's 16 giga transfers per second
[1831.04 --> 1838.72]  the through the slot power is still 75 watts same as always the final specification should come by the
[1838.72 --> 1846.32]  end of 2016. they are days away from releasing version 0.7 of the specification to the 730 paying
[1846.32 --> 1853.04]  members that provide input and a board of directors to help the process and it will double the bandwidth
[1853.04 --> 1860.80]  per lane compared to what we've seen before so here's a screenshot showing once it loads um
[1861.84 --> 1868.88]  the bandwidth of the previous pci express generations i think poor poor oh yeah there it goes poor server
[1868.88 --> 1875.60]  it's just struggling a little bit there so there you go it didn't quite double from
[1877.12 --> 1882.32]  so so gen 1 to 2 doubled gen 2 to gen 3 didn't quite double but we are actually getting it looks like
[1882.32 --> 1889.36]  straight up doubling again this time so what that means is you could do 31.5 gigabytes per second
[1889.36 --> 1895.84]  through a pci e16x slot uh which is which is great maybe we'll maybe we can do away with the external sli
[1895.84 --> 1901.04]  bridge now maybe and did you cool maybe we could i mean they could even they could even they could
[1901.04 --> 1907.44]  even do something at that point where if you had two maybe if you had two 16x slots they could allow
[1907.44 --> 1912.64]  it or something the gpus could use the first eight lanes and the and the sli communication could be on
[1912.64 --> 1917.52]  the other eight lanes like i don't know maybe i'm just totally being ignorant here some of the reason
[1917.52 --> 1924.56]  why they don't like it is interference and crosstalk if colton if colton did this screenshot then he gets to
[1924.56 --> 1930.96]  be yelled at because he left his cursor on one of the data points for the new spec that's okay we
[1930.96 --> 1939.04]  love you 16. um so there you have it though with a single 1x or 2x slot you could do two gigabytes or
[1939.04 --> 1946.24]  four gigabytes per second of bandwidth to something like an ndme ssd which is which is i guess good you
[1946.24 --> 1955.76]  know um here we go so they've also got some suggestions as to sort of why they think this
[1955.76 --> 1960.96]  matters so use cases chip to chip connection you can reduce power in real estate with extendable
[1960.96 --> 1966.88]  design features and power management capabilities m.2 scalable performance for power constrained
[1966.88 --> 1974.88]  mobile platforms u.2 so this would be the um that's that like server connector where you can connect ssd
[1974.88 --> 1980.16]  storage in like uh more like a rack mount case um and then use cables to get a get off the motherboard
[1980.16 --> 1986.24]  with it and pci express cards so high bandwidth functionality for internet of things appliances
[1986.24 --> 1992.88]  like hd video streaming apps high frequency sensor data and automation controls so nowhere in there does
[1992.88 --> 1998.56]  it say graphics cards will suddenly be faster because pci express 4.0 but that's not going to stop them
[1998.56 --> 2000.56]  from cramming it down our throats as a selling feature
[2000.56 --> 2008.32]  no we should probably skip this topic i've read over it and oh and then we should go to android 7.0
[2008.32 --> 2014.08]  all right let's talk new good so this was posted by trixanity on the forum the original article here
[2014.08 --> 2020.08]  is from anon tech i don't think i've ever read anything by matt humrick on anon tech before
[2020.08 --> 2028.88]  but android nougat is here so there's like some i actually filmed a uh a tech quickie fast as possible
[2030.24 --> 2036.00]  you know these ones always get me they're like do you won't believe these animals are real yeah
[2036.00 --> 2040.56]  yeah half the time they're not real by the way yeah don't get drawn into it they're real drawings
[2040.56 --> 2048.40]  they're real photoshops yeah anyways it started rolling out as of august 22nd so like four days ago or something
[2048.40 --> 2056.80]  uh it will begin rolling out on nexus devices in the next few weeks including nexus 5x 6p 6 9 player
[2056.80 --> 2066.56]  pixel c tablet general mobile 4g uh yeah anyways uh the nexus 5 and 7 2013 are not eligible for this
[2066.56 --> 2073.92]  update lg v20 will be the first new device that will ship with nougat pre-installed cool
[2073.92 --> 2079.36]  yeah samsung's president of mobile stated that an update should come to the note 7 in perhaps the
[2079.36 --> 2086.08]  next two to three months how long ago did you film your thing uh the note 7 uh no this video today
[2086.08 --> 2092.96]  tech wiki today yeah so coming soon yeah coming soon to a tech wiki near you yeah um but some of the new
[2092.96 --> 2097.36]  get features that we're highlighting here are a split screen mode this is something that has already
[2097.36 --> 2103.60]  existed on some vendors custom versions of android just gonna say um so samsung has had this for quite
[2103.60 --> 2109.68]  some time although uh and this is something that i did bring up in my note 7 review it doesn't work
[2109.68 --> 2115.92]  across the board like here's a a key application that samsung split screen doesn't work with google sheets
[2116.56 --> 2123.76]  oh no way like i can yeah so i mean that was that was kind of the first time when i was working on my review
[2123.76 --> 2129.60]  when i went gee i really need to use split screen right now because i was filling out a props sheet
[2129.60 --> 2134.40]  um and doing internet research on like funny camping things and i was copying pasting links and i was
[2134.40 --> 2142.16]  like oh yeah cool that oh wait no so the app support is quite limited if it is natively supported in
[2142.16 --> 2147.92]  android i would hope that app support would be quite a bit broader uh double tapping the uh the most
[2147.92 --> 2154.40]  recently used apps button now switches between your last app that's and the current one that's cool
[2154.40 --> 2159.28]  which is really nice because that and this kind of ties into another comment from my note 7 review
[2159.28 --> 2165.76]  which i think went up on vessel last night um where i was talking about the stylus on the notes that this
[2165.76 --> 2174.08]  is not a note 7 just to be clear this is the moto z force droid thing um but anyway the the stylus has
[2174.08 --> 2179.28]  a feature called glance where there's a little a little minimized icon in the bottom corner that
[2179.28 --> 2185.20]  you can hover over to quickly look between two apps and i was like that sounds pretty cool right
[2185.84 --> 2191.52]  except that it's faster to just use your multitask button and switch between them because of the delay
[2191.52 --> 2196.08]  when you hover but if it was a shorter delay then it just wouldn't work very well because every time
[2196.08 --> 2205.68]  you accidentally move anyway um so so this makes that even less relevant now because now you can
[2205.68 --> 2208.80]  just double tap that button and it'll go right to the last app you're using so when you're quickly
[2208.80 --> 2213.36]  switching between things to refer back to them this could be very useful i'm super excited about that
[2214.00 --> 2218.96]  um there's now the ability to bundle notifications together and this isn't in our notes but it was in
[2218.96 --> 2223.92]  john script so i'm going to assume that it's correct um also the ability to expand your notifications
[2223.92 --> 2227.76]  and address them individually oh thank goodness because okay this is something that's been pissing
[2227.76 --> 2233.44]  me off with twitter for so long you'll get like this person followed you and then someone that
[2233.44 --> 2239.60]  you're following like retweeted something of yours i'm like i want to click on that person's profile to
[2239.60 --> 2242.40]  figure out who they are that just followed me because if you ever get a notification that someone
[2242.40 --> 2246.72]  followed you they're probably somebody important or something or it's one of those people that's like
[2247.20 --> 2253.60]  95 million followers and 95 million people that they followed and it's like okay sure um
[2254.00 --> 2258.96]  anyways and you can't because you click on it and the app just gets confused and then it dumps you
[2258.96 --> 2264.08]  somewhere with that said i have very little faith that this is any of this is going to improve twitter
[2266.32 --> 2272.48]  because there's plenty of stuff that is perfectly not broken on android but is still very broken on
[2272.48 --> 2279.44]  twitter you know they uh released that like anyone can apply for official status thing did you apply yep
[2280.16 --> 2286.72]  no they didn't they denied john they didn't deny deny me they just refused to respond uh respond i've done
[2286.72 --> 2294.64]  it like three or four times they're just up i tried to apply and um the form just didn't work in multiple
[2294.64 --> 2300.16]  browsers on multiple occasions i filled out the whole form that's what happened the first couple times i
[2300.16 --> 2304.24]  tried to up you have to upload a thing i think yeah so i kept trying to upload and the uploader just
[2304.24 --> 2312.32]  wouldn't work so i was just like okay it's really not that important to me so yeah fine fine my only
[2312.32 --> 2317.12]  thing is there's like and you're gonna get this with your new account too there's a lot of imposter
[2317.12 --> 2323.20]  accounts there was some guy who was not retweeting manually tweeting all of the same tweets that i had
[2323.20 --> 2329.52]  really and then filtering in like super ultra aggressive religious messages really between them
[2329.52 --> 2335.76]  and like he had the exact same uh photo as me exact same cover photo all the same pictures that i would
[2335.76 --> 2340.80]  post up he would post weird um like everything i mean that takes a significant amount of dedication
[2340.80 --> 2346.80]  it was a lot of work and then yeah religious messages filtered in between what a weird thing to work on
[2347.36 --> 2352.00]  i know i mean everybody needs a hobby and i get that and you know they verified that i was real
[2352.72 --> 2360.08]  and banned him really fast and but they don't want to give you continued to not respond about being
[2360.08 --> 2363.84]  official and i'm like if this is a problem you should probably just give me an official tag so
[2363.84 --> 2368.24]  this is easier because once you're official if you report someone as a imposter whatever you don't have
[2368.24 --> 2372.56]  to go through as big of a process oh really i didn't know that yeah it's more refined interesting okay
[2372.56 --> 2376.08]  because they like know that you're actually the right one because i had to go through this thing like
[2376.08 --> 2383.92]  verifying that i was the one that wasn't the imposter right anyways apparently the audio crackle is
[2383.92 --> 2389.20]  back i wonder if like the microphone is overheating or something it's really hot honestly it wouldn't
[2389.20 --> 2395.36]  even surprise me it's like 33 degrees out there or something like that and like the warehouse with the
[2395.36 --> 2411.04]  lights and the you know stardom neither of us have official tags the stardom well all right so the
[2411.04 --> 2420.08]  original article here uh was posted by patrick 3027 on the forum and it's from ifixit.org dun dun dun
[2420.64 --> 2427.36]  could it be bend gate all over again no because the design defect actually has nothing to do with
[2427.36 --> 2433.04]  bending but you can see this gray flickering bar across the top of this iphone is a classic symptom
[2433.04 --> 2439.36]  of a problem that repair pros are seeing more and more in iphone 6 and iphone 6 plus devices
[2440.88 --> 2449.04]  and it basically causes the touchscreen to be unresponsive and the weird thing about this is that it has taken
[2449.04 --> 2458.00]  until now for lots of repair shops to experience this influx of faulty iphones with exactly the same
[2458.00 --> 2465.68]  problem now replacing the touchscreen actually doesn't fix it the gray bar eventually shows back up on the
[2465.68 --> 2472.24]  news screen as well it's actually the two touchscreen controller chips or the touch ic chips on the board
[2472.24 --> 2478.88]  inside the phone that are causing the issue apple hasn't addressed the issue and their in-house teams
[2478.88 --> 2486.96]  cannot fix it so third-party micro micro soldering specialists uh it's funny this our notes this is
[2486.96 --> 2494.00]  really funny yeah our notes say mostly unauthorized to do apple repairs because apple doesn't authorize
[2494.00 --> 2500.24]  third parties even in cases where there literally isn't an apple store within driving distance like you
[2500.24 --> 2506.72]  would have to get on a plane to go to an apple store um so unauthorized apple repair people have
[2506.72 --> 2514.64]  been helping to fix people's phones but right now uh it looks like that's about all that you've got going
[2514.64 --> 2519.68]  for yourself the good the good news is that apple will have to respond to this because literally every
[2519.68 --> 2525.20]  single iphone 6 or 6 plus is within its warranty period right now unless you've done something to
[2525.20 --> 2533.68]  physically damage it outside of this going wrong with it um so let's let's hope that they do something
[2535.28 --> 2539.20]  though i don't know what that would be
[2542.64 --> 2549.52]  all right this next topic is pretty fun this is posted by numlock 21 on the forum the original article here is from polygon
[2549.52 --> 2555.92]  south park the fractured butt holes fart smelling peripheral
[2558.16 --> 2559.20]  is a thing
[2562.24 --> 2571.44]  there you have it this is the nostrilous rift which is of course a play on oculus and nostril and um
[2571.44 --> 2580.48]  that's that's about it i actually i don't even know what else to say other than someone tried it and
[2580.48 --> 2588.32]  apparently it's very pungent yeah the sole purpose of this peripheral is to deliver a potent fart smell
[2588.32 --> 2596.16]  during specific in-game moments and i think the jokes pretty much write themselves here but the developer
[2596.16 --> 2606.80]  of this peripheral is ubisoft so the obvious one is we tried the nostrilous rift ubisoft's latest release
[2607.60 --> 2611.04]  we couldn't tell the difference between it and any of their other releases
[2615.84 --> 2624.16]  oh which isn't fair because they haven't been that badly but who has the guts to make a gaming device
[2624.16 --> 2628.72]  that just smells bad that just smells like ass gas um
[2630.96 --> 2638.16]  so farting is a key component in self park the fractured but whole and uh i mean it's a command
[2638.16 --> 2643.92]  that you can use anytime with a button press and then after you fart in game the nostrilous
[2643.92 --> 2649.60]  floods with a smell that only gets stronger as you progress it comes from oils within the device
[2649.60 --> 2656.08]  that's really gross um and here is a picture of what it looks like when you wear it
[2658.32 --> 2665.12]  i am not sure if i am excited about the new south park game i really enjoyed stick of truth i did too
[2665.12 --> 2674.16]  a lot it was really good um but they i mean like so many brands that work through third-party game
[2674.16 --> 2680.56]  developers they made a game that was good and my understanding is there were some difficulties
[2680.56 --> 2686.56]  throughout the development process i get that but like they made a game it was successful and then they
[2686.56 --> 2692.00]  completely changed the developer and are making a oh no very different game yeah that's not the same
[2692.00 --> 2698.24]  dev it's not ubi um i i don't no no the like the actual game studio that's making it yeah oh
[2698.24 --> 2704.96]  that's still a nightmare yeah so it's one of those things where it's like you have changed
[2706.08 --> 2713.52]  literally everything about it so yeah don't pre-order things anyways but especially don't
[2713.52 --> 2718.64]  pre-order this yeah i really do want to play it though if it gets good reviews i'll get it i'll play it
[2718.64 --> 2725.92]  uh all right next article this was originally posted by goodbytes that guy can post pretty much anything
[2725.92 --> 2732.16]  about microsoft on the forum and i won't be surprised although this this raised some
[2732.16 --> 2740.32]  controversy is an xbox onesie is he being paid off to sell onesies i don't think i don't know
[2740.32 --> 2745.36]  what he might be this they're only being sold on australia what if microsoft is trying to take over
[2745.36 --> 2750.64]  the australian onesie market it comes in both black and white uh the features are highlighted in
[2750.64 --> 2755.84]  microsoft's press release it actually looks kind of comfy enlarge pockets to fit your xbox controller
[2755.84 --> 2761.36]  and media remotes it has an arm pouch to offer quick and easy access to your mobile phone
[2761.36 --> 2767.84]  it has rollable legs and arms to cater to all temperatures and seasons it has forearm grips to
[2767.84 --> 2770.88]  prevent slipping on those edge of your seat moments
[2773.52 --> 2781.84]  it has an extra large hood to accommodate headsets for the ultimate gaming session and customized gamer tag
[2781.84 --> 2791.60]  embroidery um should i go get our nvidia onesie yeah okay i forgot about i will be right back i will
[2791.60 --> 2799.76]  return in the meantime if you want to talk about uh man bang or something man bang what the crap okay
[2799.76 --> 2803.76]  we are going to talk about this don't forget you can screen share you just have to like your thing
[2803.76 --> 2811.84]  right give me one second guys hold up post it in there now it's in the chat you guys can investigate
[2811.84 --> 2818.24]  man bang with me i have never heard of this man bang okay i'm using the wrong mouse where's my screen
[2818.88 --> 2825.60]  there we go nice all right so outside of the nissan thing north korea's man bang
[2825.60 --> 2833.20]  is a state approved streaming service why did they call it man bang could one of them have looked into
[2833.20 --> 2840.48]  this so one of my first questions that's going to rise here is like as far as i've heard almost no one
[2840.48 --> 2847.20]  in north korea has the like north korean version of the internet so i'm not sure how this is going to work
[2847.20 --> 2854.00]  uh it says you can't watch netflix in north korea thanks engadget um but the democratic people's
[2854.00 --> 2861.28]  republic now has something at least man bang a state approved set box that streams live to meet tv or
[2861.28 --> 2867.28]  on-demand video okay so really the only interesting thing about this article is the name man bang
[2868.72 --> 2869.60]  there's a video
[2869.60 --> 2879.52]  i have no idea how loud this is so i'm just going to mute it i'm also going to mute this
[2888.00 --> 2898.56]  there you go okay so here come the shill comments see it's very subtle actually just a little nvidia
[2898.56 --> 2903.04]  logo oh i guess i could switch to this and then that might make more sense see a little nvidia logo
[2903.04 --> 2909.60]  on the arm there it's uh i actually don't know exactly how the snuggie is supposed to work like
[2909.60 --> 2916.88]  is it supposed to kind of be like a ninja thing or like oh wow but it has uh has pockets in the front
[2916.88 --> 2922.24]  the uni pouch yeah it's hard to tell so kind of do that see well you can tell that my hands disappear
[2922.24 --> 2930.48]  it's like boom that's it gone boom it's hands no hands it's like uh anti-aliasing oh nice something
[2930.48 --> 2936.08]  there you go yeah yeah because that sort of uh this is freaking warm okay check this out real quick i
[2936.08 --> 2940.72]  want to show you this really cool video effect that they use in the man bang video check watch watch this
[2941.28 --> 2941.60]  whoa
[2945.20 --> 2948.00]  holy crap now that's a transition
[2948.00 --> 2952.56]  yeah we need to start talking to taryn and ed about rolling out on the channel i think we should
[2952.56 --> 2956.72]  start using that for every transition imagine imagine every single time we went from like product to
[2956.72 --> 2964.08]  host it was like whoa boom here's your host wonderful you have to like warp through space and time
[2964.08 --> 2971.04]  and then there's like this crazy fuzzy effect yeah why is the why did they i mean we've seen that before
[2971.04 --> 2977.76]  when there's condensation uh in front of the inside the waterproof housing for a gopro yeah we've seen
[2977.76 --> 2985.44]  that like that weird blurry effect around the outside of the frame but uh oh no original article
[2985.44 --> 2993.84]  here is from ars technica mcdonald's recalls happy meal fitness trackers after they injure children so
[2993.84 --> 3002.64]  they recalled millions of wristband toys amid reports of blistering now this is a case of um
[3002.64 --> 3010.32]  um good i have this conversation with my wife all the time english is not her first language although
[3010.32 --> 3015.84]  she speaks it mostly natively but there are certain things that she's picked up particularly from her
[3015.84 --> 3025.20]  parents where um it doesn't seem she doesn't really seem to understand the importance of the different
[3025.20 --> 3031.04]  meanings that words have like injure like okay yeah but i'll give some other examples first so
[3031.92 --> 3039.04]  she'll tell me go up in the house i left my keys on the table i will go to the house and i will look
[3039.04 --> 3044.16]  on every single table in the house and they will not be there i will then run back down the stairs and
[3044.16 --> 3049.28]  i'll say they're not there where are they and she'll say they're on the table i'll say come show me it turns
[3049.28 --> 3058.40]  out they're on the counter which is not a table okay another perfect example the cat scratched the kid
[3059.12 --> 3067.84]  and now she has a scar and i go what it turns out she means scratch which is not the same as scar scar
[3067.84 --> 3077.04]  is permanent scratch is is a mark it goes away so in much the same way that that a table is not a
[3077.04 --> 3085.28]  counter or vice versa and injury is not a blister and vice versa and and the difference between after
[3085.28 --> 3089.44]  like hurting kids hurting kids is a very broad definition anything could be hurting kids that
[3089.44 --> 3099.12]  could be all the way from the sun yeah yes but injuring children implies that they like can't um
[3099.92 --> 3106.80]  the dietary properties of mcdonald's food could be hurting kids yeah uh anyway so so
[3106.80 --> 3111.28]  the devices were found to burn and irritate kids skin so far there have been 70 reports
[3111.28 --> 3115.52]  of injuries from the colorful gadgets um
[3118.48 --> 3124.88]  so apparently you can return it to the restaurant in exchange for another toy a tube of yogurt or apple
[3124.88 --> 3127.76]  slices cool so at least there's that
[3127.76 --> 3132.72]  the other way to the restaurant in exchange for another toy a tube of yogurt or a tube of yogurt
[3132.72 --> 3137.36]  apparently there's a u.s senator suggesting that swapping college instructors for videos could be a good
[3137.36 --> 3144.72]  idea directly calling out uh the higher education system as a cartel and suggesting that uh colleges
[3144.72 --> 3148.00]  could cut the number of instructors and increase the use of online videos
[3148.00 --> 3162.48]  uh um i guess this is this is trying to to lay the groundwork for some of the discussion that mostly
[3162.48 --> 3170.00]  seems to stem from uh the bernie sanders campaign around post-secondary education should be free i guess
[3170.00 --> 3175.44]  we're we're now laying the groundwork for what free what you should actually get for free yeah it should be
[3175.44 --> 3182.32]  video courses i guess yeah um being able to have uh office hours and being able to ask questions is
[3182.32 --> 3187.52]  rather important yeah i really don't think the point that the democrats were trying to make
[3188.24 --> 3196.48]  is that um the the entire u.s higher education system should be changed and then be free i think
[3196.48 --> 3203.28]  they were trying to say like what we have which is fairly well regarded with many of the world's most
[3203.28 --> 3210.24]  prestigious schools being in the united states that should be accessible to everyone and i i'm not
[3210.24 --> 3218.48]  getting involved in that debate i paid for university um i was able to like make that work even without
[3219.44 --> 3225.04]  you know an amazing job by being entrepreneurial and stuff like that like i think there are ways to do
[3225.04 --> 3230.80]  it i do i think it's great that you know people in lower income brackets than me are able to get
[3230.80 --> 3235.92]  bursaries and are able to like make that work i think the system could be better but i'm not
[3235.92 --> 3241.84]  necessarily saying i think that it's you know everyone's right to go to university for absolutely
[3241.84 --> 3245.60]  nothing and thinking there's possibly a middle ground but i do think it should be accessible to
[3245.60 --> 3251.20]  everyone whether that means that you have 10 years to pay back your loans or whether that means that
[3251.20 --> 3255.84]  the costs are significantly reduced i don't know what the answer is that's what i'm trying to say i'm just
[3255.84 --> 3265.60]  saying i don't think the answer is making it free and significantly reducing the staffing of universities
[3265.60 --> 3273.20]  and colleges i really don't think that was the point um yeah
[3275.92 --> 3282.32]  pizza drone deliveries start testing in new zealand the drone delivery stuff is interesting because we
[3282.32 --> 3286.08]  were talking about this how many years ago did we start talking about this two one and a half
[3286.80 --> 3291.28]  something like that yeah something like that it's been a while and they're they're still kind of going
[3291.28 --> 3296.16]  along and one thing that we said back then that is that this wasn't going to happen now and it was
[3296.16 --> 3301.20]  probably going to happen later on down the line and whatnot and there's there's a video here which
[3301.20 --> 3307.12]  you can check out i can't imagine your pizza wouldn't be cold by the time it arrived if it was delivered
[3307.12 --> 3313.92]  by drone like i'm just pointing out sort of why well i don't know it's like if that's a relatively
[3313.92 --> 3320.72]  thermally sealed box it might get there faster than what oh by a cable it might get there faster than
[3320.72 --> 3325.20]  uh a car sometimes you throw it in a car and it's going to be in the car for a while before it gets
[3325.20 --> 3330.00]  to the destination that's true but it's going to have to be pretty sealed because you literally are
[3330.00 --> 3337.36]  blowing four fans very forcefully at it whereas most of the time when i see the driver come out of
[3337.36 --> 3344.16]  their car they're keeping it like in that thermal bag against the seat where you're going to lose a
[3344.16 --> 3350.32]  little bit of heat but like not too much i mean these guys look like it's super delicious they're all
[3350.32 --> 3357.76]  nodding yes yes the pizza did arrive by drone yes here you go who knows though that is interesting i
[3357.76 --> 3360.88]  don't think it's going to matter that much clearly not actors look it's raining
[3363.84 --> 3368.48]  drop fell right in front of the lens it's like oh sometimes you just gotta do the shoot
[3370.16 --> 3376.56]  not a neat pizza guys not a neat pizza um this is interesting asrock rack and super micro have
[3376.56 --> 3382.64]  announced xeon phi systems we are actually getting one no what we're going to do with it i don't know
[3382.64 --> 3390.96]  but hey maybe it can solve your uh balancing oh give it a rest um basically these are a couple of
[3390.96 --> 3400.32]  the super micro systems that are going to be available xeon phi is um kind of a like coprocessor
[3400.88 --> 3408.00]  but it's a little bit different from the first generation xeon phi so this is the uh this is the new x200
[3408.00 --> 3413.36]  series and it's going to be a little bit different in the sense that you can actually run windows on it
[3413.36 --> 3418.88]  now so it's not just on a pci express card that you have to add to a system that's running regular
[3418.88 --> 3427.12]  xeons now you can actually just boot a xeon phi system so they're going to have cpus with up to 72 cores
[3427.12 --> 3434.72]  and these are based on highly modified atom silvermont cores running it up to 1.5 gigahertz with up to 36
[3434.72 --> 3444.32]  megs of level 2 cache 16 gigs of on package high performance memory holy crap a six channel ddr4
[3444.32 --> 3454.40]  controller as well as 36 pcie 3.0 lanes this is going to be an lga 3647 socket so these chips are like huge
[3454.40 --> 3462.88]  they're massive um and should be a significant upgrade over the existing xeon phi parts which
[3462.88 --> 3469.28]  only ran over a pci express bus like i mentioned before it is expected that they will be available
[3469.28 --> 3477.52]  in pci express form again but for now they're going to look like a pretty traditional rack mount server
[3477.52 --> 3484.00]  i wish we could get a better look at the song really so you guys could see yeah there you go huge so
[3484.00 --> 3490.88]  there's a there it is liquid cooled i don't quote me on this but i want to say like 160 or 185 watt tdp or
[3490.88 --> 3498.00]  something like that oh no here we go here we go here we go 250 to 260 watt tdps so yeah liquid cooling
[3498.64 --> 3506.72]  a thing in servers moving forward um and again i have no idea what we're going to do with it
[3506.72 --> 3512.96]  but apparently super micro is planning to send us one i don't think we're going to keep it
[3514.00 --> 3518.24]  because we legitimately have zero use for it whatsoever we should just
[3519.04 --> 3525.68]  do something with it fold or something something um the thing is like immediately better than the
[3525.68 --> 3532.16]  whole folding the software designed to run on it has to be designed to run on it even though it is
[3532.16 --> 3538.48]  sort of x86 also totally fair like i still haven't had my briefing on it yet i've only done a little bit
[3538.48 --> 3544.64]  of like cursory research myself um and it's not very clear exactly
[3547.44 --> 3550.48]  what a general consumer could possibly hope to get out of it
[3552.40 --> 3560.80]  probably nothing yes yes yes um okay but there are things that there's more than nothing that consumers
[3560.80 --> 3569.36]  could expect to get out of intel finally has m.2 ssds freaking finally so the 600p series has been
[3569.36 --> 3577.28]  announced in capacities of up to one terabyte um so these are for the mainstream market these are not
[3577.28 --> 3583.44]  a 950 pro competitor but with that said they still are going to outperform a sata based ssd
[3583.44 --> 3588.40]  fairly substantially with sequential reads in the neighborhood of up to two gigabytes per second
[3588.40 --> 3596.48]  and random read iops over well over 100k uh 155k and random write iops actually more difficult are at
[3596.48 --> 3604.48]  128k so we're looking at better than sata 3 pretty much across the board uh although uh reviews are
[3604.48 --> 3609.92]  still pending on this one so i don't really have anything to say other than that and i guess that's
[3609.92 --> 3615.20]  pretty much all that i have one more thing scroll down a little bit yeah a little bit more yeah a little
[3615.20 --> 3621.60]  bit a little bit more a little bit more yeah there the playstation now coming to pc okay this
[3621.60 --> 3625.44]  was at the very bottom of the dock i did not see this definitely should have been in like the first
[3625.44 --> 3630.96]  three or four topics you better you better cover this so i only know a few things because also very
[3630.96 --> 3636.88]  bottom the dock just saw it uh the playstation now streaming ecosystem which i just looked wow that's
[3636.88 --> 3645.12]  awesome um is coming to pc and includes a huge list of games it's actually rather massive i'm not even
[3645.12 --> 3649.92]  just saying that that's a full list of subscription games is like here switch my screen for a second
[3650.40 --> 3657.92]  uh oh yeah cool this is the full list of subscription games there's there's like if you like bioshock
[3657.92 --> 3663.84]  there's bioshock bioshock 2 bioshock infinite you can like immediately get a really substantial library
[3663.84 --> 3670.08]  of games for not even that much money all the god of wars all this different stuff what's the monthly fee
[3670.08 --> 3677.84]  start your seven day trial uh one month for 20 bucks three months for 44.99 that is substantially
[3677.84 --> 3683.92]  more expensive than geforce now but more titles just having a look at the titles available on geforce now
[3683.92 --> 3688.40]  though here oh man isn't this great how we can both be looking up different things yeah so part of the
[3688.40 --> 3697.76]  problem with geforce now is that a lot of the games are just the same price you just nvidia's trying to
[3697.76 --> 3703.28]  sell it based on you don't have to buy a video card so they're eating up your video card budget
[3703.28 --> 3709.36]  whereas it looks like sony is going after your game budget yeah um so it's a different kind of
[3709.36 --> 3716.48]  approach so you can see a lot of these are paid games paid paid i clicked on something sorry so the
[3716.48 --> 3724.96]  actual ones that are included with your membership are like mostly older titles yeah saints row four last
[3724.96 --> 3733.68]  gen or a couple of gens grid autosport street fighter 4 um arkham asylum original borderlands
[3734.24 --> 3740.48]  yeah borderlands one they don't have borderlands 2 darksiders darksiders 2 those are old devil may cry 4
[3741.52 --> 3752.16]  fear 3 um whereas sony's library looks more competitive for a couple of reasons number one is there are some
[3752.16 --> 3756.08]  more modern games in it and i think they're getting around this with that substantially higher
[3756.08 --> 3763.44]  subscription fee yeah um as well as the fact that sony's library of exclusive titles spans back three
[3763.44 --> 3769.84]  generations of some pretty freaking amazing games i'm replaying final fantasy tactics right now because
[3770.80 --> 3775.12]  if you're willing to forgive some of the utterly game breaking issues with it
[3775.12 --> 3786.24]  it is a great great turn-based game the story is completely unintelligible as far as i can tell
[3786.24 --> 3791.36]  there's like suspenseful moments where you're like oh yeah like that guy's bad and we hate him let's kill
[3791.36 --> 3798.40]  him kind of like you can kind of get into it a bit but the lore is very poorly constructed especially at
[3798.40 --> 3805.68]  the beginning i i wouldn't blame you for having absolutely no idea what's going on and the uh
[3805.68 --> 3813.04]  sponsors we haven't talked about at all so i fix it dun dun dun dun i fix it has an offer code when
[3813.68 --> 3819.04]  that will let you save five dollars off a purchase of ten dollars or more and i fix it this isn't a
[3819.04 --> 3823.52]  service that they offer unfortunately because it's the coolest thing ever but i want to give them a huge
[3823.52 --> 3830.24]  shout out for providing our office with all these embroidered pro tech toolkits the latest version of
[3830.24 --> 3838.40]  the pro tech tool kit um i have one that says linus luke has one that says luke john has one that says
[3838.40 --> 3843.68]  writer oh so he's replaced but no it says john so they sent us they sent us all these kits and the funny
[3843.68 --> 3851.44]  thing about it was they were like do not show the old kits on camera anymore we are sending you
[3851.44 --> 3858.32]  literally a dozen of the new kits do not use the old kits but the thing is is that while the old kit
[3858.32 --> 3865.04]  is not as good in some fairly significant ways mine is still in perfect condition and works great i have
[3865.04 --> 3871.28]  had no desire whatsoever to use the lifetime warranty that they provide on their tools but the new kit is
[3871.28 --> 3877.84]  better it comes with 10 more drivers for the screwdriver kit it has this handy dandy magnetic release system
[3877.84 --> 3882.08]  and the lid is released so you can kind of use it as a parts tray which is pretty cool yep the uh so
[3882.08 --> 3887.52]  the lid is magnetic as well and it has all these little dividing things in it that i totally use as
[3887.52 --> 3892.08]  a parts tray even though i'm actually not sure if that was what they intended uh the driver is
[3892.08 --> 3897.84]  significantly upgraded yeah it has like a grippy part on it now so you can get way way more torque and
[3897.84 --> 3902.64]  which was a problem before and it has this handy spinning part on the top i don't know if you guys can
[3902.64 --> 3908.72]  see that this is spinning but that makes it so you can hold that in your in your hand and you can spin
[3908.72 --> 3913.20]  the uh the the neural part right here like there's a few ergonomic improvements that actually make a
[3913.20 --> 3918.72]  very significant difference it also comes with more general parts suction cups and more plier
[3919.84 --> 3926.16]  prior pieces and stuff like that the okay the plastic like uh mac tools is what i used to call them
[3926.16 --> 3931.12]  they have a better name than that but these are significantly improved as well yeah um you can just
[3931.12 --> 3937.28]  bend them in half i don't want to do it because like someone did it for me before and uh daris
[3937.28 --> 3941.20]  yeah was just like yeah yeah yeah and i was like oh why did you do that and he's like look because
[3941.20 --> 3949.52]  it's still perfect can i do it yeah and see it just like bounces back i was like oh that's cool yeah
[3950.08 --> 3955.12]  and the ends are much more durable now because i used to love those things but they had like a lifespan
[3955.12 --> 3958.80]  yeah because the more and more you use them the more chewed up the ends would get and these ones are
[3958.80 --> 3964.80]  anyway so ifixit tools are the bomb and if you use offer code when you can save five bucks off a
[3964.80 --> 3971.84]  purchase of ten dollars or more if you don't have an ifixit kit and any mobile device needs a repair
[3971.84 --> 3979.12]  in your house i can tell you right now the math that i did is fairly simple i can pay someone the
[3979.12 --> 3986.48]  amount it would cost me for an ifixit kit to repair this once or i can buy an ifixit kit now and i can do all
[3986.48 --> 3991.52]  my own repairs in the future and since then i've done everything from taking apart an imac to
[3991.52 --> 3995.84]  repairing my old iphone 4 putting in a new home button so that i can continue to use it as an mp3
[3995.84 --> 4000.56]  player like a throwaway device that i don't care about when i'm on trips or whatever the case may be
[4000.56 --> 4006.48]  so highly recommended and that one was like a six dollar part on ebay yeah so you know just sitting
[4006.48 --> 4011.44]  and i personally i find repairing small electronics kind of therapeutic so i just kind of sat and chilled for
[4011.44 --> 4018.08]  an hour replace my home button and it cost me nothing yeah except like six dollars and the ifixit
[4018.08 --> 4025.04]  kit once yes all right our next one and i have no idea what the bullet points are for this cooler master
[4025.04 --> 4032.00]  is sponsoring the wan show and you can learn more about why at coolermaster.com because i sure don't
[4032.00 --> 4037.04]  know it's the maker five oh it's the oh it's the master case maker five again oh good the master case
[4037.04 --> 4042.08]  maker five gives you the freedom to build your case uh the way you will with a variety of modular
[4042.08 --> 4046.00]  parts i actually forget the pre-roll spot i haven't done it in a little while that was it wasn't it
[4046.00 --> 4053.44]  was it um hold on the master case maker five gives you the freedom to make your mid-tower pc case your
[4053.44 --> 4058.80]  own with a variety modular system oh right with the free form modular system with a variety of with the
[4058.80 --> 4063.92]  free form variety of parts and accessories with a variety of parts and accessories okay let's just
[4063.92 --> 4069.76]  screen share here all right master case maker five there it is guys the master case maker five
[4069.76 --> 4075.52]  the case that we have probably talked about more than any there it is free form modular system um
[4076.08 --> 4080.48]  there's actually some pretty cool stuff about it so the fact that you can here this is cool so you
[4080.48 --> 4086.16]  can design stuff yourself they've actually got 3d graphics files for external modularity to customize
[4086.16 --> 4091.92]  or accessorize so you can download those they actually have a store that you can find where is it
[4091.92 --> 4096.00]  is it under modding or is it under okay i'm not sure where it is we've talked about it before but
[4096.00 --> 4101.60]  they have a store where you can actually buy third-party um like maker inspired and maker designed
[4101.60 --> 4107.84]  and maker made accessories for the master case series uh customer here it is maker master accessories
[4107.84 --> 4112.96]  and maker made accessories some of these are pretty cool they were showing off some primochill ones
[4112.96 --> 4118.24]  back at i think it was ces so i was just like oh yeah okay that's pretty neat those guys are cool and of
[4118.24 --> 4122.24]  course their site it takes a long time to load because that's how it is i'm going to try and show
[4122.24 --> 4127.36]  anything you guys are probably all over there right now or something so i guess that's pretty
[4127.36 --> 4131.12]  much it check them out at the link in the video description and i will go ahead and copy that link
[4131.12 --> 4136.88]  into the chat for you guys did nick message you that we had forgotten the sponsor spots or like no
[4137.60 --> 4146.24]  okay good someone in the twitch chat did really yeah wow yeah we should hire them yeah that's that's now the like
[4146.24 --> 4152.00]  yeah hiring metrics have you ever been in the wan show chat yeah have you ever reminded of of our
[4152.00 --> 4156.40]  sponsor spots no okay i think we're gonna have to talk to you later yeah but if they yell at us for
[4156.40 --> 4166.64]  being late then it cancels it out okay yeah all right so thank you guys for watching the wan show
[4166.64 --> 4175.60]  the over heated show yeah do we need like a fan for our microphone like i don't know i don't understand
[4175.60 --> 4181.12]  what to do at this point that'll make it putting a fan yeah you don't want to put a fan on a mic we
[4181.12 --> 4185.52]  need to like water cool it yeah we could water cool the microphone i wonder if we could do that
[4185.52 --> 4190.08]  somewhere else like that would be just kind of one of those totally stupid projects but that i'm sure you
[4190.08 --> 4196.48]  guys would watch i'd watch that like water cool your desktop microphone i just out of curiosity you
[4196.48 --> 4201.20]  know you could probably actually do it relatively easily like we could even just wrap like some kind
[4201.20 --> 4206.96]  of conductive tubing around it like you wouldn't actually be custom loop style where the pump is
[4206.96 --> 4211.44]  far away though yeah yeah you put the pump like under the desk like a nice quiet pump under the desk i
[4211.44 --> 4218.08]  think i think you'd be fine vibration isolation okay like some kind of like a thing rubbery thing of
[4218.08 --> 4224.64]  something yeah like some kind of silicone thing um i think i could work in like a radiator just like
[4224.64 --> 4231.52]  mounted to the bottom of the desk speaking of desks this has been a long time coming but there will be
[4231.52 --> 4239.84]  a new desk pc build on linus tech tips and it is going to be better than every other desk pc you've ever
[4239.84 --> 4247.52]  seen not because it looks more impressive not because the hardware is higher end not because it has like
[4247.52 --> 4255.04]  hard line water cooling or anything like that it will be the best because it will be super cheap and
[4255.04 --> 4265.04]  still look pretty cool okay yeah because most sp pc builds are like excessively expensive okay and like
[4265.04 --> 4272.16]  to replicate them you would need like an entire well-equipped shop yeah whereas this one literally
[4272.16 --> 4278.80]  doesn't have a single glue or excuse me a single nail or screw in it you can build the entire desk pc
[4278.80 --> 4286.56]  with a single sheet of mdf and glue seriously well the computer would have screws in it yes
[4287.92 --> 4294.40]  haha but the purpose of the death victory the purpose of the desk pc is that you can build it
[4294.96 --> 4301.12]  for less than you'd pay for like an enthusiast grade case that's pretty wicked so it should be
[4301.12 --> 4304.64]  pretty cool i'm pretty excited about it it's pretty wicked i mean okay to be clear the hardware inside
[4304.64 --> 4310.80]  it is going to be baller af because it's a show have that yeah it's a showcase build like if i go and put
[4310.80 --> 4318.00]  like an matx matx motherboard in like one hard drive in an entire desk pc i got so much because i released
[4318.00 --> 4323.60]  that video about how high-end power supplies or like really really really high wattage power supplies
[4323.60 --> 4329.20]  are stupid yeah and then the very next build that came out had like a 1200 watt power supply in it
[4329.20 --> 4334.00]  the only reason why i did that was because it looks nice and it came with it already had the nice cables
[4334.00 --> 4340.64]  plugged into it yeah that computer turned on like maybe once for b-roll yeah sorry but like the comment
[4340.64 --> 4347.12]  section oh man people were like how could you make a video about that then make this computer i'm like
[4347.12 --> 4352.00]  i'm not suggesting you put these parts in this case i was just reviewing the case we're just
[4352.00 --> 4357.84]  reviewing a case yeah it legitimately doesn't matter what power supply no not at all it was literally
[4357.84 --> 4362.80]  just laying there you know what was my other favorite like top comment on that video was the
[4362.80 --> 4370.00]  people being like well actually they're not stupid because my triple r9 290 build actually like draws
[4370.00 --> 4378.72]  almost that much i'm sorry but why did you high wattage high wattage power supplies
[4380.80 --> 4386.48]  don't make sense for any other configuration of hardware that would have made sense
[4387.92 --> 4393.20]  i can build a computer that can max out a 1200 or even a 1500 watt power supply
[4393.20 --> 4402.88]  and i noticed literally in the intro seven gamers one cpu was that computer it actually drew like 1500
[4402.88 --> 4408.16]  watts from the wall but it was stupid and that makes sense and nobody should have built it yeah
[4410.08 --> 4416.96]  it was a cool experiment yes it definitely was a cool experiment i don't understand why anyone built a
[4416.96 --> 4427.44]  multi-hawaii crossfire system
[4432.80 --> 4438.00]  unless you were gonna water cool it maybe and like hang the radiator out the window or put it on your
[4438.00 --> 4449.28]  roof but we all know how that ends up anyways all right so i'm done thank you for tuning into the
[4449.28 --> 4454.48]  show it's been a great great time yeah see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[4454.48 --> 4460.32]  bye is that joke ever gonna get old someone in i guess people have to get it for it to be old someone
[4460.32 --> 4465.84]  in my chat again thought you were saying batch yeah same batch time same batch channel and i was like nope
[4465.84 --> 4470.32]  that's wrong
