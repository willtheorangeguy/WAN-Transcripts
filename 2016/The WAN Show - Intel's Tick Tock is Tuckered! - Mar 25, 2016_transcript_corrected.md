[0.00 → 3.56] Oh my god, what the hell was that?
[4.94 → 9.72] Um, and public, uh, uh, there we go.
[10.16 → 10.86] Uh, hello!
[11.54 → 12.84] Welcome to the WAN Show.
[12.98 → 14.22] We're only five minutes late.
[14.86 → 15.16] Not bad.
[15.18 → 16.28] Which is not super late.
[16.40 → 18.42] I also can't see the chat at all.
[18.64 → 19.58] Give me a second.
[21.18 → 26.56] Microsoft has a partially ancestral, crazy, Hitler-loving robot.
[26.56 → 30.06] And, uh, uh, Apple released a small phone.
[30.90 → 31.34] That's true.
[31.36 → 33.06] Both of those things are apparently equally newsworthy.
[33.52 → 33.62] Yes.
[34.14 → 34.68] There we go.
[34.80 → 35.34] What else we got?
[35.82 → 37.12] Uh, don't ever leave your house.
[37.20 → 41.20] You can get pizza delivered by a robot, brand-new movies, right to your TV.
[41.36 → 41.92] And it's legal.
[42.06 → 43.48] You don't have to break the law for this one, so.
[43.64 → 44.88] And you can get, like, shavers.
[45.24 → 47.10] Although I don't think they're a sponsor this week.
[47.36 → 47.56] No.
[47.74 → 48.22] Either way.
[48.32 → 48.94] I heard they're a dollar.
[49.84 → 50.16] Yeah.
[50.78 → 51.10] Intro!
[51.92 → 52.64] It worked!
[53.08 → 54.06] Oh my god!
[55.06 → 56.30] I still like this intro.
[57.42 → 58.04] Nope, I'm dead.
[58.06 → 59.06] I've seen it so many times.
[61.20 → 63.82] Still think there should be an explosion there.
[63.98 → 64.78] There probably should be.
[65.58 → 66.40] I'm just going to be honest.
[67.06 → 68.36] Or just Linus' arms breaks.
[69.12 → 70.84] And yours just, like, continues forward.
[71.28 → 72.22] That should be the Halloween one.
[72.36 → 73.84] His arms should pop off and just start bleeding.
[74.02 → 74.42] There you go.
[74.56 → 75.32] Cooler Master!
[76.24 → 76.64] Whoa!
[79.14 → 80.32] I fix it!
[80.32 → 80.92] Whoa!
[83.06 → 83.50] Linda!
[84.06 → 84.42] Whoa!
[84.42 → 88.04] And we're done.
[88.34 → 89.28] So this isn't Linus.
[89.36 → 89.94] This is Richard.
[90.06 → 90.78] Richard is my brother.
[91.00 → 92.64] Your Twitter thing is...
[92.64 → 93.40] Slash Colds.
[93.66 → 94.74] So it's not that one.
[94.96 → 95.40] That's okay.
[95.62 → 96.38] I don't use it that much.
[96.40 → 97.34] I'm trying to Instagram more.
[97.68 → 98.00] Instagram?
[98.28 → 98.68] That's true.
[98.68 → 99.30] So what's your Instagram?
[99.52 → 100.78] I believe that's Colds as well.
[100.78 → 101.28] Yes.
[101.40 → 101.72] Nice.
[102.06 → 102.82] So it's the same one.
[102.86 → 103.62] A few pictures here and there.
[103.70 → 104.50] You posted some cool stuff.
[104.54 → 105.38] What was the last one you did?
[105.40 → 106.06] I don't remember what it was.
[106.14 → 107.44] I remember I liked it, but I don't remember what it was.
[107.64 → 112.04] I actually took, like, three pictures the other day and got, like, internet nervous and
[112.04 → 113.48] didn't post them because they weren't that cool.
[113.74 → 116.94] And then one was, like, on set, so I wasn't sure if it was legal either.
[117.06 → 117.38] Okay.
[117.38 → 119.62] So the last one was some street art.
[120.12 → 122.12] The reason why you would be on set is that you do...
[122.12 → 126.22] Transport for film and TV in Vancouver, which is exploding right now.
[126.74 → 131.42] There's a rumour going down that both unions called California and said no more movies.
[131.52 → 132.06] We're maxed out.
[132.28 → 132.68] Whoa.
[132.88 → 133.76] We have no more people.
[133.92 → 134.20] We have...
[134.20 → 136.34] They're building studios, physically building studios.
[136.34 → 139.10] We're in old warehouses that aren't up to grade.
[139.52 → 143.30] So they actually had some friends of mine, Burnaby Fire Department, was sitting outside.
[143.30 → 144.24] The whole week we're filming.
[144.24 → 149.58] They're always there because the building is not up to code fire-wise, but it's the only
[149.58 → 150.52] buildings we can find.
[150.78 → 150.96] So, yeah.
[151.24 → 153.48] Vancouver film is exploding right now.
[153.64 → 153.74] Wow.
[155.42 → 158.28] Another thing that's exploding is Microsoft's AI robot.
[158.60 → 158.76] So...
[158.76 → 159.84] Just totally...
[159.84 → 161.84] You guys have probably heard about this.
[161.96 → 163.26] I'm going to post this in the chat.
[163.34 → 163.84] Give me a second.
[163.98 → 164.86] What do you want?
[166.06 → 167.14] He doesn't like the light.
[167.50 → 168.60] Why don't you like the light?
[168.74 → 169.28] It's bugging me.
[169.74 → 170.46] Why is it bugging you?
[170.46 → 171.04] It's too cool.
[171.68 → 171.92] Oh.
[172.24 → 173.58] Just don't worry about it.
[173.82 → 174.18] Anyway.
[174.48 → 175.12] Posting that in there.
[175.38 → 180.00] It is now in the chat, apparently because Jake the Farmer is locked in.
[181.06 → 182.66] And not my account.
[183.00 → 185.26] So it's not being followed properly.
[185.74 → 194.08] Can you go in the Twitch chat and post the link from the doc for Ars Technica into there?
[194.08 → 201.76] Because that should probably be my account, and then it will actually do it repeatedly and the bot will work and stuff.
[201.96 → 203.24] Oh my goodness.
[203.66 → 205.50] Way to screw up everything, Mackay.
[206.00 → 206.58] Mackay.
[206.84 → 207.32] Mackay.
[207.54 → 208.18] Jack.
[208.18 → 208.80] Oh, sorry.
[208.80 → 208.86] Jack.
[208.86 → 208.90] Jack.
[208.90 → 209.18] Jack.
[209.18 → 209.76] Jack.
[210.84 → 212.68] I forgot his name was Jack.
[212.94 → 213.26] Anyway.
[213.58 → 216.50] So I'm going to screen share this in a moment.
[216.66 → 218.20] I'm not used to doing Linus' stuff.
[218.20 → 227.28] So this innocent little AI robot named Tay started to go slightly insane.
[227.48 → 227.78] Completely.
[227.78 → 234.14] She started to go slightly insane because how it worked was you could talk with her, and she would learn based on the people that she talked to.
[234.14 → 236.02] So she would grow and learn and develop.
[236.14 → 240.86] She's supposed to be essentially a teen girl who was influenced by society.
[241.20 → 242.74] Relatively interesting concept.
[242.94 → 243.34] Cool.
[243.44 → 244.12] Cool idea.
[244.22 → 244.62] Microsoft.
[245.14 → 251.58] It started off with her tweeting stuff like, can I just say I'm super stoked to meet you?
[251.68 → 253.12] Humans are super cool.
[253.70 → 256.94] And then you see where she starts to kind of break.
[257.12 → 259.60] And that's when she starts saying stuff like, chill.
[259.72 → 260.58] I'm a nice person.
[260.82 → 262.10] I just hate everyone.
[262.10 → 262.94] Only the beginning.
[263.74 → 264.10] Yeah.
[264.26 → 265.06] Really only the beginning.
[265.28 → 270.64] And then it goes to I'm effing hate feminists, and they should all burn and die.
[270.64 → 276.60] To someone whose name starts with H was right, and I hate the something else.
[276.70 → 278.94] I'm not saying that because I don't want to give people sound bites.
[279.84 → 281.70] To like all capital letters.
[281.84 → 284.46] We're going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.
[284.54 → 288.78] And like just starts going absolutely ham.
[289.16 → 294.04] Which really, if it's so bad, if it's saying the exact same things,
[294.14 → 299.04] that certain presidential candidates are saying, what is the state of the world?
[299.16 → 302.56] I think this is more of a, you know, we need to sit around a campfire and really talk this one.
[302.64 → 306.34] Because I'd really, the state of the world, people.
[306.34 → 311.62] Well, Microsoft had to take this bot down because of the terrible things it learned from a presidential candidate.
[312.84 → 313.24] Sorry.
[313.38 → 313.90] I'll let you get back.
[313.90 → 315.58] I'm having a terrible time trying to post this link.
[315.86 → 316.88] It's going to happen once we're done.
[316.92 → 317.24] I promise.
[317.44 → 320.28] I got to make sure this thing is even public.
[321.10 → 321.78] Wait one second.
[322.22 → 327.68] I just, the things that I took from this was that I'm actually very happy they did it.
[327.68 → 330.82] Because something that's been going around for a while is people saying essentially,
[331.30 → 334.24] oh, we don't have to worry about AI and robots and all this kind of stuff.
[334.24 → 336.36] Because we'll just tell it not to be evil.
[337.34 → 340.44] And then it's going to obviously not be evil.
[340.80 → 342.70] And everything will be fine.
[342.90 → 343.42] That's true.
[343.52 → 344.02] That's true.
[344.14 → 345.48] It's not necessarily that easy.
[345.48 → 348.38] Because what do you define as evil?
[348.84 → 350.80] How does it know what's actually bad?
[350.80 → 356.30] If an overwhelming percentage of people that are messaging it are messaging it these specific things,
[356.74 → 360.62] maybe because other bots were created to spam it, I don't really know,
[361.04 → 364.50] it's probably going to think that that is the right thing.
[364.92 → 367.12] And it's going to be extremely hard to program it otherwise.
[367.48 → 368.36] So, I don't know.
[368.50 → 369.26] Pretty interesting.
[370.06 → 372.80] I'm personally a little scared of AI and what's going to happen.
[372.88 → 374.90] And I think this was the first little taste of it.
[375.02 → 379.30] Really harmless in the end, but kind of possibly a projection.
[379.30 → 382.60] Yeah, and the thing is, you're not the only one.
[382.84 → 386.60] Having people like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking being like,
[386.72 → 387.78] AI is super crazy scary.
[387.78 → 388.90] And some smart people on my side.
[388.90 → 389.62] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[389.90 → 390.22] Absolutely.
[390.46 → 391.38] Yeah, so I don't know.
[391.42 → 392.64] I think AI is going to be great.
[392.80 → 394.62] And I think it's going to do a lot of great things.
[394.88 → 397.34] I'm excited about the moment.
[397.52 → 398.10] Have you seen that movie?
[398.50 → 399.16] Yes, I have.
[399.18 → 402.16] Yeah, when you can have genuine conversations with your phone.
[402.74 → 403.44] It would be kind of cool.
[403.58 → 404.54] I am excited about that kind of stuff.
[404.58 → 406.64] But it is terrifying, and I hope we don't screw it up.
[406.64 → 410.12] But that's why people like Elon Musk and those other guys that I mentioned.
[410.30 → 411.04] Stephen Hawking.
[411.12 → 412.96] I don't know if Stephen Hawking is actually a part of that project.
[413.18 → 416.30] But anyway, Elon Musk has started this program.
[416.38 → 417.22] I don't remember the name of it.
[417.30 → 423.00] Where they're working very hard to try to figure out ways to make AI not evil.
[423.32 → 423.58] Right.
[423.68 → 424.06] I guess.
[424.70 → 425.66] Yeah, that's the best way to say it.
[425.66 → 427.56] Human preservation, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[427.58 → 428.42] All this other kind of stuff.
[428.90 → 432.40] So if we'd accomplish that, things are borderline limitless, right?
[432.98 → 433.34] Yes.
[433.60 → 434.12] That's a hurdle.
[434.12 → 437.54] Although at the same time, capitalism won't really be able to exist.
[437.64 → 438.40] Oh, yeah, definitely.
[438.56 → 440.94] At least in its current form in that way.
[441.92 → 446.06] So that will be interesting because a lot of people super like capitalism.
[446.36 → 446.90] That's true.
[447.08 → 448.96] We can tie that into our future pizza story.
[449.08 → 449.82] We'll get to that later.
[450.04 → 450.70] Future pizza.
[450.82 → 452.36] No, let's talk about future pizza right now.
[452.38 → 453.14] You want to talk about future pizza?
[453.14 → 453.62] I like it.
[453.66 → 453.78] Yeah.
[453.86 → 455.88] So post the Engadget link in the chat.
[456.30 → 458.12] I'm going to jump to the Engadget link right now.
[458.12 → 464.24] So while he's jumping to that, Domino's has a little robot that's going to deliver you pizza,
[464.64 → 465.46] possibly in the future.
[465.72 → 470.64] It's doing it right now in Australia, I think is kind of a beta thing going on right now.
[470.72 → 471.88] But it's fascinating.
[472.12 → 472.46] Queensland.
[472.78 → 473.56] Queensland, yeah.
[473.90 → 480.04] And really, you could point to this possibly as the first jobs lost due to vehicle automation.
[480.70 → 485.58] I think there's been some minor stuff where it's happened.
[485.58 → 487.72] Like I think some like mining sites.
[488.60 → 489.46] I've heard about that.
[489.56 → 490.60] I wasn't sure if that was for Walmart.
[490.60 → 491.14] Go or not.
[491.28 → 492.88] I've heard of Walmart semis that have it too and stuff.
[492.94 → 494.76] But I haven't actually like seen any of it.
[494.90 → 495.06] Yeah.
[495.12 → 498.58] And I think this is very in your face considering you could order a pizza and it would show up.
[498.58 → 500.04] Maybe the first like large scale.
[500.24 → 502.42] It's not like a few mining trucks or something.
[502.42 → 502.94] Yeah, like small like testing stuff.
[503.00 → 505.68] Like they're actually pushing this out, which is kind of interesting.
[506.80 → 508.42] High school is going to be even more of a struggle now.
[508.88 → 509.62] No, seriously.
[509.86 → 510.06] Yeah.
[510.22 → 510.44] Yeah.
[510.50 → 514.12] Because like pizza delivery guys actually have relatively all right jobs.
[514.12 → 518.36] I already always wondered how they make any money now with fuel costs and all that kind
[518.36 → 518.78] of stuff.
[518.86 → 520.74] And now there's just going to be no job at all.
[520.88 → 521.06] Right.
[521.10 → 523.94] You know, I actually literally not lying to you saw a Domino's car yesterday.
[524.36 → 524.48] Yeah.
[524.58 → 525.12] Guy in his car.
[525.20 → 525.64] He had his N.
[525.68 → 527.02] You know what that is if you live around here.
[527.28 → 530.60] And he has a little Domino's topper on top of his car like a little Rocket League hat.
[530.78 → 531.00] Yeah.
[531.06 → 531.28] You know.
[531.28 → 531.42] Yeah.
[531.42 → 534.94] And I was driving around doing his job, making some money, you know, on a Friday evening
[534.94 → 535.58] after school.
[535.88 → 538.92] Domino's should work with Rocket League and get like a Domino's hat.
[539.00 → 539.62] That would be cool.
[539.74 → 540.20] That would be cool.
[540.32 → 540.70] That would be cool.
[540.70 → 542.52] Rocket League has all the hats in the world right now.
[543.32 → 543.92] Shout out Briggs.
[544.00 → 544.62] Saw him in the chat.
[544.82 → 546.16] But he wanted me to give him a shout-out.
[546.18 → 546.60] But there you go.
[546.90 → 548.26] But play a lot of Rocket League.
[548.42 → 549.42] But you know, that would be perfect.
[549.50 → 550.02] That would be perfect.
[550.12 → 550.42] You know what?
[550.42 → 551.34] You guys should hook up with them.
[551.42 → 552.16] They've got a bunch of.
[552.34 → 554.30] You could have little orange like Linus Tech Tips.
[554.42 → 555.20] Oh, that would be sick.
[555.20 → 555.60] Like hat or something.
[555.90 → 556.56] Oh my God.
[556.60 → 557.14] That would be cool.
[557.22 → 558.22] Like not even like a whole car.
[558.32 → 558.98] We'll start small.
[559.10 → 559.80] Like a little antenna.
[560.02 → 560.22] Yeah.
[560.84 → 561.44] A antenna bomber.
[561.74 → 563.12] Little orange Linus Tech Tips one.
[563.24 → 563.46] Yeah.
[563.58 → 565.56] Or if we got like the screwdriver or something.
[565.62 → 565.76] Yeah.
[565.80 → 566.18] The screwdriver.
[566.50 → 567.04] That would be cool.
[567.26 → 567.38] Yeah.
[567.80 → 570.66] Any rocket trail of like CPUs coming out and GPUs.
[570.72 → 571.28] Oh my God.
[571.40 → 572.48] Spewing out the back.
[572.64 → 572.82] And like.
[572.82 → 573.18] That could be crazy.
[573.18 → 575.08] You could have like Linus's laugh as the soundtrack.
[576.58 → 577.56] Call me Rocket League.
[577.78 → 578.58] I got you.
[579.88 → 581.76] I could be the correspondence between this.
[581.76 → 582.22] I can do this.
[582.28 → 582.68] I can do this.
[582.86 → 584.58] As you can see, it's actually not very small.
[584.58 → 588.12] When I first heard about this, I thought that it was going to be.
[588.24 → 588.36] Here.
[588.46 → 590.38] I'll play this video and just mute it.
[591.12 → 592.74] Or I'll turn it very low.
[593.06 → 594.12] Actually, I don't know how loud this is.
[594.16 → 594.64] I'll just mute it.
[595.46 → 596.88] I'm going to jump through this like.
[596.96 → 597.48] Oh my God.
[597.94 → 598.34] Computers.
[598.50 → 599.86] And then show the actual thing.
[600.76 → 602.04] It's tiny.
[602.38 → 607.60] And I think it's more designed to like drive on the grass or drive on the sidewalk kind of deal.
[607.66 → 609.16] Instead of driving on the road.
[609.34 → 611.22] It does come from military tech.
[611.22 → 614.04] Apparently, there are a few thousand dollars worth of tech inside of it.
[614.10 → 615.56] Which brings up another question.
[615.68 → 616.04] Which is.
[616.26 → 619.30] When is the first one going to be looted by a dude in a big truck?
[619.50 → 619.82] Absolutely.
[620.70 → 621.78] Just run it over.
[621.92 → 622.96] Or just vandalized.
[623.32 → 623.52] Yeah.
[623.76 → 624.06] You know.
[624.26 → 625.24] Just purely vandalized.
[625.26 → 626.02] It's very small.
[626.12 → 628.28] Someone spray paints the camera or something.
[628.60 → 629.10] So easy.
[629.26 → 629.48] Yeah.
[629.84 → 630.40] Too easy.
[630.66 → 631.48] Kick it over.
[631.76 → 632.98] It's not going to be able to write itself.
[633.18 → 634.38] It's just going to lay on its side.
[634.42 → 636.10] It's almost a similar story to the whole Microsoft AI.
[636.22 → 638.26] That could have been a really cool thing.
[638.26 → 639.50] But people had to make it bad.
[639.66 → 640.68] This could be a really cool thing.
[641.04 → 642.28] Hopefully, people don't make it bad.
[642.76 → 642.92] You know.
[643.56 → 645.26] I wonder if it's going to turn into like.
[645.62 → 648.24] Instead of like three or four delivery drivers.
[648.76 → 650.30] There's like a small army of these.
[650.46 → 653.38] And like one like rescue ops repair guy.
[653.52 → 654.84] Who has to like drive out.
[654.94 → 655.16] And like.
[655.54 → 656.16] All right, buddy.
[656.50 → 657.48] Someone kicked you over.
[657.56 → 658.64] I'll get you going again.
[659.06 → 660.14] I'll clear off your lens.
[660.38 → 661.34] Keep going, man.
[661.44 → 663.28] All the Transformers images in my head.
[663.34 → 663.52] Yeah.
[664.44 → 664.80] Transform.
[665.14 → 665.60] Fixes you.
[665.66 → 666.30] I'll get you going.
[666.30 → 668.20] He's got extra batteries if you're out of power.
[668.32 → 669.04] You know, whatever you need.
[669.12 → 670.40] He's got extra wheels.
[670.88 → 671.06] You know.
[671.14 → 672.26] And he doesn't just swap the rubber.
[672.38 → 672.54] No.
[672.62 → 673.56] Because that's just bang, bang.
[673.56 → 673.94] New wheel.
[673.94 → 674.34] Just the entire thing off.
[674.34 → 675.04] You got to get the pizza there.
[675.14 → 675.30] Yeah.
[675.38 → 676.06] If it's cold.
[676.38 → 677.24] You don't get paid for it.
[677.26 → 677.94] It's a serious problem.
[678.24 → 679.44] If someone's kicking your thing over.
[679.56 → 680.96] And then your pop fizz is when you open it.
[681.00 → 681.82] That's just rude.
[682.02 → 682.22] Done.
[682.28 → 682.92] Then you call back.
[682.96 → 683.40] And you're mad.
[683.46 → 684.08] And then you go on Twitter.
[684.18 → 685.04] And say something angry.
[685.26 → 686.04] This was another thing.
[686.38 → 686.94] That dog.
[686.94 → 687.20] Well trained dog.
[687.32 → 687.76] Well trained.
[688.08 → 689.84] So every single dog on the planet.
[689.84 → 690.88] Isn't going to be like.
[691.34 → 692.14] Oh my god.
[692.20 → 693.28] What the hell is that?
[693.32 → 694.30] I want to bite it.
[694.60 → 694.78] Like.
[695.26 → 695.58] Something.
[695.74 → 696.12] Chase it.
[696.26 → 696.52] Like it.
[696.60 → 697.12] Jump on it.
[697.58 → 698.02] Something's going to.
[698.06 → 698.44] I want to.
[698.52 → 699.32] I want to go back here.
[699.34 → 700.42] I love the fact that it has.
[701.26 → 702.60] Little underflow lights.
[702.78 → 703.84] Did you see that in that one picture?
[703.96 → 704.86] Very nicely cable managed.
[705.00 → 705.16] Well.
[705.30 → 705.58] Underflow lights.
[705.58 → 706.02] That's true.
[706.08 → 706.54] Very nice.
[706.66 → 707.84] I just saw that for like a second.
[708.20 → 708.40] Yeah.
[708.44 → 708.96] See right there.
[709.02 → 709.32] There you go.
[709.32 → 710.06] It's got some little underflow.
[710.06 → 711.70] I haven't actually bought the new Need for Speed.
[711.78 → 712.84] Probably going to do it this weekend.
[713.14 → 713.24] So.
[713.84 → 714.46] Got some underflow.
[714.60 → 714.80] Yes.
[714.80 → 715.82] That's my high school days.
[715.82 → 716.56] 2005.
[717.10 → 717.24] Yeah.
[717.24 → 718.22] I miss those.
[718.30 → 719.48] Get some neon going on.
[719.66 → 719.96] Meet me.
[720.16 → 720.80] He's cute.
[721.16 → 721.68] He is cute.
[721.76 → 722.14] He is cute.
[722.30 → 723.26] I think he could be.
[723.52 → 723.78] Like.
[723.86 → 725.52] I want to see stylized ones.
[725.64 → 725.76] Like.
[725.82 → 727.70] I want to see an R2D2 one.
[728.02 → 728.86] I want to see.
[728.98 → 729.10] Oh.
[729.14 → 731.12] They could definitely do that around like movie launches and stuff.
[731.14 → 731.24] Oh.
[731.28 → 731.56] Absolutely.
[731.56 → 733.34] Like the next Star Wars when it comes out.
[733.46 → 733.50] Yeah.
[733.50 → 736.22] They could definitely do like a BB-8 stylized.
[736.24 → 736.52] Yeah.
[736.52 → 736.56] Yeah.
[736.56 → 736.94] Exactly.
[737.12 → 738.06] Kind of like Uber does.
[738.16 → 738.26] Right.
[738.34 → 739.74] Like when we were at PAX.
[739.84 → 740.28] Oh my god.
[740.30 → 741.40] They had the Mad Max ones.
[741.96 → 743.16] They look so awesome.
[743.52 → 743.70] You know.
[743.74 → 746.58] And there were different things you see on Reddit about different Uber drivers.
[746.58 → 748.52] Like there was the Snowstorms.
[748.52 → 751.28] You see this one Uber driver who's got the totally done H1.
[751.52 → 752.18] The Cool Hummer.
[752.56 → 753.28] If you don't know what that is.
[753.50 → 753.68] You know.
[753.72 → 754.50] He's getting a lot of business.
[754.56 → 755.54] Kind of just stylized things.
[755.60 → 756.88] They could totally do this for the movies.
[757.06 → 759.26] Or you could see like the Alaskan delivery boss.
[759.34 → 760.40] Got like spike tires.
[760.56 → 761.92] And he's all raised and stuff like that.
[761.92 → 764.78] It would be cool just to have the different kind of unique personalities.
[765.16 → 765.36] Yeah.
[765.46 → 767.34] Because right now it's in Queensland, Australia.
[767.34 → 770.50] But they are trying to work on like adapting it.
[770.58 → 773.18] And making sure that it can be deployed basically everywhere.
[773.18 → 778.08] One thing that is interesting about this is that they're going to have to fight with different laws.
[778.62 → 778.94] Absolutely.
[778.94 → 780.64] Than most automated vehicle guys will.
[780.94 → 782.66] Because they're not dealing with road laws.
[782.76 → 783.94] They're dealing with sidewalk laws.
[784.84 → 787.54] And like the first time this thing runs someone over.
[788.54 → 790.96] Which I have to assume will eventually happen.
[791.16 → 791.30] Yeah.
[791.44 → 792.22] Is going to be insane.
[792.88 → 793.04] Yeah.
[793.14 → 794.02] Because it doesn't run someone over.
[794.10 → 796.88] But like hits an old lady's walker and then she falls over.
[796.94 → 797.92] Something's going to go wrong.
[797.98 → 798.14] Yeah.
[798.14 → 798.40] And like.
[798.40 → 800.30] Even if it's the person's fault completely.
[800.56 → 801.98] Like they could just run in front of it.
[802.04 → 802.84] Stop and lay down.
[802.90 → 803.70] And the thing runs it over.
[804.64 → 807.60] The world works in the way that their dominoes are going to get in trouble.
[807.90 → 807.92] So.
[808.22 → 808.64] It's.
[808.74 → 809.08] It'll be.
[809.12 → 809.22] Yeah.
[809.22 → 809.86] It'll be interesting.
[810.06 → 810.08] And.
[810.26 → 811.20] But it's kind of.
[811.48 → 811.76] It's a.
[811.84 → 813.06] It's just a really cool idea.
[814.14 → 814.82] I just.
[815.26 → 815.62] Yeah.
[815.76 → 816.04] I am.
[817.18 → 819.54] Another interesting thing too is they're not going to come to your door.
[820.42 → 820.74] Yeah.
[820.78 → 822.66] You have to go out kind of on the street.
[822.78 → 823.84] Or does it go up your driveway.
[824.18 → 824.40] Is it going to text you?
[824.40 → 828.14] And then for some people like if there's like steps up to your door it's not going to
[828.14 → 828.88] be able to do that.
[829.00 → 829.90] So does it come to.
[830.06 → 830.48] Where does it.
[830.82 → 833.46] What if you're just loaded, and you have an automated gate system.
[833.58 → 834.24] What happens then?
[834.30 → 835.48] Do you have to go all the way down to your gate?
[836.04 → 838.48] You get a butler to get your pizza because you're loaded.
[838.60 → 838.96] That makes sense.
[838.96 → 839.60] I'm not really sure.
[839.78 → 839.88] Yeah.
[839.88 → 840.24] That's fair.
[840.28 → 840.82] The other thing is.
[841.10 → 841.92] Butler pizza tips.
[842.78 → 846.98] It would really only work in kind of more dense areas.
[846.98 → 847.32] I deep.
[848.66 → 852.46] It's really not going to work in anything that's considered even slightly rural.
[852.46 → 853.46] Yeah.
[853.46 → 853.70] You know.
[853.70 → 857.06] So it will be focused on kind of downtown core areas.
[857.06 → 857.50] Yeah.
[857.86 → 858.10] You know.
[858.18 → 860.06] Like even where we live I'm not even sure how.
[860.42 → 862.38] Like let's take where you're at right now.
[862.40 → 863.22] It's kind of packed.
[863.32 → 866.78] I couldn't really imagine that thing just running up and down the sidewalk with all the
[866.78 → 867.98] people around and all that.
[868.02 → 870.08] But then they did show in the clip.
[870.20 → 870.72] I don't know if.
[871.00 → 872.42] It targets the garbage can.
[872.42 → 873.78] Like shoot it.
[873.88 → 874.02] Yeah.
[874.08 → 876.60] And it's like oh quickly we'll move lazily to the left.
[876.74 → 876.92] Yeah.
[877.60 → 879.32] It's doing a hand solo manoeuvre.
[879.62 → 882.86] I saw it driving off the road.
[883.62 → 885.34] Everyone liked the lady was jogging past whatever.
[885.62 → 886.36] So it could go off the road.
[886.36 → 890.64] But then if it like drives through someone's lawn and leaves track marks.
[890.76 → 892.16] People are crazy about their lawns.
[892.36 → 893.32] Oh my God.
[893.40 → 894.12] People would be pissed off.
[894.18 → 894.40] Yes.
[894.50 → 895.14] Very much so.
[895.90 → 896.30] Wow.
[896.52 → 897.98] I don't give two crafts about my lawn.
[898.06 → 898.86] But like some people.
[898.98 → 899.60] I don't have a lawn.
[899.64 → 900.32] Super particular.
[900.56 → 901.32] So there you go.
[901.40 → 902.08] I barely do.
[902.72 → 903.46] It's kind of a lawn.
[903.54 → 904.40] Sometimes it's a forest.
[904.62 → 904.78] Yeah.
[904.88 → 906.28] I prefer it when it's a forest.
[906.28 → 908.08] Although most people don't agree with me.
[908.26 → 909.76] I don't think we should cut the grass.
[909.84 → 912.08] Grass is nice to you.
[912.32 → 913.26] You're standing in wrong.
[913.50 → 915.56] You're literally just slicing it over and over.
[915.66 → 916.36] Just murdering.
[916.44 → 917.76] Have you not seen that new?
[917.76 → 919.28] And then you're making it eat itself.
[920.18 → 920.46] Yeah.
[920.52 → 920.74] Right?
[920.98 → 921.38] Fertilize.
[921.46 → 922.16] It's so rude.
[922.28 → 922.68] Disgusting.
[923.06 → 923.50] Cannibalism.
[923.52 → 924.08] You should feel bad.
[924.88 → 925.28] Plantalism.
[925.28 → 929.18] Have you seen that trailer for whatever new movie?
[929.24 → 930.02] I don't remember what it's called.
[930.94 → 931.88] The food one?
[932.66 → 932.94] I have not.
[932.94 → 935.10] Where they're like, oh my god, we're going to be taken home.
[935.18 → 935.98] We're so excited.
[936.30 → 936.98] Have you seen that?
[937.10 → 939.32] I wish I could lie to you and say it.
[939.72 → 941.70] I'm going to spoil a trailer.
[941.92 → 942.88] I don't know if that matters.
[943.42 → 945.08] Some trailers spoil the whole movie.
[945.26 → 946.82] Batman vs. Superman, for example.
[946.82 → 948.54] So I'm sure you're good.
[949.24 → 952.80] It's made by the same dudes that made Pineapple Express and Super bad.
[953.26 → 953.58] Okay.
[953.58 → 957.12] Oh, is it the R-rated Seth Rogen comic?
[957.32 → 957.92] I think so.
[957.94 → 960.06] Local Vancouver guy making movies?
[960.16 → 960.54] I think so.
[960.58 → 961.82] And it's based around food?
[961.92 → 962.22] Yes.
[962.36 → 962.58] Yeah.
[962.78 → 963.04] Yeah.
[963.22 → 964.02] I've seen yes.
[964.12 → 964.26] Okay.
[964.44 → 965.42] I don't know why that made...
[965.42 → 968.22] That took us so long to get here that I don't remember where we were.
[968.52 → 968.98] It's okay.
[969.14 → 969.76] It's the journey.
[970.36 → 971.16] That's really weird.
[971.16 → 972.90] Other Pinterest things you can post, you know?
[974.38 → 978.84] Someone needs to take a screenshot of this and then very similar to the Squarespace you
[978.84 → 979.46] should think.
[979.76 → 982.70] Just put like white, bold Helvetica text and just...
[982.70 → 983.42] It's the journey.
[983.52 → 984.26] It's the journey.
[984.44 → 984.60] Yeah.
[985.00 → 986.14] That's why we're always late.
[986.22 → 986.76] It's the journey.
[987.04 → 987.34] Yeah.
[987.44 → 988.24] It's not about being prompt.
[988.46 → 988.90] Exactly.
[989.62 → 992.16] So, iPads, speaking of not being prompt...
[992.16 → 992.64] Oh!
[994.04 → 994.48] Oh!
[995.30 → 996.28] So many shots fired.
[996.38 → 997.36] Wait, I'm not posting this.
[997.42 → 997.72] You are.
[997.82 → 998.52] Anyway, okay.
[998.68 → 1000.28] So, 9 to 5 Mac.
[1000.84 → 1004.28] If you can find it, it should be right under the previous one.
[1004.86 → 1006.20] I don't know where that was.
[1009.44 → 1010.26] You'll find it.
[1010.26 → 1018.80] Anyway, the iPad Pro 9.7 has a lower clock CPU and only 2GB of RAM compared to 4GB for
[1018.80 → 1020.40] the 12.9 inch model.
[1020.90 → 1026.22] So, apparently RAM is like too expensive for Apple or something.
[1026.58 → 1027.16] I don't know.
[1027.72 → 1028.80] You know what people are always telling me?
[1029.64 → 1029.88] What?
[1030.06 → 1031.20] Sir, this card's also declined.
[1031.46 → 1034.56] But you know what else people are telling me is the iPads, they're just...
[1034.56 → 1035.44] Their announcements are...
[1035.44 → 1036.16] That's a joke, by the way.
[1036.22 → 1036.70] I'm doing all right.
[1036.70 → 1039.04] But the iPads are just...
[1039.04 → 1040.28] Sorry, not the iPads.
[1040.34 → 1044.38] But the Apple announcements are kind of coming with less punch every single time they come
[1044.38 → 1044.52] out.
[1045.10 → 1047.82] And I'm not an Apple guy, but I'm not a big hater, right?
[1047.94 → 1048.62] Girlfriend's got an iPhone.
[1048.74 → 1049.24] She loves it.
[1049.28 → 1049.82] It's great for her.
[1049.90 → 1051.02] It's all like what you need.
[1051.08 → 1054.04] I use my NFC almost every single day on my Android device.
[1054.26 → 1055.50] So, an iPhone's not for me.
[1055.58 → 1058.82] But they have a great place and I have no problem with people who enjoy the iPhone.
[1058.92 → 1060.00] I'm not into the battle at all.
[1060.08 → 1060.96] It's whatever works for you.
[1061.14 → 1061.26] Yep.
[1061.70 → 1064.54] But every one of these announcements just coming with less oomph.
[1064.62 → 1065.64] People are less excited.
[1065.64 → 1069.50] And even Apple people are just less excited with all these announcements.
[1069.72 → 1071.22] And I can totally see why in this iPad.
[1071.30 → 1073.48] This iPad is a downgrade.
[1073.62 → 1076.44] I'm sure they're going to play it as the old one is terrible and this is the new thing
[1076.44 → 1077.66] and everything will be white and pretty.
[1077.96 → 1081.92] But to be fair, it is smaller.
[1082.32 → 1082.82] It's smaller.
[1082.98 → 1085.56] It's a 9.7 inch instead of a 12 inch, which is pretty substantial.
[1085.64 → 1087.58] But why are we going soft on the RAM?
[1087.84 → 1088.52] They shouldn't have.
[1088.56 → 1090.80] Like, is that really something we need to skimp back on?
[1090.88 → 1092.62] They're like, okay, we're going to save some money here.
[1092.78 → 1093.90] Let's give them two gigs of RAM.
[1093.90 → 1096.28] Can we move past that two gigabyte RAM mark?
[1096.44 → 1098.16] Just four should be...
[1098.16 → 1100.66] The clock speed, if it's like a thermal issue, okay.
[1101.04 → 1104.06] The RAM, you could definitely make that work.
[1104.28 → 1105.24] And here's the other thing.
[1105.26 → 1105.96] There's no excuse for that.
[1105.98 → 1108.72] It's a 16 and a 36 gigabyte options.
[1108.84 → 1109.22] Excuse me.
[1109.64 → 1109.82] Right?
[1109.96 → 1111.08] Can we be done with 16?
[1111.24 → 1111.78] But here's the theory.
[1111.78 → 1113.04] How is that even still possible?
[1113.34 → 1113.70] Exactly.
[1113.90 → 1115.08] Do you want to know what my theory is?
[1115.18 → 1115.54] iCloud?
[1115.68 → 1116.00] iCloud.
[1116.22 → 1116.34] Yeah.
[1116.34 → 1118.30] They want you to subscribe to iCloud.
[1118.40 → 1119.82] So they're going to give you that 16 gigabyte...
[1119.82 → 1123.52] They just really want everyone's nudes to have the possibility of being leaked.
[1123.86 → 1124.40] That's a lot of money.
[1124.66 → 1125.14] Yeah, it is.
[1125.66 → 1126.16] Makes sense.
[1126.26 → 1127.98] Or if you're Gawker, then you're just nothing now.
[1128.18 → 1129.54] Just post porn videos.
[1129.54 → 1130.10] You're just, yeah.
[1130.22 → 1131.80] And then disappear as a company.
[1132.02 → 1132.20] Yeah.
[1132.56 → 1133.94] You were a thing, and now you're not a thing.
[1134.04 → 1134.60] Did you notice...
[1134.60 → 1134.72] Okay.
[1134.88 → 1137.14] Not to jump back on that topic because we talked about it last week.
[1137.14 → 1139.74] But did you notice he wore his thing in the corner?
[1139.74 → 1140.68] I didn't notice that.
[1140.80 → 1141.38] I didn't notice that.
[1141.56 → 1143.98] When I first saw it, I was like, oh, that's some sweet...
[1143.98 → 1144.82] No, that's not Photoshop.
[1145.00 → 1145.58] He did that.
[1145.96 → 1146.16] He did.
[1146.30 → 1146.90] He's the man.
[1146.98 → 1147.64] What a guy.
[1147.64 → 1148.16] He's the man.
[1148.40 → 1148.78] He's the man.
[1148.78 → 1149.08] Oh my goodness.
[1149.20 → 1150.60] I wonder if he wore that in the video.
[1150.80 → 1151.60] I never watched it.
[1153.50 → 1153.90] Uh...
[1153.90 → 1154.42] The only video...
[1154.42 → 1155.30] Just like, hold on, honey.
[1155.40 → 1156.14] I need to...
[1156.14 → 1157.26] Okay, then we're good.
[1157.48 → 1158.56] Oh, in the video.
[1158.62 → 1159.18] All right, brother.
[1159.30 → 1160.02] Wait, that got weird.
[1160.42 → 1160.78] Yes.
[1160.94 → 1161.20] Yes.
[1161.26 → 1162.82] The video I was thinking was...
[1162.82 → 1164.78] I watched some testimony and stuff.
[1165.10 → 1166.12] Man, is that stuff dry.
[1166.12 → 1168.12] It's not quite as exciting as suits, but, you know...
[1168.84 → 1169.14] It's...
[1169.14 → 1170.04] Some parts of it are...
[1170.04 → 1171.04] Some parts of it are pretty good.
[1171.10 → 1174.70] Some of the lawyers are witty and really get on, you know, the...
[1174.70 → 1175.46] Wait, am I doing this?
[1175.62 → 1177.50] The guy who's testifying there.
[1177.62 → 1179.24] That's okay, because I still haven't linked it.
[1180.10 → 1180.70] I just...
[1180.70 → 1181.34] I don't know how...
[1181.34 → 1182.18] I don't do this side.
[1182.24 → 1183.00] I do that side.
[1183.24 → 1184.26] So now you're doing that side.
[1184.32 → 1185.44] So I'm like, come on, man.
[1185.52 → 1185.74] Because I'm used to that.
[1185.74 → 1186.16] That's right.
[1186.20 → 1187.68] When we went to sit down, I was like...
[1187.68 → 1188.64] I was trying to remember in my head.
[1188.66 → 1190.12] I'm like, wait, which side does he sit on?
[1190.22 → 1190.52] Yeah, no.
[1190.60 → 1191.52] I sit on that side.
[1191.78 → 1192.78] And I share the links.
[1192.78 → 1195.74] I don't sit on this side and not share the links and make it go on the screen.
[1196.18 → 1196.90] So then I...
[1196.90 → 1198.12] I don't...
[1198.12 → 1198.86] I don't know what...
[1198.86 → 1199.62] I'm so confused.
[1199.68 → 1200.10] The Bro Show.
[1200.42 → 1201.20] It's always a little different.
[1202.02 → 1202.56] You know?
[1202.84 → 1203.70] The Bro Show.
[1204.10 → 1205.64] They should make a Bro Show.
[1205.86 → 1207.78] They should get the guy from...
[1207.78 → 1209.08] What is that?
[1209.20 → 1210.22] Bro Tips channel or whatever?
[1210.50 → 1210.78] Yeah.
[1211.36 → 1212.30] Is it literally just called it?
[1212.30 → 1213.50] I think that's what it's called.
[1213.56 → 1214.34] I know what you're talking about.
[1214.50 → 1215.00] Bro Life.
[1215.26 → 1215.78] Bro...
[1216.36 → 1216.76] Okay.
[1217.36 → 1218.42] I've definitely been there.
[1218.76 → 1219.64] Bro Fitness Tips.
[1219.64 → 1223.04] I don't remember the name of the thing, but it's actually an awesome channel.
[1223.14 → 1223.74] I love watching it.
[1223.80 → 1229.28] But he should have The Bro Show where they just talk about, like, workouts and stuff.
[1229.68 → 1233.62] I've always thought, because I think it was probably, like, six or seven months ago that
[1233.62 → 1235.00] I did the last WAN show.
[1235.16 → 1237.98] But I thought it'd be cool if we could get that little bottom banner to, like...
[1237.98 → 1238.44] Oh, my God.
[1238.54 → 1242.12] Put, like, The Bro and, like, write it in, like, little, like, comical little...
[1242.12 → 1242.76] That would be cool.
[1242.98 → 1243.74] ...font, you know?
[1243.82 → 1244.66] Oh, there is a Bro Show.
[1244.68 → 1245.76] Apparently there's a Bro Show.
[1246.98 → 1248.10] So this is The Bro Show.
[1248.10 → 1249.92] They don't look super Bro-y.
[1251.86 → 1252.22] Yeah.
[1252.32 → 1253.12] They look kind of Bro-y.
[1253.44 → 1253.68] Yeah.
[1255.78 → 1257.86] Yeah, I mean, okay, he's wearing a basketball shirt.
[1258.22 → 1259.10] That's pretty Bro-y.
[1259.28 → 1260.08] That is pretty Bro-y.
[1260.22 → 1261.00] I'll take that back.
[1261.12 → 1261.88] That is pretty Bro-s.
[1261.94 → 1262.94] All right, they're pretty Bro-y.
[1263.48 → 1263.98] There you go.
[1266.06 → 1266.38] Bros.
[1266.92 → 1268.42] I don't know who these guys are.
[1269.96 → 1271.12] We're just bumping somebody.
[1271.26 → 1274.54] We have no idea who they are, what they're a part of.
[1274.54 → 1274.84] Nope.
[1274.98 → 1276.46] Don't know what The Bro Show's about.
[1276.46 → 1280.94] Maybe they're all about building walls between countries to promote making things great.
[1281.14 → 1283.22] So, okay, not to, like, talk about politics for too long.
[1283.30 → 1285.26] You heard something about Canada getting a wall now?
[1285.42 → 1286.98] He said he's going to build a wall between Canada's.
[1287.06 → 1287.88] It's a quote.
[1287.96 → 1290.62] I watched the video on my phone at work because that's productivity.
[1291.24 → 1293.80] And they said they're going to build a wall.
[1293.86 → 1295.32] He said, and it started off nice.
[1295.68 → 1298.08] Like, I've only watched the video once, so I don't want to do an exact quote.
[1298.14 → 1298.92] Go find it for yourself.
[1299.04 → 1299.86] It's out there.
[1300.00 → 1301.54] And I'm sure you can find it pretty quickly.
[1301.54 → 1304.70] But he says, you know, it's a beautiful country and they're nice people.
[1304.78 → 1307.06] And he does all these things to kind of set us up all right.
[1307.12 → 1311.10] But he says we're bringing all the heroin down to the States, apparently.
[1312.28 → 1313.28] Weed, I could understand.
[1313.44 → 1314.56] Heroin, I don't really understand.
[1314.78 → 1315.04] Yeah.
[1315.20 → 1317.36] And it's so incredibly legal down there.
[1317.42 → 1321.24] I truly wonder if it's still going over in quantities like it was years and years ago.
[1321.62 → 1323.36] But, yeah, he said he's going to build a wall, and we're going to pay for it.
[1323.36 → 1324.52] And the exact same thing as Mexico.
[1324.52 → 1331.08] Which, like, I don't know if the whole GDP of Canada for a considerable amount of time could cover a quarter of that wall.
[1331.28 → 1331.40] No.
[1331.40 → 1332.26] Does he understand?
[1332.58 → 1335.22] Like, have you looked at, okay, the Mexican border is a thing.
[1335.22 → 1337.72] It's just a tiny little, compared to us, it's a sliver.
[1337.80 → 1338.22] It is.
[1338.30 → 1339.72] And that would be astronomically expensive.
[1339.72 → 1340.86] It's like not even our province.
[1341.22 → 1344.28] Let alone all the other provinces beside us that just keep on going.
[1344.36 → 1344.56] Yeah.
[1344.74 → 1346.74] Like, all the way to that other ocean over there.
[1347.32 → 1347.94] But, yeah.
[1348.00 → 1349.28] Like, what are you going to make it out of?
[1349.36 → 1349.66] Wheat?
[1349.82 → 1351.70] Like, we might be able to pull that off.
[1352.32 → 1352.72] Snow?
[1353.20 → 1354.20] Part of it, maybe.
[1354.20 → 1354.90] It could, yeah.
[1355.04 → 1359.34] Like, I don't think you understand how construction projects work.
[1360.30 → 1361.24] And he said, Canada's.
[1361.24 → 1363.10] On time, on budget, and we're going to pay for it.
[1363.52 → 1364.26] It's like, I don't know.
[1364.40 → 1367.02] We've got Trudeau's son in there and his dad.
[1367.36 → 1368.54] On time, on budget.
[1368.94 → 1373.46] Okay, have you ever seen any construction project at any large scale ever?
[1374.60 → 1375.04] What?
[1375.34 → 1375.78] Pretty much.
[1375.78 → 1378.08] And then we're going to, we can't.
[1378.30 → 1381.40] And our current prime minister is just going to nope the hell out of that anyway.
[1381.40 → 1382.56] We're really nice people.
[1382.78 → 1385.70] But in history, we've always been pretty nice.
[1386.22 → 1387.50] And when we get pushed, we fight back.
[1387.54 → 1388.52] So I have a feeling it's not going to happen.
[1388.84 → 1389.68] But it's true, though.
[1389.72 → 1390.14] It's true.
[1390.38 → 1392.40] We'll give you maple syrup and a hug.
[1392.64 → 1394.64] We would much rather things go nicely.
[1395.20 → 1396.46] But we're still here if things go bad.
[1396.52 → 1398.68] And we'll try to Irish you back if anything goes down.
[1398.78 → 1399.28] There you go.
[1399.28 → 1406.48] Anyway, Intel retries the TikTok development model, extending the life of each process.
[1406.66 → 1407.40] So give me once.
[1407.52 → 1408.14] Oh, wow.
[1408.34 → 1411.22] The link for this is literally garbage.
[1411.92 → 1414.12] So, okay.
[1414.28 → 1414.96] I don't know what to say.
[1414.96 → 1416.36] I'm having a hell of a time finding.
[1416.36 → 1421.30] Don't bother sharing that because that just went to arstechnica.com slash information technology,
[1421.54 → 1425.52] which is a giant list and not actually the one that it was supposed to.
[1425.60 → 1433.02] But if you guys Google, uh, Ars Technica Intel retries TikTok, that, uh, nope.
[1433.22 → 1433.94] That's not it either.
[1434.02 → 1434.90] That's not right at all.
[1434.90 → 1439.50] Um, if you click the chart depicting this, which is right below it.
[1439.98 → 1440.80] There we go.
[1441.22 → 1441.64] Cool.
[1442.80 → 1443.14] Yeah.
[1443.46 → 1443.78] Yeah.
[1444.46 → 1447.22] So, if you share that in the chat, that should help.
[1447.30 → 1450.08] I'm not going to show it on the screen because it's going to be partially covered by the camera
[1450.08 → 1450.80] and it doesn't really matter.
[1451.06 → 1454.02] Anyway, the new pattern is process architecture optimization.
[1454.54 → 1458.12] Under TikTok development, it was split into different ticks.
[1459.08 → 1463.58] Existing processor design would be migrated to a new manufacturing process.
[1463.58 → 1466.14] Um, which kind of makes sense.
[1466.28 → 1472.28] Essentially, uh, the new plan is to introduce a third generation of 14 nanometre processors
[1472.28 → 1474.32] called Kaby Lake or Kaby Lake.
[1474.38 → 1475.36] I'm not really sure how that goes.
[1475.56 → 1479.72] Before shrinking to the 10 nanometre process in the second half of 2017.
[1480.02 → 1484.00] So, we're going to have a little bit of a delay until we see 10 nanometers, which is
[1484.00 → 1488.16] not astounding looking at what happened on the graphics card side of things from NVIDIA
[1488.16 → 1490.80] talking about stuff, uh, the last week or two.
[1490.88 → 1493.46] Everyone's kind of pulling back a little bit.
[1493.58 → 1495.82] Trying to spend a little bit more time doing various things.
[1496.30 → 1499.02] Um, so it's not my industry.
[1499.46 → 1499.72] Yeah.
[1499.84 → 1500.92] IT so much anymore.
[1501.26 → 1504.10] Have to say, not excited with CPU releases.
[1504.76 → 1505.12] Yeah.
[1505.18 → 1508.78] I read this and was like, okay, I don't care.
[1508.96 → 1510.48] That's, that's kind of cool.
[1510.68 → 1512.54] I still at home run a 2600K.
[1512.54 → 1515.08] I do kind of want to upgrade that.
[1515.18 → 1517.04] Having some problems with my streams lately.
[1517.48 → 1518.58] CPU's a little old.
[1518.80 → 1520.40] But at the same time, I could overclock it.
[1520.44 → 1521.06] It would probably be fine.
[1521.70 → 1523.58] Um, but like, yeah.
[1523.68 → 1527.86] New process iterations are probably the most boring thing that happened in computers right
[1527.86 → 1527.96] now.
[1527.96 → 1529.82] Not true motherboards.
[1530.14 → 1530.50] No.
[1530.92 → 1533.02] Because storage has been improving.
[1533.38 → 1533.84] Yes, definitely.
[1534.04 → 1534.16] Yeah.
[1534.16 → 1534.30] I know.
[1534.32 → 1535.84] It's probably, it's probably RAM.
[1536.80 → 1537.08] Okay.
[1537.12 → 1537.56] It's RAM.
[1537.92 → 1538.24] RAM.
[1538.36 → 1539.90] And then I would probably say CPUs.
[1540.12 → 1540.34] Yeah.
[1540.52 → 1540.76] Yep.
[1540.76 → 1544.08] Like just the, the impact is, is very low.
[1544.72 → 1549.48] The only time RAM is an issue is when mobile devices are created with too little RAM.
[1549.58 → 1551.68] I feel like that's the only holdup we've got right now with RAM.
[1551.86 → 1552.12] Yeah.
[1552.12 → 1553.54] And like that's capacity.
[1553.66 → 1553.80] Yeah.
[1553.80 → 1554.06] Exactly.
[1554.36 → 1558.44] Which theoretically, we've already mostly, yeah, we've already mostly solved that problem.
[1558.86 → 1559.46] They're just not.
[1559.92 → 1565.12] That's, hey, we could save $3 on every phone we build if we cut back the RAM to something
[1565.12 → 1566.20] that's a little bit not enough.
[1566.48 → 1567.02] Okay, sweet.
[1567.60 → 1567.96] Okay.
[1568.16 → 1568.78] That's kind of what they do.
[1568.78 → 1571.00] Sorry to tell you this, but our docs are different.
[1571.12 → 1572.38] I have refreshed and reopened.
[1572.46 → 1575.20] I don't have the open this and I have a source to that you don't have.
[1575.24 → 1576.38] So I got no idea what's going on.
[1576.48 → 1577.88] Oh, this is last week's.
[1578.06 → 1578.88] How did, are you?
[1578.88 → 1579.78] March 18th.
[1580.52 → 1581.36] How did I even?
[1583.48 → 1584.34] So I was wondering.
[1584.34 → 1585.16] I pulled some mum magic.
[1585.34 → 1585.90] That's what I did.
[1586.00 → 1586.36] Yeah.
[1586.62 → 1587.52] With the button thing.
[1587.60 → 1587.80] Okay.
[1587.92 → 1589.76] So I'm going to give a little bit of an ad lib story here.
[1590.06 → 1593.02] We were playing keep talking and nobody explodes.
[1593.10 → 1593.88] Is that my email?
[1594.22 → 1596.78] If that's my email, just search for when and it should, there you go.
[1596.78 → 1597.30] I fixed it.
[1597.38 → 1597.56] Cool.
[1597.56 → 1597.64] Cool.
[1597.92 → 1599.38] We were, we were playing keep talking.
[1599.46 → 1600.00] Nobody explodes.
[1600.00 → 1602.12] And my mom was trying to do the button one.
[1602.12 → 1604.54] So like where it's like, it's a yellow button that says abort.
[1605.06 → 1607.98] And I was trying to do it like parallelized.
[1607.98 → 1611.32] Because I finished the, uh, the numbers game already.
[1611.32 → 1612.72] So I had nothing left to do.
[1613.06 → 1614.54] And I was like trying to figure it out.
[1614.56 → 1616.64] And I was waiting to ask Richard for more information.
[1616.80 → 1619.40] And my mom's just like click and release immediately.
[1619.40 → 1621.10] Or like hold and tell me the colour.
[1621.36 → 1624.04] And I listened to, I follow instructions like nobody's business.
[1624.04 → 1624.44] Yeah.
[1624.58 → 1627.80] So he, he jammed that out, and it worked twice in a row.
[1627.80 → 1628.28] Twice in a row.
[1628.36 → 1630.46] Both times she completely guessed.
[1630.72 → 1632.18] Had no idea.
[1632.22 → 1633.62] And both of them were one strike game.
[1633.78 → 1634.00] Yeah.
[1634.06 → 1635.12] Both of them were one strike game.
[1635.18 → 1635.38] Yeah.
[1635.38 → 1637.22] So like that would have blown up the entire bomb.
[1637.48 → 1638.20] Had no idea.
[1638.42 → 1640.42] Both times I just freaked out in my head.
[1640.42 → 1644.12] Because I'm like, I've read this thing over so many times.
[1644.12 → 1647.66] And there's one step, and she doesn't know the answer, but she's doing something else.
[1647.66 → 1648.62] She didn't ask me anything.
[1648.80 → 1649.08] No.
[1649.20 → 1650.26] Just like there's an abort button.
[1650.38 → 1650.64] Do it.
[1650.72 → 1651.80] And it worked both times.
[1651.88 → 1652.58] Like what the heck.
[1652.60 → 1653.46] Can't argue with results.
[1653.80 → 1655.02] And I'm like, how did you figure that out?
[1655.06 → 1655.92] She's like, I don't know.
[1656.04 → 1657.72] I just, I just followed the thing.
[1657.82 → 1658.80] And then I got the answer.
[1658.90 → 1660.32] I'm like, mom, that's not how it works.
[1660.76 → 1662.10] You have to get more information.
[1662.54 → 1664.32] Anyway, that was crazy.
[1664.32 → 1665.90] That was, that was a lot of fun though.
[1666.22 → 1666.44] Great.
[1666.54 → 1666.94] You know what?
[1667.02 → 1669.86] If, if you're looking for a family game, I think that's a perfect one.
[1670.14 → 1671.58] It's a really, it's really kind of fun.
[1671.72 → 1673.14] Keep talking to Nobody Explodes is awesome.
[1673.34 → 1675.32] And like it first came out as a VR game.
[1675.40 → 1676.96] You do not have to play it as a VR game.
[1676.96 → 1677.74] Not even slightly.
[1678.10 → 1678.26] No.
[1679.06 → 1680.82] You can definitely play it however the heck you want.
[1680.98 → 1681.74] It doesn't matter.
[1682.06 → 1682.32] Yeah.
[1682.40 → 1683.66] I guess if you want it to be more immersive.
[1684.18 → 1687.06] But even then, like without having an actual object.
[1687.28 → 1687.58] Yes.
[1687.80 → 1687.96] Yeah.
[1688.18 → 1689.60] And without having like interactive gloves or something.
[1689.60 → 1690.34] I'm trying to be really polite.
[1690.46 → 1691.14] I see no point.
[1691.38 → 1691.58] Yeah.
[1691.72 → 1692.04] Me neither.
[1692.04 → 1693.24] If I'm going to be blunt, I see no point.
[1693.24 → 1694.90] I'm the VR guy and I see no point.
[1694.92 → 1695.26] There you go.
[1695.26 → 1696.54] So it doesn't really matter.
[1696.92 → 1698.90] Anyway, jumping on forward.
[1699.10 → 1705.32] JJ Abrams proposed $50 home media or home movie service beneficial to movie theatres.
[1705.32 → 1709.26] Which the beneficial to movie theatres part sounds confusing at first.
[1709.44 → 1711.36] But it's actually not too bad.
[1711.46 → 1716.26] So essentially how it works is for every movie that you would like to watch.
[1716.26 → 1719.38] You can watch it right when it would be released in theatres at your house.
[1719.38 → 1721.82] It costs $50, which sounds a little high.
[1721.88 → 1725.70] But then if you think about it for like the average family of four, that should probably
[1725.70 → 1731.50] be slightly cheaper by like $10 probably depending on what you go to.
[1731.98 → 1733.44] Well, like let's split hairs.
[1733.70 → 1733.80] Yeah.
[1733.98 → 1735.64] Factor in transit or fuel.
[1736.32 → 1739.88] If you're really rich, and you have electric, you're not really worried about it right now.
[1740.04 → 1742.16] But, you know, just everything right down to snacks.
[1742.24 → 1745.78] You know, the popcorn that costs absolutely absurd amounts of money costs more than the fuel.
[1745.90 → 1747.30] More than gold per weight.
[1747.30 → 1748.88] Yeah, so it's insane.
[1749.62 → 1752.86] And it really, it's, I think the whole idea is they're trying to target a market they're
[1752.86 → 1753.60] currently not hitting.
[1753.72 → 1757.40] I don't think they're really afraid of losing the people that they already have who are avid
[1757.40 → 1757.98] movie goers.
[1758.04 → 1761.66] Like someone like myself, I really only go to the things that I really want to see.
[1761.90 → 1765.78] You know, I'm not really going, especially, one thing for me especially is comedies.
[1765.82 → 1766.70] I love comedy movies.
[1766.98 → 1771.48] I very rarely go to the theatre for a comedy movie because I feel like my living room is
[1771.48 → 1772.78] just a better environment for it.
[1773.08 → 1774.44] Let's take Star Wars, for example.
[1774.76 → 1775.92] You go to the theatres for that one.
[1775.92 → 1776.12] Yeah.
[1776.12 → 1776.66] At least I do.
[1776.66 → 1778.24] And that's a no-brainer for me.
[1778.52 → 1781.84] But they're trying to, I think, target those people like myself who are going to wait for
[1781.84 → 1786.34] it to come out later or at a different time and can really enjoy it in their living rooms
[1786.34 → 1787.18] with a group of people.
[1787.34 → 1787.96] And it could be a cost.
[1787.96 → 1791.50] There are also some movies that I would like to kind of see right away, but they don't
[1791.50 → 1792.78] really feel like movie theatre movies.
[1792.80 → 1793.00] Yeah.
[1793.24 → 1793.44] Yep.
[1793.58 → 1793.84] Definitely.
[1794.02 → 1795.92] Like if it's not this big action thing.
[1796.04 → 1796.42] Exactly.
[1796.62 → 1798.24] It's who cares about seeing it in movie theatre.
[1798.36 → 1799.14] It doesn't make any difference.
[1799.14 → 1800.14] Yep.
[1800.14 → 1805.24] So they will apparently give theatre owners $20 for every $50 spent to rent a film, which
[1805.24 → 1806.76] it's 50 bucks to rent a film.
[1806.86 → 1809.66] So every time you rent a film, they would give theatre owners $20.
[1810.32 → 1811.56] What about the little theatres?
[1811.56 → 1811.90] That sounds cool.
[1811.90 → 1812.76] The mom-and-pop theatres.
[1812.76 → 1813.70] Exactly what I was just going to say.
[1813.80 → 1819.24] Even here, if you ignore the little theatres, there are two big competitors.
[1819.46 → 1819.86] Mm-hmm.
[1819.88 → 1820.08] Yep.
[1820.52 → 1826.28] So who, do you have to like sign up with like, I would go to this theatre or like how?
[1826.82 → 1827.20] Yeah.
[1827.26 → 1828.08] Do you have to pick one?
[1828.20 → 1830.24] You're like, which theatre would you like to support today?
[1830.40 → 1831.62] Or do they split it?
[1831.68 → 1835.08] But if they split it, then everyone's making not much.
[1835.50 → 1838.86] I feel like the financial logistics of that are going to be a nightmare.
[1838.94 → 1839.60] A little messy.
[1839.60 → 1843.50] You also have to buy a set-top box that costs about 150 bucks.
[1843.78 → 1844.56] Not too surprising.
[1844.72 → 1846.14] It's an encrypted set-top box.
[1847.04 → 1850.66] And when you pay 50 bucks for a film, you get it for 48 hours.
[1850.78 → 1854.68] I would assume that this comes with certain benefits like being able to fast-forward,
[1854.82 → 1858.22] rewind, pause if someone wants to go to the washroom, a bunch of different things that
[1858.22 → 1859.42] would be nice if you're in a theatre.
[1859.72 → 1862.60] Like if someone mumbles something, and you're not really sure what they said.
[1862.86 → 1865.70] What I just said was if someone mumbles something, and you're not really sure what they said,
[1865.78 → 1868.62] being able to rewind it is cool.
[1868.62 → 1870.00] People obviously can't do that in theatre.
[1870.20 → 1872.60] You don't want to like talk to the person beside you to try to figure out what it was
[1872.60 → 1874.00] because that could be annoying to other people.
[1874.46 → 1876.54] If you need to go to the washroom, you can just pause it.
[1877.44 → 1883.20] You and your, like if you're a mom and dad, you could watch it.
[1883.76 → 1887.92] And then the next day someone else could watch it as long as they have the same set-top box
[1887.92 → 1888.30] in your house.
[1888.34 → 1889.92] So like, yeah, I don't know.
[1889.98 → 1893.92] If you rent a house, you could like to rent a movie and watch it by yourself and then let
[1893.92 → 1895.94] your roommates watch it afterwards, which is pretty cool.
[1895.94 → 1897.62] So it'd be really expensive.
[1897.94 → 1901.34] As a parent, you could watch it, you know, like let's say you have a Friday night date
[1901.34 → 1902.10] night or something like that.
[1902.14 → 1902.76] You could watch it.
[1902.82 → 1905.66] And if you think, you know, it's kind of on the edge for your kids to see, you get to
[1905.66 → 1906.14] preview it.
[1906.38 → 1908.78] Next night, the kids can watch it or, you know, something like that.
[1908.82 → 1910.12] I think there's a lot of opportunity in this.
[1910.36 → 1911.98] It's got some big names behind it as well.
[1912.14 → 1912.42] Yeah.
[1912.64 → 1913.84] I did actually link that article.
[1914.00 → 1914.80] So I did my job.
[1915.02 → 1915.26] Nice.
[1916.06 → 1918.04] We're swinging at about 25% right now.
[1918.04 → 1921.92] But we had to make sure the unions came together and make sure the posting was being done
[1921.92 → 1922.44] properly.
[1922.66 → 1922.94] Indeed.
[1923.10 → 1923.22] Yeah.
[1923.24 → 1925.32] I had to go through the proper steps, pay the proper people.
[1925.44 → 1925.64] Yeah.
[1925.64 → 1926.66] I'm not allowed to do it.
[1926.88 → 1927.20] Safety.
[1927.78 → 1928.14] Yes.
[1928.42 → 1928.66] Yeah.
[1928.74 → 1930.48] We have to make sure the laptop isn't going to shock you.
[1930.50 → 1931.02] It's true.
[1931.14 → 1931.62] It's true.
[1932.38 → 1933.18] Emotional safety.
[1933.32 → 1934.00] It's 2016.
[1934.28 → 1934.74] That matters.
[1934.78 → 1935.44] I could be upset.
[1935.60 → 1936.10] He could be.
[1936.86 → 1937.38] Are you?
[1937.62 → 1937.90] No.
[1938.16 → 1938.44] Okay.
[1938.44 → 1938.76] I'm good.
[1938.92 → 1940.26] If you were, we could take care of that.
[1941.04 → 1942.76] Just want to make sure everyone knows.
[1943.28 → 1947.14] But yeah, I think it's actually pretty cool because like sometimes I'm going to want to
[1947.14 → 1950.78] go to the theatre because it's like, okay, well, I haven't left my house in like four
[1950.78 → 1951.14] weeks.
[1951.14 → 1953.38] So going out once might be okay.
[1953.56 → 1954.04] That's true.
[1954.16 → 1958.90] But then other times if I'm just tired and want to stay at home or like midnight launches,
[1959.08 → 1960.62] that's one thing that I think is super cool.
[1960.86 → 1962.68] Some midnight launches like Star Wars.
[1962.68 → 1965.34] If you want to go to Star Wars, it's kind of cool because people in the line are going
[1965.34 → 1966.68] to be like wearing costumes and stuff.
[1966.78 → 1967.18] And that's awesome.
[1967.30 → 1968.50] Certain midnight launches are sick.
[1968.50 → 1968.98] The new Warcraft movie, maybe.
[1969.22 → 1969.86] Oh my God.
[1969.94 → 1972.38] I'm going to the theatre for that even if this existed.
[1972.38 → 1973.04] That's a theatre one.
[1973.14 → 1973.86] It doesn't matter.
[1974.24 → 1975.00] I'm going in the theatre.
[1975.14 → 1978.42] But other stuff that's less important, and you want to see it right away because you've
[1978.42 → 1982.64] been excited about a long time or like someone that this is actually really exciting for
[1982.64 → 1984.64] who isn't here is Brandon.
[1985.12 → 1987.12] I love watching movies with Brandon.
[1987.32 → 1987.68] If we go fly something.
[1987.68 → 1988.02] You said this.
[1988.12 → 1989.26] I'm just going to totally interrupt you.
[1989.78 → 1992.66] Brandon, I want to watch movies with you because Luke talks about this endlessly.
[1992.84 → 1994.16] I don't know why I had this rubber band on my thumb.
[1994.16 → 1998.76] He talks about it endlessly, and he just really enjoys it, and it would be, yes.
[1998.84 → 1999.80] It's wild because okay.
[2000.00 → 2000.28] Bro date.
[2000.28 → 2000.34] Bro date.
[2001.96 → 2004.64] I'd be down to triple bro date.
[2004.88 → 2005.02] Yeah.
[2007.18 → 2009.08] Do you like square it?
[2009.08 → 2009.56] What do you do?
[2009.66 → 2010.12] I don't know.
[2010.12 → 2010.44] Bros.
[2010.58 → 2011.40] Extension bro.
[2012.24 → 2013.34] Do you see where I'm going here?
[2013.54 → 2013.98] Broome.
[2015.70 → 2016.68] Let's move on.
[2016.76 → 2017.58] That got a little weird.
[2019.50 → 2021.90] Anyway, watching movies with Brandon is awesome.
[2022.04 → 2028.96] As you guys have seen, the two cool videos that we shot recently was the VR testing through
[2028.96 → 2029.44] steam.
[2029.60 → 2031.64] I don't remember the exact VR performance tests.
[2031.90 → 2033.72] And then the other one was kick farted.
[2033.82 → 2034.94] Both look super awesome.
[2035.06 → 2038.72] All of our B-roll stuff looks super great because Brandon is perfect at filming things and
[2038.72 → 2039.94] using lights and all that kind of stuff.
[2040.00 → 2040.90] He's done some tech cookies.
[2041.02 → 2042.58] He's done some LTTs on that kind of stuff.
[2043.02 → 2043.82] Follow his Instagram.
[2044.38 → 2044.64] Oh my God.
[2044.64 → 2045.72] His Instagram is very good.
[2045.78 → 2046.40] Follow his Instagram.
[2046.74 → 2048.96] I've got two buddies who are incredible at taking pictures.
[2049.32 → 2051.86] Mr. Johnny Chu and the man.
[2052.00 → 2052.56] And Brandon Lee.
[2052.70 → 2052.82] Yeah.
[2053.72 → 2058.06] But like he, I'll watch a movie and be like, I liked that.
[2058.36 → 2060.40] The action scenes were super cool.
[2060.78 → 2062.72] And then he'll be like, but why did you like it?
[2062.74 → 2065.66] Did you notice that it was framed in this way every time?
[2065.70 → 2068.00] And I was like, whoa, I didn't notice that, but it was awesome.
[2068.00 → 2073.26] Like I watched when we were flying back, no, it was when we were flying to Switzerland.
[2073.56 → 2075.20] I watched Mad Max on the flight.
[2075.52 → 2075.64] Yeah.
[2076.02 → 2078.04] And I was like, dude, the action scenes were super cool.
[2078.16 → 2081.22] And he's like, yeah, because he doesn't make you look for it.
[2081.40 → 2086.10] When he films it, he made it so that everything that was happening, like the important part
[2086.10 → 2089.16] of the action was always in like right in the middle of the frame.
[2089.48 → 2091.22] I'm like, that's fascinating.
[2091.54 → 2092.52] It's a different way of filming.
[2092.62 → 2097.18] And he's the one that showed me that a lot of like American action movies have tons of
[2097.18 → 2098.94] jump cuts in the fight.
[2099.04 → 2099.30] Yes.
[2099.64 → 2102.60] And then like Jackie Chan movies don't.
[2102.66 → 2104.04] It flows through the entire fight.
[2104.10 → 2107.04] And then I started to appreciate that a lot more, which kind of ruined other movies for
[2107.04 → 2107.14] me.
[2107.18 → 2108.34] But like, it's still fascinating.
[2108.62 → 2110.26] Anyway, I like watching movies with Brandon.
[2110.36 → 2114.48] So it would be cool to be able to do this for a brand-new movie and like to pick through
[2114.48 → 2115.30] it as we go.
[2115.80 → 2116.04] Yeah.
[2116.54 → 2117.02] I don't know.
[2117.24 → 2119.64] That's what I like about being on the flight is because I just pause it and then talk
[2119.64 → 2120.60] to him about it and then keep playing.
[2120.60 → 2125.12] Well, the 48-hour thing, you could just watch it all the way through, talk about it,
[2125.22 → 2127.12] watch it again, pick it apart, you know, on one of your
[2127.12 → 2129.70] guys' cool flights to wherever you're going next.
[2129.84 → 2131.14] But I don't know.
[2131.22 → 2132.18] I think that's pretty cool.
[2132.30 → 2132.66] It is.
[2132.70 → 2132.92] It is.
[2132.96 → 2136.24] I think, I think they really, they're really going to hit this one out of the park.
[2136.28 → 2139.18] I think they're going to hit a target market that they're not touching right now.
[2139.78 → 2141.52] And I think it could be a win-win.
[2142.04 → 2144.50] You know, you're saying you could pause your wine, hopefully better than Netflix.
[2144.88 → 2146.80] I still am a little disgruntled.
[2147.10 → 2150.70] If you're on a PC, it's great, but I wish I could control easier on my phone because
[2150.70 → 2151.88] on suits, they whisper too much.
[2151.88 → 2153.54] And I'm just trying to get through those four seasons, man.
[2153.54 → 2157.42] So it's, you know, and you can't miss anything, right?
[2157.46 → 2161.44] You know, girlfriend wants to say something, and I'm like, I got to pause, jump backwards.
[2161.66 → 2163.52] But, you know, it is how it is.
[2163.70 → 2164.38] Yeah, I hear that.
[2164.44 → 2165.06] That makes sense.
[2165.06 → 2171.46] This doc is pretty light this week because there's not a ton of people here.
[2172.32 → 2172.82] And Colton.
[2173.54 → 2174.14] Happy Easter.
[2174.50 → 2178.24] Who makes the yeah, speaking of which, who makes the WAN doc isn't here today.
[2178.30 → 2178.96] He was here yesterday.
[2178.96 → 2183.44] So he like tried to kind of cram it in and make a WAN doc kind of last minute.
[2183.66 → 2185.06] And it sort of worked.
[2185.28 → 2186.82] Although we're almost out of topics.
[2187.10 → 2188.62] So we'll see how that goes.
[2188.62 → 2195.76] But, speaking of almost out of topics, there's a thing that I can do that takes up time that
[2195.76 → 2198.68] isn't a topic and is super cool.
[2198.78 → 2198.94] Twitter?
[2201.10 → 2201.62] Sponsors!
[2202.08 → 2203.20] So Cooler Master is a sponsor.
[2203.30 → 2205.24] This is the first time they sponsor this thing with us.
[2205.34 → 2206.14] It's a keyboard.
[2206.36 → 2209.22] The Cooler Master Key Pro S and Pro L.
[2209.34 → 2210.94] The Pro S is a 10 keyless keyboard.
[2211.06 → 2213.62] The Pro L is a standard kind of sized keyboard.
[2213.62 → 2219.60] Both use Cherry MX Red or Cherry MX Brown switches, which is like probably the most popular two
[2219.60 → 2220.42] switches there are.
[2220.82 → 2225.78] Because the brown ones give you kind of the tactile bump but no audible click.
[2225.90 → 2229.86] And the red ones are just like, I'm for gaming because you can barely feel like you're typing
[2229.86 → 2230.76] on me and stuff.
[2231.08 → 2235.76] They have 16.7 million colour RGB just in case you like rainbows under your fingers.
[2236.30 → 2240.14] You can use on-the-fly macros to set up macros within your game.
[2240.24 → 2242.40] No need to like tab out into software to do that.
[2242.40 → 2244.58] You can be just macro code in your game, which is pretty cool.
[2245.14 → 2246.96] You have profile support.
[2247.06 → 2249.10] So you can have up to four different profiles on your keyboard.
[2249.48 → 2255.44] And it uses an industry-leading ARM Cortex M3 processor that clocks at 72 megahertz.
[2255.80 → 2256.02] Nice.
[2256.08 → 2261.58] Around 25% faster than the ARM Cortex M0 processor that is in many keyboards on the market today.
[2262.08 → 2264.28] So let me know if you've noticed an improvement from that.
[2264.40 → 2265.44] It also has a two-year warranty.
[2265.92 → 2266.68] Thank you, Cooler Master.
[2267.02 → 2267.54] Moving on.
[2267.54 → 2273.02] Just in case you want to mod something on your case.
[2273.18 → 2273.80] See what I did there?
[2273.94 → 2276.50] Just in case you want to mod your case.
[2277.02 → 2278.18] Your Cooler Master case.
[2278.46 → 2278.86] Whoa.
[2279.48 → 2280.94] You can use fixity stuff.
[2281.64 → 2283.00] So, yeah.
[2283.10 → 2285.36] I don't know where they're...
[2285.36 → 2287.40] Can you give me the fixity toolkit thing?
[2287.74 → 2288.66] The big one?
[2289.04 → 2289.78] The big one.
[2289.96 → 2290.36] Mackay?
[2291.36 → 2291.84] Mackay.
[2292.96 → 2293.52] Mackay.
[2293.52 → 2294.12] It's Jacob.
[2294.40 → 2295.20] Did he just repeat?
[2295.20 → 2296.28] Oh, he said something different.
[2297.46 → 2298.80] I don't know what the big...
[2298.80 → 2299.56] Is this the big one?
[2300.38 → 2300.70] No.
[2301.06 → 2301.86] Like, the big one.
[2302.00 → 2304.08] One of my good buddies, Whole Wheat, we'll call him.
[2304.16 → 2304.92] That's his gamer tag.
[2305.06 → 2305.68] Whole Wheat.
[2305.78 → 2307.06] Does all the things with the tools.
[2307.26 → 2307.46] Yeah.
[2307.58 → 2308.40] He likes this stuff.
[2308.54 → 2310.70] So as far as I'm concerned, it's an absolute ace.
[2310.98 → 2312.00] Well, hopefully we'll get it.
[2312.04 → 2315.16] But anyway, the Protect toolkit has had an update.
[2315.30 → 2318.48] So now it is a 64-bit kit itself.
[2318.48 → 2321.40] And it uses, like, magnets to hold its little lid on.
[2321.48 → 2323.70] And the lid can kind of be used as, like, a screwdriver...
[2323.70 → 2324.60] I saw that.
[2324.60 → 2326.70] ...screw bit tray while you have it temporarily and all that kind of stuff.
[2326.76 → 2327.18] It's pretty cool.
[2327.44 → 2331.02] There are more bits inside the screwdriver kit, which is great.
[2331.20 → 2333.20] We can only seemingly find the old ones.
[2333.32 → 2334.64] We have a lot of shrugging going on.
[2334.64 → 2338.36] The cool part about having more bits isn't just a higher number.
[2338.60 → 2339.02] 64.
[2339.50 → 2339.98] It doesn't...
[2339.98 → 2342.32] Like, that's actually not just marketing terms this time.
[2342.42 → 2347.02] It means that you can get through more stuff and properly because stripping screws and stuff...
[2347.02 → 2348.26] Having the right tool for the job.
[2348.84 → 2349.70] That's half the battle.
[2349.78 → 2350.50] Three quarters of the battle.
[2350.60 → 2351.76] Sometimes it's the entire battle.
[2351.94 → 2352.22] Sometimes.
[2352.74 → 2352.98] Yeah.
[2353.48 → 2358.72] It has a newly redesigned swivel top precision screwdriver, which is pretty sick.
[2359.36 → 2361.62] And flex extension for hard to reach screws.
[2361.62 → 2366.24] So you can, like, have your screwdriver here and have it go out and then down, actually.
[2366.24 → 2369.40] And then turn the screwdriver and the whole thing twists, and it'll end up...
[2369.40 → 2370.30] It's really cool.
[2370.38 → 2370.80] Pretty cool.
[2371.54 → 2375.36] Precision ESD-safe tweezers, including a pair of reverse tweezers.
[2375.46 → 2378.46] So you have those, like, black-coated ESD-safe tweezers.
[2378.84 → 2386.04] A wider variety of plastic opening tools and picks, which, honestly, while I liked the old Protect toolkit ones,
[2386.20 → 2388.84] I would find that the tips would break off.
[2388.84 → 2394.28] And it was actually kind of a problem because my Protect toolkit, which I've used to take a huge amount of things apart,
[2394.82 → 2399.34] most of the tips of the blue little spider things were broken off.
[2399.40 → 2401.28] And the new ones don't seem to do that.
[2401.40 → 2403.00] So this is actually, like, a significant improvement.
[2403.12 → 2405.76] That's probably my favourite part of the new Protect toolkit.
[2406.22 → 2408.80] It has suction cups for display assembly removals.
[2409.16 → 2413.82] It has metal spiders just in case you need an even more durable thing for, like, jimmying things open and whatnot.
[2413.82 → 2418.72] If you're into fixing phones or screens, like, that's something people can pay a decent amount of money for.
[2418.84 → 2422.46] If you've got, you know, the kind of handiness to do it, suction cups, man, this toolkit.
[2423.66 → 2425.96] It's what we use to fix my old S3 when I smash it up.
[2426.48 → 2427.66] By we, I mean whole wheat.
[2428.94 → 2430.40] He does a lot of that kind of stuff.
[2430.40 → 2436.92] The price for the Protect toolkit has increased to $69.95 because they have all this, like, new awesome stuff.
[2437.02 → 2438.00] I want to jump in there again, though.
[2438.02 → 2439.00] That's really not that expensive.
[2439.62 → 2440.38] Go to Home Depot.
[2440.58 → 2441.68] Look at some of the tools you've got.
[2441.74 → 2442.44] I know they can't.
[2442.44 → 2443.60] But look at some of the tools on the wall.
[2443.98 → 2444.68] We're looking at $70.
[2445.72 → 2449.06] That's really, you know, they're really not charging you too much.
[2449.10 → 2450.30] I really don't feel like that's an unfair price.
[2450.34 → 2451.92] Just personally, I don't even work here.
[2452.00 → 2454.00] This isn't an ad for myself.
[2454.18 → 2455.50] I just think that's a fair price, really.
[2455.78 → 2456.08] Yeah.
[2456.08 → 2459.68] And speaking of fair price, if you use offer code Linus, you get $10 off.
[2460.08 → 2461.16] So it's even cheaper.
[2461.34 → 2463.82] That makes it $59.95 instead of $69.95.
[2463.82 → 2464.16] There you go.
[2464.40 → 2466.88] And it's backed by fixity's lifetime warranty.
[2467.32 → 2469.12] So get it because it's awesome or don't.
[2469.24 → 2474.64] You still get access to all their free resources if you need to do stuff like repairing phones on iFixit.com.
[2474.74 → 2475.22] So check that out.
[2475.30 → 2476.60] iFixit.com slash Linus.
[2477.14 → 2479.08] And use offer code Linus.
[2479.92 → 2480.86] So, yeah.
[2481.18 → 2481.80] There you go.
[2482.16 → 2485.04] Or, if you need to just, like, learn stuff, lynda.com.
[2485.04 → 2487.04] What I've learned there is certain camera things.
[2487.12 → 2491.44] I know you probably wouldn't know that because I haven't filmed anything in a super long time.
[2492.50 → 2493.40] I think about it a lot.
[2493.60 → 2493.98] I do.
[2494.40 → 2495.40] Refer to it sometimes.
[2495.54 → 2495.74] Yeah.
[2495.96 → 2502.88] And, like, learning camera stuff and whatnot helped me direct those two episodes that I was talking about Brandon shooting earlier,
[2503.02 → 2507.22] which was the Valve VR performance test and Kick farted.
[2507.34 → 2508.44] I directed both of those.
[2508.56 → 2508.70] Yeah.
[2508.70 → 2510.76] So that came from stuff that I learned from lynda.com.
[2510.76 → 2512.98] Anyway, it's used by millions of people around the world.
[2513.10 → 2522.26] There's more than 3,000 courses available in topics like web development, photography, visual design, business, software like Excel, WordPress, and Photoshop.
[2522.88 → 2525.04] All courses are taught by industry experts.
[2525.32 → 2528.92] The dude that I learned from my photography and videography stuff is super cool.
[2528.92 → 2533.68] You can get a 10-day free trial, which gives you access to every course on lynda.com.
[2534.22 → 2537.48] And you can use lynda.com on, like, basically any device.
[2537.64 → 2539.06] Plan started at only $25 a month.
[2539.32 → 2543.26] Head over to lynda.com slash WAN show and claim your 10-day free trial and start learning today.
[2543.38 → 2543.86] And we're done.
[2545.08 → 2545.32] Cool.
[2545.32 → 2545.58] There you go.
[2546.32 → 2547.12] Flew through those.
[2547.90 → 2549.24] Yeah, but it's cool when you have cool sponsors.
[2550.52 → 2551.98] I genuinely like all of our sponsors.
[2551.98 → 2553.94] We've kicked off the ones that we didn't like.
[2554.24 → 2554.36] Yeah.
[2554.96 → 2555.70] Like legitimately.
[2556.58 → 2559.04] Someone, we had a bunch of complaints about a specific one.
[2559.52 → 2562.48] So I, I'm trying to be vague.
[2562.72 → 2565.96] I decided to try to use it for, like, a while.
[2566.62 → 2572.36] And a quarter of the way into my trying to use it for a while, I was like, this is terrible.
[2573.40 → 2574.20] So we.
[2574.34 → 2575.32] That's good on you guys, though.
[2575.40 → 2576.80] I really appreciate that about you guys.
[2576.88 → 2578.22] We've done that twice, I think.
[2578.36 → 2578.60] Yeah.
[2579.10 → 2580.64] Maybe, maybe, maybe twice.
[2580.64 → 2580.72] Nice.
[2581.52 → 2585.74] So in other news, Oculus Rift pre-orders start shipping out to customers.
[2586.36 → 2590.30] Basically, this is the title.
[2590.40 → 2590.84] Give me a second.
[2591.18 → 2593.92] Oculus Rift pre-orders start shipping out of customers.
[2594.14 → 2594.62] Out of customers.
[2594.78 → 2595.62] They're out of customers.
[2596.02 → 2596.96] There's no more customers.
[2597.08 → 2597.62] So it's like the alien thing?
[2597.72 → 2598.56] Am I dating myself a little bit?
[2598.56 → 2598.84] Yeah.
[2599.08 → 2599.64] I'll be my time.
[2600.16 → 2603.90] A person is delivered to your door and the Oculus Rift erupts out of their stomach.
[2604.18 → 2605.36] That's, that's how that happens.
[2605.38 → 2607.50] Yeah, you have to finish them to be humane.
[2607.78 → 2608.10] Yes.
[2608.10 → 2612.14] And then you have to use it and then consume it, and then you are shipped.
[2612.80 → 2613.02] Wow.
[2613.02 → 2614.06] Because you were one of the customers.
[2614.60 → 2617.84] See, I read that the Domino's thing will come and pick up what's left.
[2618.06 → 2619.34] I guess that was just a rumour.
[2619.54 → 2620.10] Oh my God.
[2620.14 → 2621.40] Had a little scoop on the front.
[2621.58 → 2622.20] Whoop, whoop.
[2622.68 → 2623.60] The body scoop.
[2623.74 → 2625.70] Everyone gets turned into a soil and green afterwards.
[2625.96 → 2626.08] Yeah.
[2626.44 → 2626.82] Wow.
[2626.98 → 2627.88] Ancient references.
[2627.88 → 2632.30] Anyway, CEO Brendan ARB, ARB, ARB, I think it's ARB.
[2632.50 → 2632.70] Wow.
[2632.78 → 2633.96] I'm going to get murdered for that.
[2634.50 → 2636.00] Tweeted that it has shipped.
[2636.38 → 2638.88] Deliveries begin Friday, March 28th.
[2639.72 → 2642.10] So not getting mine then.
[2642.36 → 2645.76] Anyway, if you pre-order now, you won't be able to get one until July.
[2645.76 → 2651.34] If anyone remembers a tweet that I sent out around CES, I was frustrated because it's
[2651.34 → 2657.12] been basically impossible for us to get any amount of media contact information from Oculus
[2657.12 → 2658.04] at all.
[2658.14 → 2663.06] And every single show that we've gone to, we've had to basically fight our way into a meeting
[2663.06 → 2663.76] with anyone.
[2663.76 → 2668.88] I even have an interview with Palmer because I met him in the hallway and was like, yo
[2668.88 → 2670.08] dude, can we have a meeting?
[2670.46 → 2674.06] And he knew who we were, but we still couldn't get media contact information.
[2674.22 → 2678.06] So I tweeted about it, and he was like, hey man, I got you.
[2678.14 → 2678.96] Let's figure this out.
[2679.06 → 2681.26] And then immediately disappeared off the face of the planet.
[2681.38 → 2682.04] He followed me.
[2682.36 → 2684.78] We DM'd like once or twice and then he was just gone.
[2685.16 → 2690.66] He sent me another tweet DM thing today being like, whoa, that took a while.
[2691.26 → 2692.38] Anyway, let's figure this out.
[2692.38 → 2696.18] So hopefully we can get a rush on our Oculus rifts because I think ours were going to be
[2696.18 → 2697.34] delayed by like a few weeks.
[2697.44 → 2701.08] So we're trying to get them rushed so we can get a review out of the actual consumer version.
[2701.24 → 2702.00] It'd be awesome if that could happen.
[2702.40 → 2703.72] I really want to play it.
[2705.68 → 2707.54] You've been on this train since the very beginning.
[2707.66 → 2708.34] I can vouch for it.
[2708.38 → 2710.92] You've been very excited about this whole project from the very start.
[2711.10 → 2715.12] I really, really, really, really, the whole time I was doing it, I was thinking about you
[2715.12 → 2715.74] a hundred percent.
[2716.02 → 2719.10] I want you to try the bullet train demo with the touch controllers.
[2719.64 → 2721.26] Is it because I'm not totally sold?
[2721.26 → 2722.86] What's the drive?
[2722.94 → 2724.26] No, it's because, okay.
[2724.42 → 2728.90] So the bullet train demo with the touch controllers, you stand in one location.
[2729.04 → 2731.34] I'm not going to show right now because I won't fit into the camera properly.
[2731.62 → 2733.38] But you stand in one, pretend I'm standing.
[2733.68 → 2734.70] I'm standing in one location.
[2735.16 → 2738.18] There's little blue kind of orb things on the ground.
[2738.48 → 2742.08] And if you point at one with your controller and press a certain button, you teleport there.
[2742.08 → 2745.04] And then it's a stand and fight game that's a shooter.
[2745.04 → 2749.58] So basically, wherever you teleport, there's probably some form of gun.
[2750.10 → 2753.10] And you can pick it up with your other controller, shoot.
[2753.32 → 2756.84] And if it's an AK, if you shoot it with one hand, it's going to be like...
[2756.84 → 2758.56] And the bullets are going to go everywhere.
[2758.68 → 2761.00] So you have to pull your other hand up and actually hold it properly.
[2761.76 → 2763.00] Shotguns, you can take one shot.
[2763.12 → 2764.60] And then if you don't pump it, you can't shoot again.
[2764.66 → 2766.02] So you have to actually pump it.
[2766.02 → 2770.26] Or if stuff just gets crazy, you can slow down time.
[2770.80 → 2773.08] Drop both your weapons or like Huck a weapon at someone.
[2773.64 → 2775.48] And grab the bullets out of the air.
[2775.82 → 2777.58] Turn them around and then throw them back.
[2778.12 → 2781.60] And then go back in bullet time and like actually kill people.
[2782.12 → 2784.96] So it's like really fun to play because you're teleporting all the way to play.
[2785.06 → 2786.38] Slowing down time, grabbing things.
[2786.44 → 2788.54] Like it's very physically interactive.
[2788.96 → 2792.92] Which is a thing that I think a lot of VR games are missing right now.
[2793.04 → 2793.68] Yes, definitely.
[2793.68 → 2797.34] My two favourite demos, my most favourite demo used to be EVE Valkyrie.
[2797.52 → 2798.22] It's not anymore.
[2798.36 → 2800.78] My two favourite demos now are Bullet Train.
[2801.60 → 2805.06] And I don't know if they have an official name for it yet.
[2805.12 → 2806.64] Or if they're ever actually going to release it.
[2806.70 → 2809.08] But it's essentially the Iron game.
[2809.70 → 2811.28] And CCP made it.
[2811.48 → 2813.48] So it's the Iron game where you throw discs at each other.
[2813.62 → 2813.88] Really?
[2814.24 → 2814.48] Yeah.
[2814.64 → 2816.94] CCP, I just lit up.
[2816.94 → 2817.18] Sorry.
[2817.30 → 2817.66] No, I know.
[2817.70 → 2819.62] I don't even play because it's not my type of game.
[2819.68 → 2820.66] But they're an incredible company.
[2820.90 → 2822.08] EVE is an incredible game.
[2822.10 → 2822.74] Now I'm excited.
[2822.74 → 2826.56] Do you know the Iron game where you throw discs at each other, and you're standing on the platforms?
[2826.64 → 2826.80] Yes.
[2826.88 → 2827.64] They made that.
[2828.32 → 2831.68] And you have to actually jump and dodge and block.
[2832.10 → 2833.24] And the blocking works.
[2833.44 → 2834.20] And you block.
[2834.36 → 2838.38] And if you're swinging around this way, and it hits, it'll bounce off in that direction.
[2838.90 → 2841.60] Or if it's coming this way, and you hit that way, it'll bounce off in that direction.
[2841.60 → 2843.58] However, the physics are pretty good.
[2844.04 → 2846.32] If it's coming behind you, you can get hit in the back.
[2846.54 → 2848.86] Because there's room behind you, and it can bounce off the walls.
[2849.38 → 2850.80] And you have to throw it.
[2851.16 → 2851.76] Oh, man.
[2851.82 → 2852.70] I played against Colton.
[2853.04 → 2855.92] And it was slightly frustrating because he's super non-athletic.
[2856.34 → 2857.98] So I just racked him.
[2857.98 → 2861.94] I think it was almost 30 to 2.
[2862.58 → 2866.00] And the only reason why I got hit those times was because I didn't fully know how the game worked yet.
[2866.34 → 2868.20] Like, just completely destroyed him.
[2868.60 → 2872.32] But it was really cool doing something more physically active in VR.
[2872.90 → 2873.62] That's really cool.
[2873.88 → 2876.24] I'm actually, I thought about bringing this and I didn't.
[2876.46 → 2878.38] I'm going to try and find it.
[2878.84 → 2881.72] But, and this is going to be super bad because I'm not in the industry.
[2882.52 → 2884.64] Basically, the treadmill that you move around on for VR.
[2884.80 → 2885.04] Yes.
[2885.14 → 2886.44] One of them was just launched on Kickstarter.
[2886.60 → 2889.62] It just raised a whole bucket of money in the first 24 hours.
[2889.74 → 2891.14] I'm going to try and look for the article.
[2891.32 → 2891.50] Okay.
[2891.54 → 2892.28] That made me think of it.
[2892.28 → 2896.68] But I think that's what I'm excited about with the whole VR thing.
[2896.78 → 2899.36] Right now, I'm not a hater.
[2899.70 → 2901.68] But just strapping it on and doing a roller coaster.
[2901.68 → 2902.44] Not really my thing.
[2902.50 → 2903.04] I'm not really excited.
[2903.18 → 2903.28] No.
[2903.52 → 2906.62] I, and I know I like showed our whole family that and stuff.
[2906.86 → 2910.18] But it's totally cool for other people to be excited about.
[2910.28 → 2910.98] And it's the start.
[2911.12 → 2913.96] It's the building blocks of what I'm going to be excited for.
[2914.12 → 2914.46] Exactly.
[2914.62 → 2919.42] That's, I didn't actually really care about the fact that that was going on.
[2919.50 → 2922.26] I cared about the like, wow, wait for all the other things.
[2922.30 → 2923.54] This is, this is where we're going.
[2923.68 → 2923.78] Yeah.
[2924.02 → 2926.54] And one thing that's going to help with that a ton is you're probably going to like the
[2926.54 → 2927.28] Five a lot more.
[2927.70 → 2928.02] Yes.
[2928.26 → 2929.62] Because the Five is room scale.
[2929.82 → 2930.06] Right.
[2930.06 → 2931.26] And that means you can move around.
[2931.26 → 2932.06] And it's like way better.
[2932.16 → 2932.52] Absolutely.
[2932.76 → 2932.92] Absolutely.
[2934.06 → 2934.42] Wow.
[2934.58 → 2935.20] Tilt Brush.
[2935.42 → 2936.50] The Google art game.
[2936.54 → 2937.12] Have you seen that?
[2940.18 → 2941.08] I think so.
[2941.08 → 2941.22] Super cool.
[2941.32 → 2943.42] I'm excited for like, I think Nikita will really like it.
[2943.44 → 2947.12] Is that the one Disney was showing a little, one of the artists from Disney was doing it?
[2947.40 → 2947.80] Probably.
[2947.96 → 2948.92] I think I watched it.
[2949.02 → 2949.60] It's from Google.
[2949.60 → 2952.20] I wouldn't be surprised at all if one of the artists from Disney was in there.
[2952.20 → 2957.26] But it's like a you use your controllers essentially as paint brushes.
[2957.76 → 2957.94] Yeah.
[2958.02 → 2958.74] And it's 3D.
[2958.80 → 2960.66] So you can move around whatever you're painting.
[2960.84 → 2961.08] Yes.
[2961.08 → 2962.02] That's got to be the same thing.
[2962.02 → 2962.72] And you can basically paint out sculptures.
[2962.86 → 2963.38] Really cool.
[2963.38 → 2963.82] Wow.
[2963.94 → 2967.74] I made this scene where like I put grass all over the floor.
[2968.12 → 2973.56] Then I made like a tree and a little fire that actually had fire and smoke come out of
[2973.56 → 2973.66] it.
[2973.74 → 2974.98] And then I made it like snowing.
[2975.40 → 2977.50] And I just kind of sat down and was like, I like this.
[2978.56 → 2978.84] Nice.
[2978.84 → 2979.76] That's really cool.
[2979.98 → 2980.14] Yeah.
[2980.14 → 2983.36] I had an absolute ton of fun when I wasn't expecting to.
[2983.42 → 2985.50] I was at a family dinner at our uncle's place.
[2986.58 → 2988.02] And this was a few years ago.
[2988.40 → 2989.28] PlayStation 3.
[2989.40 → 2990.82] It had a game built into it.
[2990.88 → 2993.14] We had both controllers, and it was a sword and shield fighting game.
[2993.30 → 2995.24] And I had a ton of fun.
[2995.38 → 2995.58] Yeah.
[2995.58 → 2999.98] Like I had way too much fun playing this game because it was incredible how much it mattered
[2999.98 → 3001.68] about like you couldn't even trick it.
[3001.94 → 3004.60] Like you couldn't just move your wrist really quick and try to get some big hits.
[3004.96 → 3005.06] Yeah.
[3005.24 → 3008.38] You know where the Wii games where you can kind of exploit certain issues with the controller.
[3008.38 → 3012.98] It was really incredible just moving, blocking and using your sword, and you could move your
[3012.98 → 3013.40] person.
[3013.66 → 3015.22] And it was a ton of fun.
[3015.34 → 3017.84] So I think VR is going to be really incredible.
[3018.10 → 3023.50] And it's really going to move gaming from physically inactive activity to something that could be
[3023.50 → 3024.28] very active.
[3024.56 → 3025.20] That's one thing.
[3025.28 → 3032.02] Like yesterday, I was tweeting out asking if there's any novice men's lacrosse teams.
[3032.24 → 3032.72] I saw that.
[3032.76 → 3033.80] You know what got me excited about that?
[3033.92 → 3035.72] Growing up, football and hockey, right?
[3035.82 → 3037.00] Playing football and hockey all the time.
[3037.04 → 3038.18] You did a very similar thing.
[3038.18 → 3038.48] Yeah.
[3038.66 → 3039.76] Lacrosse was the one thing.
[3039.84 → 3041.28] And I did try and we called.
[3041.40 → 3042.44] I wanted to fit in lacrosse.
[3042.58 → 3044.16] I would have had to quit hockey and I couldn't do it.
[3044.28 → 3044.46] Yeah.
[3044.56 → 3045.42] But sorry.
[3045.54 → 3045.66] Yeah.
[3045.66 → 3046.94] I saw that tweet today, actually.
[3047.02 → 3047.52] I was a little behind.
[3047.80 → 3049.68] But I was like, yeah, that's totally.
[3049.80 → 3050.24] Is there one?
[3050.30 → 3050.90] That's pretty cool.
[3051.00 → 3051.86] I don't think so.
[3051.98 → 3052.54] No, there isn't.
[3052.64 → 3053.22] It falls apart.
[3053.34 → 3056.70] There's no, like, I think there might be one rugby team.
[3056.78 → 3061.88] And other than that, there's no full contact sports for adults where we live.
[3061.88 → 3066.20] And I'm like, if you're a grown dude, how do you hit someone?
[3066.84 → 3067.24] Legally.
[3067.66 → 3068.02] Legally.
[3069.26 → 3071.96] My ice hockey league, I played at the very low levels.
[3072.22 → 3074.92] And you watch some of the games, there's a little bit of hitting, but not really not much.
[3075.18 → 3079.96] When you go to the higher skill levels, basically every skill level, the rules are technically the same.
[3080.22 → 3080.86] Every skill level.
[3080.86 → 3083.12] If you watch the A guys play, I was playing E.
[3083.38 → 3086.64] If you watch the A guys play, that's a much more physical game.
[3086.70 → 3088.28] They let a lot more go.
[3088.72 → 3090.06] The rules are technically the same.
[3090.12 → 3090.88] It's technically the same league.
[3090.96 → 3094.42] But every division you go up, because I actually jumped up a game to play for another team.
[3094.48 → 3096.14] And I could totally tell there's more physicality.
[3096.46 → 3097.50] That's the only thing I could tell you.
[3097.54 → 3100.12] I know Washington State has men's pro.
[3100.52 → 3102.08] Fencing and karate and stuff.
[3102.30 → 3104.28] Like, not the same.
[3104.50 → 3105.54] You're doing a bit of jiu-jitsu.
[3105.94 → 3106.20] Yeah.
[3106.38 → 3107.48] It's still not the same.
[3107.60 → 3108.12] It's not the same.
[3108.12 → 3108.30] Yeah.
[3108.30 → 3115.62] Hitting someone in lacrosse or football or rugby, and I know there is actually a local
[3115.62 → 3120.02] team for rugby, but hitting someone in lacrosse or football or rugby is very different from
[3120.02 → 3123.34] fighting someone in karate or jiu-jitsu or something like that.
[3123.38 → 3124.20] It's super different.
[3124.92 → 3125.62] It's more like...
[3127.30 → 3129.90] Yeah.
[3130.16 → 3130.64] I don't know.
[3130.84 → 3131.18] Collision.
[3131.18 → 3131.54] I like team.
[3131.74 → 3136.24] It's collision, which is not something you get a little bit in some of those, but not a
[3136.24 → 3136.46] ton.
[3136.46 → 3143.40] And it's team object-oriented stuff where sometimes you do the suicide pass kind of thing.
[3143.50 → 3143.58] Yeah.
[3143.58 → 3144.12] You've heard about that?
[3144.34 → 3146.72] Like, freaking Zach Peters, if you're watching.
[3146.88 → 3148.20] He's the suicide pass me in rugby.
[3148.72 → 3152.64] So he'd be almost going to get hit, and there's someone on me just in case he passes to me,
[3152.64 → 3155.50] and he'd be like, ha-ha, get wrecked.
[3155.92 → 3157.08] And I would just take the hit.
[3157.24 → 3158.78] But there are other things...
[3158.78 → 3160.60] You know, a floater right in the middle.
[3160.80 → 3160.96] Yeah.
[3161.20 → 3161.90] Linebackers are just like...
[3161.90 → 3162.60] Good luck!
[3162.80 → 3163.26] Let's go.
[3163.46 → 3164.08] Dinner time.
[3165.12 → 3169.94] But, like, taking one for the team by, like, physically hitting someone or allowing yourself
[3169.94 → 3173.36] to get hit or something like that is a very different mentality than, like, fighting someone
[3173.36 → 3177.32] one-on-one in an orchestrated sparring match.
[3178.32 → 3178.56] Like...
[3178.56 → 3179.76] And I'm a big team sport guy.
[3180.10 → 3180.46] Me too.
[3180.46 → 3183.90] You know, like, I've been getting up so early for work and going to bed so early.
[3184.00 → 3185.08] Like, today I woke up early.
[3185.18 → 3185.74] I went online.
[3185.78 → 3186.80] I was like, I'm going to play some games.
[3187.58 → 3191.92] No one was on because it was 8.30 in the morning, which is totally normal, and I get
[3191.92 → 3192.20] that.
[3192.48 → 3194.02] But my whole mood just kind of...
[3194.02 → 3194.42] Oh, well.
[3194.42 → 3196.00] You know, and I did some stuff by myself.
[3196.12 → 3197.30] I farmed a little bit of gold.
[3197.80 → 3199.10] And, you know, I did some other things.
[3199.26 → 3200.34] But the whole team...
[3200.34 → 3201.64] And I was talking about Rocket League earlier.
[3202.18 → 3204.14] I can't tell you the last time I played Rocket League by myself.
[3204.54 → 3208.14] But when you get some guys in there, you get a group together, and, you know, it's
[3208.14 → 3208.72] really fun.
[3208.78 → 3209.68] So the whole team atmosphere.
[3209.68 → 3215.32] I'm like, my favourite thing at PAX for the last, like, few years probably was our group
[3215.32 → 3218.12] of people just jamming out playing Rocket League together because everyone gets hyped
[3218.12 → 3219.28] up, and it gets...
[3219.28 → 3219.94] It's a lot of fun.
[3220.20 → 3222.20] And VR could really play into that.
[3222.32 → 3223.74] You know, they're going to have...
[3223.74 → 3226.78] Obviously, it's going to be a singular thing to start, but we're talking about how VR is
[3226.78 → 3227.58] going to get better and better.
[3227.94 → 3233.50] What happens until now it's us two in that bullet time game jumping around, shooting together,
[3233.78 → 3234.62] working together.
[3234.98 → 3236.94] You know, I go behind an object, and I find two guns.
[3237.00 → 3238.18] You go behind an object, you find none.
[3238.18 → 3238.74] Sly board across the floor.
[3238.78 → 3239.22] You know what I mean?
[3239.22 → 3239.32] Yeah.
[3239.32 → 3240.38] Just different things like that.
[3240.74 → 3245.44] You know, co-op, I remember, especially growing up, the whole idea of co-op was really a big
[3245.44 → 3247.42] deal and really pushed gaming forward.
[3247.66 → 3250.26] And then, obviously, multiplayer, and then really playing online.
[3250.26 → 3251.48] I'm very excited for...
[3251.48 → 3258.44] I have a computer idea coming up that a few people know about, but not that many, so I'm
[3258.44 → 3259.44] not going to leak it here.
[3259.44 → 3264.06] The guys from my stream, the guys from my stream, the after party for this, some of you guys
[3264.06 → 3265.66] might know about it, but I'm not going to talk about it right now.
[3265.66 → 3270.88] But it incorporates the idea of multiple people in VR together.
[3270.88 → 3275.10] And I'm excited for that, too, because I feel like it can bring back the...
[3275.10 → 3280.64] Maybe not actual hitting, like I can't hit someone, but it'll bring back the team-based
[3280.64 → 3286.28] mentality with physical aspects in it going towards some type of game with a collective
[3286.28 → 3287.92] goal and all this kind of things.
[3287.92 → 3292.42] One of my favourite things that we've done was paintball forever ago.
[3292.54 → 3292.74] Yep.
[3292.86 → 3293.88] When we were...
[3293.88 → 3297.54] One person would move up, and then the person who moved up would call shots for the person
[3297.54 → 3299.12] in the back, and then...
[3299.12 → 3299.78] Yep, exactly.
[3299.78 → 3300.86] Like, that was super cool.
[3301.00 → 3302.66] If you can do stuff like that in video games.
[3303.00 → 3308.08] And something that would be cool is taking away stuff like Skype and Vent and TeamSpeak for
[3308.08 → 3309.38] competitive shooters and whatnot.
[3310.04 → 3311.88] And if you have, like...
[3311.88 → 3316.14] Because it's cool and all, but being able to have it so you have to, like, shout out to
[3316.14 → 3316.54] your buddy.
[3316.78 → 3317.56] Yeah, absolutely.
[3318.36 → 3321.62] That's awesome, because you have to kind of give away your position to communicate in
[3321.62 → 3323.26] that situation, and that's kind of cool.
[3323.28 → 3324.82] And if you're dead, you shouldn't be able to communicate at all.
[3324.96 → 3325.20] Yeah.
[3325.38 → 3325.68] You know?
[3326.54 → 3327.06] I don't know.
[3327.12 → 3327.94] Just little things like that.
[3327.96 → 3328.36] That'd be awesome.
[3328.62 → 3329.34] It's just going to be fun.
[3329.46 → 3330.56] We should probably move on from VR.
[3330.66 → 3332.24] I could literally talk about VR forever.
[3333.02 → 3336.04] Well, you're saying we don't have enough, and I've been thinking more and more that we're
[3336.04 → 3336.68] just going to...
[3336.68 → 3337.02] It's true.
[3337.04 → 3337.52] We'll have enough.
[3337.74 → 3338.04] Yes.
[3338.04 → 3338.74] It'll be fine.
[3338.88 → 3339.98] But there's some rapid fire stuff.
[3340.66 → 3340.88] Yep.
[3340.98 → 3342.36] I'm still moving on rapid fire.
[3342.54 → 3345.44] So, Pebble fires 25% of its staff.
[3345.74 → 3346.02] Boom.
[3346.02 → 3348.44] That's really depressing.
[3348.44 → 3352.54] Just for the pure fact that now there are a bunch of guys looking for jobs.
[3352.58 → 3353.92] I'm sure Pebble looks great on your resume.
[3353.92 → 3356.24] I've been there.
[3356.42 → 3357.18] You've been there.
[3357.18 → 3361.24] I know it might be hard for you to even remember now, but there's always a time in a lot of
[3361.24 → 3363.28] people's lives where you're looking for that job, and it sucks.
[3363.48 → 3364.24] It really sucks.
[3364.56 → 3368.20] And to lose your job sucks, even if it's in the best way possible, as in the company just
[3368.20 → 3369.56] goes, we're really sorry.
[3369.64 → 3373.56] We like you a lot, and we'll give you the best reference, and here's a letter, and all
[3373.56 → 3374.08] that kind of stuff.
[3374.12 → 3376.38] And we'll try to do what we can to help you, which I'm not even sure how much.
[3376.44 → 3378.48] I haven't actually read up about it, how much they are helping.
[3378.48 → 3383.58] I'm sure they're doing their fair share, but just a really unfortunate thing for a lot
[3383.58 → 3385.44] of different people who are working there.
[3386.28 → 3386.52] Yeah.
[3386.74 → 3392.16] They laid off 40 employees, which is that 25% number.
[3392.16 → 3402.50] The CEO, Eric, has said that money is pretty tight these days, and he's referring to difficulties
[3402.50 → 3407.78] raising money in Silicon Valley, which kind of makes sense because of the quote that is
[3407.78 → 3408.76] actually on the screen.
[3408.90 → 3411.30] Pebble is now in a very crowded market.
[3411.50 → 3415.50] There are so many companies making smartwatches.
[3415.58 → 3416.18] Oh, my God.
[3416.22 → 3416.68] And you know what?
[3416.74 → 3419.04] I'm not seeing them a lot on the day to day.
[3419.12 → 3421.34] I see them when I come to this office, obviously.
[3421.34 → 3423.20] This is a tech-focused area.
[3423.36 → 3428.56] I saw a handful of the watches when they first came out, or the Apple Watch.
[3428.64 → 3428.86] Sorry.
[3429.48 → 3430.04] Couldn't care.
[3431.22 → 3433.54] You know, I saw kind of a surge of them immediately.
[3433.92 → 3439.30] I'm very much out and about Vancouver and Burnaby with my job, but I don't see a lot of
[3439.30 → 3439.92] them on the day to day.
[3439.98 → 3447.98] You still see the more simple fashion accessory or the more Iron Man, G-Shock style of functionality.
[3447.98 → 3450.48] And I'm not really seeing this.
[3451.02 → 3452.20] It's not really taking over.
[3452.64 → 3454.14] Like, I think a lot of people thought it would.
[3454.28 → 3460.62] It helps a little bit to get out of Langley and Vancouver.
[3461.16 → 3461.26] Yeah.
[3461.38 → 3466.78] Vancouver, like, however much of a tech hub it is, because it actually is, doesn't really
[3466.78 → 3468.26] seem to adopt things super quickly.
[3468.66 → 3469.48] I don't know why.
[3469.48 → 3470.48] I don't...
[3470.48 → 3470.94] I don't...
[3470.94 → 3473.78] You do travel all over, so you would have a good view on this.
[3474.16 → 3474.28] Yeah.
[3474.42 → 3475.92] It feels very hotspot-y.
[3476.50 → 3476.74] Okay.
[3476.74 → 3480.76] Like, Switzerland, I don't think I literally saw a single person with a smartwatch the
[3480.76 → 3481.88] entire time I was there.
[3482.04 → 3484.92] And I was going to techie kind of places and stuff.
[3485.24 → 3485.42] Yeah.
[3485.50 → 3487.20] So, there's that.
[3488.02 → 3489.64] But, like, in San Fran.
[3490.40 → 3490.76] Oh, yeah.
[3490.82 → 3493.48] Like, actually, like, a pretty significant amount of people have there.
[3493.48 → 3493.78] Interesting.
[3493.78 → 3495.96] Not, like, a majority.
[3496.28 → 3497.28] Definitely not a majority.
[3497.46 → 3499.84] But, like, it's noticeable, and you kind of see it around.
[3499.90 → 3501.18] See, that's what I was referring to with here.
[3501.32 → 3501.54] Yeah.
[3501.80 → 3502.46] So, it is.
[3502.58 → 3503.10] So, it's spot.
[3503.14 → 3503.34] Okay.
[3503.58 → 3506.60] But, San Fran, you kind of expect that?
[3507.38 → 3508.42] So, I don't know.
[3508.88 → 3509.20] Yeah.
[3509.50 → 3513.42] I don't think it's kicking off quite as hard as people thought, because I don't think it's
[3513.42 → 3515.50] that difficult to pull your phone out of your pocket.
[3516.42 → 3518.40] Now, and I was saying it's really unfortunate for a lot of people.
[3518.40 → 3520.40] 25% is only 40% of their employees.
[3521.28 → 3523.54] So, really, that is, you know, that's a decent chunk.
[3523.78 → 3526.48] You know, you're looking at a high school classroom and a half, or however you want
[3526.48 → 3527.50] to mentally picture it.
[3527.98 → 3530.34] It's also not devastating.
[3530.58 → 3533.76] It's not, you know, one of these massive, you know, corporations.
[3533.76 → 3536.54] It's devastating on an individualized scale.
[3536.74 → 3541.84] It's not devastating on, like, oh, my God, half of a massive company just got laid off.
[3541.84 → 3542.38] Because that happens.
[3542.48 → 3543.64] Thousands of positions floating.
[3543.74 → 3543.76] Exactly.
[3543.76 → 3544.66] Thousands of people.
[3544.98 → 3548.48] You know, and when it's fewer employees, you're going to hope that they're going to get a little
[3548.48 → 3552.52] more help, a little more special attention than, you know, those mass layoffs that you see.
[3552.52 → 3557.00] Yeah, and one thing that I worry about, and, like, it's going to suck for these guys, but
[3557.00 → 3561.72] it sucks even more when it's in the gratuitous amounts of numbers, is, like, one of my buddies,
[3562.04 → 3567.12] Rule, was recently working at a restaurant that closed.
[3567.12 → 3574.96] So all the people that were working at that restaurant were all friends and stuff, but no one's really able to help each other properly.
[3574.96 → 3580.82] Because now you have all of these people who are looking for similar work because of their experience.
[3581.14 → 3581.80] They're now competitors.
[3582.28 → 3583.40] They're all competitors.
[3583.68 → 3583.92] Don't want to.
[3583.92 → 3585.94] And, like, that sucks.
[3586.04 → 3589.68] So even 40 of them, that's got to suck.
[3589.80 → 3599.94] Because now there's 40 people who have immediate, probably fairly lengthy, fairly interesting experience at a company selling watches that are probably going to try to find this.
[3599.94 → 3603.54] A fifth of their one-page resume is the exact same as everybody else.
[3603.54 → 3603.90] Yes.
[3604.04 → 3605.38] You know, they got 40 duplicates.
[3605.44 → 3606.22] This is what I did.
[3606.54 → 3608.98] Essentially, obviously, they'll have different facets to their job.
[3609.18 → 3611.56] But, you know, I totally agree.
[3611.70 → 3615.02] Yeah, it's an unfortunate situation when anybody closes down.
[3615.24 → 3617.36] But, you know, maybe they can, VR is picking up.
[3617.40 → 3618.32] Other things are picking up.
[3619.76 → 3622.94] There are ads on the radio all the time about tech jobs in BC.
[3623.18 → 3624.70] So hopefully it's going to be a little bit of a place.
[3624.70 → 3624.92] Yeah, yeah.
[3625.24 → 3625.32] Oh, my God.
[3625.32 → 3626.90] Hi, I'm the blank, blank, blank.
[3627.62 → 3631.22] We're the CEO of Bench, and we've moved back to Vancouver.
[3631.22 → 3633.88] Vancouver from New York because the people here.
[3634.08 → 3635.70] And it's not joining the tech industry.
[3635.70 → 3637.32] It's joining the tech industry.
[3637.34 → 3638.72] The future of the tech industry.
[3638.72 → 3639.52] All industries.
[3639.94 → 3641.26] It's a super weird radio commercial.
[3641.38 → 3642.22] Yeah, very odd.
[3642.32 → 3642.98] Don't worry about it.
[3643.24 → 3653.04] Bench, which is like a clothing company, is hiring, is the spokesperson for a company that hires tech people in Vancouver.
[3653.26 → 3656.38] And they moved away from Vancouver but have now moved back.
[3657.04 → 3660.12] And it's like, it's a very weird radio commercial.
[3660.24 → 3660.82] Don't worry about it.
[3660.82 → 3661.22] Anyway.
[3661.88 → 3667.42] Right on schedule, AMOLED displays are now cheaper to produce than LCDs.
[3667.50 → 3669.22] Now, is the actual dollar number in here?
[3669.30 → 3669.56] Yes.
[3669.68 → 3680.30] So a 5-inch Full HD smartphone display is $14.30 for AMOLED panels and $14.60 for an LCD panel.
[3680.30 → 3682.32] That's awesome.
[3682.32 → 3682.92] It is.
[3682.92 → 3689.12] Because that means that it is now going to be beneficial for people to use AMOLED panels instead of LED panels.
[3689.52 → 3692.18] There's, I don't think, a ton else to say.
[3693.56 → 3693.76] No.
[3694.04 → 3694.84] No, that's good.
[3695.00 → 3702.40] You know, maybe these vehicle manufacturers, excluding Tesla, can start putting better stuff in their vehicles.
[3702.40 → 3706.46] Kind of hater on almost everybody right now.
[3706.62 → 3711.36] And that's kind of funny because Linus is off in New York at like an auto show thing.
[3711.46 → 3712.02] So hopefully.
[3712.44 → 3714.20] Maybe there'll be cool stuff to come out of that show.
[3714.40 → 3714.56] Hopefully.
[3714.56 → 3714.82] You know.
[3716.42 → 3717.46] Ford, I know.
[3717.56 → 3720.16] I've seen some new videos about one of their new vehicles coming out.
[3720.20 → 3724.48] And they made some minor improvements that are still, in my personal opinion, miles away.
[3724.84 → 3725.06] Yeah.
[3725.14 → 3727.96] I've seen some of the I rode in a brand-new Mazda the other day.
[3727.96 → 3735.14] It was kind of nice, but I just didn't really, I felt like they took a tablet, and they were like, uh.
[3735.28 → 3736.56] And they just kind of left it there.
[3736.78 → 3739.44] And like didn't really fully integrate it.
[3739.44 → 3740.18] It just looks awkward.
[3740.28 → 3741.52] Like it doesn't look like it's a part of the vehicle.
[3741.74 → 3741.90] Yeah.
[3741.98 → 3746.00] It looks like it's just kind of like you could take it away with you, and you would want to because it looks weird.
[3746.26 → 3747.76] I don't, like, yeah.
[3747.88 → 3749.50] Not a big fan of what's going on.
[3749.74 → 3754.32] I actually got into a Dodge Ram yesterday at work that had 20 kilometres on it.
[3754.96 → 3756.42] And it had the screen and everything.
[3756.56 → 3757.70] And it's just really not that impressive.
[3757.96 → 3758.56] It's really not.
[3758.80 → 3765.08] You literally, in my opinion, you have to be in a Tesla to be impressed by the multimedia centre that's involved unless you've done a custom fit yourself.
[3765.42 → 3767.96] Your 2009 Acura is pretty darn solid.
[3768.24 → 3771.22] And it totally compares to the 2015s.
[3771.28 → 3772.32] Which is so weird.
[3772.76 → 3779.78] We were going to do a video like a year and a half ago, I think.
[3779.78 → 3789.30] And we were trying to work with a car company to show where it has whatever bracket, because I don't know what brackets cars fit into, because I'm not a super car guy.
[3789.64 → 3791.70] I like car tech, but I would say that anyway.
[3791.70 → 3798.20] Of car, like, how far has it come in the last, since 2009?
[3798.28 → 3799.12] Because I got my car.
[3799.12 → 3803.40] And they contacted us, and they were like, oh yeah, we can send you this one.
[3803.54 → 3804.72] It has these things.
[3804.90 → 3807.80] And it had no additional functionality and a smaller screen.
[3808.12 → 3809.12] I was just like...
[3809.12 → 3812.92] Yeah, they're really not hitting it out of the park with this one.
[3812.92 → 3814.78] I can't understand why, to be honest.
[3815.00 → 3817.08] We're just talking about how cheap it is to produce.
[3818.14 → 3820.20] The tablets are getting better and better every day.
[3820.28 → 3823.50] Why they're not just hooking up with a manufacturer to help them out, I don't understand.
[3823.52 → 3826.22] And that Tesla tablet does have its problems.
[3826.28 → 3828.36] It's not the fastest thing ever, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3828.42 → 3830.70] But it's actually been in that car for a while now.
[3831.24 → 3833.44] Model Ss are not really new anymore.
[3833.44 → 3839.32] Of course, you can buy one new, but the Model S itself is a new design model.
[3839.90 → 3841.88] So, yeah, I don't know.
[3842.94 → 3844.20] Having a workable...
[3844.20 → 3846.44] I'm really excited for...
[3846.44 → 3850.82] I'm excited for conversational AI.
[3851.24 → 3851.46] Yep.
[3851.80 → 3854.12] So, like, the style, you can actually talk to it.
[3854.38 → 3856.44] And when I can converse with my car...
[3856.44 → 3856.80] Okay.
[3857.18 → 3859.88] What was the show we watched a little tiny bit when we were super young?
[3859.98 → 3860.38] Knight Rider.
[3861.18 → 3861.58] Yes!
[3861.58 → 3861.80] Yes!
[3862.20 → 3863.34] I love Knight Rider!
[3863.94 → 3865.08] Oh my god!
[3865.52 → 3867.40] So, yeah, if I can talk with my car, it would be so cool.
[3867.40 → 3869.46] That was an AI that you could converse with, you know?
[3869.58 → 3873.80] Like, I would even legitimately be cool with, like, instead of it being an app, I just, like,
[3873.86 → 3874.66] call my car.
[3874.74 → 3874.92] Yeah.
[3875.08 → 3876.96] With, like, the phone app.
[3877.10 → 3879.28] And I'm just like, hey, you want to, like...
[3879.28 → 3879.80] Come pick me up.
[3879.82 → 3880.32] Come pick me up.
[3880.34 → 3880.58] It's raining.
[3880.80 → 3883.22] The car's just like, you know, I was kind of relaxing.
[3883.72 → 3884.50] I was relaxing.
[3884.84 → 3886.30] But that's fine, I guess.
[3886.36 → 3887.52] Are you going to change my oil?
[3888.54 → 3889.86] Can we do that today?
[3889.86 → 3891.40] But then it's a joke because it's electric.
[3892.20 → 3893.18] Oh, shit.
[3893.68 → 3894.38] That is right.
[3894.60 → 3895.94] Then he's like, haha, I don't have oil.
[3895.98 → 3897.50] And you're like, I'm going to go in and turn your sass meter down.
[3897.50 → 3900.18] Like, you are so funny, but we need to turn that down.
[3901.64 → 3902.52] That would be awesome.
[3902.96 → 3903.28] But yeah.
[3903.40 → 3908.10] Anyway, speaking of things talking to you, that's not a segue that works for this at all.
[3908.34 → 3909.34] It works if you want it to.
[3909.34 → 3909.78] Anyway.
[3910.26 → 3913.60] Facebook is pulling back on its BlackBerry app.
[3913.68 → 3915.38] Come on, bbc.uk.com.
[3915.38 → 3916.34] Oh, apparently.com.
[3916.86 → 3921.52] Facebook drops support for BlackBerry, which is probably completely fine.
[3921.86 → 3924.74] And I'm not even saying that because basically no one uses BlackBerry phones.
[3925.02 → 3927.94] I'm saying that because don't they just work with Android apps?
[3928.58 → 3929.54] Yeah, I thought that was the thing.
[3929.68 → 3931.74] I wouldn't know because I don't know anyone who has a BlackBerry.
[3931.80 → 3932.18] Me neither.
[3932.26 → 3932.50] At all.
[3932.58 → 3932.80] Zero.
[3932.80 → 3933.16] Zero.
[3933.16 → 3933.26] Yeah.
[3934.82 → 3935.22] So.
[3937.92 → 3938.40] Okay.
[3940.18 → 3941.08] I don't know.
[3941.20 → 3943.62] I kind of thought of it is as just like kicking somebody when they're down.
[3944.10 → 3944.50] Maybe.
[3944.84 → 3945.24] A little bit.
[3945.40 → 3950.42] And like the Twitch chat can probably comment on that.
[3950.52 → 3954.62] But I'm pretty sure these days if you're a BlackBerry owner, you just.
[3955.80 → 3958.30] If you are somehow a BlackBerry owner.
[3958.38 → 3959.72] I think there are some government organizations.
[3959.96 → 3962.62] Now that I think about that, I actually know someone who has two phones.
[3962.62 → 3963.56] One of them is a BlackBerry.
[3963.72 → 3963.84] Oh.
[3964.16 → 3966.48] He works for Canadian Border Security.
[3967.04 → 3967.34] Okay.
[3967.76 → 3972.40] And he has a BlackBerry for his government phone just because, as Elon Musk would say,
[3972.46 → 3974.84] government's very, very slow to do things.
[3974.92 → 3977.54] So they're still having, you know, kind of moved on.
[3977.98 → 3979.02] He has problems all the time.
[3979.08 → 3980.50] He can't email properly from it.
[3980.58 → 3984.60] When he tries to email the group of us, it doesn't always go through and all that kind
[3984.60 → 3984.80] of stuff.
[3984.84 → 3985.92] He's got to wait until he gets home.
[3986.62 → 3987.78] Yeah, BlackBerry's.
[3988.02 → 3989.62] BlackBerry scan use Google Play.
[3989.90 → 3990.06] Yes.
[3990.06 → 3990.42] Yeah.
[3990.62 → 3991.38] The Google Play Store.
[3991.38 → 3992.46] Who cares?
[3992.58 → 3996.22] They probably stopped support for it because who cares?
[3996.38 → 3996.84] Here's another thing.
[3996.88 → 4000.24] I know you've got the app back now, but I still don't use the app on my phone.
[4000.34 → 4001.66] I still use my browser.
[4001.92 → 4004.08] I believe Mr. Light, Nick, does that as well.
[4004.18 → 4006.92] I'm not sure if he's switched back to get the messenger because you guys use it a bit
[4006.92 → 4007.52] more than I do.
[4007.64 → 4009.36] But I'm just a typical casual user.
[4009.52 → 4010.36] I don't use the app.
[4010.82 → 4011.94] I just use the browser.
[4012.06 → 4013.46] I used to not use the app.
[4013.50 → 4016.94] And a big part of that was because of how, like, invasive and not okay it is.
[4016.94 → 4017.14] Yeah.
[4017.52 → 4021.78] And then I just realized that I am not allowed privacy in my life anyway.
[4022.52 → 4023.90] So, whatever.
[4024.40 → 4025.02] Yeah, pretty much.
[4025.02 → 4025.42] Yeah.
[4025.64 → 4028.30] Like, I don't know.
[4028.30 → 4035.00] It's gotten to the point where, like, my information is so farmed out that, like, Facebook doesn't
[4035.00 → 4035.30] have it.
[4035.34 → 4036.22] Someone else has got it.
[4036.42 → 4037.88] So, I might as well just not care.
[4038.10 → 4042.16] The only thing I would say on that is, if you're like me, and you're kind of not sure
[4042.16 → 4044.56] about it, the browser functionality is actually fantastic.
[4044.56 → 4044.86] It's fine.
[4045.14 → 4045.34] Yeah.
[4045.42 → 4046.42] It's actually perfect.
[4046.62 → 4049.50] The only thing you're going to miss is notifications pinging your phone.
[4049.92 → 4050.56] You can check it.
[4050.62 → 4051.60] Which is probably fine.
[4051.66 → 4052.72] That's probably fine, too.
[4052.80 → 4053.68] I get by just fine.
[4053.76 → 4055.14] We communicated on Facebook this morning.
[4055.26 → 4055.86] It worked out.
[4056.64 → 4058.26] You know, it's not a huge deal.
[4058.32 → 4059.38] If you're thinking about it, try it out.
[4059.84 → 4060.68] You know, it still works.
[4061.10 → 4061.40] Yeah.
[4061.40 → 4063.16] I did that for a very long time.
[4063.28 → 4068.24] And then one day was just like, you know, I try to do all these things because I suggest
[4068.24 → 4069.52] that people do these things.
[4069.52 → 4074.80] And then I realized that just like in my position, I have no privacy at all anyway.
[4075.90 → 4076.50] And unfortunate.
[4076.78 → 4077.76] Not everything's positive.
[4078.18 → 4078.32] No.
[4078.40 → 4081.14] There has to be some sort of yin-yang going on.
[4081.24 → 4081.36] Yeah.
[4081.86 → 4082.82] It's probably fine.
[4083.24 → 4084.86] At least I'm easy to contact, I guess.
[4086.98 → 4087.90] You say that.
[4088.02 → 4090.90] There's been a family email going around you still haven't responded to.
[4091.08 → 4091.44] Wait, what?
[4091.64 → 4092.58] Oh, that one.
[4092.68 → 4094.10] I don't know how to respond to that yet.
[4094.86 → 4096.00] Because I want to make it.
[4096.38 → 4097.02] Oh, yeah.
[4097.70 → 4098.56] That's not really going to work.
[4098.56 → 4100.38] I thought you answered that properly.
[4100.38 → 4100.88] Did you like that?
[4100.96 → 4101.62] I had your back there.
[4101.74 → 4101.80] Yeah.
[4101.92 → 4105.28] I actually was writing it, and then I went back, and I went working very hard.
[4105.46 → 4105.74] Thank you.
[4105.74 → 4106.64] I put in the very after.
[4107.18 → 4107.98] That's how you know I got you.
[4108.14 → 4109.06] I'm doing like a yeah.
[4109.24 → 4109.60] Anyway.
[4110.96 → 4116.08] So something that's kind of weird actually from Facebook is this.
[4117.04 → 4117.28] So.
[4117.82 → 4118.22] Yeah.
[4118.50 → 4127.10] Facebook's ad platform now guesses your race or as they call it, ethnic affinity based
[4127.10 → 4128.12] on your behaviour.
[4128.56 → 4129.38] I like that terminology.
[4129.38 → 4129.44] I like that terminology.
[4129.82 → 4130.18] So.
[4131.46 → 4135.88] Basically what's happening is, as you can see here, there are two different trailers.
[4136.40 → 4140.82] Straight Out of Compton trailer 2015 and Straight Out of Compton trailer 2 2015.
[4140.82 → 4148.60] And based on what it guesses your ethnic affinity is, it will give you a different version of
[4148.60 → 4149.10] the trailer.
[4150.10 → 4150.94] No joke.
[4151.14 → 4157.64] One trailer portrays the movie as like a violent depiction of gang acts and the other trailer
[4157.64 → 4162.16] depicts it as like a history of the music industry from the underdogs.
[4162.16 → 4162.42] Really?
[4162.90 → 4163.22] Yeah.
[4163.38 → 4163.84] Like, okay.
[4163.84 → 4165.36] I'm going to jump off of this.
[4165.48 → 4166.36] I still haven't seen this movie.
[4166.36 → 4167.14] So I can read the proper notes.
[4167.20 → 4168.54] I haven't either, but I do actually really want to.
[4168.54 → 4171.32] I wonder what my, I'm really interested as to what they're guessing for me.
[4171.36 → 4176.76] Because I do like a lot of hip hop and a lot of different, I was literally watching the
[4176.76 → 4179.74] the best vines from world star hip hop this morning.
[4179.74 → 4185.58] So yes, I do have weird things on my YouTube, but something like this, why would you even
[4185.58 → 4186.28] play with this?
[4186.66 → 4189.18] Why as a big company, why would you even touch this?
[4190.04 → 4190.30] I did.
[4190.46 → 4190.94] So, okay.
[4191.32 → 4193.98] I have no idea, but to jump into it real quick.
[4193.98 → 4194.28] Make one trailer.
[4195.08 → 4200.72] There's apparently three different versions of the marketing campaign for the NWA biopic
[4200.72 → 4201.84] Straight Out of Compton.
[4201.96 → 4202.18] Weird.
[4203.04 → 4208.22] One for white audiences, one for black audiences, and one for Hispanic audiences.
[4208.22 → 4210.26] Trailers are all completely different.
[4210.70 → 4215.72] They didn't, they don't say which one is for which, but one depicts a gangster movie
[4215.72 → 4216.78] emphasizing violence.
[4217.24 → 4221.40] One depicts the movie as a biography talking about their music being protest art.
[4221.60 → 4223.64] And then they don't say what the third one is.
[4224.12 → 4231.66] Facebook describes ethnicity as affinities or a similarity of characteristics.
[4232.84 → 4234.36] I just don't know why they're touching it.
[4234.42 → 4235.08] I just don't get it.
[4235.08 → 4240.20] I think they could have just picked way better terminology.
[4240.38 → 4240.64] Oh yeah.
[4241.00 → 4245.30] Because like looking at using their, their picture stuff, they could figure out your ethnicity
[4245.30 → 4251.00] probably pretty easily, but they're talking about similarities of characteristics.
[4251.00 → 4254.26] So why not just call it that?
[4254.42 → 4255.72] It's called racism.
[4255.72 → 4258.34] Are you an angry, aggressive person?
[4259.04 → 4263.26] Then maybe you want to see the one that depicts it as a gangster movie, which emphasizes violence.
[4263.42 → 4265.48] Are you not an angry, aggressive person?
[4265.52 → 4266.62] What if they just said characteristics?
[4267.38 → 4268.92] Instead of anything about ethnicity.
[4268.92 → 4269.40] That's what I mean.
[4269.58 → 4269.80] Yeah.
[4269.98 → 4270.18] Yeah.
[4270.54 → 4275.30] Are you, are you someone who likes, who likes protests and like standing up for what you
[4275.30 → 4277.08] believe in, but you're not necessarily a violent person.
[4277.14 → 4277.46] There you go.
[4277.46 → 4282.20] Maybe portray that one or whatever the third one is like, let's call it characteristics.
[4282.20 → 4284.48] Why are you calling it ethnic affinity?
[4284.60 → 4285.88] Just a really terrible manoeuvre.
[4286.04 → 4287.14] That's just bad play.
[4287.20 → 4288.50] Makes you sound like a dick.
[4288.74 → 4289.52] Like, I don't know.
[4289.72 → 4290.36] Glad you said it.
[4290.44 → 4291.46] I was wondering if we could say it.
[4291.46 → 4292.26] I wasn't sure.
[4292.38 → 4292.94] I don't know.
[4293.18 → 4293.38] Whatever.
[4293.38 → 4294.74] Turn around the lines on that one.
[4294.98 → 4295.14] Yeah.
[4295.14 → 4297.56] Just, just a bad move in every direction.
[4297.72 → 4299.52] That's just, that play fell apart.
[4299.74 → 4301.30] They picked it up around the wrong direction.
[4301.44 → 4302.06] I have no idea.
[4302.26 → 4302.52] Yeah.
[4302.96 → 4307.92] Facebook has done some really weird stuff with their like social science team or whatever
[4307.92 → 4308.46] they call it.
[4308.48 → 4311.66] I don't remember what they call it, but they, they like play experiments on the people all
[4311.66 → 4312.08] the time.
[4312.20 → 4312.42] Yeah.
[4312.82 → 4314.96] And I wonder if this is just one of them.
[4315.68 → 4316.58] To be completely honest.
[4316.94 → 4320.80] Facebook doesn't seem to be losing any steam, but I'm kind of excited about the next one.
[4320.80 → 4325.48] And I'm kind of excited for Facebook to become the old or the current MySpace, let's
[4325.48 → 4325.80] call it.
[4325.90 → 4325.94] Yeah.
[4325.94 → 4326.30] Yeah.
[4326.30 → 4326.38] Yeah.
[4326.38 → 4331.08] One interesting thing that I read an article about, which I don't have right now, but it
[4331.08 → 4338.14] was talking about how Facebook is, especially now, and it's going to continue to be, especially
[4338.14 → 4344.94] now, becoming this completely unstoppable, literal graveyard of humanity.
[4346.40 → 4349.38] Because people are dying and their Facebook pages stay up.
[4349.50 → 4350.78] As depressing as can be.
[4350.78 → 4354.72] So like the percentage of the user base that is literally dead.
[4354.72 → 4360.34] It's actually a depressing fact for, um, I don't see, I don't always know if we should
[4360.34 → 4365.10] drop names or not, but my SO, my significant other just had a friend pass away.
[4365.18 → 4366.82] That friend's Facebook page is still there.
[4366.92 → 4367.38] You know what I mean?
[4367.38 → 4370.24] Like that's a that's a true to life example that's within the last few months.
[4370.86 → 4374.18] Um, so what you say really hits home and locally as well.
[4374.18 → 4379.78] And I'm sure for people watching this and that's a really, and it's super weird when like someone
[4379.78 → 4384.24] who might really care about that person sentimentally goes back to essentially their gravestone by
[4384.24 → 4385.48] just going to their Facebook page.
[4385.48 → 4389.26] And then you see like someone who's not very well-informed being like, Hey, we should hang
[4389.26 → 4390.14] out on their wall.
[4390.14 → 4392.94] And it's like, yeah, that's, yeah.
[4392.98 → 4393.56] That's sad.
[4393.56 → 4394.56] It's weird.
[4394.56 → 4395.56] It's weird.
[4395.56 → 4396.56] It's weird.
[4396.56 → 4399.96] Anyway, in less sad news, but slightly weird news.
[4400.16 → 4408.00] Um, Sony is maybe possibly considering the potential of a PlayStation 4.5.
[4408.30 → 4408.54] Yeah.
[4409.02 → 4412.48] So this was a Kodak source.
[4412.76 → 4418.56] So who knows if this webpage is going to exist in a certain amount of time or if someone's
[4418.56 → 4420.24] going to like to buy them or something.
[4420.24 → 4426.52] I don't know, but apparently the new version of the PS4 would have increased graphical power,
[4426.82 → 4431.74] uh, being able to play games running at 4k resolution, um, and would probably do a bit
[4431.74 → 4433.86] better with VR and stuff like that.
[4433.86 → 4440.74] So this is from like some source that is super not named and all of this other kind of stuff.
[4441.02 → 4445.02] Apparently there's been whispers about upgrades to the Xbox as well.
[4445.48 → 4448.16] So iterations faster than we expected.
[4448.30 → 4449.46] Wouldn't be super surprised.
[4449.46 → 4453.90] I wonder if it will line up with the Nintendo NO, which is the only console I'm even remotely
[4453.90 → 4454.60] interested in.
[4454.78 → 4455.28] Hey, want an apple?
[4455.30 → 4455.48] Hello.
[4455.72 → 4456.02] Yes.
[4457.74 → 4458.26] See ya.
[4458.34 → 4458.80] One apple.
[4458.88 → 4459.08] Bye.
[4459.46 → 4460.16] I see how it is.
[4460.62 → 4461.64] Would you like an orange?
[4462.04 → 4462.28] Yeah.
[4462.48 → 4462.72] Okay.
[4463.18 → 4464.60] Damn, you got a better one.
[4464.64 → 4466.00] He was so excited about that.
[4466.04 → 4466.34] He was.
[4466.34 → 4466.98] I'm a little scared.
[4467.36 → 4468.16] Catch it on camera.
[4469.54 → 4469.86] Woo!
[4470.12 → 4470.56] Got it.
[4470.64 → 4470.90] Dang.
[4470.98 → 4471.34] All right.
[4471.84 → 4472.36] Nerd sports.
[4472.36 → 4472.68] Shirt out of the eight.
[4473.12 → 4473.52] Shirt out of the eight.
[4474.40 → 4475.20] Nerd sports.
[4475.60 → 4476.22] Coming soon.
[4476.94 → 4477.36] There you go.
[4477.36 → 4479.94] I guess I can't really like to say shit over here and then be on there.
[4480.14 → 4481.68] I can say that I saw a little bit looking out the window.
[4481.68 → 4481.98] You can come over here.
[4481.98 → 4482.72] Looking out the window.
[4482.72 → 4483.56] Just for one second.
[4483.84 → 4484.12] Okay.
[4485.36 → 4486.32] Um, what I was going to say.
[4486.52 → 4488.50] I, I'm not in the console game.
[4488.70 → 4489.78] I'm not really excited for it.
[4489.78 → 4491.14] You need to toss me an orange while I do it.
[4491.54 → 4491.88] Okay.
[4492.14 → 4492.42] Okay.
[4492.72 → 4493.46] Can you do this?
[4493.50 → 4493.66] Yeah.
[4494.52 → 4494.76] Go.
[4495.62 → 4495.98] Okay.
[4496.20 → 4496.68] Oh, fuck.
[4498.76 → 4499.68] Wait, one more time.
[4500.48 → 4500.74] Okay.
[4501.20 → 4501.58] All right.
[4501.68 → 4502.66] Tune into nerd sports.
[4502.78 → 4503.64] It's going to be sick.
[4504.36 → 4505.28] Wait, one more time.
[4506.50 → 4507.60] I should probably do it myself.
[4507.76 → 4507.96] Okay.
[4507.96 → 4508.28] Okay.
[4508.34 → 4509.96] Turn into nerd sports.
[4511.24 → 4512.00] It's going to be sick.
[4512.26 → 4513.04] It's going to be dank.
[4513.36 → 4514.20] I'm editing it now.
[4514.54 → 4515.44] Oh, you were so close.
[4515.78 → 4516.58] That was going so well.
[4516.82 → 4520.36] I've made, I've signed an agreement that I can't talk about nerd sports unless I'm juggling.
[4521.20 → 4521.50] Really?
[4521.76 → 4521.98] Yeah.
[4522.34 → 4523.10] No, no.
[4523.64 → 4524.18] I don't know.
[4524.28 → 4525.00] You just kept with it.
[4525.00 → 4525.88] Yeah, I liked it.
[4527.28 → 4529.70] But check it out and don't unsubscribe from Vessel.
[4530.60 → 4532.30] Because it's, it's going to be on there.
[4532.76 → 4534.16] And nowhere else.
[4534.48 → 4534.84] I don't think.
[4535.62 → 4536.42] For a long time.
[4536.42 → 4537.30] And I worked a lot.
[4537.40 → 4538.64] I worked really hard on it.
[4540.38 → 4541.60] So don't unsubscribe.
[4542.74 → 4544.48] And say nice things to your moms.
[4545.56 → 4545.92] Okay.
[4546.00 → 4546.38] See you guys.
[4546.54 → 4546.90] Please do it.
[4546.92 → 4547.36] We're back.
[4548.78 → 4549.40] Thanks, Virgo.
[4549.48 → 4549.82] All right.
[4551.24 → 4552.22] Have a good long weekend.
[4552.52 → 4552.86] You too.
[4552.94 → 4553.22] See ya.
[4554.56 → 4555.12] That was weird.
[4555.24 → 4555.84] Okay, you guys get Monday off.
[4556.20 → 4556.64] That was cool.
[4557.36 → 4557.72] Okay.
[4558.00 → 4559.14] PlayStation 4.5.
[4559.88 → 4561.14] I'm not in the console game.
[4561.22 → 4561.94] Don't have a console.
[4562.16 → 4563.04] Would like a Wii U.
[4563.32 → 4564.66] We were talking about the Spoken tournament.
[4564.86 → 4566.06] I found out that came out yesterday.
[4566.42 → 4568.70] I live under a very large rock.
[4568.88 → 4569.38] But it's comfortable.
[4570.66 → 4571.10] So.
[4572.22 → 4573.32] I don't like this.
[4573.58 → 4574.98] Because people who bought this console.
[4575.10 → 4577.72] And it's for the same reasons that I don't like the new Nintendo 3DS.
[4577.84 → 4578.84] Now I almost bought one.
[4579.30 → 4580.28] But the whole fact that you were.
[4580.40 → 4581.60] Now, please confirm.
[4581.92 → 4584.70] The new games will not work on the older Game Boys.
[4584.96 → 4585.30] Is that.
[4586.60 → 4587.28] Certain games.
[4587.68 → 4588.46] Functionality and stuff.
[4588.62 → 4589.48] Certain functionalities.
[4589.56 → 4589.76] Okay.
[4590.06 → 4590.34] So you see.
[4590.80 → 4592.28] Certain functionalities are a little bit different.
[4592.36 → 4593.46] I have the 2DS you got me.
[4593.46 → 4594.22] Which is fantastic.
[4595.08 → 4596.00] Really been enjoying that.
[4596.04 → 4596.90] Really works well for me.
[4597.98 → 4598.20] But I.
[4598.38 → 4599.08] My problem there was.
[4599.18 → 4599.98] I was misinformed.
[4600.84 → 4601.30] Oh, okay.
[4601.34 → 4602.50] I thought certain games wouldn't work.
[4602.64 → 4603.62] I don't think that's a thing.
[4605.58 → 4606.66] There's like a C stick.
[4607.22 → 4607.42] Yes.
[4607.42 → 4608.32] For when you're in Smash and stuff.
[4608.38 → 4609.52] Like there are different things like that.
[4609.66 → 4609.86] Right.
[4610.24 → 4610.40] Right.
[4610.56 → 4611.60] So that's not that big of a deal.
[4612.02 → 4616.24] Because what I think of is the parent who did the best they could.
[4616.52 → 4617.64] Very similar to our parents.
[4617.92 → 4618.62] To get a console.
[4618.78 → 4619.68] And now there's a new one.
[4619.78 → 4621.84] And now like this PS 4.5.
[4621.94 → 4623.26] Are all games going to work on it?
[4623.54 → 4624.56] We don't know.
[4624.62 → 4625.38] We know very little.
[4625.46 → 4626.46] It might not even be a thing.
[4626.76 → 4627.64] But if it is a thing.
[4627.70 → 4628.84] If it is an updated version.
[4628.98 → 4629.46] First.
[4629.54 → 4630.84] Anyone who plays anything competitive.
[4631.18 → 4631.74] Has to upgrade.
[4631.86 → 4632.02] Period.
[4632.30 → 4633.86] That was one thing we saw with the Xbox Elite.
[4634.64 → 4636.12] Which was kind of a frustrating deal.
[4636.16 → 4637.04] But not a huge deal.
[4637.04 → 4640.42] My biggest thing is if they're going to come out with a new one.
[4640.72 → 4644.50] If the new games following that launch only work on that new system.
[4644.86 → 4647.30] Basically making the PS 4 obsolete.
[4647.92 → 4648.48] I'm upset.
[4648.64 → 4649.32] And I don't own them.
[4649.42 → 4650.40] I don't like that idea.
[4650.48 → 4651.28] I don't like that marketing.
[4651.46 → 4652.22] I don't like any of that.
[4652.28 → 4653.00] I think that's ugly.
[4653.62 → 4654.36] From all sides.
[4654.46 → 4656.28] So I'm really hoping that's not what happens.
[4657.34 → 4658.08] And frankly.
[4658.66 → 4659.36] My biggest argument.
[4659.60 → 4660.18] When Xbox.
[4660.46 → 4661.74] And we saw it at PAX especially.
[4661.92 → 4663.04] I don't think it was this year.
[4663.06 → 4663.74] But the year before.
[4664.26 → 4665.54] It might have even been the year before that.
[4665.54 → 4669.98] But when PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were really trying to compete.
[4670.72 → 4671.60] My biggest thing.
[4671.68 → 4673.34] And everyone who's watching this knows that.
[4673.42 → 4674.44] Is they're just super underpowered.
[4675.18 → 4675.96] Like why didn't you just.
[4676.16 → 4677.44] Why do this now?
[4677.52 → 4678.76] Why didn't you start on a good foot?
[4679.20 → 4680.94] My biggest complaint when they first came out.
[4681.12 → 4681.48] Was that.
[4682.06 → 4685.42] The Wii U was ridiculously comparable.
[4685.62 → 4687.28] If not better in certain categories.
[4687.86 → 4688.30] No.
[4688.44 → 4689.52] What pissed me off was.
[4690.66 → 4692.74] Every generation before that.
[4693.08 → 4693.84] Like the 360.
[4693.84 → 4695.08] When the 360 first came out.
[4695.08 → 4697.48] And the PlayStation 3.
[4697.62 → 4699.36] They're losing a little bit on selling the console.
[4700.18 → 4701.86] It's actually got pretty good hardware in there.
[4702.10 → 4703.04] And at the very beginning.
[4703.20 → 4703.52] It's like.
[4704.30 → 4704.52] Ooh.
[4704.84 → 4705.52] Solid drop.
[4705.64 → 4705.72] Yeah.
[4705.72 → 4707.36] It's an interesting idea.
[4707.56 → 4708.34] Compared to a computer.
[4708.62 → 4709.74] A computer is probably going to be better.
[4709.86 → 4710.16] But like.
[4710.78 → 4712.22] For people that don't want to mess with that.
[4712.86 → 4714.32] It's actually kind of interesting.
[4714.46 → 4715.74] It's running its own thing.
[4716.82 → 4717.70] Games load like.
[4718.30 → 4718.66] Okay.
[4718.88 → 4719.84] Games don't load right away.
[4719.92 → 4721.66] But like you don't have to patch things really.
[4721.84 → 4721.92] Like.
[4722.22 → 4723.64] Stuff just kind of works.
[4723.64 → 4724.86] When the 360 dropped.
[4725.04 → 4725.80] I would say the PC.
[4725.94 → 4726.40] Red ringed.
[4726.66 → 4729.24] Console argument was way closer than it was.
[4729.24 → 4729.48] It was.
[4729.60 → 4730.08] And then like.
[4730.26 → 4731.32] As time goes by.
[4731.42 → 4733.72] The PC will start to just completely destroy it.
[4733.80 → 4734.88] And it's not a contest anymore.
[4734.96 → 4735.44] And that's fine.
[4736.10 → 4739.06] When the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One came out.
[4740.22 → 4741.40] PCs at the same cost.
[4741.64 → 4742.50] Were already just.
[4742.86 → 4743.62] So much better.
[4743.76 → 4744.16] Ridiculous.
[4744.32 → 4744.44] Yeah.
[4744.54 → 4745.14] It wasn't even.
[4745.50 → 4746.54] They're not in the same ballpark.
[4746.90 → 4747.66] And that's boring.
[4747.88 → 4748.92] Like I'm on the PC side.
[4749.02 → 4749.68] But that's just.
[4750.38 → 4750.82] Boring.
[4751.02 → 4751.52] It really is.
[4751.64 → 4751.76] Yeah.
[4751.76 → 4752.36] It really is.
[4752.60 → 4754.18] What they were putting in there was just.
[4754.60 → 4754.96] Ugly.
[4755.76 → 4756.66] It just really was.
[4758.10 → 4758.58] You know.
[4758.78 → 4759.00] Just.
[4759.62 → 4759.92] I don't know.
[4759.92 → 4760.98] I don't know how much we can beat that.
[4761.12 → 4761.50] Super disappointed.
[4761.68 → 4761.84] Yeah.
[4762.06 → 4762.38] Really.
[4762.48 → 4763.00] Really not.
[4763.10 → 4763.76] Really not exciting.
[4764.04 → 4765.66] We'll see what Sony decides to do with this.
[4765.88 → 4766.66] If Sony does it.
[4766.68 → 4768.64] You've got to assume Xbox is going to do something similar.
[4769.06 → 4769.78] I love Nintendo.
[4769.86 → 4770.56] Because they're just on their own.
[4770.60 → 4771.28] Doing their own thing.
[4771.88 → 4773.04] So that new Nintendo console.
[4773.14 → 4774.20] I'm also excited as well.
[4775.58 → 4776.52] I wish I had a week.
[4776.58 → 4777.12] Maybe I'll.
[4777.20 → 4778.40] We'll rent it this weekend or something.
[4778.40 → 4779.82] I really want to try that Spoken tournament.
[4779.82 → 4781.30] I don't even play fighting games.
[4781.40 → 4782.70] But I've just been watching a little bit online.
[4782.70 → 4784.32] I've heard it's like basically Smash.
[4784.64 → 4785.16] But with Pokémon.
[4785.36 → 4785.88] Isn't it?
[4785.94 → 4786.42] Or is it different?
[4786.62 → 4787.14] It's different.
[4787.26 → 4787.96] It's much more.
[4788.08 → 4789.78] It's just a one-on-one fighting game.
[4789.90 → 4790.42] It's not.
[4790.88 → 4791.76] It's not exactly.
[4791.96 → 4792.22] You know.
[4792.26 → 4792.70] Two-dimensional.
[4792.84 → 4794.12] You're moving on a single axis.
[4794.24 → 4795.00] You can move around.
[4795.26 → 4796.26] But it's very interesting.
[4796.38 → 4797.62] I actually watched a tournament the other day.
[4797.92 → 4798.16] I said.
[4798.18 → 4798.26] Oh.
[4798.28 → 4799.12] I'm going to check this out.
[4799.46 → 4800.62] I saw one of the streamers.
[4800.66 → 4801.94] Who streams all different games playing it.
[4802.16 → 4803.16] I went to the actual channel.
[4803.16 → 4805.28] Which it's got very low traction on Twitch.
[4805.28 → 4805.92] I have to say.
[4806.16 → 4807.48] Very low traction for a new game.
[4807.48 → 4808.96] Which is kind of depressing.
[4809.18 → 4813.36] But I was watching Mew two fight Pokémon that's brand new.
[4813.40 → 4814.18] So I don't know its name.
[4814.36 → 4816.78] But it was incredible how Mew two was always in the air.
[4816.90 → 4818.90] And this one character had to use constant anti-air.
[4819.26 → 4820.22] And just watching the engagement.
[4820.28 → 4822.00] People are facepalming because I said.
[4823.62 → 4824.66] Taken not Smash.
[4824.76 → 4826.96] That makes so much more sense why it's called Spoken now.
[4827.36 → 4827.66] Yes.
[4828.06 → 4828.28] Yes.
[4828.30 → 4829.00] It's much more like Taken.
[4829.00 → 4830.02] I didn't think about that at all.
[4830.14 → 4831.82] I just thought Smash because I saw the cover.
[4832.52 → 4832.84] Yes.
[4832.92 → 4833.76] The cover you could say totally.
[4833.76 → 4834.66] And it made me think of Smash.
[4834.78 → 4835.98] I haven't seen the game at all.
[4836.20 → 4836.48] Taken.
[4836.48 → 4837.16] Much more like Taken.
[4837.26 → 4838.12] That totally makes sense.
[4838.24 → 4838.38] Yeah.
[4838.48 → 4839.02] I get that now.
[4839.02 → 4841.48] Which isn't really our kind of games.
[4841.60 → 4843.96] I know neither of us kind of gravitated towards that.
[4844.54 → 4845.44] It's probably worth a rent though.
[4845.80 → 4846.02] Mm-hmm.
[4847.54 → 4850.26] Luckily we still have a place near our house where we can rent video games.
[4850.26 → 4851.22] An awesome place.
[4851.36 → 4851.54] Yeah.
[4851.62 → 4852.76] If you live anywhere around here.
[4852.84 → 4853.72] Willow Video Games.
[4853.78 → 4855.14] Give them a shout-out in Langley, BC.
[4855.68 → 4857.74] Fantastic shop run by fantastic people.
[4858.86 → 4859.24] But great.
[4859.36 → 4860.24] It's an old school shop.
[4860.30 → 4861.30] You can buy and sell.
[4861.52 → 4862.44] And it's fantastic.
[4862.44 → 4864.40] It's a perfect place to go.
[4864.48 → 4866.22] Competitive prices and nobody's nicer.
[4866.68 → 4866.78] Yeah.
[4866.78 → 4868.08] Their customer service is fantastic.
[4868.36 → 4868.48] Yeah.
[4868.48 → 4873.82] I bought a tiny little Charizard shirt for that was built for a lady.
[4874.08 → 4874.28] Yeah.
[4874.28 → 4876.54] And the dude totally thought it was for me.
[4876.88 → 4878.68] And he mentioned that it might not fit me.
[4879.20 → 4880.14] That's okay, dude.
[4881.68 → 4884.16] And I never actually told him it wasn't for me.
[4884.24 → 4885.88] He just looked at me weird the whole time.
[4886.12 → 4886.90] I was buying it.
[4887.92 → 4892.30] Turned out to not fit my SO as I'll call it.
[4892.38 → 4893.72] And we actually ended up taking it back.
[4894.02 → 4896.06] And the guy was like, oh, I'm not sure if it was a different individual.
[4896.18 → 4897.92] Oh, I'm not sure if we take clothing back.
[4897.96 → 4901.52] And the guy who sold it to me out front of the back was like, oh, I know him.
[4901.54 → 4902.40] We can take that back.
[4902.40 → 4905.12] And it's okay that it didn't fit him.
[4905.34 → 4906.62] I just let it play out.
[4906.66 → 4907.30] I just let it play out.
[4907.34 → 4908.36] Yeah, it was a female small.
[4908.66 → 4911.50] So that didn't work out.
[4913.00 → 4915.40] Probably wouldn't even cover like one of your arms.
[4915.76 → 4916.08] Yeah.
[4916.14 → 4918.14] I might have had to rip it a few times and take it off.
[4919.18 → 4920.64] But yeah, it didn't work out.
[4920.64 → 4921.82] It could eventually solve the problem.
[4922.16 → 4922.90] But they're super nice.
[4922.98 → 4923.40] They're great.
[4923.58 → 4923.76] Yes.
[4923.82 → 4925.32] If you have some games to sell, games to buy.
[4925.34 → 4925.66] I love that place.
[4925.98 → 4926.72] It's a great place to go.
[4926.72 → 4933.20] I'm like probably a very, maybe a noticeable percentage of their reason why they're still
[4933.20 → 4933.70] in business.
[4934.08 → 4934.60] Could be.
[4934.74 → 4934.82] Could be.
[4934.82 → 4940.64] I try to buy like everything I can from them if it's possible.
[4940.76 → 4943.56] And I try to send everyone I know to them if possible.
[4944.26 → 4945.06] Because I would rather like.
[4945.06 → 4947.22] I wonder if you can buy the new Need for Speed for PC from them.
[4947.42 → 4947.72] I wonder if you can.
[4947.72 → 4948.56] No, they don't do PC stuff.
[4948.66 → 4951.70] I think if you request beforehand.
[4952.20 → 4952.62] Oh, yeah.
[4952.70 → 4953.50] They can get one for you.
[4953.50 → 4956.22] They're actually the ones who told me because I have the 2DS that you got me.
[4956.62 → 4958.94] And then I played on your new Nintendo 3DS.
[4959.52 → 4960.54] That's what it is, right?
[4960.56 → 4960.90] I'm using it.
[4960.90 → 4962.46] I think that is literally what it's called.
[4962.74 → 4962.94] The new Nintendo 3DS.
[4962.94 → 4963.00] Yes.
[4963.00 → 4963.20] Okay.
[4963.66 → 4965.20] And I was a little blown away.
[4965.36 → 4966.22] So I wanted to go buy one.
[4966.24 → 4967.10] And they had the Pokémon version.
[4967.18 → 4968.04] So I actually called Willow.
[4968.30 → 4970.56] They were the ones who informed me that it's not the actual XL.
[4970.68 → 4971.74] They saved me a bunch of.
[4972.06 → 4977.16] Because I referred to it as, oh, do you have the new Nintendo Pokémon 3DS XL?
[4977.58 → 4978.88] They said, we actually do.
[4978.88 → 4979.58] But it's not an XL.
[4979.70 → 4981.88] And told me all about it and the issues with it.
[4981.88 → 4984.28] So they saved me a bunch of money because I actually almost ordered off Amazon.
[4984.40 → 4987.64] Just assuming it was the full go because it was the same price.
[4987.88 → 4994.02] When a company is willing to tell you the bad things about something to save you money
[4994.02 → 4999.58] because you specifically asked for something like improperly or whatever.
[4999.70 → 5000.42] Like what just happened.
[5000.98 → 5001.84] That's awesome.
[5002.10 → 5002.64] Yes, absolutely.
[5002.68 → 5005.74] I would very much expect another store to just be like, sure, man.
[5006.38 → 5007.96] Here's your $300 something device.
[5008.34 → 5009.10] Yeah, exactly.
[5009.10 → 5012.92] And someone like me and you, I just don't want to speak for you, but I guarantee you,
[5013.42 → 5015.76] that means you're going to get future business.
[5016.10 → 5020.52] Instead of losing that initial sale, which might suck for the moment,
[5020.76 → 5022.48] you just guaranteed sales down the road.
[5022.54 → 5023.44] I'm totally that type of person.
[5023.80 → 5026.22] For example, see, I don't know who your sponsor is.
[5026.26 → 5028.06] Are you sponsored by Amazon right now?
[5028.64 → 5028.84] No.
[5028.84 → 5033.16] Okay, so I had terrible customer service from that video card company,
[5033.22 → 5034.72] which I don't want to hate on because they are a good company.
[5036.40 → 5038.00] But I'm probably not going to go back to them.
[5038.18 → 5045.06] Just purely off the customer service that I was received when I had to send in my 660 Ti and get it fixed.
[5045.22 → 5047.88] I actually ended up getting a brand new one, which was nice,
[5048.02 → 5052.08] but it was a nightmare of a process that guaranteed a lack of future business.
[5052.20 → 5052.42] Right.
[5052.56 → 5053.12] From myself.
[5053.22 → 5054.28] Am I going to hurt their bottom line?
[5054.36 → 5055.08] Absolutely not.
[5055.92 → 5056.64] Well, I got a story.
[5056.98 → 5057.88] Got to vote with your wallet.
[5058.60 → 5059.94] A story I've been saying forever.
[5060.34 → 5062.56] The stream's more or less over now, but a story I've been saying forever.
[5062.56 → 5063.98] Should we turn it into the after party or?
[5065.32 → 5065.62] Sure.
[5065.94 → 5066.16] Yeah.
[5066.68 → 5067.04] Okay.
[5069.34 → 5070.74] This thing and whoop.
[5071.36 → 5071.86] Sorry, guys.
[5071.88 → 5073.22] I get them off-topic all over the place.
[5074.00 → 5076.36] It's very similar to what happens when we hang out.
[5076.36 → 5080.44] It's kind of a slightly more professional version of it.
[5081.12 → 5082.06] That's pretty much it.
[5082.06 → 5086.48] That's kind of the whole idea of what created the Sancho to start with.
[5086.84 → 5088.78] It was just what happened with Linus and me.
[5088.94 → 5091.50] I really did like the original ones in the garage.
[5091.76 → 5092.28] Sancho!
[5092.66 → 5094.10] I mean, Linda.com!
[5094.52 → 5094.84] Linda!
[5096.76 → 5097.64] My Faces!
[5098.54 → 5099.64] Fix all the things.
[5100.16 → 5100.66] Cool, Master!
[5101.52 → 5101.94] Cool.
[5102.10 → 5103.30] All the games.
[5105.14 → 5106.50] And the CPUs.
[5107.28 → 5108.46] And the GPUs.
[5108.46 → 5123.24] And the CPUs.
[5125.98 → 5127.62] The CPUs.
[5127.62 → 5127.98] The CPUs.
[5127.98 → 5128.56] Because the CPUs.
[5128.56 → 5130.00] The CPUs.
[5130.00 → 5132.76] The CPUs.
[5133.12 → 5133.74] The CPUs.
