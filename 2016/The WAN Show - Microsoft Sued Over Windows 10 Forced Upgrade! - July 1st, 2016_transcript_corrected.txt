[0.00 → 11.60] and we're live welcome to the wan show my friends we've actually got a great show for you guys
[11.60 → 17.44] today it feels like we hardly ever host the show together any more it's like probably less than 50
[17.44 → 21.96] percent of the time like either you're out of the country or I'm out of the country, or you're in the
[21.96 → 28.96] country but lazy oh that's mean i legitimately we were talking about this before the show i
[28.96 → 36.68] legitimately don't remember why you weren't here last week when were you um oh that's right you had
[36.68 → 44.44] the personal thing yeah oh that's right so that's the same reason that I probably could not be here
[44.44 → 51.58] today if there were anything that I could do yes um yeah oh that's right our lives are going great
[51.58 → 56.86] yeah it's been kind of a rough couple of weeks um the good news is my rough couple weeks isn't quite as
[56.86 → 64.86] bad as like my grandparents rough couple weeks so you know hey um knock on wood for the that it
[64.86 → 70.24] continues to continue to not be worse than it already is minecraft or something well no, no it's
[70.24 → 74.76] it's like it's a joke no because your head's made of wood if you're an idiot
[74.76 → 87.60] so it's time for the wad show guys lots of great topics for you today oculus stops blocking five owners
[87.60 → 95.88] from playing exclusive rift games basically uh they needed some good PR so they went and bought it
[95.88 → 101.94] yeah I think they heard my video was coming, and they were like whoa and then did this yeah I'm pretty
[101.94 → 107.30] sure that's what happened Microsoft pays a woman I'm sorry did they actually send us a review sample
[107.30 → 113.66] or did they just eventually after two months prioritize your paid order I think it was 52
[113.66 → 119.56] days later they prioritize our paid order and to add to that it wasn't that they like shoved it through
[119.56 → 123.78] the queue when it might have been difficult they're now shipping them at a much faster rate
[123.78 → 128.94] so got production way higher than it was before, and then we're like yeah we can probably give them
[128.94 → 137.36] one of those Microsoft pays a woman 10 000 us dollars over a forced Windows 10 upgrade
[137.36 → 144.14] don't dun which okay I guess we'll talk more about it yeah we'll talk more about it tesla driver dies in
[144.14 → 150.92] the first crash while using autopilot mode first fatal crash specifically first fatal crash yes did I
[150.92 → 156.36] say dies in yeah you said dies in the first crash, but there have been crashes oh that's fair
[156.36 → 161.64] uh that is fair yeah I mean we don't want to be down us border control could start asking for your
[161.64 → 169.96] social media accounts oh no what oh no actually for p okay we'll discuss it more later but I might be
[169.96 → 176.06] in favour of this so let's roll the intro, and we'll get to all these topics and more I can just take
[176.06 → 179.86] these off my head they keep like I keep being like what's on my head I keep touching god
[179.86 → 205.12] visit squarespace.com slash
[205.12 → 211.92] actually it's squarespace.com slash wan show it's not even the right link
[211.92 → 213.12] oh
[213.12 → 219.12] I hate this show I hate this show um
[219.12 → 228.56] so why don't we jump right into our first topic um oculus stops blocking five owners from playing
[228.56 → 235.04] exclusive rift games you know why this actually happened um you know what can I do my ignorant
[235.04 → 241.36] version first and then can you tell us why it actually happened sure okay so original article
[241.36 → 249.28] here is from the might be right website that I hold on it's from the verge yeah yeah hold
[249.28 → 254.88] on let's just see if oh please work completely flawlessly and everywhere oh no way it
[254.88 → 261.04] worked oh okay so original article is from the verge and basically if you guys haven't been paying
[261.04 → 267.92] attention oculus has their store where you can buy games and applications and in theory at some point
[267.92 → 275.12] when it's not just games um where you can buy games and in that store some of the games are exclusive
[275.12 → 282.88] to the rift and so basically what oculus was doing was someone came out and I forget what the pro
[282.88 → 289.36] the project was called libra something libra VR or libra five or something libra VR slash revive
[289.36 → 297.12] there we go libra VR slash revive and found a way to bypass um the DRM that existed on these games
[297.12 → 304.48] that prevented people who did not own a rift from playing them and then oculus reacted by tightening
[304.48 → 309.28] down the DRM and making it so that like I actually got as far as to launch lucky's tail
[309.28 → 314.08] and I could like to look around and enjoy the platform oh it's a platformer I should be
[314.08 → 318.64] playing it on a screen with a controller, and then you just decided to i actually really want to play
[318.64 → 324.64] it in VR so I haven't played it yet though you actually have yeah anyway so I got as far as to
[324.64 → 330.00] be able to look around in the game, but then they made it, so the controller wouldn't work so that was
[330.00 → 339.20] one of the ways that they locked it down so oculus having come under fire lately seems to have
[339.60 → 349.92] bought themselves some positive PR by discontinuing the blocking of uh their exclusive and DRM'd
[349.92 → 355.36] games discontinued the blocking of preventing five owners from playing them there let's call that
[355.36 → 361.52] grammatically correct okay what actually happened okay so uh oculus had a check in all the games
[361.52 → 366.80] downloaded from their store that just did a headset check is this a rift does it check yourself it
[366.80 → 370.88] it should check does it prevent you from wrecking because they did kind of wreck themselves did they
[370.88 → 377.36] okay well if you think yeah the PR is terrible so they kind of right yeah okay anyway so that's
[377.36 → 385.04] that's all that libra VR slash revive was getting around at first was this thing a rift yes or no
[385.04 → 390.16] i I think they just like removed that check, or they just told if it was a rift and then moved on or
[390.16 → 396.48] something but it just basically that part didn't matter so oculus got a little upset patched in like
[396.48 → 402.40] straight up DRM to not allow it was more intense than just a simple check and then the way
[402.40 → 410.88] that libra VR slash revive had to fix that was with a complete DRM breaking patch which enabled piracy
[412.64 → 418.56] the original libra VR okay I did not know this patch did not enable piracy it didn't help you
[418.56 → 424.80] pirate games the new patch so you had to buy the game, but it got around the headset check yes that
[424.80 → 430.88] was the original one the new one didn't and libra VR slash revive was like to we don't really want to
[430.88 → 439.76] do this, but this is the only option we have to play rift games on a five so there you go so oculus has now
[439.76 → 451.52] allowed people to use games bought on the oculus store on the five while saying we continually revise
[451.52 → 462.48] our entitlement and anti-privacy systems um and where is it we believe uh protecting developer content is
[462.48 → 468.48] critical to the long-term success of the VR industry so while they're also doing stuff like uh
[469.60 → 475.44] where's why is it an Apple news link to the verge the dock is broken for some reason
[477.68 → 483.28] while there's also stuff going on like saying it's solving a major sore point between oculus and parts
[483.28 → 490.08] of the VR community I don't think that was actually the motivation for this that might be a helpful
[490.08 → 495.68] way for them to paint it so that they also get good PR out of the move but I think the problem is
[496.80 → 504.56] their action whether they intended it to or not was directly resulting in the removal of things that
[504.56 → 512.40] stopped piracy in a very widespread way so the way for them to try to slow down or stop or whatever the
[512.40 → 519.84] piracy that was going on they made a way to keep anti-piracy stuff in there but allow people to use it
[519.84 → 526.72] across platforms you notice how at the bottom of these notes it says library such revive developers
[526.72 → 532.48] have removed their DRM breaking patch good so that's gone which is good that's good all right
[533.84 → 540.24] I'm I'm like I'm creating havoc in twitch chat right now why by saying that it is pre-recorded because it's
[540.24 → 547.52] a national holiday today oh my god can we just like everything okay, okay so everyone and
[547.52 → 555.20] their dog in twitch chat wants us to move on to a bit of a different topic here um so the original
[555.20 → 563.92] article here is from nine to five mac and there is some bad news in the Apple repair world so
[563.92 → 572.48] tech serve which has been in business for 29 years in the New York area has apparently decided to
[572.48 → 582.08] shutter their doors um citing competition from I think it's four Apple stores uh best buy and uh let's
[582.08 → 587.12] see what else we got going on here and online sales so they're saying they're no longer doing enough
[587.12 → 593.28] business on the sales side to make continued operation viable so they were a third party apple product
[593.28 → 605.84] repair shop and this actually would seem to indicate that it's possible um that there's more to this
[605.84 → 611.92] than necessarily just the business isn't viable so lewis Grossman uh who you guys may know from the
[611.92 → 617.92] furious video where the guy was so mad at me for putting a video card in an oven that he was
[617.92 → 622.88] practically foaming at the mouth and swearing his head off I have never actually watched the video
[622.88 → 626.96] because I was pretty sure it would just annoy me and make it so that I didn't want to work with
[626.96 → 632.24] them but I decided that you know my reaction to that video because he wasn't wrong
[634.88 → 641.12] my reaction to that video should be to show up at his shop and have him show me how to do it properly
[641.12 → 647.76] sharp guy nice guy he was just upset I have to give you props that was a pretty gentlemanly move
[647.76 → 652.72] I get it I get it I understand why he was mad I totally get it, and you know what we went out for
[652.72 → 659.36] dinner we patched our differences and uh and I've actually been in touch since then we submerged
[659.36 → 664.80] some phones in salt water a little while ago and I got his help as a consultant to help us figure out
[664.80 → 669.44] if could there be any way to revive them turns out the answer was no um I actually owe him an email
[669.44 → 673.04] back he's like hey whatever happened with that because I emailed him last night when I saw this video
[673.04 → 680.88] um no it didn't work bud sorry um yeah nothing about it worked it was terrible under
[680.88 → 684.80] salt water for a while well they were under salt water for a while, and then they were submerged in
[684.80 → 690.56] alcohol for five weeks because I didn't get to them because I was like out of the country for weeks so
[690.56 → 696.72] yeah that also doesn't sound great everything about it is terrible um the the the laminated layers
[696.72 → 704.40] of the like screen and the glass and the touch interface just fell apart in my hand well because
[704.40 → 709.76] of the alcohol right yes you just like burned all the glue did everything all the adhesive all the seals
[709.76 → 718.00] all the o-rings anyway so um there may be more to this because lewis's video from last night
[718.00 → 729.92] he contained a lot of uh unclear sort of wording about things, but it was really clear on a
[729.92 → 734.72] few things number one is that his business is viable and I could have told you that because I went down
[734.72 → 741.12] I visited him like two months ago three months ago something like that and I walked into his shop there was
[741.12 → 747.76] customer in there was customer out I saw his rate card I saw how many people he has on staff
[747.76 → 751.68] I've watched his videos I know how long the repairs take it doesn't take a freaking genius
[751.68 → 758.16] to do the math he's doing just fine he's built himself a business from nothing and is more than
[758.16 → 763.28] surviving um he even offered to pay for dinner but I didn't let him because I knew it was my bad for
[763.28 → 769.84] upsetting him by putting by baking video cards anyway so he made it really clear that anything that
[769.84 → 776.56] happens to his business if his business is gone you know in a month that it is not because it was not
[776.56 → 784.96] viable um he made it really clear that there are tools available online that will allow you to
[784.96 → 792.00] download the videos of a given channel um to perhaps archive them just in case YouTube was no longer
[792.00 → 797.68] serving those videos so what he seems to be hinting at very strongly, and you can see for such a small
[797.68 → 805.92] channel it's got 171 000 subscribers and uh 372 000 views on this video so for such a small channel I would
[805.92 → 811.68] consider that to be kind of semi-viral um it's about like if we released a video that did 5 million
[811.68 → 815.84] views yeah so that that would be that's a certain amount of virality that we've got going on with this
[815.84 → 823.60] video people are reacting very strongly to this there's a lot of speculation that apple themselves
[824.16 → 833.28] who have been known to do things as crazy as sick swat teams on repair shops that are selling apple
[833.28 → 839.28] trademarked merchandise in the case of one of the stories I heard it was actually replacement
[839.84 → 847.60] backplates for iPhones that had apple logos on them um so they've gone as far as to six swat
[847.60 → 853.76] teams on these people and closed down their shops um it is being speculated that apple could be behind
[853.76 → 861.44] lewis potentially losing his YouTube videos as well as his livelihood in the form of his shop I have no
[861.44 → 869.04] confirmation from him, I suspect based on that he's a pretty outspoken guy not real afraid of just kind
[869.04 → 878.72] of saying whatever he's thinking you know firing from the hip a little um i I suspect that there is
[879.28 → 887.28] um some kind of legal imposition on him to keep his mouth shut at this time and that it could affect the
[887.28 → 893.28] the proceedings of whatever battle it is that he finds himself in um he's not asking for any money
[893.28 → 899.20] he's not asking for really anything I reached out i I said hey bro can I do anything to help he said no
[899.20 → 904.88] it's just good to know that that that you're there um so I guess that's all that's all that I would ask
[904.88 → 910.80] guys is uh either check out there's I think there's a thread on Reddit as well but check that out or just
[911.36 → 916.08] uh I guess you guys don't have to watch me do this but leave a comment under the video just be like yo
[916.96 → 921.44] you know whatever's going on we're there because he's a good guy and there's a bad thing happening
[921.44 → 928.64] to him right now and uh that's pretty much uh pretty much where I'm at on the whole lewis Grossman thing
[930.80 → 931.68] um yeah
[934.24 → 941.44] so maybe we could move on to some good news how about some good news one second wow we don't have a lot of
[941.44 → 949.20] good news do we have some funny news what's up um no I don't think I want to get involved in that
[949.20 → 958.00] okay um okay so this uh the original article here is from extreme tech and this is some pretty extreme
[958.00 → 966.96] craziness a woman wins a ten thousand dollar judgment against Microsoft for the forced windows
[966.96 → 971.20] 10 upgrade that happened on her computer you want to post this on the twitch chat on it um
[971.20 → 978.72] um wow does this have the potential to open the floodgates or is this a one-time thing or uh hey
[978.72 → 984.72] Microsoft I want my 10 grand you bricked my computer yeah obviously temporarily it's not really bricked but
[984.72 → 991.36] like but like it was very inconvenient you made it completely unusable until I like reformatted everything
[991.36 → 1001.92] so terry Goldstein of causality don't quote me on that uh California sued Microsoft after a failed Windows 10
[1001.92 → 1007.84] upgrade left her system performing poorly not even in an unusable state which I know you've personally experienced
[1007.84 → 1012.64] yeah and like I know other people have as well I know people have experienced this too so she's also not the only one
[1012.64 → 1017.80] poised no one is better
[1017.80 → 1020.96] she's only to constantly slide by the deaf, and so they felt outside the community while selecting a
[1020.96 → 1022.76] girlfriend she saidcoloic government's conference, but she was put in all sides of the enterprise
[1022.76 → 1024.36] and critical of this directly being stored in a 小 000 I walls
[1024.36 → 1026.60] was just one component after a learning curve to first place I saw a mix of therefor Terrier
[1027.08 → 1028.28] so uh, uh всё on theellschaft colostomy eye's jersey that one structure as a front door
[1028.28 → 1030.22] can go to the Microsoft to see family pictures and just walk off of them and actually
[1030.22 → 1031.52] 케 Lynn on the entire set of the roaring show in the end of the show
[1031.56 → 1034.56] environment at the end of the price that could go to the end of school
[1034.56 → 1037.02] doing it um they showed it also said and who had entered
[1037.02 → 1039.40] this video were as well when thank you for her very particular NG he was missing his dissum
[1039.40 → 1043.58] is it that a company that charges that much for their products doesn't have to pick up a phone
[1043.58 → 1048.80] when you have a problem with it can anyone else figure that out why is it that they just get to
[1048.80 → 1054.96] have like a support desk at the tech shops that I've worked at if someone's like operating system
[1054.96 → 1059.02] is screwed up, and we have to reinstall it and use a key and the key that's on the side of their box
[1059.02 → 1064.82] doesn't work because it never freaking works, and you call them they're just like but not our problem
[1064.82 → 1073.22] every time like what the hell did you know that there are like the discount for system
[1073.22 → 1079.76] integrators is not as much as you'd think they actually still pay a significant amount of money
[1079.76 → 1085.66] for Microsoft Windows so like the fact that they just get to kind of go oh yep nope nope
[1085.66 → 1092.66] should be upsetting yeah anyway super frustrating and then if you buy it yourself they just do the
[1092.66 → 1099.58] same thing yeah yep I mean I've had conversations with Microsoft where I mean a lot of you have
[1099.58 → 1104.30] probably noticed that in the corner of a lot of our screen capture all of our benchmarking systems
[1104.30 → 1111.44] it says this copy of windows is not genuine how on earth are we supposed to be using a genuine copy
[1111.44 → 1116.46] of windows on a benchmark machine every single time hardware changes it invalidates the key I have spent
[1116.46 → 1123.86] literally hours because it used to be that I would go to the trouble of calling in and revalidating it
[1123.86 → 1129.72] every time that I changed a motherboard for example certain components it is dislikes more than others
[1129.72 → 1135.80] graphics cards are pretty good but not always too and not always I've changed a car a graphics card and
[1135.80 → 1141.34] I've had it get pissed so basically I used to call in all the time and I got to the point where
[1141.34 → 1146.18] one of my bench test copies of windows had been reactivated so many times they just refused to
[1146.18 → 1150.62] keep doing it for me, I'm like well what am I supposed to do this is the same computer, and they're
[1150.62 → 1156.14] like there's nothing we can do I'm like well what am I supposed to do my job is to test hardware and
[1156.14 → 1161.82] change out the hardware on the machine so when I change a motherboard I am not changing the system I'm
[1161.82 → 1169.56] just changing a motherboard it's like uh, and they're like well there's no solution like so i just
[1169.56 → 1176.68] so what i I can't, I can't, you understand there's an entire industry of like people who have to test
[1176.68 → 1182.80] computers, and you're basically just telling them all to pirate windows because I have literally no
[1182.80 → 1188.32] other choice actually I do have another choice so the reason that that's always down there because if
[1188.32 → 1193.46] I was pirating windows it wouldn't be there yeah the reason that's down there is that I'm just
[1193.46 → 1199.88] running within the 30-day trial so we just have to reformat the machines periodically and just not
[1199.88 → 1205.94] enter a product key we just skip it the reality of it is these are not production machines and
[1205.94 → 1212.56] they're just for testing purposes keys we also have like a shelf of keys just for loss just in case
[1212.56 → 1215.70] if you know why it's in case someone walks in here and is like
[1215.70 → 1220.86] then we can just be like key it's like yeah like what I like look I didn't know what to do
[1220.86 → 1225.58] I talked to Microsoft support they couldn't tell me what to do so I just bought like a pile of pro
[1225.58 → 1233.22] keys like fine I don't know what to tell you anymore just look here, here pro keys like I don't know
[1233.22 → 1241.00] I don't know the answer not a small pile um so the ten thousand dollar figure reflected the estimated
[1241.00 → 1246.74] lost compensation so maybe she was self-employed or something um maybe as well as the cost of a
[1246.74 → 1252.44] new system they had to buy her new computer wow so uh they appealed the initial judgment but dropped
[1252.44 → 1258.36] the appeal last month that is hilarious the problem I would have here is I didn't contact customer
[1258.36 → 1264.52] service and I just fixed the problem immediately by myself so it took me like a couple of hours and then
[1264.52 → 1269.98] updates and then I was done well they should have to pay you for the training and experience and
[1269.98 → 1275.10] expertise that goes into having been able to fix the problem that's how life works that's true i
[1275.10 → 1280.10] mean when you bring in a plumber, and it takes him 15 minutes to fix the problem you're not paying him
[1280.10 → 1286.62] for 15 minutes you're paying him or her for the years of experience that they bring into your house
[1286.62 → 1292.20] in order to fix it in 15 minutes speaking of or her a female plumber friend of mine just got engaged
[1292.20 → 1297.94] really yeah so congratulations to them, I'm not going to say names because I don't know but
[1297.94 → 1305.86] yeah I'm not even joking my dad taught her do I know this person or uh I doubt it I went to high
[1305.86 → 1314.62] school with them, I don't think you've ever met them though but yeah anyway it was like yesterday or
[1314.62 → 1320.26] the day before it was very recently I don't remember on that positive note I have more bad news um
[1320.26 → 1331.82] so we're on the tesla blog here teslamotors.com and yeah so you know what is the saddest thing about
[1331.82 → 1341.86] this every additional incident that happens from now on will get less and less attention
[1341.86 → 1349.78] yeah the only reason anyone's paying attention to this is that it's the first, but you know with
[1349.78 → 1359.12] that said um tesla is kind of you know being sympathetic while also protecting their own
[1359.12 → 1365.78] interests in their statement pointing out that in fact um this shouldn't have happened if the
[1365.78 → 1372.98] operator of the vehicle was following the guidelines that they to be fair they didn't like push on that
[1372.98 → 1378.14] a ton no they didn't, but they did point it out yeah I think legally it was a responsible thing to
[1378.14 → 1383.22] point that out but in a nutshell they didn't try to make that the focus or anything but yeah the
[1383.22 → 1390.12] autopilot sensors on a model s failed to distinguish a white tractor trailer crossing the highway against a
[1390.12 → 1396.84] bright sky so Joshua brown had put the model s in autopilot mode to control the car during highway driving
[1396.84 → 1403.18] the car attempted to drive full speed under the tractor trailer it impacted the windshield veered off the
[1403.18 → 1410.88] road crashed through two fences and into a power pole so um Joshua brown has passed away uh the incident
[1410.88 → 1417.52] was disclosed by tesla on Thursday night and happened on May 7th actually in Williston Florida so it actually
[1417.52 → 1423.00] took a little while for them to start talking about this they were probably looking into how it
[1423.00 → 1427.00] happened and all that well I think they wanted to know what the story is before they start talking
[1427.00 → 1432.22] about the story otherwise you end up with you know wide changing stories and all this kind of stuff and
[1432.22 → 1438.14] you know how the internet loves to speculate I mean the number of people who think uh who was it
[1438.14 → 1444.82] I think like Google is responsible for the uh the twitter yeah that's not accurate thing that happened with
[1444.82 → 1452.54] us it is a company, but it was not a thing yeah um it's just crazy so they detailed in their statement
[1452.54 → 1459.82] that this is the first known autopilot death in 130 million miles driven by their customers uh this
[1459.82 → 1465.38] isn't in my notes so don't quote me on the exact numbers but I've got it here actually um yeah so among
[1465.38 → 1472.04] all vehicles in the U.S. there's a fatality every 94 million miles compared to 130 that were in autopilot
[1472.04 → 1477.70] mode so they were quick to point out that they're still ahead yeah and worldwide they fatality
[1477.70 → 1483.94] approximation is at about 60 million miles so that's not I don't know how apples to apples that
[1483.94 → 1489.20] is though because I don't think teslas are all over the place in like Cambodia where people drive
[1489.20 → 1495.68] like they all just make up their own rules as they go like I think the U.S. yeah that's why it's lower
[1495.68 → 1501.36] right yeah yeah because the U.S. comparison is more fair yeah the 60 is not specifically not a one-to-one
[1501.36 → 1505.16] yeah yeah um that's still not
[1505.16 → 1515.14] like we're not trying to be like no they did great like uh still sort of sucks yeah still sucks um you
[1515.14 → 1520.20] know there's still supposed to be other sensors on the car that should have known that there was a
[1520.20 → 1527.84] very large object actually in front of the car um, but you know tesla is taking this opportunity to
[1527.84 → 1534.16] remind people some of whom have been posting very irresponsible videos to YouTube even like the guy
[1534.16 → 1542.02] sleeping yep of abusing their autopilot mode um to it is an assist feature that requires you to keep
[1542.02 → 1546.88] your hands on the steering wheel at all times you need to maintain control and responsibility for your
[1546.88 → 1552.80] vehicle while using it I'm just glad that it didn't carry them on to you know a pile of school
[1552.80 → 1559.08] children or something like this could have been worse um, and it's a really important opportunity for
[1559.08 → 1566.84] us to remind ourselves that they are a two out of four in terms of autonomous driving standards
[1566.84 → 1573.76] they are four is fully autonomous they are not that they are two um keep your hands on the wheel
[1573.76 → 1579.68] be prepared to take over at any time um yeah
[1579.68 → 1588.00] so that's a drag um you know what maybe now's the time for a twitter blitz here
[1588.00 → 1597.80] I want to hear from you guys uh so tweet at Linus tech on Twitter um oh I guess this is also a good
[1597.80 → 1602.74] opportunity to tell you guys that the at Linus tech twitter handle is actually going to become the
[1602.74 → 1607.20] official Linus tech tips twitter handle and I'm going to be switching over to something else
[1607.20 → 1610.66] personally it's sort of TBD, but it's probably going to be at Linus g Sebastian
[1610.66 → 1617.58] I couldn't get at Linus Sebastian darn did you contact them um I've tried to contact at Linus
[1617.58 → 1622.88] Sebastian before I wasn't able to get through so the oh crap I need to get in touch with the
[1622.88 → 1628.02] at Linus tech tips guy he's going to hand that over to us as well so we have at
[1628.02 → 1633.26] Linus tech tips with a lowercase i at the beginning that's the guy that was posting a
[1633.26 → 1638.38] bunch of spam it was like a bot for a while and then at Linus tech tips is coming, but we're not going
[1638.38 → 1644.70] to switch the Linus tech tips because ideally I would have liked at Linus tech tips to be
[1644.70 → 1650.76] the publication and at Linus tech tips to be me yes, and theoretically you could do that but you
[1650.76 → 1655.30] lose your verified check mark so I don't want to strip the company of its verified check mark
[1655.30 → 1661.46] also all the twitter handles in the videos and under the videos would have to be replaced
[1661.46 → 1666.08] with the official one which is a real chore and I don't feel like doing it so um
[1666.08 → 1674.82] vehicles sorry I'm just I'm going to create a straw poll here as well
[1675.70 → 1683.86] okay so let's get that posted in the twitch chat want to hear from you guys want to hear from you guys
[1683.86 → 1690.50] on Twitter, but basically the question is are you still comfortable with autonomous vehicles and
[1690.50 → 1698.50] the answers are yes no I never was or I mean if you want to hit us up on Twitter than I guess you
[1698.50 → 1704.10] could say something a little bit yeah you know more complex than that, but it's still limited to 140
[1704.10 → 1709.30] characters or whatever it is uh sorry I just got to get us signed in to Twitter do you want to jump
[1709.30 → 1713.54] on to the next topic in the meantime then we'll come back to this place so U.S. border control could
[1713.54 → 1721.38] start asking for your social media accounts now to be clear this is an um like when you're filling out
[1721.38 → 1726.98] your I believe it's like your customs incoming form or whatever the questionnaire thing that you fill out
[1726.98 → 1732.98] when you enter the country I don't think this is U.S. border patrol as in driving over the border I think
[1732.98 → 1741.14] this is U.S. border control uh control as in flying into the country um it would be added to both
[1741.14 → 1747.94] electronic system for travel authorization oh you have got to be kidding me 94w forms oh I still had my
[1747.94 → 1754.98] screen share on okay I'm going to have to deal with that immediately okay all right you should do that
[1754.98 → 1771.30] very quickly um anyway going to keep uh talking uh anyway uh, and it would be an optional field so you would
[1771.30 → 1779.38] have um the option to put it in or not uh I don't necessarily think that this is the worst thing ever
[1779.38 → 1785.62] one it's optional two this would be what is currently I don't know see it's kind of weird
[1786.42 → 1790.50] this would be what is currently public on your social media account so if you had things that
[1790.50 → 1796.34] you didn't want people to see you would theoretically have it posted in a private way so it's probably not
[1796.34 → 1806.66] the end of the world, and you could have like uh say you were a like cam girl or porn star or something
[1806.66 → 1812.74] like that maybe have your work account and your personal account and give them your personal
[1812.74 → 1817.70] account when going over the border I do think it's a little bit weird for things like stalking you go
[1817.70 → 1822.50] over the border someone thinks you're attractive they give you have to give them all of your information
[1822.50 → 1829.62] including address and social information I don't know I'm not entirely sure what the inspiration for
[1829.62 → 1838.90] it is um you could theoretically say like oh like Isis members and stuff have social media accounts
[1838.90 → 1845.78] um whatnot and so forth but I seriously doubt any of them would give that one like I just said about
[1845.78 → 1852.02] the like if you're an adult star of some form um you would have a work one and a non-work one I have
[1852.02 → 1856.98] a feeling someone who's as blatant as an Isis member with a Twitter account wouldn't put their Isis
[1856.98 → 1865.38] affiliated Twitter account on a travel authorization form to go into the U.S. because that is just
[1866.18 → 1876.10] ridiculous, and it's also an optional area so yeah okay well that was potentially the end of the world
[1876.10 → 1886.42] but isn't yay if I could copy this that would be great jeez I've had a bad enough week with that kind
[1886.42 → 1894.90] of crap going on that's the last thing yeah yeah no i know no it was much it was much worse
[1894.90 → 1902.66] than that actually it was much, much worse than just the password um it was uh it was that and a backup
[1902.66 → 1909.62] code so it was like so it was the password and the means to uh circumvent my two-factor authentication
[1909.62 → 1915.78] the best part is too I saw through my administrator stuff that people were storing backup codes
[1916.42 → 1921.70] in that and was literally going to bring it up in the Monday morning meeting next week that people
[1921.70 → 1930.42] should not do that yeah well there you go there you go um sorry I'm just going to need a minute actually
[1930.42 → 1934.98] okay no I did want to weigh in on that topic and I'm actually like I'm good now that was uh that was the
[1934.98 → 1939.38] only thing that showed up there, and it's all it's all sort of squared away now and then I'm being a bro
[1939.38 → 1944.34] in chat was like you post pictures you get timed out talk get hit
[1946.74 → 1954.34] so uh when crossing the border like honestly some of the easiest times that I've ever had crossing the border
[1954.34 → 1962.58] have been when I explain who I am and show them a video because like if I'm going down to attend a conference
[1962.58 → 1967.14] or something like that I'm like yeah I'm this guy I make videos about tech on YouTube, and they're like
[1967.14 → 1976.10] oh okay so you're you um, um you don't want to figure that out immediately okay yeah I'll figure that out
[1976.10 → 1981.22] um so I have kind of the same thing someone will ask me what I'm doing I'm like oh I'm going for meetings
[1981.22 → 1986.42] and like before they even ask me like what kind of meetings because you know the border control guy
[1986.42 → 1992.50] is just like I've had 10 000 people come through here today and I'm tired of asking these questions
[1992.50 → 1996.98] every single time so instead of just like vomiting information at them because they also don't want
[1996.98 → 2003.22] that either and that makes you look super suspicious I just have my formulated obvious question ready
[2003.22 → 2007.78] I'm like I'm a YouTube person I make YouTube videos I'm going to visit a hardware company because I make
[2007.78 → 2014.18] YouTube videos on hardware and I'm going down there for meetings um yeah it's actually pretty
[2014.18 → 2019.86] straightforward so for me being able to show like here's my Twitter account which is for work and
[2019.86 → 2026.34] here's the YouTube channel that we have it's for work and here's my Facebook page it's private so
[2027.86 → 2036.18] there's my picture I guess cool um actually I don't have any problems with that at all and one kind of
[2036.18 → 2042.58] cool side effect of this could be that people are more wary about what they put publicly on their social
[2042.58 → 2049.30] media because man some people aren't careful with that at all like Dennis
[2051.54 → 2058.02] just posting dick pics on Twitter all the time yeah yes he does that's why his twitter handle is Dennis
[2058.02 → 2064.42] is hung yeah I thought it was Denny is hung is it Denny is hung oh it's Denny is never so slightly
[2064.42 → 2073.62] different from that as in Denny's the restaurant chain anyway uh talking about another thing that
[2073.62 → 2079.46] could be seen in either way apple has granted a patent that can prevent iPhones from recording at
[2079.46 → 2084.90] concerts so I'm going to post the nine to five mac article in the chat so you guys can see it as well
[2084.90 → 2091.94] my immediate gut reaction is that uh sorry I should probably take this it's my sister which
[2092.74 → 2101.78] yes yep yep yep what's going on I would also recommend going yeah um so i my immediate come
[2101.78 → 2106.66] on Dennis my immediate knee-jerk reaction is that I don't care at all because cell phone recordings at
[2106.66 → 2112.10] shows are stupid what we're talking about right now is apple has been granted a patent that can prevent
[2112.10 → 2119.22] iPhones from recording concerts oh what do you think how do they prevent that I'm not in i
[2119.22 → 2126.10] actually have no idea one second an infrared emitter can be located near an object and generate infrared
[2126.10 → 2132.50] signals with encoded data that includes oh so up on stage or something oh they would blast out
[2132.50 → 2141.38] infrared yeah you like that I hate people Snapchat yeah entire concert yeah one thing once the Snapchat gets
[2141.38 → 2147.22] out you can't hear anyway because it's just like yeah yeah oh if you snatch have two
[2147.22 → 2154.90] stories of this concert is fine but if you snatch entire storage that's not good yeah all right yeah
[2154.90 → 2162.10] I mean you can sit on the show if you want to go ahead okay I'm going to finish this topic um I think
[2163.70 → 2169.86] I think this they have right they have like copyright thing right you cannot record a lot of concert that
[2169.86 → 2175.78] you're not allowed to record I don't know in here in Taiwan that's and like even outside of it because
[2175.78 → 2181.22] I agree and that makes sense and if I was hosting a concert I would want people to just go instead of
[2181.22 → 2186.82] just watching and recording so I get that but even just like people standing there like this yeah recording
[2186.82 → 2193.30] with their phones being obnoxious and super annoying and like getting videos from people that are like
[2193.30 → 2198.18] yeah okay this is even you record it when are you going to look at it again you're never going
[2198.18 → 2202.90] to watch that again you can't hear the music properly like it's going to be blown out because
[2202.90 → 2209.94] all the lasers and lights yeah I don't mind they do that taking pictures or anything before the concert
[2209.94 → 2215.94] actually start I think still pictures are probably fine yeah but if you want just like one memento of
[2215.94 → 2223.14] like this is cool click or like selfie yeah or something but like no selfie stick though no selfie
[2223.14 → 2228.26] stick that's that might be better because then your arms aren't way up no that's too annoying it's very
[2228.82 → 2234.50] crowded and takes up too much space yeah yeah yeah okay I was thinking if they go like straight up
[2234.50 → 2241.14] no even some places in Japan they banned them yeah yeah Disneyland did too yeah yeah it's too
[2241.14 → 2250.34] dangerous yeah apparently there's more positive uses for the technology as in museums um
[2253.14 → 2258.26] oh that could be cool, so museums could use it differently while you're trying to take a photo
[2258.26 → 2262.74] of something they could display relevant information about it that's cool that could be pretty sweet is
[2262.74 → 2270.98] that what's oh I'm not sure if it sounds like there's too much potential for misuse though because
[2270.98 → 2276.26] if they can display things on the screen about what you're pointing the camera at in a museum
[2276.26 → 2280.18] could someone not use it to just put black over your screen so you can't see what you're trying to
[2280.18 → 2290.10] film or record you mean when they are in the museum no like in as a civilian I feel like someone could
[2290.10 → 2297.22] use this to like oh to see your stuff to no to like block people from taking photos or different things
[2297.22 → 2302.18] when theoretically you're allowed filming or taking photos of whatever you want on public property
[2302.74 → 2308.34] someone could try to block you from doing so by using this exact same technology am I being like way
[2308.34 → 2315.70] too tinfoil Hattie I don't know what you're talking about that's I are blasting a license plate number yeah
[2315.70 → 2321.70] like someone's saying if you had like the museum thing right yeah so if I try to take a photo of my wallet
[2321.70 → 2328.82] yeah I'm at the museum and my wallet is somehow important even though it's really not um it is says
[2328.82 → 2334.50] on screen this was so-and-so's wallet he got it here and used it in the great battle of buying
[2334.50 → 2342.26] things at Walmart um that's kind of interesting was it on Black Friday probably yeah that's funny and
[2342.26 → 2348.74] relevant um you could see if say this is someone's license plate they could have the same technology
[2348.74 → 2352.10] blasting so when you try to take a picture or video of their license plate it's just black
[2353.54 → 2355.22] or it covers your screen with something
[2359.54 → 2363.62] I could be way too tinfoil Hattie that's probably I don't know that situation
[2365.38 → 2371.22] but I agree with that um they that's a cool thing if they use that in their concert or
[2371.22 → 2382.66] maybe some meeting is like um it's a confidential okay that'd be cool if
[2383.22 → 2389.46] people try to record things it's like if we try to do like a factory tour and if we have that
[2389.46 → 2397.06] technology in our office no prank then no pranks I'm sure you'd appreciate that then you can't get
[2397.06 → 2403.94] Burke back though oh we can do outside the office okay yeah at your house are you saying we can prank
[2403.94 → 2410.66] you at your house no I'm moving oh right actually that's not funny um
[2414.66 → 2422.26] oh do you know those channels uh mainly in Asia where you can watch someone eat oh yeah yeah stream
[2422.26 → 2428.74] twitch is allowing that now they banned that before yeah they did why before um they didn't have a
[2428.74 → 2434.26] section for it twitch likes having a section for different things so they now added a category called
[2434.26 → 2440.98] social eating it sits along other non-gaming categories like twitch creative I've
[2440.98 → 2444.66] actually used a fair amount I don't know if I'm going to use social eating, although people have
[2444.66 → 2452.02] commented that a lot of times and a section called life of life yeah social eating is weird
[2452.02 → 2458.50] what I don't know what that term what does that term mean social eating but the the the Asian
[2458.50 → 2463.86] streams where they just eat on camera is social eating you're eating, and you're you're you're talking
[2463.86 → 2470.34] to the people social media eating eating show yeah sure I mean if you can have a cooking
[2470.34 → 2476.34] show you should be able to have an eating show right yeah but if you can eat you can also have a
[2476.98 → 2483.46] different washing show you want a washroom show I'm sure they have that because you this is what
[2483.46 → 2490.02] that's your logic Linus so you just get to the next step when you get rid of the food
[2490.02 → 2493.70] so when you make the food when you consume the food, and then you get rid of the food okay, but we know
[2493.70 → 2499.22] you want the full circle we know that twitch has um nudity guidelines so if you were going to have a
[2499.22 → 2505.38] washroom show it would have to be what like neck up and just facial expressions you can have your
[2505.38 → 2510.90] shirt on yeah you can have your shirt on when you're on the toilet so like like waist like
[2510.90 → 2519.38] median just above yeah here, here like right there okay oh that makes sense no one's going to watch that
[2520.02 → 2526.90] is there oh I'm pretty sure someone would watch that yeah is there any like obscenity problems I don't I
[2526.90 → 2533.70] don't think so I mean it's a natural thing you know going to the bathroom it's very natural okay
[2533.70 → 2537.30] but sex is also natural sex is well it can be pretty unnatural
[2541.46 → 2551.78] right okay fair speaking of twitch streams for going to the washroom android n is called
[2551.78 → 2557.94] nougat um android 7.0 nougat here I'm going to jump in okay thank you Dennis because i have to do our
[2557.94 → 2566.50] sponsor spots yes done to the response before nougat yes first sponsors than nougat okay all right
[2567.38 → 2578.50] so the new site that you might get what the new site that you might get new get oh
[2578.50 → 2586.90] oh that's awful yeah uh might be on Squarespace they've got 24 7 support via live chat and email
[2586.90 → 2591.94] they feature responsive design and all of their templates which means your website looks great on
[2591.94 → 2596.82] any device they've got commerce built into every website so you can create a free online store
[2596.82 → 2602.10] they've got their cover pages feature which lets you have like a one-page online presence if you're a
[2602.66 → 2605.70] web 2.0 company, and you think that more pages isn't cool
[2605.70 → 2611.06] I'm personally not a fan but if you must have that kind of site then I guess Squarespace can do
[2611.06 → 2617.30] that for you, and they've got lots of other tools too everything from their easy inline text editing to
[2617.30 → 2623.14] their just kind of move things around move pictures around interface to the fact that it's all cloud-based
[2623.14 → 2628.66] and finally to their logo creator and I'm sure there's a million things that I'm not thinking of but
[2628.66 → 2635.22] basically it makes it easy to make a website your website will be uh reliable the only time
[2635.22 → 2641.06] ours has gone down was entirely caused by someone else not Squarespace that's for sure and technically
[2641.06 → 2647.54] the site didn't go down you just couldn't find it that's true if you had gone to the IP directly
[2648.18 → 2653.86] then that would have worked just fine actually now that you bring that up yeah so Squarespace did
[2653.86 → 2658.34] nothing wrong nope um you can start a trial with no credit card required and start building your
[2658.34 → 2664.02] website today and everyone can now publish content in Apple news format directly from their Squarespace
[2664.02 → 2670.90] blog making it available to millions of potential readers though I mean if is is you're blogging about
[2670.90 → 2679.54] like your washroom streaming show then actually yeah there's probably millions of potential viewers
[2679.54 → 2684.98] for that okay fine so when you decide when you just oh when you just
[2689.22 → 2694.50] everything is awful right now uh when you decide to sing up for Squarespace make sure you use offer code
[2694.50 → 2700.50] when so you can save 10 on your first purchase thanks to Squarespace for supporting the wand show
[2700.50 → 2703.86] you should keep doing it so we can build our show beautiful
[2708.18 → 2716.66] I like it Nick's not here to yell at me anyway yeah all right away what have we got for our next uh
[2716.66 → 2727.46] next topic here uh well uh nougat right android n the n word nougat yeah
[2727.46 → 2738.10] uh the original article here is from android police let's go ahead and oh you did it you beat me to the
[2738.10 → 2743.30] punch huh I was gonna I was going to do it I was just like I was in I'm not here with Luke because he's
[2743.30 → 2749.14] away last week mode and lots of other weeks and lots of other weeks android n is now officially nougat
[2749.14 → 2757.14] nougat yeah um I really wanted them to make it name CNAME face did you see the one that got like voted the
[2757.14 → 2764.02] most or something I did it just it they put it in like a teaser trailer and I was like just do it I know you do
[2764.02 → 2770.82] your candy thing but like it's funny and if it's cool I actually think nougat has got to be like the
[2770.82 → 2778.90] the worst it's pretty boring and do people even know what it is blocks like do people even know
[2778.90 → 2784.42] what nougat is like I know what nougat is only because I love tuberoses that is the only reason
[2784.42 → 2791.54] I know what nougat is I know what nougat is probably because my mom likes it I believe someone that i
[2791.54 → 2795.62] know has liked it a lot I think it might have been my mom it could have been someone else I don't know
[2795.62 → 2803.14] and tuberoses are awesome they're just too expensive yeah so Nanaimo bar what else well
[2803.14 → 2808.90] Nanaimo but remember I think that's sort of more relevant to us because we live near like is that
[2808.90 → 2813.54] the origin of Nanaimo bar or is it a thing uh I don't know if that's the origin of Nanaimo bar or
[2813.54 → 2819.94] not but I know it's not just a Canadian thing like Nanaimo bars are they're pretty cool okay let's find
[2819.94 → 2824.10] out the origin because if it's like a local thing yeah and from Nanaimo the name of a city in the
[2824.10 → 2828.02] Canadian province of British Columbia so I don't think I think that's probably worse than nougat
[2828.02 → 2833.14] okay can we do a poll to see if people know what Nanaimo bars are sure because I feel like they're
[2833.14 → 2838.98] pretty big let's not say if they know what they are let's hit a poll if they've tried one okay yeah
[2838.98 → 2848.34] cool I like that okay that makes sense let's do it so have you tried a Nanaimo bar see look spell
[2848.34 → 2853.70] check didn't even recognize it that's not a good sign no and don't worry we are going to get back to
[2853.70 → 2858.50] that twitter blitz uh hopefully if we can find all the i just I feel like it's a bigger thing
[2858.50 → 2865.62] it might not be I could definitely be wrong kind of lived here forever and stuff yeah so it's hard
[2865.62 → 2871.30] for us to really say but let's go ahead and try and think of what some of the other uh I mean there's
[2871.30 → 2879.46] not a lot of wow yeahs there you go get rest son all right cool they're not very good quite frankly
[2879.46 → 2885.70] I think they're gross so you're not really missing they're very strong yeah my mom loves them yeah
[2886.66 → 2893.46] absolutely yeah i I think we just got told here that the results are clear all right thank you
[2893.46 → 2898.18] everyone that's enough although at the same time how many like little pastry cake style thingy
[2898.18 → 2909.38] majigs have different people tried probably some you know yeah um okay so let's go ahead like what
[2909.38 → 2914.50] what were the other options here even because i I remember hearing nougat and I remember also
[2914.50 → 2921.14] hearing some ones that were better nerds' oh yeah that that's a that's a company thing that's terrible
[2921.14 → 2929.62] uh nut roll Nutella okay I could have gotten behind Nutella isn't Nutella is that a brand thing
[2929.62 → 2934.02] it's a brand thing isn't if it is oh they also did KitKat yeah, but they did KitKat, and they reached
[2934.02 → 2939.78] to deal with nestle this was one of the suggestions android nestle crunch uh this list is coming from
[2939.78 → 2949.06] android over here that's cheating that's like saying that's like if it was h, and it's like android Honda Civic no
[2949.06 → 2962.02] android napoleon yeah android noodle pudding oh greenish tart android NATO par yeah they're all awful
[2962.66 → 2970.98] they're just all terrible yeah android I'm on Wikipedia under list of desserts and I'm going through all the
[2970.98 → 2977.86] different categories and looking what they have for n control f oh what's that non-event I've never
[2977.86 → 2985.54] it sounds like another Canadian thing to be honest Nam Kang SAI yeah that doesn't sound Canadian
[2985.54 → 2987.06] unless it's like in Richmond
[2989.94 → 2992.34] nun's puffs wow nun's puffs
[2992.98 → 3004.26] that nut roll yeah not roll that that one was there wow is n just not like uh not a delicious
[3004.26 → 3007.54] sounding first letter or something I don't get it
[3009.94 → 3018.10] well there you go huh go figure all right yeah there's like really not much let's go have a look
[3018.10 → 3023.94] at that uh let's go have a look at that twitter blitz that we were uh oh they probably should have come to
[3023.94 → 3029.14] an um agreement with Nutella
[3032.02 → 3036.82] oh crap did you just do that again no, no no, no no there we go okay
[3039.22 → 3045.62] no, no no, no sorry I'm not I'm not operating it's all good I just wanted to make sure you didn't do that
[3045.62 → 3051.78] no because if you did, i was going to be like all right you need to blitz and fix it again and I'll keep
[3051.78 → 3061.54] doing whatever um hold on I need a minute all good Florida man um who at this point has probably been
[3061.54 → 3067.94] in jail for an obscenely long time, and it was a lot of money um has florida man yeah you
[3067.94 → 3073.30] don't know that thing no there's a Subreddit called Florida man okay whenever you hear like
[3073.30 → 3079.38] crazy complete idiots whenever you hear crazy news yeah it seems to be like Florida man dies
[3079.38 → 3084.02] after threatening an alligator with a chocolate bar like just like crazy stuff it seems to end with
[3084.02 → 3089.46] like or start with like Florida man oh it's just like so it's not a specific person man from Florida
[3089.46 → 3097.38] yeah Florida but how the news does it Florida man anyway Florida man sues apple for 10 billion U.S.
[3097.38 → 3107.70] dollars what says he invented the iPhone in 1992. Uh yeah there's a gizmodo article
[3108.50 → 3116.10] there's also a comparison picture which is fantastic um that is his drawing oh hold on i have to i have to
[3116.10 → 3125.46] bring this up hold on okay, okay sorry florida florida man for 10 billion dollars
[3125.46 → 3133.54] dollars he wants okay so here's the comparison picture here we go the iPhone according to Florida man
[3134.58 → 3145.46] the iPhone according to apple so I mean at what point does gene Roddenberry start selling people or
[3145.46 → 3154.18] start suing people for inventing things and like or george lucas I mean when someone releases a lightsabre
[3154.18 → 3160.90] actually you know what's your knowing what's kind of crazy is Disney probably would be on that
[3162.82 → 3168.42] what if someone created a lightsabre do you think Disney would try to claim that they own
[3168.42 → 3173.70] all the applicable rights like a real life lightsabre yes I feel like if they tried to call it a lightsabre
[3173.70 → 3180.34] then they'd have a problem but creating a theoretical fantasy depiction of something I don't think
[3180.34 → 3186.74] gives you the rights to its actuality I think if that was a problem but could they make the argument
[3186.74 → 3194.90] that it is so culturally pervasive that the inspiration would have had to come from Star Wars
[3196.10 → 3202.74] I think once we got to the point where we could make something that was like that powerful based on
[3202.74 → 3207.30] mostly like light I don't remember how it works in the Star Wars universe what is it exactly it's an
[3207.30 → 3214.02] energy energy energy right um so it's basically a laser a crystalline thing that is emitting energy
[3214.02 → 3219.54] which is somewhat like a laser but only goes out a little bit and has obscene amounts of power but
[3219.54 → 3225.54] only goes to like a point that looks like a sword once we get to the point that we can do that I don't
[3225.54 → 3232.74] even know Star Wars will still be relevant, or maybe it's all going to be like galaxy quest all over again
[3232.74 → 3241.54] and we'll think that they're historical documents yeah yeah yeah rewatched that recently still very
[3241.54 → 3251.14] good I love that I've actually heard that yeah oh man that sucks sorry oh um anyway I haven't
[3251.14 → 3255.30] rewatched it in a long time but I've heard from a lot of people that whenever they rewatch galaxy
[3255.30 → 3261.46] quest they're like holy crap this movie's awesome it's still just as good it is equally relevant um
[3261.46 → 3268.74] um yeah it's its not that often that you get a movie that that ages that well because nerds are
[3268.74 → 3276.58] still exactly the same as in 1994 or whenever that movie came out I think it was actually a little
[3276.58 → 3285.30] later than that quest uh 2000 no it couldn't have been 2008 that doesn't make any sense maybe it came
[3285.30 → 3295.14] on DVD then 1999 1999 wow it is pretty old holy crap so in 17 years nerds have not progressed at all
[3295.14 → 3299.94] not to mention the movie was probably being written a couple of years before it was actually you know so
[3299.94 → 3306.58] then it was you filming, and it's like in 20 years yeah yeah not a thing I think you can see that um
[3306.58 → 3313.70] um okay let's see wow we've actually covered a lot of the lot of the best topics for today already
[3313.70 → 3320.50] um oh yeah the Marx 480 is a thing but like we have a video on that so another thing to add to
[3320.50 → 3327.22] the Florida man thing um yes the U.S. patent and trademark office declared the application abandoned
[3327.22 → 3333.54] in 1995. wow, I've been screen sharing for a while again great I'm just really like not on did you do
[3333.54 → 3340.98] anything crazy I don't think so okay cool um so yeah there was that um it is also like if you scroll
[3340.98 → 3349.22] down a little bit he had one where it's like basically a book, and it like closes yeah okay so i
[3349.22 → 3356.74] think there's like writer and reader mode okay so it looks more like phone antenna speaker optional
[3356.74 → 3364.82] solar cells, so basically this is just like the scribblings of uh of a dreamer yeah he's like
[3364.82 → 3371.22] what's a cool thing I'm going to put it in here awesome three and a half inch diskette drive
[3372.26 → 3377.14] how big is it supposed to be it's five inches by three how is he planning to put a three in it
[3378.18 → 3383.14] what how's he planning to put a three and a half inch diskette drive in a five and a half inch
[3383.14 → 3388.98] and how big is this so that's three and three quarters chargeable battery is here that's where
[3388.98 → 3395.38] the rechargeable battery is page forward is here uh numeric so the whole typewriter keyboard with
[3395.38 → 3399.46] the space bar that big is in half an inch because it's five and a half inches right no five and five
[3399.46 → 3405.54] inches to here by three oh yeah no well it looks maybe an inch let's let's say an inch wow it's really
[3405.54 → 3416.50] small okay features each device 80386 so processor 16 megahertz 80 megabyte hard drive writing devices
[3417.06 → 3429.78] 160 megabyte d ram reading device options either a or b uh calendar slash clock typewriter slash
[3429.78 → 3439.62] keyboard magnetic latch that's a good idea oh more solar cells backlit LCD super twist display screen
[3439.62 → 3449.62] monochrome or colour okay all right okay, okay okay well good luck with that buddy
[3453.46 → 3459.62] good old Florida man you know it would be kind of fun if the iPhone had an 80 megabyte hard drive
[3459.78 → 3467.06] and two megabytes of ram and a 16 megahertz processor that sounds like the iPhone
[3470.74 → 3477.70] what's the next topic I don't know I don't really know if I see much, much else here oh uh this is just
[3477.70 → 3489.62] a quick one Samsung has a one terabyte m.2 NVMe SSD the SM 961 so uh right now it's a SM 961
[3489.78 → 3497.46] so that's an oem product Tom's hardware has a review up, but it is speculated that this would be
[3497.46 → 3505.06] uh this will be rebadged as some kind of a some nine something pro at some point here so maybe a
[3505.06 → 3513.62] 960 pro or something along those lines very, very interesting it's like wicked fast like what what what
[3513.62 → 3522.74] one terabyte at 512 bucks and 512 gigs at 280 bucks is pretty cool that's pretty cool I mean one
[3523.38 → 3531.22] honestly 480 gigs to 512 gigs is the SSD size where I really don't feel limited by it anymore yeah
[3531.86 → 3539.22] um I'm pretty comfortable with 256 still unless it's a gaming machine but if it's a gaming machine I want
[3539.22 → 3545.30] my 500 I want my 500 gigs, but one terabyte is at the point where I feel like I can be like a data
[3545.30 → 3549.70] pack rat and I don't really have to clean up any after myself any more yep not quite with the amount
[3549.70 → 3558.50] I have a NAS yeah my only thing is you said gaming machine and game load times can still be nicer yeah
[3558.50 → 3565.86] but I don't mind putting up games that aren't important like Lego batman is on a hard drive yeah
[3565.86 → 3569.94] yeah yeah just have a couple steam libraries there's no real reason not to do that it's very
[3569.94 → 3574.98] easy actually yeah I made a video on it, I think it just came out this SSD hard drive optimization
[3574.98 → 3580.66] thing it's really easy to have steam have different save locations, and it'll ask you every time it's
[3580.66 → 3590.82] it's actually really nice um there's where is it uh Activision issues DMCA takedown against developers of
[3590.82 → 3595.78] Orion prelude and then there's comparison images in there that you have to check out I'll post
[3595.78 → 3602.42] the steam article but check out the comparison images here I think the bottom one might be the best
[3604.18 → 3605.06] yeah yeah
[3607.70 → 3608.02] um
[3610.74 → 3616.58] yeah wait sorry, so this is supposed to prove yeah that Orion ripped off black ops yeah
[3616.58 → 3627.06] so uh apparently it was taken down from the steam stores due to the DMCA request it is now back
[3627.06 → 3634.02] in the steam stores um the official quote says on behalf of Activision who alleges that the game Orion
[3634.02 → 3640.42] used weapon art content from Call of Duty black ops 3 and Call of Duty advanced warfare the weapon art in
[3640.42 → 3646.90] question includes the m8 a7 rifle the haymaker rifle and the BAL 27 rifle
[3651.54 → 3651.78] what
[3654.98 → 3660.26] uh the developers of Orion prelude were not contacted or notified before their game was removed from steam
[3660.26 → 3671.54] at all wow that's pretty brutal um a Reddit post on RPC master race goes into how the DMCA claim may be
[3671.54 → 3677.54] legitimate and apparently some of the main uh points are addressed that parts of the 3d models are
[3677.54 → 3685.94] apparently exactly the same so if you click on that one um yeah let me bring up the uh the thingamabob be
[3685.94 → 3691.14] here
[3692.26 → 3696.90] that is actually a more interesting look at it because that's actually how you hold the gun in the game
[3696.90 → 3701.46] so the images that were given up were of side isolated models that you don't really see in the
[3701.46 → 3703.94] game this is more when you're holding the firearm
[3706.34 → 3707.22] at the same time
[3707.22 → 3715.94] the red dot site is more telling me than the iron site because like the little area with the
[3715.94 → 3727.38] lights on it uh here and here yeah are actually just like a button panel and that could be taken from
[3727.38 → 3734.18] some other gun I'm not sure um and iron sights are pretty generic and the side of that gun looks pretty
[3734.18 → 3743.06] generic um the red dot site on the right which they can't see I'm sorry about that oh sorry um also
[3743.06 → 3752.18] looks a little generic but i kind of see where they're probably coming from okay all right well
[3752.18 → 3758.26] we'll see how this plays out I'm not going to be the uh I'm not going to be the judge on this one yeah I don't
[3758.26 → 3762.58] really know I don't know how that legally plays in I think we'd both need to know a lot more about
[3762.58 → 3768.98] different rifles like if that red dot site was taken from like something in real life then who
[3768.98 → 3776.58] cares right uh there are more rumors so uh original article here is Nintendo inquirer.com more rumours
[3776.58 → 3785.46] that the no will be cartridge based wow blast from the past possibly a good move to be perfect I think
[3785.46 → 3790.82] that's kind of cool I might be the weird one there I mean i I don't see I've been wondering why
[3791.62 → 3798.10] media doesn't come on SD cards for a long time like a really long time well not I've been wondering i
[3798.10 → 3803.14] understand why it's because they're cheap it's because the companies that sell this stuff to us
[3803.14 → 3809.78] don't want to spend another you know 82 cents on uh on the media that they're giving us they'd rather
[3809.78 → 3817.22] have something that costs 82 cents less a disc um but basically in the final months before it's formally
[3817.22 → 3822.98] unveiled blah blah blah blah blah blah admitted hoax etc etc etc, but there's been it looks like a
[3822.98 → 3831.38] trademark apply um hold on so Eógan user ethereous noticed something in Nintendo us's trademark for the
[3831.38 → 3836.98] Legend of Zelda breath of the wild user goods and services section both video game discs and video game
[3836.98 → 3844.90] cartridges are listed this contrasts with other Wii U software trademarks so it could be Nintendo's just
[3844.90 → 3849.54] just updating their verbiage so that they can use the same thing for our portable games which
[3849.54 → 3856.66] already use cartridges and um full-size console games but I choose to believe that we're going to
[3856.66 → 3861.62] have a cartridge-based console again that would be cool which would mean Nintendo only ever had
[3861.62 → 3869.46] three disc-based consoles then yeah uh and again so has Sony for that matter so has Microsoft
[3869.46 → 3876.02] so there you go right the game cube I always forget about the game yeah the game cube was a thing just
[3876.02 → 3880.98] because no one cared doesn't mean that it wasn't a thing it's the I didn't have a n's when I was a
[3880.98 → 3887.22] kid um I had friends that had them we just didn't have one so I had a Newton n64 that I never had a
[3887.22 → 3894.26] game cube and then I like very luckily got a Wii pretty early on and then I have my Wii U so i just
[3894.26 → 3900.50] completely skipped that whole segment all right let's go ahead and uh fire up twitter over there
[3900.50 → 3905.38] I don't even know if it yeah it's not really set up any more we don't really use it that often lets
[3905.38 → 3913.54] just go ahead and boopity right about there oh, oh that did not work oh that was supposed to work
[3913.54 → 3928.66] uh add screen capture um okay let's see if that works this day no okay well then I will just I will
[3928.66 → 3938.10] just read tweets um oh uh I've had this problem before i I think it might be that browser um but what
[3938.10 → 3943.06] you do is minimize the browser highlight the area where it is brought the browser back up, and it works
[3943.06 → 3951.38] oh what a chore I know it's super annoying I don't know if it's exploit or if it's the browser or what
[3951.38 → 3952.82] kind of guess it's like bearish
[3957.30 → 3965.62] oh yeah this is my pain I had to do it during the charity stream that I did was super annoying
[3965.62 → 3977.62] good enough all right uh bring back Dennis cheer up you two you both slowed down today well we've
[3977.62 → 3983.22] both had kind of rough weeks uh twitch bot is timing everyone out for using the uptime command is this
[3983.22 → 3992.10] intentional I don't know I wanted Nutella hail poodles uh I'm just glad the media didn't make as big of a deal
[3992.10 → 3998.26] as it as they usually do um yeah I think there's still time for them to do that
[4002.42 → 4006.58] you need some tech tips JK just did a little love land show
[4008.90 → 4015.62] oh we've got people commenting on my uh on my leak there that's okay all that information is completely
[4015.62 → 4022.26] out of date now which is perfect yep yay for doing things quickly whoa you get over the border
[4022.26 → 4034.10] easily what um still safer than 100 people on the road yep so that's a good point oh yeah so a lot of
[4034.10 → 4043.06] oh I don't like autopilot I like to drive by myself all right yeah yeah see jams says my uncle's model s
[4043.06 → 4048.02] tells you to constantly keep your hands on the wheel yep that's what it's supposed to do time
[4048.02 → 4055.46] magnets how do they work would you consider buying an autonomous car and yeah no I would too expensive
[4055.46 → 4063.30] well okay right other than that I would consider it fair I yes okay I would as well and then I would go
[4063.30 → 4067.30] it is too expensive and then I would stop considering it okay let's bring up the uh let's bring up the
[4067.30 → 4075.78] straw poll results since it seems like that pretty much tells us the answer here 74 of you are still
[4075.78 → 4082.42] comfortable with autonomous vehicles in spite of the death well you're talking to nerds um nerds are
[4082.42 → 4090.58] probably down with math I prefer to call them a tech-savvy audience nerd I know I think it's okay when
[4090.58 → 4096.58] you call yourself the thing anyway um they're probably more down with numbers and statistics and blah blah
[4096.58 → 4101.86] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, and they're seeing mathematically it is better so they're going
[4101.86 → 4107.22] okay mathematically it's better until we have a bigger sample size, and maybe it's not better anymore
[4107.22 → 4112.90] that's also true I mean we could have another death tomorrow and all of a sudden that would make it uh
[4113.70 → 4120.98] as much worse than people operating vehicles as now it is better and there's also the thing that I've
[4120.98 → 4130.26] been saying from the start yeah um which is what I'm afraid of is uh it's potentially going haywire instead
[4130.26 → 4135.46] of just not detecting something driving through it and crashing right it going nuts um
[4137.54 → 4146.98] that's scary because a human driver unless can go haywire can yeah they can go haywire unless
[4146.98 → 4154.18] malicious isn't going to like if they crash into something I don't know like because that's going
[4154.18 → 4161.54] to cause the brig the big media problem oh like if one just spaces out because one decides to go
[4161.54 → 4167.38] the driver's life and the pedestrian's life yeah that kind of stuff and yeah and there's a valid problem
[4167.38 → 4174.18] there which is if someone goes nuts and drives over a bunch of people yeah you put them in jail yeah
[4175.06 → 4179.30] if an AI goes nuts and drives over a bunch of people you go oh my god this thing is installed
[4179.30 → 4187.22] in everything yeah what do we do yeah and that's a valid question all right, so thank you guys for
[4187.22 → 4191.62] tuning into the wan show we hope you enjoyed the show as much as we did this week actually it was kind
[4191.62 → 4197.62] of a nice distraction today um although actually for a lot of today I was working on a really cool
[4197.62 → 4207.06] project uh I am calling this project the most comfortable gaming setup ever and Luke thought i
[4207.06 → 4213.30] was like what did you think I was doing with this uh I thought he was trolling i i I thought that you
[4213.30 → 4222.50] were uh how much can I describe it um I haven't disclosed what makes it comfortable yet I have owned so here so i
[4222.50 → 4229.30] have tweeted uh pictures of the room okay so I've tweeted okay this so that room is tiny I've
[4229.30 → 4236.42] been in there I've tried to stand in there etc it's small and like kind of cramped yeah exactly so
[4236.42 → 4243.78] I've I've experienced the room so when he says the most comfortable gaming room ever and I know the
[4243.78 → 4248.74] back cramping that I had to do in order to get in there my mind is going he's going to shove a whole
[4248.74 → 4252.74] bunch of tech in there because he's told me what he's shoving in there, and it's going to be way too
[4252.74 → 4257.14] much, and he's going to be cramped, and he's going to make like a funny video about how he just had to
[4257.14 → 4260.66] have all these things so he made it work that's what I thought the plan was I thought it was going to
[4260.66 → 4268.02] be a funny video no it's going to be a badass video yeah all right so we will see you guys again next week
