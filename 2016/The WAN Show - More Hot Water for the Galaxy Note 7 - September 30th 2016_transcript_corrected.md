[0.00 → 7.88] Okay, I believe we're live. Welcome to the WAN show. Am I streaming on the right one? Yes, I hope so.
[8.38 → 16.04] So, I know, I know, we are about as late as we've ever been, and I did promise that the new streaming
[16.04 → 22.94] equipment, video capture equipment, would help significantly with that. But there is also a reason
[22.94 → 30.90] why we haven't done our official, like, the WAN show set was updated video yet, and that is because
[30.90 → 37.14] we haven't really done anything about our audio situation yet. We definitely need some kind of
[37.14 → 43.72] piece of dedicated mixer hardware. That will definitely happen at some point, but basically
[43.72 → 51.04] in a nutshell, I was super loud. Luke was super quiet. He's Skyping in from Twitch Con right now.
[51.04 → 57.38] The little, like, volume thing in the corner, you know, the bling thing was crazy quiet.
[58.36 → 65.18] The playing back videos that we recorded from last week were crazy loud, and then playing back videos
[65.18 → 73.08] we were test recording just now was, like, normal. And then apparently it's all normal, and we spent a
[73.08 → 77.40] bunch of time diagnosing something that wasn't a problem, other than that our system audio is
[77.40 → 84.12] infected by gremlins on the streaming computer, which shouldn't surprise anybody. Are you surprised, Luke?
[84.72 → 86.16] Sorry. I'm not very surprised.
[86.22 → 90.40] This is so funny. I look towards my webcam in your picture, but actually I should be looking over here.
[90.96 → 91.52] Hi, Luke.
[92.36 → 95.04] Hello. How's it going? You have a very nice hat.
[95.30 → 95.76] Thank you.
[95.78 → 96.32] Do you want to explain your hat?
[96.32 → 105.22] Oh, yes. I was working on my PlayStation 4, like, my PlayStation 4 water-cooled project.
[105.52 → 108.32] That is hardly my project at this point, because Jake did most of the work.
[108.84 → 118.20] But basically my intro involves a rant about the PlayStation 4 Pro, and how, like, if I had to upgrade
[118.20 → 126.80] my PlayStation 4 and spend $400 every three years to get better graphics, well, that's starting to sound
[126.80 → 131.22] an awful lot like being a PC gamer, isn't it? Anyway, the rant involves Doritos and Mountain Dew
[131.22 → 136.02] and this hat and anger, so it should be pretty good. It should be pretty good.
[136.40 → 141.06] Also, I saw someone in the Twitch chat saying, Linus, you should be spending time with your baby
[141.06 → 142.60] instead of being on a rant.
[143.12 → 151.58] And I would love to, except that my baby is still safely tucked away in mama's uterus,
[151.72 → 157.62] so there will be no spending time with that particular baby other than, like, kind of poking
[157.62 → 162.92] it through her stomach, which doesn't really appeal to her, nor does it really appeal to
[162.92 → 170.80] me. I have to confess, I am not that into the whole unborn babies thing. Like, you know,
[170.80 → 175.42] I'm not into the whole unborn or born babies' thing. Yeah. One step further.
[175.80 → 182.16] I mean, the thing, though, is, like, people are like, oh, it's magic. It's just as magical
[182.16 → 188.26] as an iPhone. And I'm just kind of like, you know what? I cannot get the scene from Alien
[188.26 → 192.28] out of my head. Can you tweet on a baby belly? I don't think so.
[193.44 → 197.44] Tweet on a baby belly? Yeah, okay. Oh, sorry. We're back to the iPhone comparison. Sure.
[197.44 → 201.44] But, like, some people get all, like, oh, it's the magic of, like, they want to put their
[201.44 → 207.26] hands on and, like, oh, the baby's kicking. The other night, I was, like, mostly asleep.
[207.68 → 213.88] And I had my arm over my wife, because we're adults and we're allowed to do that. And the
[213.88 → 220.96] baby kicked so hard through her stomach that I jolted awake, flipped out. I'm like, ah!
[220.96 → 228.92] And I woke her up. I am not a fan. Not a fan of baby in the tummy.
[228.94 → 229.66] So smooth.
[229.96 → 237.56] Yeah. So when the baby's out, we'll talk. And the baby will not respond because they don't
[237.56 → 244.38] speak English yet when they are born and are, therefore, not a lot of fun. Not that I'm
[244.38 → 248.04] saying people, you have to speak English to be fun. I'm just saying being able to communicate
[248.04 → 255.04] at all is super helpful. It's like, you could just say, I'm hungry, instead of, ah! Ah!
[255.70 → 264.28] Oh, my God. I got so limited sleep last night that because of one of those situations. I'm
[264.28 → 270.62] not going to add way too many details, but for way too much time is exactly what happened.
[271.28 → 271.60] Yeah.
[271.60 → 278.32] Just re-enforcing why I don't want one. Fair enough, man. All right. We should roll the
[278.32 → 281.82] intro, speaking of things that we don't want to. I do want an intro, though. Yeah, I do
[281.82 → 282.82] want an intro. Let's do that.
[282.82 → 312.54] All right.
[312.54 → 319.08] Ladies and gentlemen. So why don't we get things started with our first big topic of
[319.08 → 325.00] the day, the Galaxy Note 7. This was originally posted by Daring on the forum. The original
[325.00 → 330.32] article here is from Tech Time. Tech Time? Tech Times? The Tech Times. All right. Linus
[330.32 → 335.80] is screen share. Oh, look at that. He's still there. Ah! That's right. That's what I spent
[335.80 → 344.34] 45 minutes setting up today. At least that's my story, and I'm sticking to it. So Galaxy Note
[344.34 → 351.26] 7 replacements. They might not explode, but they might overheat and drain the battery while
[351.26 → 360.34] charging. Samsung just cannot catch a break here, can they? I would assume because the losing
[360.34 → 366.70] charge while it's charging thing is a lot. It was losing 1% of power every second. First
[366.70 → 370.68] of all, that seems a little insane. Second of all, he's probably not using a first party
[370.68 → 375.30] charger. Not that that even, like, matters. Not that it should matter. But he could be
[375.30 → 382.26] using, like, a 0.5 amp charger. Right. Something that's not made for charging notes. Still, losing
[382.26 → 387.20] 1% of power every second while charging. That's still insane. That's still, like, something's
[387.20 → 392.02] wrong. Although this was one user who was reporting this. That's, that's, I think he might be exaggerating
[392.02 → 398.24] a little bit because that's 100% to dead in under two minutes. So Samsung said this problem
[398.24 → 404.52] is completely unrelated to batteries. They haven't stated if the problem is present in units replaced
[404.52 → 408.88] in other countries aside from South Korea. So, so far, everyone who's encountered the issue
[408.88 → 414.94] has been in South Korea. And the good news is there are no reports of devices catching
[414.94 → 416.24] fire at least. Yes.
[416.24 → 421.74] So that is a small victory. A very small, inconsequential victory.
[421.74 → 430.24] On, uh, uh, in other news, it really doesn't get much better for Samsung here. Are you posting
[430.24 → 436.80] links in the chat, by the way, or am I doing that? Okay. So the next one here is from hardware.slash.dot.org
[436.80 → 442.86] or money.CNN. I'll, I'll go with slash. Wow. Slash. That's like a blast from the past. Right?
[442.86 → 448.86] I remember slash. From like 10 years ago. Apparently it still exists. So there's that.
[449.86 → 456.94] Ah, Samsung may have a new problem on their hands after the U.S. warns Samsung washing machine owners
[456.94 → 459.30] after explosion reports.
[460.54 → 463.56] There's a picture that goes along with it if you want to show that.
[463.56 → 467.54] Uh, oh yeah. Where is that? Post that picture in the chat.
[468.82 → 472.48] All right. Let me see if I can figure out that picture in the meantime here.
[473.10 → 479.18] Ah, yes. There we go. So the, the scariest part of this one is this could affect units all
[479.18 → 490.70] the way from 2011 to 2016. So here's a picture of, uh, you know, what appears to be a bowed out
[490.70 → 498.66] washing machine. Um, it's unclear right now. I mean, this is not the world's most gorgeous wall
[498.66 → 504.06] in the first place, but it's, it's unclear to me if this hole in it is a result of the washing
[504.06 → 506.34] machine plosion. Um.
[506.34 → 509.98] The picture is documented by a Texas woman who claims it exploded during use.
[509.98 → 513.30] She's part of a class action lawsuit against the company currently.
[514.66 → 515.14] Wow.
[515.70 → 521.80] Samsung currently has declined to comment on the litigation at all. Um, which is not astounding
[521.80 → 525.94] to be completely honest. With this type of claim, they would want to do investigations
[525.94 → 529.98] before trying to claim anything. So I'm not too surprised that they haven't said anything yet.
[530.52 → 534.62] Uh, but they have issued a statement that said they're talking to U.S. authorities about
[534.62 → 540.60] how to address safety problems. Um, said in the statement that in rare cases, affected
[540.60 → 546.76] units may experience abnormal vibrations that could pose a risk of personal injury or property
[546.76 → 552.44] damage when washing bedding, bulky, or water-resistant items.
[554.38 → 555.26] Womb wall.
[556.26 → 558.24] You know, the like fight club thing.
[559.52 → 563.12] The like fight club thing. I, I, I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm pretty
[563.12 → 564.58] sure you're not supposed to be talking about it.
[566.16 → 571.20] Investigating car accidents and seeing if there's been enough of a certain type per car
[571.20 → 574.16] for it to be worth doing like a recall or whatever.
[574.54 → 574.78] Yeah.
[575.24 → 579.58] I wonder if like, there's going to be like fight club too. And like pretty early on in
[579.58 → 585.16] the intro, it shows him, and he's like, I investigate phone explosions and washing machine explosions
[585.16 → 587.70] to see if it's worth doing a recall.
[587.70 → 595.02] Oh, someone's got a someone's got a parody at least at some point.
[595.02 → 595.60] That would be so awesome.
[596.06 → 600.72] At some point it's bound to happen. I mean, all Samsung needs is one more to reach that
[600.72 → 609.60] magic three number because one's a fluke, two is sketchy and three is a trend. So I mean,
[609.64 → 614.68] the problem is that Samsung makes pretty much everything. So all we need is for like a printer
[614.68 → 618.12] to explode. Although they can.
[618.14 → 620.64] Or if you're from Korea, like anything.
[621.48 → 622.86] Oh, that's right.
[623.22 → 627.90] Yeah. They make like everything there. If I remember correctly, there's like Samsung toilets
[627.90 → 630.60] and like Samsung, whatever the heck you want.
[630.70 → 634.76] We almost put a Samsung air conditioner on the roof of the building. Actually, oh, our air
[634.76 → 636.26] conditioning for the server room just went in.
[636.96 → 637.78] Oh, cool.
[637.86 → 639.48] So there you go. So that's a thing.
[639.90 → 641.14] Is that loud now?
[641.14 → 648.70] Well, it'll be just as loud until such time as I do something about the air vents that
[648.70 → 655.74] are in the door for the old ambient air cooling system. But at that time, yes, it could potentially
[655.74 → 656.46] be less loud.
[658.54 → 665.62] They're sketchy. There's a UK advertising agency named ASIA. Wow. That is investigating Hello
[665.62 → 673.88] Games, which is the No Man's Sky guys over false advertising. Mainly things like having
[673.88 → 679.84] screenshots and I believe videos. Yeah. Screenshots and videos that depict large scale combat and
[679.84 → 684.18] ship flying behaviours that didn't actually make it into the game. And I think they could go
[684.18 → 688.98] a little bit farther than that. Those are probably just they're like cemented. This is very easy to
[688.98 → 695.22] target kind of stuff because there was also a large amount of other claims that didn't end up being
[695.22 → 702.02] true at all. So, yeah, I kind of have a feeling that Hello Games is going to lose this. And I also
[702.02 → 704.34] have a feeling that the entire Internet will be OK with that.
[704.98 → 710.78] This could have a huge impact on the way that games marketing is done in the future. I mean,
[710.78 → 720.86] it is not unusual. Watch Dogs. It is not unusual to end up with a situation where a game developer
[720.86 → 730.70] shows off a trailer or, you know, some kind of concept. Star Citizen. And the finished game, though,
[730.70 → 736.70] I can't really judge Star Citizen as they haven't finished the game yet. And the finished game ends up
[736.70 → 742.70] not having those features or those levels or whatever the case may be.
[742.70 → 751.26] Like skiing in World of Warcraft. Right. And while this one, you know, looks pretty open and shut
[751.26 → 758.06] because it's fairly egregious that this, you know, large scale combat that the screenshots and videos
[758.06 → 766.62] on the page depict is not in the game. I think it would be harder to go after a situation like Watch Dogs
[766.62 → 774.54] where it is a graphical difference, because while you and me and probably everyone in the audience
[774.54 → 780.62] can very easily see the difference between the E3 demonstrations and what we actually were delivered
[780.62 → 786.06] in the end. I think it's going to be harder to argue in court because I would assume that the judge
[786.06 → 791.74] and jury wouldn't fully understand what's actually going on. Whereas if you go, look, there were big
[791.74 → 798.30] ships, and they would go pew. And now there isn't big ships that go pew. I think that's a
[798.30 → 804.22] more straightforward case. I mean, some of some of the complaints about No Man's Sky are also
[804.22 → 810.54] regarding misrepresentation of the graphical quality in the game. Right. Which is great. But I think the
[810.54 → 815.02] main ones are the functionality things, and hopefully they'll also hit them with other things as well.
[815.02 → 822.70] Hmm. So the complaints target Steam, but the ASA said that the ruling would apply to any other
[822.70 → 829.10] advertising for the game. So that could be YouTube videos and or the games listing on the PlayStation
[829.10 → 835.02] Store. This could be very interesting. I mean, as it is, game developers keep things pretty under wraps
[835.02 → 839.74] while a title's in development. But this could drive them to be even more careful. I mean, could this
[839.74 → 848.06] potentially apply to something like a demo shown at PAX? Like if I'd played Wolf Among Us, okay,
[848.06 → 854.14] is a game that it's one of the few games that I've ever demoed at PAX, just because usually the lineup
[854.14 → 859.98] at places like PAX is such that I'm just kind of like, you know what, I can either wait six months
[859.98 → 866.38] for the game to come out, or I can wait six months in this lineup. And at the end of one of those six
[866.38 → 870.54] month periods, I will get a demo. And at the end of the other one, I will get the entire game.
[871.10 → 877.26] So I think they'll have a better time getting away with that. Because that could be, I think you
[877.26 → 885.26] could pretty easily put a sign somewhere on your booth and say like, game is subject to change or some
[885.26 → 893.74] crap like that. But when it's on your store page. Yeah, okay. Well, that I, oh, go ahead. Is that the
[893.74 → 901.58] the screenshots and the videos of the stuff that they are trying to directly sell? Right. Then,
[902.70 → 907.98] ooh, how does that apply to like early access stuff? I don't know. And, and another complicated
[907.98 → 913.02] thing here too, is like, so you're going back to the, to the PAX game demos. Let's say for example,
[913.02 → 917.82] that the difference, okay, because we've seen this before in movies, right? Where the trailer will
[917.82 → 923.42] actually contain a scene that ended up getting cut. Right. Yeah. That's a thing. But there's a
[923.42 → 934.22] difference between us, haha, a cut scene. Oh, no. There's a difference between a cut scene and
[934.22 → 939.58] completely pulling core functionality out of the game. So if you're going to go, okay, yeah,
[940.14 → 946.14] our game is gratuitous space battles. And your trailer has the like a cut scene. And then it has like
[946.14 → 953.50] a two like legions of ships blasting each other. And you know, some, some cinematic is gone from the
[953.50 → 960.86] completed game versus like, you can only fly two on two. Uh, that, those are very different things.
[960.86 → 966.22] So in something like a PAX demo, if they were to say, okay, yeah, our game is like a top down,
[966.22 → 972.94] you know, uh, platformer. And then someone sees that, that is marketing. So if someone sees that,
[972.94 → 977.42] tries that game, and it turns out to be a racing, like a mobile racing game or something like that,
[977.42 → 981.58] then it, I guess it, it becomes a gray area and a question of just how misleading it was.
[983.66 → 989.42] What happens too, if that communication comes through game journalists?
[991.26 → 998.54] Like say, say someone goes to a show, and it's not an interview, and they play the game and they
[998.54 → 1001.82] describe their experience and everything that they described in their experience
[1003.18 → 1008.78] that could be seen as a form of marketing. And then if that's not actually how it ends up going.
[1011.18 → 1015.18] Hard to say because unless they pay the game's journalists and the game's journalists opinions
[1015.18 → 1019.58] are their own. Then that's not officially right. Okay. Yeah. But what if,
[1019.58 → 1028.14] it's still kind of an interesting area because if you're going like this game has battles in it
[1028.14 → 1036.62] that have 400 ships versus 400 ships. Yep. That's stated as a fact. Yep. That's not like this game
[1036.62 → 1045.02] has battles with a lot of ships and then the game journalists version of a lot is four. I don't know.
[1045.02 → 1050.30] That's true. I mean, I really want to see how this plays out. Another thing I want to see how it plays
[1050.30 → 1057.90] out is Twitch news. Twitch announces Twitch Prime. I think we've already seen how this played out.
[1057.90 → 1065.26] Actually, there is an insane amount of subs randomly on the Linus Tech channel. Oh, really?
[1065.26 → 1069.26] And like this whole stream I've been watching Twitch chat and every once in a while you'll see like,
[1069.26 → 1074.94] has just subscribed with Twitch Prime. So what Twitch Prime is to kind of help people out a little
[1074.94 → 1080.94] bit is Amazon Prime now has a component under it called Twitch Prime that doesn't cost any amount
[1080.94 → 1088.22] more money. You get it when you have Amazon Prime. It gives you one subscribe per month to a channel.
[1088.22 → 1092.94] I believe you can like to move it around, but you only have one. So you'd be able to switch it once a month,
[1092.94 → 1100.70] I believe. You get some extra prizes. I think they said swag in Hearthstone and Smite,
[1100.70 → 1105.98] although I'm not sure what that swag exactly is. I think they were talking about getting certain
[1105.98 → 1112.70] games on launch and then discounts on physical copies of games from Amazon. Now I checked that out
[1112.70 → 1117.98] and literally every single game that I was able to find that was discounted because of being a Prime
[1117.98 → 1127.02] member was discounted by 3 to 10 cents. Whoa! All right, rock on! Hopefully that changes or something.
[1127.02 → 1135.26] But I could-No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Luke, I could get it shipped for free. Yeah. There you go.
[1135.26 → 1139.50] You also get a badge, which is like a little blue crown. You can see a bunch of people in the chat right
[1139.50 → 1144.22] now have little blue crowns. I guess the YouTube GOD won't be able to see that, but I just described it.
[1144.22 → 1147.66] So- Oh, well, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I got this. I got this. Furthermore, I got this. Furthermore, I got this.
[1147.66 → 1154.38] Linus is green. There. Blue crowns. Blue crowns. Okay. There. Gigantic blue crowns. Enjoy.
[1154.38 → 1158.46] So let me- Give me one sec. Oh. Come on now. Do the thing.
[1160.54 → 1167.26] Oh. I'm trying to pick up like the official list of parks just to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[1167.26 → 1176.62] But I think that's basically it. It's going to be interesting because this is part of the Amazon
[1176.62 → 1183.02] takeover, right? Yeah. So they're giving everyone that already had a Prime account a free subscribe,
[1183.02 → 1189.50] which is giving partners more money. We've already seen with this channel, like last week,
[1189.50 → 1195.10] there were almost no subscribers. This week, there are many subscribers. I just-There's
[1195.10 → 1199.02] literally two people just did it in chat right now. I don't know how to check.
[1201.42 → 1208.62] Sorry. It's your like partner panel and stuff. So if you go to your- I think it's your dashboard,
[1208.62 → 1213.50] and then you go to partnership. I'm the world's worst Twitch streamer. I legitimately have
[1213.50 → 1219.58] no idea how the site works. Let's see if I can figure it out for you. It's like, okay. No, no,
[1219.58 → 1223.10] go ahead. Go ahead. Keep explaining how we have more Twitch subscribers and how that's good or
[1223.10 → 1230.30] something. Anyway, it's exploded for us. And I'm sure while the change in growth might not be as big
[1230.30 → 1236.86] for other people, because we might have more people watching here that don't normally watch Twitch,
[1237.74 → 1243.18] because we're not average content that is on Twitch. And this is like-We're way above average.
[1243.18 → 1249.90] I don't believe it. And we basically just got subscriptions as well. So people didn't necessarily
[1249.90 → 1254.14] know that you could even subscribe to us. So we're in like kind of a special spot. But everyone's
[1254.14 → 1261.98] going to see growth. And a lot of the growth could even be like some dude's girlfriend has an Amazon
[1261.98 → 1269.02] Prime account, and he's like, hey, mind if I link my Twitch so I can get a free sub? Or dude's mom or
[1269.02 → 1273.42] girl's mom links her Amazon account to the kids Twitch so they can get a free sub?
[1273.42 → 1280.46] I'm still confused as to how the whole Amazon Prime thing is not just an enormous cash sink.
[1281.02 → 1288.14] As far as I can tell it is, like I- Okay, okay. So let's like break it down, right from,
[1288.14 → 1296.46] you know, top to bottom. Amazon will pay me to tell you about Prime if you sign up.
[1296.46 → 1301.58] Yeah. Then they will give you free shipping on everything, which as far as I can tell,
[1301.58 → 1307.50] if you buy like-Okay, because the benefit of Prime initially was supposed to be that it
[1307.50 → 1312.46] encouraged repeat shopping, right? Because you wouldn't have to think about shipping costs when
[1312.46 → 1320.94] you're shopping on Amazon. Okay. So if you buy like one thing a month, there goes the entire
[1321.74 → 1327.50] Prime membership for the month. Probably. Unless it's something very small. Okay. So there's that.
[1327.50 → 1334.30] Plus there's video streaming. So Amazon Prime costs more than a Netflix account, unless your Netflix is
[1335.34 → 1338.62] 4K, I think. Then I think they're pretty similar. I can't remember how much Prime costs, to be
[1338.62 → 1345.26] perfectly honest with you. But anyway, so they have Amazon Prime Video. So there's all the licensing costs
[1345.26 → 1349.50] associated with something like a Netflix service. Maybe not all of them. I actually had- I have two
[1349.50 → 1353.10] Prime accounts. I have one Canada and one US. Furthermore, I have never looked at Amazon Prime Video. Maybe I
[1353.10 → 1358.46] should do that. Anyway, so there's the licensing costs associated with that. There's the cloud storage
[1358.46 → 1364.30] they give you. You can store an unlimited number of photos using Prime. So, so, so far, what is, what
[1364.30 → 1373.98] does Prime cost again? $79.99. For the year? Canadian, it's $79 flat. Sorry. And that's a 13-month membership.
[1373.98 → 1381.34] Okay. So it's probably about $59 American. Okay. So it's $11 a month apparently on Amazon.com. Okay. Okay.
[1381.34 → 1391.98] $11 a month. So out of $11 a month, so far, we have spent all of it, times lots. And then at the
[1391.98 → 1395.82] end of all that, they're going, okay, you can subscribe to a Twitch channel for free, which is
[1395.82 → 1403.66] $5. And we will give some of that money to the Twitch channel. Sorry. So once again, oh, oh, oh,
[1403.66 → 1410.46] Luke had a bad burrito. Bad burrito. He's running to the bathroom, folks. Oh, that's the bad. Someone's
[1410.46 → 1414.94] already in there. Oh, no. He, there's been a negotiation. There's been a negotiation. He
[1414.94 → 1421.66] has been negotiated back, back to his chair. Um, he's going to go. Do you need ice? Someone need ice?
[1422.46 → 1427.98] He's going to go to the bathroom on his chair. Nope. No, I'm good. I'm good. Could you hear me the
[1427.98 → 1435.74] whole time? Yeah. Oh, okay. She could too. Oh, okay. Well, that's awkward. He's taking a drink.
[1435.74 → 1441.10] For people that don't know, I am at Twitch Con. Um, what I was doing here has changed a fair
[1441.10 → 1447.10] amount, but so I'm streaming from a hotel room and that was someone else's room service who ended up
[1447.10 → 1452.30] at my room. So yeah. So the plan actually, this is great because it brings us right into our sponsor
[1452.30 → 1459.10] spots for the day. The plan was for Luke to be streaming from the Racer booth. Yeah. Check out
[1459.10 → 1465.10] the Racer broadcasting suite below and, uh, the talking points for Racer. There's actually a bunch of stuff
[1465.10 → 1469.10] that they're showing off. That's well, that they were going to be showing off in their booth at
[1469.10 → 1474.62] Twitch Con when they arranged to sponsor us to be down there covering Twitch Con and streaming from
[1474.62 → 1479.90] their booth. Uh, so the stargazer, the tiny webcam that clips onto your laptop or monitor and does
[1479.90 → 1484.46] everything a green screen setup does for background removal and more. So it actually features Intel's
[1484.46 → 1489.42] Real Sense technology. So that's the, uh, the depth sensing whole camera thing. So it can cut out
[1489.42 → 1495.98] things that are far away as opposed to things that are a different colour, which is pretty darn cool.
[1495.98 → 1501.90] As well as the Siren Pro, the mic that any streamer should look at first. XLR input helps to aspire
[1501.90 → 1506.30] streamers take their audio to a professional level. You're using that, right? I am actually using the
[1506.30 → 1510.70] Siren Pro right now. The thing that I like about the Siren Pro actually is not necessarily that.
[1510.70 → 1516.30] See, I'm not using the XLR though. I probably will at some point, probably should at some point.
[1516.30 → 1521.58] The thing I like about it is its one of the few mics I've found that just kind of works out of the
[1521.58 → 1528.38] box. Like you just set the thing, and then it doesn't peak, which is nice. That's really all I
[1528.38 → 1534.62] asked for. That's all I'm asking for. It doesn't seem that complicated, but we've tried like six
[1534.62 → 1542.06] different mics on the WAN Show. Um, yeah. And then they're also featuring the Ripsaw, the world's first
[1542.06 → 1547.10] USB 3 capture card. I actually don't know that it is the world's first USB 3 capture card.
[1547.10 → 1553.26] Okay. I know why you said that. I said the exact same thing because of the thing that I'm using
[1553.26 → 1561.82] right now. Um, and it's, we're wrong. Oh, are we? The Ripsaw came out first by like a few months.
[1561.82 → 1569.42] Oh, it was close. How about that then? Yeah. Okay. No delay when recording, and it comes out
[1569.42 → 1573.50] with just about every cable you need for PC and console streaming out of the box. So it shows you
[1573.50 → 1577.58] what I know. And you can check these products out at the link in the video description, which will be
[1577.58 → 1582.30] there when you are watching this on YouTube or another possibility. And I'm going to go ahead and
[1582.30 → 1587.42] paste all these links into Twitch chat for you guys, or another possibility for those links would be to
[1587.42 → 1593.74] see them on the Twitch GOD. And Twitch now has the capability, this is the last part, sort of big
[1593.74 → 1599.18] part of the, uh, the whole upgrade announcement thing that they've been doing. Twitch now has the
[1599.18 → 1605.26] capability for you to just upload Gods straight up. So you don't actually have to stream to Twitch
[1605.82 → 1611.42] in order to have your video appear on Twitch. And this is a weird reversal for them, isn't it? First,
[1611.42 → 1616.78] they don't want you to leave your Twitch Gods on Twitch. Now they want you to just upload videos to Twitch.
[1617.42 → 1621.58] Yeah, they totally changed. Although that probably came with like, Amazon just being like,
[1622.30 → 1628.14] servers! Because... Yes, that's what Amazon, that's what Jeff Bezos sounds like. We're going to have
[1628.14 → 1631.58] him on the show. He's going to sound just like that. We're going to be like, hi, Jeff, welcome to the
[1631.58 → 1636.78] show. He's going to be like, Amazon! We have servers! And we're going to be like, wow, that's great,
[1636.78 → 1644.30] Jeff. Thanks for, uh, thanks for coming on. Two things that... The Fire Phone wasn't very good, but it wasn't my fault.
[1644.30 → 1652.06] Two things that's interesting about this to me is, one, I think the amount of people spamming
[1652.06 → 1659.90] pre-recorded question mark is going to be way too insane on our stream. And two, my like, main problem
[1659.90 → 1663.82] with my stream is... So just ban the word. Like, consistency, because I go on like workshops and
[1663.82 → 1671.18] stuff. Yeah. So I could legitimately pre-record them. And then just have them play. What? What?
[1672.30 → 1676.78] One interesting thing is, if they're just going to show up in your past broadcasts
[1677.58 → 1684.14] when you upload a GOD, or if it will like, if you could like schedule one to play on your channel
[1684.14 → 1689.98] through Twitch, I don't know how any of this works yet. Because it just shows up in your past
[1689.98 → 1696.62] broadcasts. I don't think it's going to be super successful. Because that's... Unless they change,
[1696.62 → 1703.02] like, how people look at things on Twitch. Because right now, going to someone's past broadcasts is
[1703.02 → 1710.06] very manual. Yeah. And it's tedious, and they're usually not titled correctly because Twitch streamers
[1710.06 → 1717.74] are irresponsible. And yeah, it's just horrible. So if they could have it so that like, you upload it,
[1717.74 → 1722.46] it goes into your past broadcasts, and then there's like a settings thing somewhere where
[1722.46 → 1729.34] it can be like, play this file at this time. And that could be kind of interesting for
[1730.22 → 1736.06] people that legitimately just replay stuff. Like, there's certain gaming tournament channels that
[1736.06 → 1741.50] will replay their tournaments, while various tournaments aren't live. So you can go watch
[1741.50 → 1745.98] them at different timeframes. And yes, it is pre-recorded, but it's kind of like going and watching
[1745.98 → 1751.50] TV. Yeah, it's kind of like watching like a match replay like you would on... Sorry, TV. Yes,
[1751.50 → 1755.50] that's what you said. That's actually kind of cool, and would make it so that those guys don't have to
[1755.50 → 1761.02] have computers that are just set up constantly just playing like video files and streaming video
[1761.02 → 1767.50] files all day. So that could be kind of cool. But I have no idea if it's going to work that way.
[1767.50 → 1773.02] I'm sorry. Go ahead. I said I have no idea if it's going to work that way. I just hope it does.
[1773.02 → 1776.62] I'm sorry for contributing nothing to that last exchange and just repeating what you said.
[1780.22 → 1786.54] I felt bad. I've got some serious conspiracy theory nonsense going on here. We've got people
[1786.54 → 1792.70] saying that you are pre-recorded and that I am not and that I am actually live and that we're just
[1792.70 → 1802.06] extremely impressive. Yeah, that would be amazing. If that's even true, I like I would just give it
[1802.06 → 1809.18] to you at that point. Yeah, right. Oh, knock to a 21 is saying we should ask Nerd Fusion about playlists.
[1809.18 → 1813.82] I actually I should probably talk to Seeds over there and see what he thinks.
[1814.54 → 1820.38] I'm hanging out with him probably tomorrow and Sunday. So I'll, I'm sure we'll talk about that.
[1820.38 → 1822.86] Cool. Tell him I think he's nice. Sure.
[1824.78 → 1828.46] Or that I'd hate him. It doesn't really matter. I can talk to him myself.
[1829.34 → 1833.90] Sorry, Anti what? Anti gave me Maker Faire tickets. Wow.
[1833.90 → 1839.82] Wow. So my like plan to hang out at Twitch Con is maybe changing a little bit.
[1843.18 → 1848.46] All right. This was originally posted on the forum by Master Disaster and I think that pretty much
[1848.46 → 1855.58] says it right there. The BBC reports I got this post in the chat here. The BBC reports that
[1855.58 → 1863.98] Blackberry will stop designing its own phones. How long ago did we say they should do this?
[1865.02 → 1872.14] Uh, how long ago did everyone say they should do this? I mean, we weren't the only ones for the last
[1872.14 → 1878.22] few years saying that's fair. Why don't you just be a software company? Why don't you just do an Android
[1878.22 → 1887.50] branch or something and become a security software specialist? So it looks like they are finally
[1887.50 → 1897.10] going that route. I have apparently lost the tab. But in a nutshell, so John Chen, their CEO said that
[1897.10 → 1901.74] he would know by September whether the hardware business would become profitable for Blackberry.
[1901.74 → 1908.70] Um, it is now September and apparently it did not. So they are outsourcing hardware development to
[1908.70 → 1915.34] partners. Uh, Chen has stated that further devices, even ones with the iconic physical keyboard,
[1915.34 → 1921.66] would go on sale. Um, I always wanted to make sure that we keep having iconic devices, he said.
[1921.66 → 1926.70] We just need to find a way to be more efficient and be able to make money. I think we found the model.
[1926.70 → 1932.54] So the company sold 400,000 smartphones in its second quarter, which is less than the previous
[1932.54 → 1941.66] three months. Um, yeah, there's no, there's no, you didn't find the model. Stop selling phones.
[1946.54 → 1951.74] I mean, like it's a step in the right direction, but they need to just get off the platform and just
[1951.74 → 1958.62] start making only software. Oh man, I don't understand how they keep doing this.
[1958.62 → 1963.58] I was looking, uh, I was actually reading a couple other articles about this that aren't the linked
[1963.58 → 1967.26] ones here and that the notes apparently weren't pulled from. But, uh, basically they've already
[1967.26 → 1976.22] got a couple of hardware partners they've worked with. I believe it was, uh, Foxconn and I want to say,
[1976.22 → 1981.50] uh, shoot, it was some other, it was some other Chinese phone maker. I can't remember exactly, but, um,
[1983.02 → 1990.54] oh, okay, TCL, I think is the TCL is the other one. So here we go. Uh, this one right here, so the
[1990.54 → 1996.30] first touchscreen-only Android device, the DTEK50, that was released in July 2016. So to reduce cost, this
[1996.30 → 2002.06] was based on a phone manufactured by TCL. So the idea is they're going to leverage those partnerships. Uh,
[2002.06 → 2009.98] they're going to kind of Blackberry brand existing hardware, which quite frankly, I don't think is
[2009.98 → 2015.66] inherently the worst thing ever. And then they're going to be putting their own, uh, their own kind
[2015.66 → 2022.14] of spin on Android in order to, I guess, make it more secure or whatever. This is something I can't
[2022.14 → 2026.38] really figure out why Google hasn't tackled. Like, why do we need Samsung's Knox in order to
[2026.38 → 2036.86] optimize Android for better security? I, uh, well, okay, whatever. Okay. I guess that's a conversation
[2036.86 → 2043.50] for another day, but there you go. Would you consider, okay, here, Luke, you were the last one
[2043.50 → 2047.26] to review a Blackberry device on our channel, the Z10, I think it was?
[2047.26 → 2053.66] Yeah, it was a while ago, but yeah. Okay. So your takeaway from that, if I recall correctly,
[2053.66 → 2057.90] feel free to kind of jump in and interrupt me here, but your takeaway from that, if I recall,
[2058.46 → 2062.30] was basically there were some things about it that were perfect, including text messaging.
[2063.10 → 2069.66] Um, it was responsive. It was like pretty smooth to use, but not having apps is basically the end of
[2069.66 → 2076.06] the world. Yes. Okay. Now there were even, even back then there were ways to like ghetto side load
[2076.06 → 2081.74] Android apps. But it was not great. But it was not great. In fact, it was super dumb. So would you
[2081.74 → 2089.34] consider a Blackberry phone if they have a mostly stock Android looking skin? And other than that,
[2089.34 → 2096.86] it's just a PHONE and with Blackberry security optimizations? It depends. Like my most
[2096.86 → 2104.30] important metrics right now for phones personally are water resistance levels and battery life.
[2104.30 → 2111.90] Um, which is like why the iPhone seven looked kind of cool. And then all of a sudden it was like,
[2112.86 → 2117.02] no headphone jack. And I was like, all right, probably not going to do that. Um,
[2118.30 → 2124.22] so it would have to depend on how well they did in those categories. Right. One thing that I really,
[2124.22 → 2132.22] really did like was the Blackberry hub. Um, so for like an efficiency standpoint, it might actually
[2132.22 → 2136.70] win. The Blackberry hub was a wonderful system. I liked it a lot more than just like standard
[2136.70 → 2141.66] notifications because you could just see everything in one category and made it very efficient to skim
[2141.66 → 2146.62] through things. It's like, uh, Google inbox or whatever that was called that we all got kind of
[2146.62 → 2153.18] excited for a little while. And then the entire one forgot about. Um, but like better and for
[2153.18 → 2158.70] everything instead of just your email, which was super cool. But like, I'll wait and see till they
[2158.70 → 2163.58] come out. If they have good water resistance and good battery, I would legitimately consider it.
[2163.58 → 2168.94] Yeah. I actually, uh, on the subject of the iPhone seven, I was talking to one of my badmintons
[2168.94 → 2174.30] buddies who got an iPhone seven, and I was like, so how's it, uh, not having a headphone jack there.
[2174.30 → 2178.46] And he's just like, Oh, I actually haven't really noticed. I only use my Jaybirds.
[2179.10 → 2185.10] And I was just like, wow. Okay. I'm officially no longer mainstream. I'm officially like an old
[2185.10 → 2193.42] fuddy-duddy for actually carrying around wired earphones at all times. I can't say though, like
[2193.42 → 2200.70] their wireless ear pods look incredibly stupid, and I'm not even like, I'm not really a fashion dude or
[2200.70 → 2206.54] whatever, but they just look so dumb. Um, there are wireless headphone solutions that don't look
[2206.54 → 2212.38] incredibly stupid, but theirs are brutal. And considering, uh, Apple often gets described as like
[2212.94 → 2218.62] a technology jewellery company where like what you're buying is a fashion statement. Lifestyle.
[2218.62 → 2228.06] Yeah. That's kind of brutal because they're ugly as sin. So I don't know. Uh, if people start adopting
[2228.06 → 2233.82] third party headphone options, I got our Bluetooth, I see it being a little bit more popular, but
[2234.62 → 2240.22] regardless of the power of Apple to make something trendy, I think those headphones are just fundamentally
[2240.22 → 2246.46] ugly and I don't think they're going to be able to get over that. We'll see. I mean, we will see, but yeah,
[2246.46 → 2251.98] I don't know. You know, white, white wires on your, on your earphones that like, that look grungy and
[2251.98 → 2259.82] yellow in two weeks became a status symbol. So it's true. There you go. I don't know, man,
[2259.82 → 2268.38] but at least they looked cool at the start. Oh, oh, ouch. Okay. I don't know. For me, a phone,
[2268.38 → 2275.74] like I'll either have to buy a charging and headphone adapter if I were to want to use the iPhone 7,
[2275.74 → 2281.34] or I would be just unable to use it because I, so my earphones, I wear them while I sleep.
[2281.90 → 2289.02] Um, I always listen to music or podcasts or shows while I'm sleeping because it, uh, it helps me,
[2289.02 → 2292.70] it helps me fall asleep. Like it used to take me sometimes an hour, two hours to fall asleep at
[2292.70 → 2297.98] night. I had horrible insomnia, uh, to the point where I was like taking sleeping pills sometimes
[2297.98 → 2302.38] just because I'd be like, I really need to be awake in the morning. So I will take this sleeping
[2302.38 → 2308.06] pill now because otherwise I will not sleep. Um, and this completely fixed it for me.
[2308.70 → 2313.82] Uh, the best one is I'll, I'll watch a show. Like I'll listen to, because I'm not watching it,
[2313.82 → 2322.54] but I'll listen to a TV show, like episode that I've heard 20 times and that's like, it's boring
[2323.18 → 2330.06] and it puts me to sleep. It's great. So, um, yeah, problem solved. All I have to do is wear earphones
[2330.06 → 2334.30] when I sleep, but I can't charge my phone and listen to these at the same time if it doesn't
[2334.30 → 2340.86] have a headphone jack. So there you go. Everyone's giving me advice in Twitch chat. I'm not asking for
[2340.86 → 2345.58] advice. I have fixed the problem. He's been doing this for years, and it works very well for him.
[2345.58 → 2349.74] I think he's great. It's great. Anywhere from like five minutes.
[2349.74 → 2355.58] Just get medical tape and tape over your ears so that the headphones can Bluetooth in, and they won't
[2355.58 → 2360.22] fall out while you sleep. It's, it's no man, no man. You're doing it wrong. Brilliant.
[2360.22 → 2365.26] Gotta get on that medical tape game. Wow. The entire Twitch chat is just like,
[2366.30 → 2370.30] Oh, Francisco Era is officially fired from watching the show.
[2371.02 → 2373.42] I listened to this show because it's boring.
[2376.86 → 2379.26] That's a little sad, but it's also kind of funny.
[2379.26 → 2385.66] So are we, I mean, okay, this, this demands a straw poll. Oh, God!.
[2385.66 → 2389.74] This demands a straw poll. Okay. Are we your sleep aid?
[2395.02 → 2399.02] How do you feel knowing that you might, uh, help people fall asleep at night?
[2399.02 → 2403.98] I mean, I guess that's a useful public service, but like, come on.
[2403.98 → 2411.42] Are we your comfy pillow? That is really not what I was going for here. So far, 100% of the vote. Okay.
[2411.42 → 2416.46] There we go. There we go. It's getting a little better. Oh, oh, oh, oh, come on.
[2416.46 → 2418.46] Come on.
[2421.74 → 2422.14] What?
[2423.98 → 2425.90] 54% yes.
[2427.10 → 2430.14] Guys fight the 54%. Okay.
[2430.14 → 2430.94] I would vote yes.
[2430.94 → 2431.90] Luke.
[2431.90 → 2432.46] Luke, come on.
[2432.46 → 2433.42] I was going to guess.
[2433.42 → 2434.38] What's wrong with you?
[2436.70 → 2439.58] Hey, the ways I help you sleep, we don't talk about on this show.
[2441.98 → 2443.18] We only allude to them.
[2443.90 → 2444.70] Right. Yeah.
[2444.70 → 2446.14] And I can't do it from here, buddy.
[2447.66 → 2449.26] Well, I mean, I mean, tell adult kids.
[2450.54 → 2456.70] Oh, oh, we've got over a thousand votes. I mean, that is like, that's significant enough that, uh,
[2457.66 → 2461.34] it could be considered the definition of significant.
[2463.50 → 2469.98] Oh, I'm sad now. Okay. Well, at least this answers a question that you and I have posed to
[2469.98 → 2476.62] each other a handful of times. Why do people watch the WAN show? And now we know.
[2476.62 → 2476.94] Yeah.
[2476.94 → 2479.02] Because they're tired.
[2479.02 → 2479.50] Yeah.
[2479.50 → 2481.34] And it's time to go to bed.
[2481.34 → 2486.78] That makes sense. So maybe, like, our time zoning thing was wrong. We should actually be going for
[2487.34 → 2489.10] nighttime instead of, like, midday.
[2489.10 → 2493.10] I had no way of knowing, bro. Yeah.
[2493.10 → 2494.46] I had no way of knowing. Okay.
[2495.02 → 2495.58] Now we know.
[2495.58 → 2499.42] All right. Hard drives are on the ropes.
[2499.42 → 2503.58] Baby, okay. There we go. No. Conspiracy theory. That's why we're late every time.
[2504.78 → 2506.78] Because we're trying to be later.
[2506.78 → 2509.82] You're waiting for the WAN show. You start kind of dozing off a little bit.
[2509.82 → 2510.06] That's right.
[2510.06 → 2513.98] You're like, okay, good. You press the button, and then you just fade off.
[2514.62 → 2515.18] That's right.
[2515.18 → 2516.30] Everything's fine.
[2516.30 → 2519.34] You drift to sleep. Everything's good. And then you never wake up.
[2520.70 → 2522.30] Unless you feel refreshed.
[2523.26 → 2523.34] Yeah.
[2523.34 → 2527.66] Yeah. Okay. So this was posted by It's Me on the forum.
[2529.10 → 2535.98] SSDs are steadily displacing hard drives in more applications, but NVMe.
[2537.42 → 2543.66] This is interesting. This is from Tom's Hardware. NVMe, shaping up to be the dark horse
[2543.66 → 2553.58] that may put the venerable hard disk drive to rest. So this is based on Samsung predicting a collision
[2553.58 → 2562.30] course for SSD pricing and hard drive pricing. Dun, dun, dun. Look at that.
[2562.30 → 2566.70] How do you think that will mean hard drives will be done? Because...
[2566.70 → 2569.90] Well, in the enterprise, sure.
[2569.90 → 2569.98] Sure.
[2569.98 → 2571.02] Sorry?
[2571.02 → 2573.74] In like enterprise, like cloud storage, sure.
[2573.74 → 2581.42] Yeah. At the home, they'll probably die off quite a bit faster. But like, being able to put critical
[2581.42 → 2588.14] stuff on a hard drive that you can recover if it fails, kind of nice. Storing things on a variety
[2588.14 → 2589.74] of different mediums is a good thing.
[2589.74 → 2590.62] Mm-hmm.
[2590.62 → 2592.38] I don't know.
[2592.38 → 2597.26] I don't know. I see hard drives becoming... Okay. So here are the things to look at.
[2597.82 → 2605.74] So number one, have we reached the limit of what people actually need to store? Like, yes,
[2605.74 → 2610.30] people take lots of photos, and they take lots of videos on their phones. And that's one of the things
[2610.30 → 2617.74] that hard drive makers have loved talking about at conferences or in presentations, conference calls,
[2617.74 → 2621.50] where they'll kind of be like, yeah, the data storage needs of the world is going like this.
[2621.50 → 2631.42] But the reality of it is that cloud storage pricing is such that if people wanted to store their data
[2631.42 → 2638.86] somewhere where they theoretically, you know, don't have to worry about it getting lost or being vulnerable
[2638.86 → 2646.22] to a failed device, cloud storage for the amount that most people have, like a couple terabytes,
[2646.22 → 2647.42] is pretty reasonable.
[2648.70 → 2649.90] Yeah. Yeah.
[2649.90 → 2655.18] So have we gotten... have we reached that threshold where SSDs are starting to hit that one to two
[2655.18 → 2660.54] terabyte capacity where they hold pretty much everything you could need unless you have a gigantic
[2660.54 → 2665.74] Steam library, and you don't have... you have dial-up internet. So you need to preload everything
[2665.74 → 2670.30] so that you'd never have to download it or whatever. So we're talking edge cases where
[2670.30 → 2676.62] most people can hold everything they could need on their phone or their computer or backed up in the
[2676.62 → 2682.22] cloud, especially looking at the way that, okay, Google, for example, gives you unlimited photo storage
[2682.22 → 2687.34] through photos if you allow them to compress the image. Yeah. What else do people store?
[2688.22 → 2691.18] You stream all your music. Sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm done. I'm done.
[2691.18 → 2697.18] This ties into to... when did I bring this up? Like last week? I was like, when are people not going
[2697.18 → 2701.10] to have SATA cables anymore? Yeah. Yep.
[2701.10 → 2707.98] So like this might... I still think that's a little ways out, but this might kind of advance that up even
[2707.98 → 2714.70] a little bit more. It's going to be fascinating seeing computers that don't need space to put drives.
[2714.70 → 2722.62] Yep. Interesting. Yep. And then I think at that point, everything is either backed up in the cloud or
[2723.74 → 2729.34] you'll have the enthusiasts who are the guys like me that have an unrayed box in their closet or
[2729.34 → 2734.22] something because they want to be able to transcode video on the fly, and they want to be able to do
[2734.22 → 2740.70] this. They want to store uncompressed Blu-ray rips on a network machine so that they can play it back
[2740.70 → 2745.50] or on any screen in the house. Like there's going to be enthusiasts. And I think for guys like that,
[2745.50 → 2750.86] like the hard drive is by no means dead for me. Not even close. Yeah.
[2751.82 → 2759.34] But I'm also at the point where one of the videos that I have coming soon is the most cost-effective
[2759.34 → 2767.02] 100 terabyte server. And what I learned when I was working on that video is that with Seagate's archive
[2767.02 → 2773.82] drives, which sit at around 3 cents a gigabyte or something like that, like just obscenely low cost,
[2774.38 → 2782.38] with an archive drive, I can saturate a typical gigabit home network already. So you could do
[2782.38 → 2787.34] 100 terabytes for... I kind of want to pull up my spreadsheet now so I don't give you guys the wrong
[2787.34 → 2793.34] number, but that video is coming soon. But Seagate's archive drives are 24-7 rated drives. They run at
[2793.34 → 2804.62] 5,900 RPM. And you can buy 100 terabytes of hard drive for... cost per gig is 2.9 cents.
[2805.34 → 2815.34] And 100 terabytes for $3,000. Okay? I think from an enthusiast standpoint, all that number needs to do
[2815.34 → 2823.10] is fall down to another half or another third. And I think 100 terabytes is reasonably all that most
[2823.10 → 2827.42] people could need. And there will always be the exceptions. The people that want to back up the
[2827.42 → 2832.70] internet or whatever the case may be. The only channel where you'll hear someone say,
[2832.70 → 2838.86] I genuinely think 100 terabytes is all that anyone's probably going to be needing.
[2838.86 → 2845.66] And obviously, 50 years from now, that might not be the case. But you look at the trends.
[2846.38 → 2858.86] We are not on the same path that we were before of going from 480i being an acceptable video standard
[2858.86 → 2866.70] to now we're at 4K. Explosion in data requirements in order to get to a point where the quality is
[2866.70 → 2874.54] acceptable. And now the trend is towards dedicated hardware to handle video compression and video
[2874.54 → 2880.70] decoding. So where the hardware and the devices is so much more powerful that we don't have to have
[2881.50 → 2887.02] these obscene bit rates in order to get decent image quality. And so I'm just kind of looking at it
[2887.02 → 2895.18] going, yeah, everything could be compressed on the fly. Everything could be decoded and could be
[2895.18 → 2902.70] converted on the fly. And I think that is a ton of storage. I think it's just huge.
[2905.02 → 2912.38] I have yet to determine if I think 4K Blu-ray is worth it. All my 4K Blu-rays and my Xbox One S are
[2912.38 → 2914.78] here though. So I'm going to be trying it out very soon. Stay tuned for that.
[2914.78 → 2919.02] Is that what those Blu-rays that you just ordered are? HDR stuff?
[2919.02 → 2925.74] Yes. Because HDR does genuinely look perfect. Yes. Is that a good conversation though?
[2925.74 → 2932.46] But that's a different conversation I think because HDR can also be handled. Again, it's not like going
[2932.46 → 2940.38] from 480i to 1080p. HDR can be added without necessarily... Okay, so we doubled the capacity
[2940.38 → 2947.58] of a Blu-ray disc going from Blu-ray to 4K Blu-ray. We managed to quadruple the resolution and add HDR.
[2948.46 → 2952.22] So we added a bunch more contrast and colour information and quadrupled the resolution. We
[2952.22 → 2956.22] doubled the data. So we're not on that same trajectory anymore. That's kind of the point I'm
[2956.22 → 2961.82] trying to make. I think that we're using processing power which continues to increase and is pretty darn
[2961.82 → 2968.62] impressive these days, even in tiny little devices, to compensate for what we normally would have just
[2968.62 → 2973.50] added more storage for. That's been partly out of necessity because storage hasn't really continued
[2973.50 → 2978.54] to scale in the same way that it has. I think that's why Samsung is making this bold prediction
[2978.54 → 2985.74] where they're kind of going, okay, SSD upgrades. This is actually amazing. 40 million SSDs. They're saying
[2985.74 → 2995.42] SSD upgrades sometime in 2012, it looks like, overtook CPU upgrades as the most common upgrade that
[2995.42 → 3000.54] people make to a computer. That makes sense. And they're also saying that the SSD doesn't have to
[3000.54 → 3005.74] reach exactly the same pricing as a hard drive gig for gig. It just has to reach a point where,
[3005.74 → 3011.82] and we're there now, where 256 gigs for an SSD is about the same as a one terabyte hard drive. So that
[3011.82 → 3015.58] entry-level capacity versus that entry-level capacity. They're saying it just has to be
[3015.58 → 3023.50] good enough. And 512 gigs for me is that sweet spot where I don't really feel like I need an
[3023.50 → 3030.30] additional storage drive anymore. I can still have like the two or three big games that I'm playing
[3030.30 → 3035.50] right now, and I can still have all the data that I need as long as I have a NAS. And I think everyone
[3035.50 → 3041.26] should have a NAS anyway. Yeah. I don't, I still don't personally feel like that's enough in my desktop.
[3041.26 → 3048.22] Are you a one terabyte guy? I'm a four. You're a four terabyte. What the heck do you have on your
[3048.22 → 3054.22] computer that takes up four terabytes? And I have a 16 terabyte NAS. I know about your NAS. It's, that's
[3054.22 → 3061.66] the important part of my original question too. Mine is slightly special use case though, because it's all the
[3061.66 → 3065.10] games. Because I hear you, it doesn't take that long to download them. Uh-huh.
[3065.10 → 3068.62] Because my connection isn't that bad. But I don't want to sit and download games while I'm streaming.
[3069.74 → 3073.90] Okay. So I'd like to be able to have everything available. I think you should just go iSCSI then.
[3074.94 → 3082.54] Because your NAS would support an iSCSI target. Would it? I don't know. That's pretty slow.
[3082.54 → 3088.46] That NAS is not that fast. All right. Fair enough. You know what's... It's good at holding things for a
[3088.46 → 3094.70] long time. It's not really doing much else. You know what's funny? I don't normally notice when
[3094.70 → 3099.26] gaming off of a hard drive. Because generally speaking, game developers are good at masking
[3099.26 → 3104.86] those loading times. I mean, maybe part of it is that it's a heck of a lot better than an optical disc.
[3104.86 → 3114.62] And so many games are designed for optical media still. But when I do run into trouble... So my home
[3114.62 → 3119.42] theatre PC, the one in my living room, actually just has a small boot SSD. Like it's actually kind
[3119.42 → 3125.42] of an older config at like 128 gig boot SSD. So I pretty much can't put more than one AAA game on it
[3125.42 → 3129.66] if I want to have anything else on it. Another thing that I'm going to... Sorry, I'm going to kind of
[3129.66 → 3137.98] bring this up. The amount of people that are not only... Like not necessarily that it's their job,
[3137.98 → 3142.30] but the amount of people that are even just doing it as a hobby, Ada, Ada, Ada,
[3142.30 → 3147.02] Twitch streaming, YouTube, all that kind of stuff. The amount of people that are just doing it for fun,
[3147.02 → 3150.62] the amount of people that are trying to get into it, and the amount of people that are successful at it
[3150.62 → 3156.62] is huge to the point where a lot of people that I talk to in my day-to-day, when I tell them what I
[3156.62 → 3162.22] do, go like, oh yeah, I've been kind of like trying that out, or I tried that out at one point in time.
[3162.22 → 3169.02] Right. Storing footage is a nightmare. Computing stuff is a nightmare. And like,
[3169.74 → 3175.42] Twitch streamers, I know a not that insignificant number of them that actually archive all of their
[3175.42 → 3183.26] footage. Right. Which is kind of crazy. I still think that's a niche case, but I don't remember what I was saying.
[3183.26 → 3187.82] Twitch streaming archive, yeah. But like, there's a lot of people that are dabbling in things like
[3187.82 → 3193.26] YouTube right now. Right. Yep, that's true. That's true. I still think hard drives will hold on,
[3193.26 → 3199.02] but I think it's going to be, instead of the thing that everyone buys for every single computer ever,
[3199.02 → 3202.78] it's going to be an official. An accessory purchase. Yeah. Yeah. So either an accessory
[3202.78 → 3207.58] purchase for a little external drive, or when you're ready to move to the big time, I think it,
[3207.58 → 3214.70] I think NAS, I think NAS moves in. Yeah. So this is interesting. This is one of the challenges for
[3214.70 → 3220.06] hard drive, is that there's roughly a $40 price floor. Hard drives have never been under, you know,
[3220.06 → 3226.46] like $39.99. Not unless it's a lost leader, or something along those lines. Whereas, and this is
[3226.46 → 3232.62] something that Samsung's saying, SSDs can scale well below $40 in much smaller quantities. Because the
[3232.62 → 3238.78] hard drive, no matter what, no matter how cheaply you can make them, you still need a casing, motors,
[3238.78 → 3245.50] heads, other, you need the actual platters themselves. So the platters and the complexity
[3245.50 → 3249.98] of the motors and how many heads you need and how many platters are in it, all that increases in cost
[3249.98 → 3255.66] as you scale up. But you can only go down to one platter. Yeah. And that costs how much it costs.
[3255.66 → 3258.38] There's pretty much nothing we can do about it, and it's not really going to get any better.
[3258.38 → 3264.94] Yeah. So Samsung also figures that SSDs have displaced hard drives in 40% of new notebooks,
[3264.94 → 3269.74] and they predictably reach 55% in 2018. And I totally get it, and I personally definitely
[3269.74 → 3274.22] prefer SSDs. Back to my story, I don't mind gaming off of a hard drive in general.
[3275.10 → 3280.14] And I forget a lot of the time that my media PC has a 2TB hard drive to go along with that small SSD.
[3280.70 → 3285.26] But the other day, I was trying to install a game by copying the files over the network
[3285.26 → 3292.22] while trying to play a game. And I loaded my game. It's like Lego Batman or something.
[3292.22 → 3297.26] Like, not the world's most demanding game. And the game sat there at the loading screen
[3298.14 → 3303.34] the entire time that those files were copying. And then as soon as they were done, boom, game loaded.
[3303.34 → 3306.54] Yeah, that's brutal. Terrible.
[3306.54 → 3315.34] I can't even basically comprehend using a hard drive-based computer as my daily driver now.
[3316.62 → 3322.38] Anytime I use some ones that's set up that way, I'm like, man, you can make your life so much better
[3322.38 → 3329.58] with a little bit of an upgrade here. And then I point them to my hard drive SSD configuration video
[3329.58 → 3336.22] thing. Like, there. Even if you buy a tiny one, like a 128GB or something, you can still live,
[3336.22 → 3341.74] and it'll still be far better. And 128GB SSDs are pretty cheap these days.
[3343.34 → 3349.98] All right. So Tech Racks has convinced people the video has 10.3 million views. And apparently,
[3349.98 → 3351.58] I just opened it in another browser window.
[3351.58 → 3352.06] It's old news?
[3352.06 → 3356.70] I'm trying to... No, this... I mean, it's iPhone 7, so it can't be that old.
[3358.30 → 3365.50] So 10 days ago. Tech Racks has convinced people to add headphone jacks to their iPhone 7s.
[3366.22 → 3373.90] I haven't actually talked to them about this yet, but I think it's pretty funny. As with every iPhone hoax,
[3373.90 → 3382.86] every time this happens, and it's like, make your iPhone waterproof with these easy steps. Hit it with a hammer.
[3382.86 → 3386.62] Like, just terrible, terrible ideas.
[3390.14 → 3395.34] Tightening the handset and the metal vise, the screen starts to flicker. He promises his viewers this is normal.
[3395.34 → 3400.94] He just drills a hole kind of randomly. He doesn't even pretend. Like, he's not even pulling a...
[3402.78 → 3408.70] Oh, shoot. My... Yeah, there. Theo Joe. He's not even pulling a Theo Joe here, where he's like,
[3409.42 → 3414.46] trying to look like there's some kind of science and methodology behind it. He just pulls out a drill,
[3414.46 → 3419.02] drills a hole in the bottom, goes, boom! There! Now it works. I'm amazed he was able to get far enough
[3419.02 → 3423.98] into the iPhone that he was able to insert a 3.5mm jack while it was still working.
[3423.98 → 3427.34] You know what I noticed, which I thought was kind of hilarious? It was like, okay,
[3427.34 → 3432.14] there's the screen flickering when it's in the vise thing, but he addresses that. When he plugs his
[3432.14 → 3441.82] headphones in, it's still playing audio over the speakers. I know. What? What? Yeah.
[3445.82 → 3451.66] I don't... I also wonder at the same time, like, if... People are just saying they did it to get
[3451.66 → 3456.78] attention. Yeah, and then that multiplies the views on the video because everyone liked laughing at
[3456.78 → 3463.58] stupid people. Right. Yeah, that seems pretty possible. Speaking of things that are possible,
[3463.58 → 3470.38] I would have never imagined this to be possible. Tinder for sperm donors. Swipe right for a sperm donor.
[3471.58 → 3477.74] The London Sperm Bank is now taking orders for customized dads in the UK. They released a Tinder-issue
[3477.74 → 3483.10] mobile app that lets women filter potential sperm donors based on traits like ethnicity, occupation,
[3483.10 → 3488.54] personality type, eye colour, and more. That's cool. The search results are labelled with numbers like
[3488.54 → 3491.34] donor 1002 instead of names.
[3493.58 → 3500.94] So without getting into too many details about my family history, what I will say... Oh, wow.
[3500.94 → 3507.58] Is that sperm donors can lie and some of them might fill out their forms saying that they are... Oh,
[3507.58 → 3512.06] I don't know. Say, for example, a doctor and might turn out to be a milk truck driver.
[3513.58 → 3521.98] So I don't know what steps they're going through to prevent fraud in this case.
[3522.94 → 3531.66] But anyway, the app also gives women the option to create wishlist alerts for possible surrogate fathers.
[3531.66 → 3535.82] If they already know what they want and aren't interested in browsing, it will notify them when
[3535.82 → 3540.22] their preferred characteristics become available. The selected sample will be sent to the fertility
[3540.22 → 3545.82] specialist where the woman is undergoing treatment once an approximately $12,000 payment is made through
[3545.82 → 3556.70] the app. And there you go. Some critics say... This is great. This is from the qz.com article.
[3556.70 → 3561.66] Say that there's a difference between narrowing down food delivery options by cuisines and choosing
[3561.66 → 3570.30] sperm donors by eye colour. The abundance of choice and narrowness of selection categories, they say,
[3570.30 → 3580.62] could exacerbate the eugenic tendencies that already exist at traditional sperm banks. Wow. So yeah, there you go.
[3581.26 → 3590.38] It's legal. What I would hope that it would do is when you swipe right, say, so you're like accepting,
[3591.02 → 3593.82] it then like sends you a more detailed profile.
[3593.82 → 3602.22] I don't know. Apparently, all the donors in the app have to be approved by the British Andrology Society,
[3603.34 → 3608.62] the British Fertilization Society, and the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority to ensure they
[3608.62 → 3612.46] don't have any infections or genetic conditions. So at least there's that going for them.
[3612.46 → 3615.10] How do you define a genetic condition?
[3617.18 → 3619.90] I don't know. Like, could stupidity be a genetic condition? Because...
[3619.90 → 3623.82] Even if it runs in your family line.
[3623.82 → 3628.22] All right. So thanks for tuning into the WAN show this week, guys. We will see you again next week.
[3628.22 → 3635.50] Same bad time, same bad channel. I probably won't be here. So, Luke, you'll probably be on WAN show
[3635.50 → 3636.94] upload duty. Do you know how to do it?
[3638.38 → 3642.06] Uh, yes. No.
[3642.06 → 3645.98] I think what I'll do is I will screen record me doing the entire thing tonight.
[3645.98 → 3650.70] Cool. And then I will give that to you. I think I do, but it's way safer if you just do that.
[3650.70 → 3653.18] I'm just going to do that. I'll put it in the WAN show folder on the server. Sorry,
[3653.18 → 3655.50] we'll take this conversation offline. Thanks again next...
[3655.50 → 3657.58] Next... Thanks again next week. Thanks again...
[3658.30 → 3662.70] I'm rolling the intro. Same bad time, same bad time.
[3675.98 → 3677.58] I'm rolling the intro.
[3677.58 → 3689.98] Someone in Twitch chat wants me to say, you're not my real dad!
