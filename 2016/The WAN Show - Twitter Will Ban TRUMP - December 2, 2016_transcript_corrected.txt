[0.00 → 1.18] It couldn't possibly go wrong.
[1.30 → 2.02] I'm starting the stream.
[2.18 → 2.84] Sounds good, dude.
[3.76 → 4.28] Oh, hey!
[4.84 → 5.76] Do-do-do.
[6.18 → 7.10] Do-do.
[7.34 → 8.10] Do-do-do.
[8.10 → 10.18] I don't know much.
[11.48 → 13.42] But I do know that.
[13.50 → 14.96] I know it's a wench ow.
[15.98 → 17.78] Oh, I thought you were going with, like, Meatloaf there.
[18.26 → 23.02] And that may be all I need to know.
[23.24 → 24.10] So not Meatloaf.
[24.22 → 24.80] Not Meatloaf.
[24.86 → 25.30] No, okay.
[25.50 → 28.26] That's What's-Her-Face and some other guy.
[28.26 → 30.10] I don't know.
[30.52 → 31.46] Linda Ronstadt.
[31.52 → 32.74] But it's, like, a cover or something.
[32.82 → 33.22] Oh, yeah.
[33.30 → 34.68] I like Meatloaf.
[34.80 → 38.46] She's, like, actually kind of, like, pretty famous for a cover artist.
[38.62 → 38.78] Yeah.
[40.66 → 41.18] All right.
[41.24 → 42.50] Sorry, I'm still loading up the doc.
[42.56 → 43.54] I have no idea what the topic is up for this week.
[43.54 → 44.22] My doc's up.
[44.64 → 48.90] I'm just going to read the first four in the doc because we don't really know what they are anyway.
[49.18 → 52.54] Twitter says that they will ban Trump if he breaks hate speech rules.
[52.56 → 53.68] Can they do that retroactively?
[53.86 → 55.12] Like, how does he still have an account?
[57.22 → 57.58] Boom.
[57.58 → 62.58] Casey Estate sold his Beam app and himself to CNN.
[63.58 → 69.02] And Netflix 4K streaming requires Kaby Lake, Windows 10, and Edge browser.
[69.26 → 70.70] You know what the problem is?
[71.94 → 77.18] And Canada wants software backdoors, mandatory decryption capability, and record storage.
[77.50 → 80.04] That's why I look so small.
[80.04 → 80.50] The table was moved.
[80.52 → 82.44] It's the table that was moved.
[82.68 → 83.58] Yeah, because you're...
[84.18 → 85.70] Also, your chair is higher.
[85.70 → 91.84] I bet it's on the other side because I bet your chair was assembled backwards.
[91.84 → 93.22] Oh, no, no, it is on that side.
[93.22 → 93.60] Is it?
[94.00 → 94.56] You got this.
[94.60 → 95.22] You got this, bro.
[95.28 → 96.02] I'm cheering for him.
[96.52 → 97.54] You can do it.
[97.80 → 98.66] You can do it.
[98.84 → 99.20] Is this doing something?
[99.20 → 100.26] Yeah, it's not doing anything.
[100.38 → 101.54] Oh, is that as low as yours goes?
[101.92 → 102.60] Try lifting it.
[102.60 → 108.40] Oh, so yours just doesn't go as low.
[108.94 → 110.58] Because it's like a bigger person chair.
[110.70 → 110.90] Yeah.
[111.14 → 111.70] Okay, well, fine.
[111.78 → 113.40] I'll just lift my chair up a bit.
[113.74 → 114.34] There we go.
[114.38 → 115.40] Yeah, this is as low as my chair is.
[115.40 → 116.06] All right.
[116.42 → 117.28] We got this.
[117.34 → 118.02] Oh, no, no, no, no.
[118.16 → 119.50] My chair isn't higher.
[119.60 → 120.54] No, I just lifted mine, though.
[121.00 → 121.28] Oh.
[121.42 → 121.60] Yeah.
[121.60 → 123.46] There we go.
[123.48 → 124.00] Now my chair is lower.
[124.00 → 127.60] Now we look like the same species, at least, even if he's a larger specimen.
[129.24 → 130.12] What else we got?
[130.18 → 135.04] The Reddit CEO actively altered and censored user comments.
[135.30 → 140.16] And Canada wants software backdoors, mandatory decryption capability, and record storage for,
[140.32 → 143.18] I believe, at least a year of everything you do on any service.
[143.72 → 144.16] Cool.
[144.84 → 145.64] Oh, Canada.
[146.00 → 147.20] Freaking man.
[147.90 → 149.92] So don't say anything bad about anything.
[149.92 → 152.28] And everything you do will always be tracked forever.
[153.68 → 155.86] Why is it going so slow?
[157.12 → 158.96] Does that seem, like, broken?
[163.50 → 164.02] Weird.
[164.32 → 165.42] Is the audio screwed?
[165.88 → 167.04] I have no idea.
[168.36 → 172.34] I'm sure Twitch chat is, like, spanning out about it by now, if it is.
[172.52 → 178.12] It was like, LOL, WTF, 5 FPS, you suck, LOL, freaking noobs.
[178.12 → 180.30] You'd think they'd figured out by now, LOL.
[180.58 → 182.22] Are you even reading this or are you just guessing?
[182.54 → 185.34] I read, like, a couple comments and then I guess.
[185.44 → 185.94] Oh, yeah.
[186.08 → 187.32] No, I see it.
[187.42 → 187.86] I see it.
[187.86 → 187.96] Yeah.
[187.96 → 188.30] Yeah.
[188.74 → 189.76] It was pretty accurate.
[189.88 → 190.48] That's fine.
[191.74 → 192.60] No problem.
[193.38 → 194.04] No problem.
[194.92 → 195.70] That's fine.
[195.88 → 196.90] The sponsor spots work.
[196.98 → 198.04] That's all that matters anyway.
[198.28 → 198.66] Hell yeah.
[198.74 → 200.16] We're going to rename the WAN show.
[200.26 → 201.68] It's just going to be the sponsor show.
[202.12 → 207.46] I mean, based on that, the sponsor segment was, like, the most popular part of last week's WAN show anyway.
[207.64 → 209.92] We might as well just do an entire show only of sponsors.
[210.06 → 211.66] We should probably do that.
[212.04 → 219.10] This show, sponsored by Canada, not giving a bleep word about your privacy or rights at all as a person.
[219.10 → 221.90] No, I don't want them as a sponsor.
[223.90 → 225.34] No, no, I mean real sponsors.
[225.46 → 226.28] Okay, okay, think about it.
[226.30 → 228.42] Because you know how there's, like, an awareness to everything.
[228.56 → 232.02] There's, like, Breast Cancer Awareness Month and there's, like, November.
[232.28 → 239.86] Is there, like, a blatant, shameless advertising celebration?
[240.98 → 242.84] Like, is there, like, Sellout Month?
[243.14 → 244.38] Could we create this?
[244.38 → 244.86] Yes.
[245.18 → 250.78] So, to kick off Sellout Month, we do an entire WAN show of nothing but sponsor spots.
[251.50 → 252.86] We should see if Nick could sell it.
[255.80 → 257.12] He probably could.
[258.22 → 259.82] I think Nick can sell anything.
[260.82 → 262.68] The live demonstration show?
[263.54 → 266.00] We show a live demonstration of every single sponsor's product?
[266.20 → 266.62] Mm-hmm.
[266.98 → 268.56] How would we show a live, like, we could spend...
[268.56 → 271.58] You get a 15-minute segment, and we use your product for 15 minutes on stream.
[271.58 → 274.42] We could spend 15 minutes creating a Squarespace site.
[274.60 → 274.80] Yeah.
[275.12 → 275.80] That could be done.
[276.00 → 276.20] Yeah.
[276.36 → 277.98] We could spend 15 minutes...
[277.98 → 282.06] We could partially disassemble a device with an fixity kit.
[282.06 → 284.96] We wouldn't be able to finish anything, but we could do that.
[285.08 → 286.96] We could, like, expense some stuff.
[287.32 → 288.36] With FreshBooks.
[288.56 → 288.62] Yeah.
[289.16 → 290.24] We could shave.
[290.98 → 291.86] Oh, I need to.
[291.96 → 292.46] Dollar Shave.
[292.86 → 294.40] I think it could be done.
[294.54 → 294.76] Yeah.
[294.96 → 295.86] I think it could be done.
[295.96 → 296.10] Yeah.
[296.20 → 296.82] What else have we got?
[297.12 → 299.76] We could make a call if we hosted it in the States and used Ting.
[300.12 → 300.38] Yep.
[300.38 → 304.00] And then we could make another call and use Discord.
[304.52 → 304.86] Yes.
[305.10 → 305.42] Yes.
[306.18 → 307.00] A VoIP call.
[307.00 → 307.44] Internet, yeah.
[307.70 → 308.02] That's right.
[308.20 → 313.02] While you're calling people, I can cook stuff with a Chef Steps jewel.
[313.86 → 314.16] Yeah.
[314.44 → 317.38] No, that could be, like, the one that runs in the background of the entire show and then
[317.38 → 318.10] we eat it at the end.
[318.16 → 321.46] So it's, like, 10 minutes of preparation and then five minutes of eating it.
[321.58 → 321.82] Yep.
[321.82 → 326.82] So we could host the show on an Intel NUC.
[328.06 → 328.46] One sec.
[329.38 → 329.94] Hi, Mom.
[330.00 → 330.74] You're on the WAN show.
[333.14 → 335.78] I feel like it's been a while since we've, uh...
[335.78 → 335.80] One second.
[335.80 → 336.18] One second.
[336.86 → 337.54] Oh, boy.
[337.62 → 338.00] There we go.
[338.04 → 338.82] You're on speaker, Mom.
[338.92 → 339.58] Oh, boy.
[340.28 → 341.38] Hi, Linus.
[341.60 → 342.04] Hey.
[342.24 → 343.10] How's it going?
[343.84 → 344.82] It's been so long.
[344.90 → 345.54] I miss you.
[345.60 → 345.90] I know.
[345.98 → 349.34] I love it when you call into the show live like this without announcing it first.
[349.96 → 351.08] I know you love it.
[351.12 → 352.26] That's why I do it.
[353.64 → 354.42] What's up, Mom?
[354.48 → 355.44] To what do I owe the pleasure?
[355.44 → 358.84] I would need to know Luke's shoe size.
[359.14 → 360.14] Luke's shoe size.
[361.14 → 361.52] Okay.
[361.78 → 364.70] Now, I fully understand that he wouldn't know this.
[366.14 → 368.42] But were you really expecting me to know?
[369.84 → 371.62] I thought you were in charge of him.
[372.34 → 374.04] I know his sweater size.
[375.04 → 376.78] So I can meet you halfway here.
[377.90 → 378.62] Is that your child?
[378.90 → 379.20] Yes.
[379.60 → 380.60] Hello, Stephanie's child.
[380.66 → 383.24] Oh, the wardrobe ladies are saying hello.
[383.42 → 383.66] Hello?
[384.22 → 384.54] Hello?
[385.44 → 391.16] It's generally a 12, Mom.
[391.28 → 394.44] It can range from 11 to 13, but it's usually a 12.
[394.52 → 395.32] You set this up.
[395.62 → 399.62] You had your mom call into WAN Show and ask about your shoe size just so you could talk about it.
[400.14 → 402.36] Just so you could talk about how big your shoes are.
[402.72 → 404.48] I know why you want to talk about that.
[404.48 → 406.50] I think that's semi-average for like a tall dude.
[407.60 → 408.88] Linus, just leave it alone.
[408.88 → 416.28] All right.
[416.34 → 417.34] Thanks for calling in.
[417.60 → 418.06] Bye, Mom.
[418.10 → 418.54] I love you.
[418.76 → 419.02] Bye.
[419.02 → 419.54] Bye.
[419.64 → 420.12] Love you, too.
[420.20 → 420.46] Bye.
[422.42 → 423.28] Oh, wow.
[423.44 → 424.06] All right.
[424.22 → 425.10] So...
[425.10 → 428.16] Linus, just leave it alone.
[428.16 → 434.00] Oh, my God.
[434.00 → 434.68] That was good.
[434.76 → 435.22] All right.
[435.30 → 437.40] Let's move into our first topic here.
[437.54 → 444.34] Twitter says it will ban Trump if he breaks hate speech rules.
[444.34 → 448.38] So this was originally posted on Quartz.com.
[448.78 → 448.98] Quartz.
[448.98 → 452.18] And the article is...
[452.18 → 453.78] Just...
[453.78 → 455.40] I mean, the way it begins is great.
[455.52 → 457.42] Twitter's been fighting hate speech for years.
[457.54 → 459.04] Some would argue not very successfully.
[459.40 → 463.62] Now it faces what may be the world's most powerful troll.
[463.96 → 467.32] The President of the United States.
[468.28 → 469.40] It has the best memes.
[470.36 → 470.88] So...
[470.88 → 471.82] The greatest memes.
[471.82 → 476.04] Facebook has already indicated to Slate...
[476.04 → 478.36] So there's another article here from Facebook...
[478.36 → 479.64] From Facebook.com.
[479.76 → 480.08] From...
[480.08 → 481.24] Please load.
[481.50 → 482.70] From Slate.com.
[482.76 → 483.24] Here we go.
[483.54 → 486.34] Would Facebook or Twitter ever ban President Trump?
[486.44 → 487.52] One says it wouldn't.
[487.76 → 488.92] One says it would.
[488.92 → 494.02] So Facebook has already said they are willing to bend the rules for President-elect Trump.
[494.18 → 497.74] Twitter told Slate no one is exempt from their rules.
[497.92 → 499.20] Not even the president.
[499.84 → 501.36] And you know what I have to say to that?
[501.36 → 502.64] That is good for you, Twitter.
[503.20 → 507.94] So Twitter has recently suspended the accounts of several leading pundits and activists from
[507.94 → 509.24] the alt-right.
[511.04 → 516.58] Which has been linked with notions of white supremacy, white nationalism, and anti-Semitism.
[516.58 → 522.24] So asked whether Twitter would consider banning government officials, the Twitter spokesperson
[522.24 → 530.34] said the Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account
[530.34 → 531.10] abuse.
[531.10 → 533.76] Wow.
[534.02 → 539.64] Honestly, like, being a person who admins a forum, you own your platform.
[539.64 → 543.26] If you want to do that, you want to do that.
[543.32 → 546.58] Like, I'm not going to tell Twitter or Facebook how to run their stuff, because I wouldn't
[546.58 → 548.28] want them to tell me how to run my stuff.
[548.74 → 551.42] And like, we ban people for various reasons.
[551.42 → 553.36] But, hold on a second.
[553.36 → 559.22] You wouldn't tell them how to run their stuff, but could you not make the argument that due
[559.22 → 561.00] to their ubiquity...
[561.00 → 561.40] Their size?
[561.60 → 563.68] Their size, their scale, their impact.
[563.68 → 564.62] I don't think they should.
[564.62 → 571.22] Though there's been a lot of debate, and I think Facebook has come out and said they
[571.22 → 575.34] don't feel like they influenced the election one way or the other, or they didn't think
[575.34 → 576.78] that there was proof that they had.
[577.08 → 583.10] I think that's stupid for them to say something like that, that they didn't influence it one
[583.10 → 583.84] way or the other.
[585.76 → 592.00] And given their size, given their scale, do you feel like, while we are not legally entitled
[592.00 → 595.30] to tell them how to operate their platform, do you feel like they have a social responsibility
[595.30 → 595.98] to do it?
[596.34 → 598.04] Social responsibility to ban him, though.
[598.24 → 604.02] No, social responsibility to enforce the rules equally to all people, regardless of whether
[604.02 → 609.32] it's just, it creates, like, a PR poop storm for them.
[609.76 → 611.76] I think it depends, personally.
[611.86 → 615.28] Because, like, one way that you could look at it is, like, yeah, this is bannable stuff.
[615.28 → 620.36] But then he's a leader of a country where probably the majority of your users are from.
[620.36 → 621.82] Mm-hmm.
[621.92 → 629.14] So, like, there's being informed and knowledgeable about extremely important things that are
[629.14 → 630.04] happening in your country.
[630.24 → 634.28] And then there's, like, Joe Blow down the block being a dick.
[634.76 → 635.20] Right.
[635.74 → 640.52] And I think there, whether the comments might be the same.
[640.92 → 645.84] Okay, so if you're saying, you're saying if someone important is a dick, they should get
[645.84 → 646.58] special treatment.
[647.20 → 647.66] But that's...
[647.66 → 648.64] How are you draining the swamp?
[648.64 → 652.64] No, that's just to spread knowledge about...
[653.32 → 654.60] It's different when it's a president.
[654.70 → 655.78] It's not just someone important.
[655.92 → 657.16] It's the President of the United States.
[657.56 → 658.00] It, like...
[658.00 → 658.16] Elect.
[658.42 → 659.00] It's a...
[659.00 → 659.28] Elect.
[659.40 → 659.64] Whatever.
[659.84 → 660.04] Yes.
[660.92 → 662.00] It's a tier above.
[662.14 → 662.56] You know what I mean?
[662.58 → 666.08] And you need to know what's going on with your president or prime minister or whoever
[666.08 → 667.10] is the leader of your country.
[667.30 → 668.48] You need to know what's going on.
[668.56 → 669.72] I think that's an important thing.
[669.98 → 671.96] I like to be informed about what Trudeau's doing.
[672.28 → 673.24] I like to be informed about what...
[673.24 → 673.90] Do you like it?
[674.20 → 674.52] Trump is doing it?
[674.52 → 675.32] Do you enjoy it?
[675.32 → 678.22] I don't necessarily enjoy it, but I think it's an important thing.
[678.22 → 678.98] Knowledge is important.
[679.06 → 681.38] The last week hasn't been a high point for...
[681.38 → 682.38] No, it hasn't.
[682.38 → 682.74] ...PM Trudeau.
[682.84 → 683.62] It really hasn't.
[683.74 → 686.70] But knowing that he has said those things is important.
[687.34 → 689.70] And I would like to see that feed.
[690.14 → 690.48] Okay.
[690.88 → 691.28] So then...
[691.28 → 696.94] I think knowledge goes above not necessarily feeling comfortable all the time.
[697.18 → 699.56] So I would want to know what is being said.
[699.64 → 700.80] Whether I agree with it.
[700.82 → 701.34] It doesn't matter.
[701.44 → 703.28] I would want to be able to see that.
[703.36 → 703.66] Okay.
[704.00 → 704.40] So...
[704.40 → 705.06] So...
[705.06 → 705.30] Okay.
[705.48 → 706.40] I mean, honestly...
[706.40 → 706.66] So here.
[706.76 → 709.24] I got to straw poll this because we got to hear from you guys.
[710.60 → 711.88] Should presidents...
[711.88 → 713.94] I think it would be hilarious if he was banned.
[714.86 → 715.62] Have a...
[715.62 → 717.24] Let's call it like a so-called...
[717.88 → 719.24] A diplomatic immunity...
[719.24 → 720.70] Yeah.
[721.70 → 724.60] ...to social media bans.
[724.92 → 725.24] Should presidents...
[725.90 → 726.34] PMs...
[726.34 → 727.48] Heads of state...
[727.48 → 728.24] We're going to go...
[729.06 → 730.06] Yes, no.
[731.34 → 732.14] Create poll.
[732.24 → 735.60] Let's go ahead and drop this in the Twitch chat so you guys can start hitting us with these.
[736.36 → 736.68] But...
[736.68 → 737.70] Someone in chat's like...
[737.70 → 742.86] So basically Luke is saying make sure all politicians have a platform to say stupid bleep word on.
[743.42 → 748.94] The thing is, if they're saying all this stupid bleep word stuff, elect someone else.
[749.24 → 755.00] Or use those things to campaign against them so that your country elects someone else.
[755.00 → 765.02] I don't personally enjoy living in ignorance and hiding everything away so that I don't know what's going on so that I don't feel bad about things that other people are saying.
[765.14 → 769.68] I would rather know what other people are saying, feel bad about it, but know what's going on more.
[769.76 → 770.60] That's me personally.
[771.32 → 774.80] Like I said earlier, I don't want to tell these platforms what they need to do.
[774.80 → 779.92] But like we have a rule on the forum where you can attack us.
[780.94 → 782.92] We don't like you attacking other users.
[784.10 → 787.88] And personally, I would enforce that whether it's President Trump or not.
[788.74 → 789.80] President Trump came on the forum...
[790.86 → 791.88] And attacked our users.
[792.24 → 792.90] And was like, I would ban him.
[793.38 → 793.68] Right.
[794.82 → 796.38] That's the way I'm going to do it.
[796.78 → 797.80] I don't feel like...
[797.80 → 803.84] But you're also saying that Facebook isn't outright wrong.
[803.96 → 804.90] I don't want them to.
[805.62 → 805.88] You don't want them to.
[805.88 → 807.32] If I was them, it might be different.
[807.48 → 809.94] I don't want them to because I want to be able to see what he's doing.
[810.64 → 811.46] As a user.
[811.94 → 812.30] Interesting.
[814.06 → 816.14] As a user, I don't care if he's making fun of me.
[816.96 → 820.48] I want to be able to see what he's doing because I care about knowledge.
[820.48 → 826.74] As an admin of the Linus Actives forum, I don't want anyone making fun of my users or attacking different people on my platform.
[827.40 → 831.22] If they attack us, if they're like, wow, they made this video.
[831.58 → 834.46] There's such NVIDIA shills is common.
[835.28 → 836.24] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[836.36 → 837.14] I hate these guys.
[837.94 → 848.90] Like someone created a thread in the general section of the forum not that long ago in a response to mine and John's video on MacBook RAM.
[848.90 → 849.60] Mm-hmm.
[849.74 → 849.90] Yeah.
[850.48 → 856.82] Saying that we were horribly ill-informed, and he was looking for other YouTube channels to go watch.
[857.30 → 857.48] Yep.
[857.54 → 858.52] I didn't pull that down.
[858.66 → 859.50] I didn't ban that guy.
[859.64 → 860.86] I didn't give him warning points or anything.
[861.14 → 870.28] It made me sad, but he was left completely alone because that's how I think we should be running the forum.
[871.46 → 879.42] So you think, okay, so on our forum, President Trump would be allowed to attack us, but he would not be allowed to attack other users.
[879.42 → 880.46] Yeah.
[880.46 → 881.66] So, but then...
[881.66 → 882.76] That's how I...
[882.76 → 912.76] 
[912.76 → 914.00] Yeah.
[914.00 → 920.50] chips for him. Yes. Would you feel the same way if you or it's great that your mom called in
[920.50 → 925.72] if it was your mom being attacked on Twitter or on Facebook how would you feel about Facebook
[925.72 → 933.04] not banning a bully no matter who they are if they were campaigning against your mother
[933.04 → 938.96] for being a cast member of let's say a show for example for I think that happened right
[938.96 → 944.72] with I don't remember the name of it, but there was a show yeah so some show in my opinion my mom is an
[944.72 → 952.34] extremely wonderful lady and I truly believe that people would back up my mom because she's a
[952.34 → 959.82] wonderful person, and I'd love to believe that I would like to have the knowledge out there that
[959.82 → 966.64] this theoretical person is attacking my lovely mom and if someone would do that they would be a
[966.64 → 972.96] deplorable person but if someone came on the Linus Tech Tips forum personally attacking your
[972.96 → 977.50] mother they would be banned within seconds oh yeah nanoseconds yeah but on another platform
[977.50 → 985.46] my mom is a user on the forum but on another platform okay I mean I'm uh so Twitter is a
[985.46 → 991.22] platform that people very specifically use for like political things and has been set up to be very good
[991.22 → 996.18] for that Linus Tech Tips is not a platform at all that has been set up for political things
[996.18 → 1001.54] in the slightest right it is a technology discussion community it is not the same place
[1001.54 → 1011.02] and it will be admin and moderated as such okay well 75 percent of you or so say that presidents and PMs
[1011.02 → 1017.92] should not have diplomatic immunity to social media bans with 25 percent of you approximately about a
[1017.92 → 1024.16] quarter of you saying that they should to be clear have immunity I respect and totally understand the
[1024.16 → 1029.74] people voting against my thing, and again I would probably run the platform differently yeah just
[1029.74 → 1035.50] as a user I appreciate the knowledge interesting okay I want to be able to know what's going on
[1035.50 → 1040.22] maybe it's not on Facebook and Twitter, and he has some other place that's fine just as far as I
[1040.22 → 1046.16] know he doesn't really he just tweets things I don't know um that's the only place I monitor I don't
[1046.16 → 1051.86] follow him so that he doesn't get more followers even though he has so many but like I don't know
[1051.86 → 1059.56] oh man uh I don't actually know if it made it into the uh the doc this week 140 characters for
[1059.56 → 1066.24] politic talks Luke dumb that's literally what it's for what some guy was like calling me dumb because
[1066.24 → 1071.28] it's only 140 character for like politicians because twit longer doesn't exist because putting one out of
[1071.28 → 1075.26] four two out of four three out of four out of four at the end of tweets doesn't exist because
[1075.26 → 1080.30] taking pictures of something and then posting it doesn't exist and linking off to another site
[1080.30 → 1086.88] and because pms don't exist or dms as they call them on that platform yes, yes so um yeah there's that
[1086.88 → 1093.16] uh on the subject of President Trump and his twitter followers do you know that as the president
[1093.16 → 1102.12] he can SMS the entire country right okay oh my god I don't think any president has ever actually
[1102.12 → 1109.18] used it but if there was anyone who was gonna who was gonna SMS because it's its mostly like the
[1109.18 → 1114.38] network exists this person made fun of me go look at her porno SMS entire country emergency like
[1114.38 → 1119.06] information and stuff like that that makes sense yeah there's like three different like oh my god
[1119.06 → 1123.22] can access it yeah like things that would be extremely got to the chopper that kind of thing
[1123.22 → 1132.16] um but uh but yeah yeah president-elect trump will have the keys to texting everybody's cell phones
[1132.16 → 1133.54] oh man at three in the morning
[1133.54 → 1142.36] well no, no no, no you've shown no see comments like that you show a clear misunderstanding of
[1142.36 → 1148.48] time zones because it cannot be three in the morning across the entire country
[1148.48 → 1155.52] right the the US of an is a very big place okay we're talking three different time zones
[1155.52 → 1159.92] that more if you count Hawaii I was just going to say what yep there's more they're important too
[1159.92 → 1168.24] yep to someone oh Hawaiians they have a really cool observatory so I mean to be clear i I love Hawaii
[1168.24 → 1173.44] I actually have never been there have you not been there I went for AMD's uh Hawaii GP oh yeah
[1173.44 → 1180.88] yeah it's beautiful yeah it's awesome um it makes sense yeah but um but they just they kind of get
[1180.88 → 1185.28] forgotten in the whole how many time zones why do you ever waste space uploading this to YouTube why
[1185.28 → 1191.44] do you ever waste time watching it ask yourself maybe they're not watching it maybe that's like
[1191.44 → 1197.28] maybe like trump they are specifically not following us so we don't get any more followers they're sitting
[1197.28 → 1202.48] at their computer kind of looking at the screen like this right so all they can see is the chat window
[1202.48 → 1206.80] and they're not watching it, and they have they pop out the chat, and then they close the stream the
[1206.80 → 1213.68] finger in the ear the shoulder against the other ear, and they're going I am warriorlike my keyboard
[1215.44 → 1219.20] that's what they probably look like right now so good oh my god
[1220.08 → 1227.04] so good all right speaking of Canada things and being informed and caring about knowledge
[1227.04 → 1233.44] original article here is from Tom's hardware yeah this is why I like to know what's going on because
[1234.32 → 1239.84] I mean between this and the Fidel Castro thing it has not been a proud week for Canada no it hasn't
[1239.84 → 1244.80] it's funny because I've been really enjoying all my smug Canadianism over the last little bit since
[1244.80 → 1249.92] the Americans elected trump yeah but I'm I'm not I'm not having a good time this where's the happy in
[1249.92 → 1259.04] between man I know right the beginning of this bill was not proposed by his party um but this one
[1259.04 → 1265.20] should have been axed by his party, and it has not been so literally not better is how I'm going to apply
[1265.20 → 1272.24] that anyway Canada wants software backdoors mandatory decryption capability and record storage
[1272.24 → 1279.68] extensive record storage for everything so you know what's hilarious is did you also read because i
[1279.68 → 1286.64] was reading some article somewhere saying he was going to kill c51 no, no no, no nothing he said that
[1286.64 → 1295.12] yeah um he's expanding it no, no no um dick hole um it's weird yeah i think i think dick is
[1295.12 → 1300.56] considered a swear in the same way that pussy is like I think it's one of those like it's not an f-bomb
[1300.56 → 1307.52] but it's also not he'll like I think it sits in this awkward in between right but if President Trump can say
[1307.52 → 1311.44] pussy then you should probably be able to say dick
[1315.68 → 1318.88] I'm down I'm down it's 2016 say what you want
[1320.56 → 1327.76] uh just don't expect the government to not be able to decrypt it and look at it yeah and store it so uh
[1327.76 → 1333.84] man I forget what I said right right right so i i I had read some article about someone
[1333.84 → 1338.48] wanting to move like a backup of the internet onto storage servers in Canada or something because
[1338.48 → 1344.56] they were worried about like President Trump something like yeah I understand google the UK is a mess right now oh yeah
[1345.28 → 1351.68] Canada looks like it's going to be a mess yeah the US is who knows google Canadian spy palace
[1351.68 → 1360.08] it sounds just as amazing as it is just check it out Canada like Canada's not doing as great as a lot
[1360.08 → 1367.12] of people think yeah let's move up there oh they're screwed whoops um anyway yeah so last year Canada passed
[1367.12 → 1373.68] an anti-terrorism law called bill c51 which just like screwed over everyone who wasn't a terrorist and was
[1373.68 → 1379.12] extremely easy to bypass by anyone who like actually really wanted to do anything bad exactly like this one
[1379.12 → 1383.76] will be because you can still use VPNs and stuff it will just cost more money to get a good one
[1384.72 → 1392.48] you idiots god-damn it, and it's not like VPNs are hard to like google it's like how do I get away from
[1392.48 → 1398.16] people tracking my oh wow every single website has made a thing about using VPNs tunnel bear a sponsor
[1398.16 → 1403.12] today no they're not unfortunately they should yeah like what country is going to be safe to tunnel
[1403.12 → 1409.12] through at a certain point uh well there's like there 's's uh what are they called bunker
[1410.24 → 1415.28] bunker ISP bunker servers something like that okay they like literally host their stuff in a bunker
[1415.28 → 1419.76] and I believe Sweden it's where it's where the pirate bay was hosted and stuff how'd that work out
[1419.76 → 1425.12] for them uh pretty good they never got the servers I don't think I don't think they ever got into the bunker
[1425.12 → 1433.44] there's like there are places you can VPN through um of course you don't see um no
[1435.44 → 1441.04] the government has complained aw about not being able to intercept communications oh that's so
[1441.04 → 1445.84] unfortunate and that it should be allowed to intercept uh allowed to use intercept capability
[1445.84 → 1450.48] against some service providers I feel so bad for you, you could use a warrant I don't know if you've ever
[1450.48 → 1456.16] heard of that um, but it's a thing that you can use to do this kind of stuff if you need to instead
[1456.16 → 1460.40] of just doing it to everyone all the time so they're allowing back doors that they're asking
[1460.40 → 1466.32] for back doors that will allow this interception and warrantless access to basic subscriber information
[1467.60 → 1474.80] um so yeah the Canadian service intelligence service which is CS is
[1474.80 → 1481.92] security intelligence service instead of uh Isis surprisingly close oh that's maybe a bad
[1481.92 → 1489.52] this is not comparable to a terrorist organization that was a little rough jeez in other things about
[1489.52 → 1495.12] privacy and things changing and whatnot Reddit CEO actively altered and censored user comments i
[1495.12 → 1500.96] believe this was in the Donald or whatever that crazy yeah it was in the Donald sub Subreddit um
[1500.96 → 1507.36] um, so there was a thing that was like f you uh you slash sees which is supposed to tag him but it
[1507.36 → 1513.28] doesn't work he turned that off a long time ago um because people were mad about him setting
[1513.28 → 1522.24] down a Subreddit called Pizzagate which was about people uh theory crafting the idea that there was
[1522.24 → 1528.96] potentially a pedophilia ring involving people at the highest levels of the Democratic Party operating out of
[1528.96 → 1534.80] a Washington pizza restaurant that they got this information out of emails that were leaked through
[1534.80 → 1540.88] WikiLeaks I read some of them they're actually pretty quick um anyway they're they're weird emo like
[1540.88 → 1545.52] regardless of what's going on their weird I know that's all I have to say I don't know what's going on
[1545.52 → 1556.16] but them are some weird emails um so he changed the comments from being against him to being against
[1556.16 → 1562.80] moderators of the Donald if I remember correctly yeah I was reading this article and like the way
[1562.80 → 1569.52] the guy convoluted the way he handled it was very childish yes yeah so sees screwed up real bad
[1570.64 → 1577.76] um I don't know I mean this is shortly following um like when people are attacking you
[1577.76 → 1581.92] a perfect way to deal with it is just like being mature
[1584.40 → 1590.64] usually I don't know not that we're the kings of no we're not but like when that dude attacked us and
[1590.64 → 1597.60] was like what are some people I can go watch that aren't you can just ignore it yeah just let it blow
[1597.60 → 1603.68] over or if you need to address something just address it and then let it fly over yeah address it properly
[1603.68 → 1609.92] and fully and then move on yeah and sometimes addressing it just means sorry my bad which is
[1609.92 → 1613.52] yeah which he did after should have done it before yeah should have done it in the first place but
[1613.52 → 1620.24] maybe he learned um I mean this comes I mean Ellen Powell when did she resign was that even a year
[1620.24 → 1625.36] ago a year and a bit yeah it feels like it wasn't that long ago I don't know but didn't she do stupid
[1625.36 → 1630.88] stuff I don't remember what it was or so whoa no, no she closed down the fat shaming Reddit I think
[1630.88 → 1634.72] something like that I don't remember what she I don't remember what it was but basically I mean
[1634.72 → 1640.56] one of the comments in the article here was even she didn't change user comments because and this
[1640.56 → 1646.48] is that's that's brutal that's a pretty sensitive topic especially on a platform that is supposed to
[1646.48 → 1651.60] be front page of the internet you know like a kind of free speech yeah um what has happened
[1651.60 → 1656.72] on Linus tech tips is we've edited user comments before yeah but I say I edit it but what happens is
[1656.72 → 1662.16] there's a flag that goes on the bottom that says who it was edited by and a reason and we usually
[1662.16 → 1667.68] post in the thread saying that it happened, and the edits are like usually hilarious like we'll take
[1667.68 → 1673.04] someone like insulting another user with crazy slurs and swear words and stuff and make it like rainbows
[1673.04 → 1677.92] and bunnies and happiness and stuff yep and then say that it was edited by us like we've done stuff
[1677.92 → 1685.68] like that before, but we're very clear I've done stuff like if someone posts um like uh, uh like a guide to
[1685.68 → 1690.80] something and refers to my video that I did on it or something, and they weren't sure where it was
[1691.36 → 1696.88] like I'll go in and I'll put it in and I'll put it like a thing at the bottom edit edited by Linus
[1696.88 → 1704.88] admin added YouTube link yeah yeah I mean we tell them that it was there are transparent and harmless ways
[1704.88 → 1711.12] to edit user comments on a site and this especially and non-destructive because we can just go into the
[1711.12 → 1716.40] history and see what it was did you expect people not to notice yeah that part's pretty weird eh like
[1716.40 → 1725.52] that's the thing is if it had been a subtle edit like changing it to a misspelling or something or like
[1725.52 → 1731.60] even i I don't know especially like an angry personal attack changing the subject of it yeah
[1732.16 → 1737.12] yeah because those people are going to get tagged yeah they're gonna notice, and they were moderators of
[1737.12 → 1740.80] the Donald like you don't think they're going to jump on that I don't have the whole thing was just odd
[1742.00 → 1749.60] just poorly planned, so his statement is funny that was Brandon hey everyone yup i messed with
[1749.60 → 1757.04] the f you span comments replacing span with are the Donald admins for our mods for about an hour it's been
[1757.04 → 1763.12] a long week here trying to unwind the r slash Pizzagate stuff as much as we try to maintain a good
[1763.12 → 1769.44] relationship with you all it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly as the CEO I shouldn't
[1769.44 → 1776.16] play such games, and it's all fixed now our community team is pretty pissed at me so i most assuredly
[1776.16 → 1782.64] won't do this again and there were some leaked screenshots of the community team's slack which
[1782.64 → 1789.92] one of you guys needs to not leak that because that's lame, but the slack was like very unhappy
[1789.92 → 1795.44] because it's like the Reddit admins that need to go like clean all this yeah now it's their
[1795.44 → 1803.12] problem yeah, and they're like oh god it would have been super cool if my day hadn't been completely
[1803.12 → 1812.40] ruined by you yeah, thanks for that pretty much um speaking of days being completely ruined this is
[1812.40 → 1819.44] such a great show this is the best show the best show it's the greatest show no one else could make a
[1819.44 → 1826.40] show like our show yeah what the flicks original article here from tom Herbert no I got it do not want
[1827.04 → 1833.04] notifications sorry what are you asking notifications what hold on, but you know what I realized
[1833.04 → 1841.52] I am doing this wrong what I need to view this page in the best browser oh god the greatest browser come on
[1841.52 → 1849.84] now Microsoft Edge no I mean look at this look at how these ads are chopped off halfway on the page
[1849.84 → 1856.56] nice you know what it's like halfway ad block its oh why is it zoomed 250 I don't know edge and wait
[1856.56 → 1867.36] what is 100 why is it 100 look like this what why are you terrible like that's Tom's Tom's isn't formatted
[1867.36 → 1874.08] barley why are you so terrible well no look at chrome did it just fine look here's chrome yep my oh
[1874.08 → 1880.00] oh again oh shoot that's not edge's fault yeah that no that's not edge's fault hold on I got this
[1880.72 → 1887.84] really anyway okay, okay okay tell them what's going on net Netflix 4k streaming is going to require
[1887.84 → 1898.80] a baby lake processor Windows 10 and edge browser so considering I've had so many endless problems
[1898.80 → 1904.96] with Windows 10 and streaming at home and I'm planning on going back to Windows 7 the obvious solution
[1904.96 → 1912.56] is to go to an immature browser on a brand-new platform from intel all at the same time for the
[1912.56 → 1921.68] the best user experience yes wow yep wow the best part is that it's completely unnecessary, although it's
[1921.68 → 1927.52] probably because it's using something crazy yeah it's probably hardware coding support for 10-bit
[1927.52 → 1936.80] HEVC which I guess the question from my side would be why can't we use software decoding
[1936.80 → 1946.64] just like we can right now yeah this very moment exactly right now I do actually understand why
[1947.28 → 1955.36] play ready 3.0 hardware based DRM it has to do okay so yes so play ready 3.0 is a hardware based DRM system
[1955.36 → 1962.64] that requires to be dedicated and supported decoding hardware uh which prevents the video stream from being
[1962.64 → 1970.00] captured in software or via an external capture device don't you just love DRM I actually had a
[1970.00 → 1976.08] great week with DRM this week nice yeah and so did john everyone had a great week with DRM awesome john
[1976.08 → 1984.16] wanted to capture some PS4 pro gameplay yeah and uh and discovered that due to the HDMI 2.0 implementation
[1984.16 → 1991.20] of the PS4 pro our capture card just straight up couldn't do it that was great yeah and I was trying to
[1991.20 → 2000.40] do my evaluation of 4k Blu-ray with legitimate discs on an Xbox One S a legitimate player with a high-end
[2000.40 → 2011.84] receiver from only with HDCP 2.2 and arguably the best HDR TV on the market LG signature OLED and thanks
[2011.84 → 2021.12] to HDCP 2.2 half the time my stuff wouldn't handshake nice wasn't it wonderful that's awesome yeah i
[2021.12 → 2028.80] thought it was wonderful DRM and hardware is great um yeah I mean especially when firmware updates
[2030.00 → 2036.08] upgrade the DRM and downgrade the functionality oh nice do you know how long it's been since I've
[2036.08 → 2046.08] been able to have my GTX 980 go directly into the HDCP 2.2 ports on my TV no since halfway through my review
[2046.08 → 2046.80] nice
[2049.76 → 2055.68] isn't that great god, so my understanding is it may actually be NVIDIA's fault on that one, and it's the
[2055.68 → 2059.76] kind of thing that doesn't come up a lot so I didn't mention it in my review, or it wasn't even
[2059.76 → 2070.08] really a review anyway, but the point is I am not a fan at all um and I'm even more not a fan now that i
[2070.08 → 2075.68] pay for media so like the last stream was like the don't have anything to talk about so we're
[2075.68 → 2079.68] just going to like talk about random stuff and laugh about things stream, and this stream is the like
[2079.68 → 2085.12] everything sucks everything is terrible there's lots of news it's just all terrible yeah um like
[2085.12 → 2090.00] oh you just all had a good Black Friday Cyber Monday little like spend all your money deal well get
[2090.00 → 2099.68] screwed speaking of getting screwed and spending all your money oh wow let's stuff some sponsor messages
[2099.68 → 2105.12] down your throats first up is vertical yeah they have gaming chairs, and you can check them out over
[2105.12 → 2113.52] at vertigear.com the line is uh great for overall comfort it just takes one person to assemble the chair
[2113.52 → 2118.72] and I know this for a fact because I was personally reassembling it before the stream not
[2119.36 → 2124.56] it was not vertical's fault there's a very clear thing no I'm going to lift it up no, no we're not
[2124.56 → 2129.92] going to have to let's just let's just do this the right way okay you see down there you see
[2129.92 → 2138.00] that sticker right there yeah so that sticker says front it's a white sticker with big capitalized bold
[2138.00 → 2144.32] red font it says front with an arrow so I had to reassemble this chair myself before the show because
[2144.32 → 2151.12] someone put it on backwards and I was sitting in the chair I was like this is really uncomfortable
[2151.12 → 2155.36] like I don't know if I want to do a sponsor spot for these guys because this thing's awful
[2156.80 → 2161.84] and it was assembled backwards put it the right way it's fine it's its pretty good all right so
[2161.84 → 2166.48] anyway glides very smoothly on any surface has a tall backrest meant for the neck shoulder and it
[2166.48 → 2171.12] has lumbar support built in instead of just adding a cushion to it like some uh you can adjust the seat to
[2171.12 → 2174.48] fit your height it has adjustable armrest the knob under the seat can be set in order to match your
[2174.48 → 2180.96] weight so you can rock yeah you can rock with these and the backrest can be altered from 80 degrees to
[2180.96 → 2193.84] 150 degrees Luke's chair oh it's the plus line yep yep yep so you know what's great too my shoulders
[2193.84 → 2200.80] don't actually you know what's hilarious even on the plus is you are effectively a plus
[2200.80 → 2205.68] size model right now but like I still don't fit so I'm like a plus size model you kind of are
[2205.68 → 2210.96] yep because my arm is like over top of this you are such an enormous hunk of man
[2212.56 → 2219.76] um so the plus size extra large construction on the padding and headset headrest to provide more
[2219.76 → 2225.44] support and uh glide also glide smoothly on any surface all mechanical parts are covered by leather
[2225.44 → 2230.32] and the material is easy to clean that'll be good for you because you can be very messy sometimes
[2231.36 → 2236.72] I remember that one time I came into your office and on your chair there was like a cereal bowl with
[2236.72 → 2242.96] milk all over it that was you don't pin that on me, I knew you were going there to don't pin that on me
[2242.96 → 2251.04] so you can check out vertical at uh vertigear.com and uh we will have a link and uh something etc at
[2251.04 → 2254.56] that spot below all right moving on to Squarespace
[2257.68 → 2268.88] square space is a space that's square or rectangular not but not a circle no unless you were to browse a
[2268.88 → 2274.96] square space website in on your watch oh and not this watch because this is not a circular watch
[2274.96 → 2279.12] but normally the watch I wear is a circle does android wear have a browser
[2281.84 → 2286.72] well whatever Squarespace allows you to make your website the way you want to make it as long as
[2286.72 → 2292.64] you do it on a browser in VR you could yes, but that would still wouldn't be a not really circle no
[2292.64 → 2297.52] you can move it around you could spin in a circle while you yeah so I guess we've achieved what
[2297.52 → 2304.96] we would still be viewing it in a sir if you spin it around in a circle, and you are within the circle
[2304.96 → 2310.72] would you be viewing it within a circle viewing it in a circle because like if you spin
[2310.72 → 2317.20] it around as you're as you're as you're rotating where is he going with this would you be within
[2317.20 → 2321.04] the circle that you're viewing it in so you could say that you're viewing it in a circle what if some
[2321.04 → 2325.76] of the people out there are legitimately wondering what squarespace is an easy to use
[2325.76 → 2331.60] website where you can make a website that's kind of is it in a nutshell isn't it yeah they have 24
[2331.60 → 2336.24] 7 tech support if you sign up for a year you get a domain for free it starts at 12 bucks a month yep
[2336.24 → 2342.40] um they all include a store so you could sell your craft or your whatever else the case tons of different
[2342.40 → 2346.48] themes so you can make it look nice even if you're not good at making things look nice like Squarespace
[2346.48 → 2351.68] you can make the page any way you want as long as it's one of their templates um which actually isn't
[2351.68 → 2356.48] which is a solid way to go yeah not as restrictive as it might sound uh they've got their cover pages
[2356.48 → 2362.48] feature which lets you set up a one-page online presence in minutes, and you can start a trial

[2374.40 → 2382.48] Wang from now on you got a whammy bar now the Wang show it's annoying isn't it Wang a little bit a
[2382.48 → 2387.68] little bit are you getting that from your kids nope Wang it sounds like it sounds kind of like it yeah
[2387.68 → 2393.44] but they're higher pitched than me actually even higher pitch uh speaking of my kids I feel like your
[2393.44 → 2398.72] voice has gotten considerably deeper since we started working together I'm I have a cold so that might have
[2398.72 → 2403.76] something to do with maybe the last couple of days yeah I've just really noticed Linus you really went
[2403.76 → 2411.36] through puberty lately good on you for that it's like the chill the aforementioned children are sort
[2411.36 → 2417.52] of evidence that the puberty did happen at least four and a half five years ago whatever the math works
[2417.52 → 2423.60] out too because that's the whole puberty thing is the cubic you know right area and the hair happened
[2423.60 → 2433.68] yeah, and then you know yeah what a little bit a little bit I don't know what that gesture means

[2501.92 → 2507.84] true story yes on my stream thing last night people brought up fresh books, and we're all talking
[2507.84 → 2513.12] about not all of them the ones that had used it we're talking about how they liked it and that's
[2513.12 → 2518.72] kind of cool we just had a cool story bro moment and then I talked I loved it no exactly yeah and then
[2518.72 → 2523.60] we talked about how like we will drop a sponsor if we genuinely think that we don't like them
[2523.60 → 2528.88] and then someone guessed which ones they were and I was like oh really heck do you know that
[2530.24 → 2536.00] yeah we generally don't uh kiss and tell they guessed like right away absolutely immediately
[2536.00 → 2541.68] it was weird I don't know maybe it was like Nick's alt account or something oh yeah I don't know yeah nick
[2541.68 → 2547.28] would know all the sponsors we've dropped yeah um all right let's move on to some more topics I guess
[2547.28 → 2557.12] we do have more topics right yeah um there was like a Netflix offline so they're they're like
[2557.92 → 2566.00] putting DRM up our butts, but they're also giving us a delicious uh offline viewing you know
[2566.64 → 2572.64] chocolate sundae so yeah I guess um as long as they don't get the chocolate and the butt mixed up
[2572.64 → 2578.88] then we should be pretty good uh Netflix finally lets you download shows and movies to watch
[2578.88 → 2588.40] offline this has been one of the biggest reasons asterisk small amount of that I have bought
[2588.40 → 2595.20] certain media because I intended to watch it on a plane so I'll buy it rip it throw it on Plex and then
[2595.20 → 2600.08] transcode it onto my devices which is an awful lot of work and if I could just since I have a Netflix
[2600.08 → 2606.16] account anyway if I could just download it and watch offline later it's its been confusing to me
[2606.16 → 2614.16] for some time that their licensing deal doesn't account for them to just be able to track through
[2614.16 → 2619.84] the app the next time you log in what you've watched and make sure that the payments are all
[2619.84 → 2627.36] processed correctly so with that said it's not like available for everything, but they announced that
[2627.36 → 2632.00] members can download in addition to streams series and films at no additional cost you just click the
[2632.00 → 2639.04] download button on the details page and uh currently orange is the new black Marcos and the crown are
[2639.04 → 2644.24] available for download as of November 30th 2016? Your Netflix app needs to be up-to-date to enable the
[2644.24 → 2652.96] feature, and it looks a little something like this pretty straightforward yep looks like a download button to me
[2652.96 → 2657.68] yep they did a good job of that download button look at how download that the line at the bottom
[2658.32 → 2662.64] I'm using the wrong mouse showing yeah look at that showing where down is yeah this well no this is the
[2662.64 → 2667.20] line at the bottom doesn't show where down is well it does, but it shows where the down that the arrow
[2667.20 → 2670.48] was pointing at would be which is what you said but in a different way
[2675.76 → 2678.32] Fitbit is reportedly close to buying pebble
[2678.32 → 2687.04] I really enjoyed the moment of silence for my uh my coherency there, and it was lost it was good
[2688.88 → 2696.64] Fitbit is reportedly buying pebble apparently for a small amount um pebble's CEO saying that money is
[2696.64 → 2703.84] pretty tight these days openly um just happened to my link there were offers to pebble in the past
[2703.84 → 2712.08] um that were much higher than what this offer and deal is apparently going to be apparently the pebble
[2712.08 → 2718.24] brand will be phased out um Fitbit will be taking pebble's intellectual property such as it sos
[2719.20 → 2728.08] etc maybe this is an ah maybe the smartwatches seem to be not doing well at all
[2728.08 → 2738.48] well you don't use one right nope I used to and then I was like wow it super drains the battery on
[2738.48 → 2744.24] my phone for like not a ton of benefit and then I stopped I would be fine if it didn't affect if it
[2744.24 → 2751.04] didn't uh adversely affect my phone, but it does so I don't know see I started and then there's the
[2751.04 → 2756.88] Neptune pine we all know about that I started using a smartwatch right around the time I switched to the
[2756.88 → 2765.84] droid turbo and since then I have leaned very heavily towards phones with just outrageous battery
[2765.84 → 2772.00] life like I might be able to do it now that I have my pixel right but like it was not a thing with the
[2772.00 → 2778.64] z5 I'm kind of disappointed nothing I've seen from Fitbit has particularly impressed me their software is
[2778.64 → 2787.20] just trash whereas pebble even though I was not a fan of the pebble time the pebble time felt like
[2787.20 → 2794.32] a cheap crappy device it felt like they were keeping out trying to eke out more margin
[2794.32 → 2799.68] which makes sense, and they ultimately compromised what could have been a very good user experience
[2799.68 → 2806.80] because I actually didn't mind the software like for third-party software it did a better job
[2806.80 → 2814.48] on iOS and android than I think apple could do on an android phone with the Apple Watch or that
[2815.20 → 2820.40] google has done with android wear paired to an iPhone like they actually managed to bridge that gap
[2820.40 → 2827.36] where I think they achieved really 90 of what I would care about, and they managed to do it on both
[2827.36 → 2834.16] platforms I thought that was really cool about it but um someone in the chat said it was just kind of a
[2834.16 → 2841.84] crappy device with a terrible screen someone in the chat said that uh real smartwatches like the
[2841.84 → 2849.60] Apple Watch and the gear are doing well uh I think you should re-con jigger how you view well apple has
[2849.60 → 2854.24] like pretty much straight up said that the Apple Watch isn't doing well haven't they um i I don't know
[2854.96 → 2861.52] actually but i what I will say is that they now have a second generation Apple Watch, and they have
[2861.52 → 2867.68] slashed the price of the first generation Apple Watch which when you look at the Apple Watch and
[2867.68 → 2873.04] the price delta that they're trying to go at between the two generations of it basically means to me they
[2873.04 → 2877.76] have a lot of inventory they're sitting on like I don't think I don't think Apple Watch is a big
[2877.76 → 2883.52] success how many of them do you see my vet has one that's the only person I know with an Apple Watch and
[2883.52 → 2888.96] it was a gift from someone who thought she would like an Apple Watch like that's what they've largely become
[2888.96 → 2892.48] it kind of sucks right now because like two of the most
[2896.00 → 2900.56] highest anticipated within the last little while sections of technology I guess is how I'll phrase
[2900.56 → 2907.12] that like VR and smartwatches are wearables in general both just like drunk and then are stuck
[2907.12 → 2913.12] down here right well I think VR stands a chance of coming back well I think wearables definitely
[2913.12 → 2917.20] do too maybe they'll come back on similar to no I was going to say I thought VR might come back sooner
[2917.20 → 2923.28] because at least the VR like the good VR that's out today is perfect and very compelling whereas
[2923.28 → 2929.04] even the best wearables right now I think are trying to be all the wrong things like I've been
[2929.04 → 2937.04] wearing the Apple Watch as a daily driver for at least two weeks I don't actually remember how long
[2937.04 → 2942.80] it's been but I've been using it for a bit because I switched to the MacBook Pro and I switched to the iPhone 7
[2942.80 → 2951.52] and I've been like in the Apple ecosystem I haven't been tempted to press the crown and open up any of
[2951.52 → 2959.84] the other apps on the stupid thing once how could I possibly care the time that it takes to press the
[2959.84 → 2965.68] crown navigate these tiny little icons to the weather by then I could have pulled out my phone like
[2965.68 → 2970.96] there's just so few things that really make sense it's mostly a notification device why
[2973.12 → 2981.76] okay can it come back okay that was scary um I guess they're just they're trying to instead of just
[2981.76 → 2988.32] trying to be really elegant and beautiful one thing and that is like tell time for one thing yes um
[2989.52 → 2995.44] they're either trying to be too much or their business is too dependent on just selling wearables
[2995.44 → 2999.92] they need too much margin they can't build a good enough product just no one's really no one's
[2999.92 → 3007.84] really gotten it quite right um yeah so anyway this news comes off after pebble laid off 25
[3007.84 → 3015.84] of its staff earlier in the year and um this is all despite funding rounds in 2015 and 2016 that raised
[3015.84 → 3025.36] 26 million so there you go so much for that in continued
[3025.44 → 3030.80] bad news uh UK ASA concludes that no man's sky ads were not misleading
[3032.24 → 3036.72] which actually sounds like impossible original article here was from the BBC
[3037.68 → 3043.12] no man's sky's ads were not misleading says the UK's advertising watchdog
[3044.80 → 3051.04] what kind of watchdog is that bad dog doesn't watch very well bad dog no supper
[3051.04 → 3059.52] bad so the ASA um has rejected these complaints with their statement reading that we understood
[3059.52 → 3065.44] that the screenshots and videos in the ad had been created using game footage and acknowledged that
[3066.08 → 3071.60] in doing this the advertisers would aim to show the product in the best light we considered that the
[3071.60 → 3077.28] overall impression of the ad was consistent with the gameplay and the footage provided both in terms of
[3077.28 → 3083.60] that captured by hello games and by third parties and that it did not exaggerate the expected player
[3083.60 → 3084.48] experience of the game
[3088.24 → 3096.72] delusional is the one keyword reaction I'm going to give to that and moving on I guess because
[3096.72 → 3101.04] I don't know I've got a good one okay I have some good news I have cool news oh yeah so we're moving on
[3101.04 → 3109.76] now um so the original article here this was posted by spider on the forum, and it's aws.amazon.com Amazon
[3109.76 → 3118.56] snowmobile they have cool names for things I know right so uh last year they announced the AWS snowball
[3118.56 → 3126.88] which allows you to transfer one petabyte per week using Amazon owned storage appliances into the cloud
[3126.88 → 3133.12] so this is for like large scale data migrations so with 80 terabytes of storage these appliances
[3133.12 → 3136.88] would address the needs of many of their customers and are in widespread use blah blah blah blah blah
[3136.88 → 3143.44] however customers with exabyte scale on-premises storage look at the 80 terabytes and realize that
[3143.44 → 3149.12] an all-out data migration would require lots of devices and some headache and using logistics introducing
[3149.12 → 3159.68] snowmobile where is it where is it physically snowmobiling is a ruggedized tamper resistant shipping container
[3161.68 → 3170.40] 45 feet long 9.6 feet high and 8 feet wide it is waterproof climate controlled and can be parked
[3170.40 → 3177.68] in a covered or uncovered area adjacent to your existing data centre each snowmobile consumes about 350
[3177.68 → 3184.00] kilowatts of ac power if you don't have sufficient capacity on site we can arrange for a generator
[3187.36 → 3195.68] so each truck is equipped with uh how what was it 100 gigabits per second or 400 gigabits per second or
[3195.68 → 3204.56] some ridiculous kind of networking capacity and these trucks can store up to 100 petabytes of data
[3204.56 → 3211.12] allowing you to move exabytes to AWS in a matter of weeks one terabit per second of data transfer
[3211.12 → 3217.28] speed across multiple 40 gigabits per second connections one terabit assuming that you're existing
[3217.28 → 3222.00] network can transfer data at that rate you can fill a snowmobile in about 10 days
[3224.24 → 3229.28] and then they show snowmobile in action, and they did it with Lego characters did you see that I scrolled
[3229.28 → 3234.48] through it okay yeah so I have more good news about this one as soon as I heard about this
[3235.28 → 3242.08] I fired off as many emails as I could to anyone I could think of and i I okay it's nothing concrete
[3242.64 → 3249.60] but I did get a reply that someone at an agency who knows someone at Amazon Ads is looking into whether it
[3249.60 → 3254.96] be feasible for me to go down and take a look at a snowmobile oh I wonder if we want here ah they're
[3254.96 → 3259.60] not going to bring oh it would have been cool what would we even do with it, I don't know this would
[3259.60 → 3267.12] have been sweet transfer everything we have there in like not long at all just for funnies just for
[3267.12 → 3273.20] fun like delete it afterwards I guess I don't know yeah I have a feeling they're not going to invest that
[3273.20 → 3282.64] kind of time and effort do it worth it you should uh what else we got should ah yes it will
[3282.64 → 3290.16] soon be illegal for businesses to punish customers for leaving negative reviews that's good that is
[3290.16 → 3296.24] actually really just needs president Obama's signature to be official and that assumes that the republicans
[3296.24 → 3302.96] and professor trump don't repeal it because it's a bad idea because Obama was involved in his signature
[3302.96 → 3310.00] was on it but in a nutshell what this means is that congress just passed a bill protecting
[3310.00 → 3315.68] consumers rights to post negative reviews online passed by unanimous consent by the pass the ah blah
[3315.68 → 3320.88] blah blah the consumer review fairness act will make it illegal for businesses to include a non-disbarment
[3320.88 → 3327.60] or gag clause which limits a customer's right to share bad reviews by ending gag clauses this
[3327.60 → 3332.16] legislation supports consumer rights and the integrity of critical feedback about the products and services
[3332.16 → 3336.72] sold online so that's cool I guess
[3339.84 → 3345.28] uh more bad news uh Uber now tracks passengers locations even after they're dropped off
[3349.20 → 3356.40] yay in its latest update Uber gathers user location information even when the app is not open during a ride
[3356.40 → 3362.16] so let's go ahead and make our way through this so in the latest update uh after the update is completed
[3362.16 → 3367.92] Uber prompts users to accept the new policy by enabling their phones to make the change previously
[3367.92 → 3373.52] Uber only collected data from the user if the rider had the app open now if a rider calls for an Uber and
[3373.52 → 3378.80] closes the app Uber says it will continue to collect location data up until five minutes after the ride
[3378.80 → 3384.16] ends Uber says on their website they do this to improve pickups drop-offs consumer service and to
[3384.16 → 3393.04] enhance safety wouldn't it improve literally nothing no because what it will tell them is where people
[3393.04 → 3399.76] are going and what it will tell them is more accurately, but you just verbally tell your driver where
[3399.76 → 3405.28] the drop-off point is yes I know so it would only need to track where the car is no, but it will tell
[3405.28 → 3411.36] them what specific place you are specifically going so you could get dropped off at an intersection
[3411.36 → 3415.36] and now Uber will know that you were going to get your hair cut at Joe's barber why do they need to
[3415.36 → 3422.00] how would that help them with drop-off i I'm I'm just saying you asked like what it would tell
[3422.00 → 3426.80] them I said no I meant okay no I meant what it would help them I don't see how it would help them with
[3426.80 → 3429.92] these things I don't see how that would help you with drop-off because you probably got dropped off
[3429.92 → 3432.72] at the intersection because you just wanted to get out of the car because it'd be easier for you to
[3432.72 → 3441.60] get there it could improve the next pickup I mean you already have GPS yeah, so there's that and if
[3441.60 → 3446.48] they tracked you before you got in the car that actually makes sense, but then they're going to get
[3446.48 → 3454.16] a bunch of positive PR from this the first time someone like gets kidnapped or some crap like within
[3454.16 → 3459.76] five minutes after they got dropped off from an Uber and Uber is able to be like yeah they went this
[3459.76 → 3466.80] way except that that seems like it would be a breach of every privacy policy ever but then in the event
[3466.80 → 3472.32] of safety being involved but then now they have that information so they could use it any way they want
[3473.76 → 3480.88] basically it's a brave new world folks I like gave up my privacy a long time ago once I started being on
[3480.88 → 3489.04] camera so much but like if I hadn't I feel like I would just be constantly pissed off from like
[3489.04 → 3498.56] NVIDIA drivers taking telemetry data like what you don't need to know all this junk to like this stuff
[3498.56 → 3503.44] like leave me alone all I wanted to do is get a car ride that wasn't terrible like a taxi you don't need
[3503.44 → 3514.64] to do this leave me alone Canada installing back doors like duh all I know is my back door is uh
[3516.32 → 3517.60] basically open at this point
[3520.08 → 3527.76] yeah pretty much, so thanks for watching the wan show guys I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed it
[3527.76 → 3532.88] yeah I enjoyed it actually this is kind of a depressing it was a really depressing show this is not like
[3533.44 → 3540.24] not my favourite land show let's see if um let's see if the outro works oh it's going to lag one thing i
[3540.24 → 3546.48] know for sure is that my twitch chat on my laptop is super not working you can see here I mean you're
[3546.48 → 3555.52] ending the show so fixing it now is well whatever intro oh beautiful oh it's broken yeah it's broken oh
[3555.52 → 3567.20] okay oh, oh crap no, no we didn't talk about the Casey estate thing we didn't talk about beam okay so uh
[3567.20 → 3571.60] so Casey estate sold his name to CNN no, no he sold beam he sold the beam app
[3572.48 → 3576.64] Casey estate sold, and he's there shutting down just got what okay
[3576.64 → 3583.20] Casey estate and his beam app just got acquired by CNN for 25 million his beam app was a terrible
[3583.20 → 3589.04] idea um he's building a company with CNN, but he's building a company that is going to be some type of
[3589.04 → 3595.76] news thing yeah um and here are some sponsored links there's people speculating that it's going to be
[3595.76 → 3602.32] very much like extremely topical things like this is happening now, and you can tune into like live feeds
[3602.32 → 3608.80] kind of deal sort of makes senses apparently beam has an 11-person team
[3611.12 → 3617.68] wow um hell yeah so the head the global head of CNN digital told the New York times
[3617.68 → 3624.32] Casey has tapped into nearly six million really powerful viewers most of which do not tune in to
[3624.32 → 3631.68] see oh my god the whole chat is like what is this what is beam WTF is beam like seriously that's
[3631.68 → 3636.32] like what the whole chat is apparently it's worth 25 million dollars actually it's not what's worth 25
[3636.32 → 3642.72] million dollars is Casey estate so good for him, he sold Casey estate for 25 million dollars
[3643.28 → 3648.32] um CNN also said to build this audience authentically we need to build something new
[3648.96 → 3653.92] um speaking to the verge Casey estate hit on the main challenge that he'll have to overcome is that there is
[3654.56 → 3659.60] a tremendous distrust between those six million viewers and traditional media
[3659.60 → 3665.84] the project whatever it ends up being is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2017 all I know for
[3665.84 → 3674.00] sure is I'm going to set my watch and I'm gonna wait with bated breath for what for them like the man of
[3674.00 → 3681.04] the year months of development for the yeah for the six months of development who good luck coding house
[3682.08 → 3686.80] dang that's a lot of eyes on you for six months of development time yeah
[3686.80 → 3689.92] eat well try to sleep at some point
[3693.92 → 3700.40] I mean the guy just got 25 million dollars to sit and work on this thing for presumably like
[3700.96 → 3706.72] I would say they've at least locked him up for two years I think I don't know to work on this like i
[3706.72 → 3713.76] don't know much about the details of the uh of the agreement there's an article here but I feel bad for
[3713.76 → 3720.80] any programmer on that project yeah six months like just man I feel bad for everything about this
[3720.80 → 3728.88] project because you know what maybe I don't maybe this will be the one mainstream traditional
[3728.88 → 3737.12] media acquisition of a new age media property that works out maybe this will be the one time
[3737.12 → 3746.08] except that they bought one that wasn't working except for that all right thank you for watching
[3746.08 → 3750.48] the wan show we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[3750.48 → 3766.96] people are like PewDiePie is quitting no he's not he uploaded a video that says he'll delete his channel at 50 million subscribers
[3766.96 → 3779.84] watch him just do it everyone's like LTT will be acquired by something you know what time how true that yes
[3779.84 → 3786.24] bullet time that's what it is it's on purpose if he did that he would get so much press from doing that
[3786.24 → 3791.12] that he could rebuild knowing that subscribers don't actually matter that much and get his views back
[3791.12 → 3798.56] insanely fast he made not fast enough he made jets Jacksepticeye 2 which was like a troll fake side
[3798.56 → 3805.12] channel and got it to like 2.8 million subscribers as a joke with one video that I think he recorded on
[3805.12 → 3809.60] his cell phone being like yeah I want another play button so they shipped him another gold play button
[3809.60 → 3814.24] for it, you know he mentioned it one time in one video, and he got like almost three million we even
[3814.24 → 3818.16] talked about doing that except we were going to try and get silver play buttons we wanted a hundred
[3818.16 → 3822.48] thousand subscribers yeah we figured it would take us a lot he went like way higher than his goal i
[3822.48 → 3828.16] guarantee you he could delete his channel get in like every news everywhere recreate and be completely
[3828.16 → 3832.88] fine he probably wouldn't even have to recreate it because YouTube has tools to restore them it just
[3832.88 → 3838.56] like it restores it kind of lankily from at least it did four years ago five years ago whenever I had to do
[3838.56 → 3839.04] it yeah
[3842.00 → 3844.56] bye he's not going to do it I'm calling his bluff right now
