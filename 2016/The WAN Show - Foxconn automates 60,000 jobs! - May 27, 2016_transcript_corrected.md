[0.00 → 10.18] Are we starting?
[12.04 → 13.40] Maybe. Are we here?
[13.58 → 16.06] We might be live. We're going to have to start
[16.06 → 17.72] from the top. So we have
[17.72 → 20.14] topics to talk
[20.14 → 22.02] about now that the stream
[22.02 → 23.98] works. One of them is that H2H3
[23.98 → 25.22] got sued
[25.22 → 27.78] by a fellow YouTuber named
[27.78 → 29.26] the bold guy. Is being sued.
[29.26 → 31.06] That's fair. It's in the process.
[31.30 → 33.14] I don't know legal stuff. They're not in court yet.
[33.26 → 35.08] John's probably super sad over there.
[35.14 → 36.64] Able to hear me say dumb things.
[37.02 → 39.24] There's also a can't use the touch screen. This laptop
[39.24 → 40.62] doesn't have one. Deep.
[41.32 → 43.20] There's also a study that claims that Fitbit
[43.20 → 44.82] trackers are highly
[44.82 → 47.14] inaccurate. And Google
[47.14 → 48.86] has kind of won
[48.86 → 51.14] a case where
[51.14 → 53.14] Oracle was suing them to the deal
[53.14 → 55.02] of $9 billion or something.
[55.32 → 57.22] Talk about that later. Also, Foxconn
[57.22 → 59.34] has replaced 60,000 factory workers
[59.34 → 61.04] with robots. Because no guys,
[61.10 → 62.86] it's totally cool. Advancements in technology
[62.86 → 63.98] just create more jobs.
[64.76 → 65.84] I don't know what you're talking about.
[67.08 → 68.00] To be fair.
[68.04 → 68.84] Moving forward.
[69.80 → 70.88] In the first two
[70.88 → 72.34] industrial revolutions, they did.
[72.34 → 78.42] Ringo!
[93.76 → 94.80] Yeah.
[98.64 → 99.08] Yeah.
[99.40 → 100.24] Okay.
[100.24 → 100.28] Yeah.
[100.28 → 105.54] I was just going to say a joke, but I'm not going to do it
[105.54 → 107.66] Anyway, H3H3 who I think
[107.66 → 109.92] I can actually look at the
[109.92 → 111.94] article for now and like
[111.94 → 113.74] show it on screen
[113.74 → 115.86] Oh
[115.86 → 118.78] Dang
[118.78 → 121.52] Look at that
[121.52 → 121.98] Awesome
[121.98 → 123.82] Wow, it works
[123.82 → 126.22] Anyway, Burke's gone this time so that's
[126.22 → 128.34] unfortunate but H3H3
[128.34 → 130.20] Productions, Ethan Hila Klein
[130.20 → 132.04] are being sued over
[132.04 → 133.74] alleged copyright infringement over
[133.74 → 135.96] a reaction video that they made
[135.96 → 137.48] to someone doing parkour
[137.48 → 140.28] That guy's name was
[140.28 → 141.92] I don't remember, it's not very important
[141.92 → 143.28] Matt Haas zone I think
[143.28 → 145.90] I think that's his channel
[145.90 → 148.00] and they
[148.00 → 150.56] I think he's colloquially
[150.56 → 152.42] referred to as Bold Guy
[152.42 → 154.48] Right, yes
[154.48 → 156.60] There's been some pretty major updates
[156.60 → 158.70] here. A lot of people know that this was going on
[158.70 → 160.16] Phil DeFranco opened up a fund
[160.16 → 162.64] on GoFundMe, it raised like over
[162.64 → 164.90] 120 grand, a huge amount of big
[164.90 → 166.54] YouTubers stepped in including the
[166.54 → 168.90] Fine Bros, which was probably a very
[168.90 → 170.72] good PR move for them but they
[170.72 → 172.14] stepped in to the amount of
[172.14 → 174.74] $10,000 which is probably
[174.74 → 176.40] worth more than the PR move
[176.40 → 179.20] So there was some actual true goodwill there as well
[179.20 → 179.70] Yeah
[179.70 → 184.90] Big other YouTubers like PewDiePie and a bunch of people that I don't remember
[184.90 → 186.40] but if you go watch Phil DeFranco's video
[186.40 → 189.02] Multiplier, even Leafy donated some
[189.02 → 190.76] Leafy donated and was like
[190.76 → 194.78] there are certain things that trump like petty arguments
[194.78 → 198.32] Yeah, and he put his name as Leafy aka the cyberbully
[198.32 → 198.72] Yeah
[198.72 → 199.52] Yeah
[199.52 → 201.02] That was kind of funny
[201.02 → 201.54] I guess
[201.54 → 201.98] It was good
[201.98 → 204.34] Okay, but you should talk about the update
[204.34 → 206.82] Yeah, so there was an update video that they posted yesterday
[206.82 → 209.34] after the initial video about how they were being sued
[209.34 → 211.36] So in the initial video they specifically said
[211.36 → 214.26] we're not going to do like a Patreon or something like that
[214.26 → 215.62] You guys have already supported us a ton
[215.62 → 217.24] and that's all that we can ask for
[217.24 → 219.38] But after that, like Luke said
[219.38 → 221.42] Philly D came in and was a boss
[221.42 → 224.40] and started the GoFundMe and contributed five grand to start it
[224.40 → 225.60] Now it's huge
[225.60 → 228.16] Yeah, that's one thing I want to say too
[228.16 → 230.50] is Philip DeFranco didn't just like
[230.50 → 232.22] Yeah, he wasn't just like
[232.22 → 233.38] Hey guys, you should donate
[233.38 → 235.92] He was like, here's a page and five grand
[235.92 → 236.70] And five grand
[236.70 → 240.80] And like really set like a benchmark to move forward
[240.80 → 243.74] and I think that's one of the big reasons why a lot of YouTubers stepped up
[243.74 → 246.62] Even Notch and Gary from Gary's Mod
[246.62 → 246.94] Yeah
[246.94 → 248.16] Contributed, like it's crazy
[248.16 → 248.90] People care
[248.90 → 251.82] So anyway, in their update video
[251.82 → 255.22] They essentially were like, holy crap, this is insane
[255.22 → 257.44] Like we never thought that this would happen
[257.44 → 260.18] And they made it clear that like, yeah, in the video
[260.18 → 261.48] In the initial video we said
[261.48 → 263.74] Our legal fees could be up to $100,000
[263.74 → 266.64] If this went to the full extent that it could go
[266.64 → 268.94] They don't expect them to be that high
[268.94 → 270.24] If it doesn't go the full way
[270.24 → 272.00] So essentially what they're doing
[272.00 → 274.04] Is they're making sure that the funds get handed off
[274.04 → 275.56] Into an escrow account
[275.56 → 278.18] That's going to be managed by Ryan Morrison
[278.18 → 280.38] And I think Michael Lee is the other guy's name
[280.38 → 283.74] So to the people out there that don't know what an escrow account is
[283.74 → 285.46] Including definitely myself
[285.46 → 286.86] Not trying to dodge that
[286.86 → 287.62] Yeah
[287.62 → 288.22] What?
[288.76 → 290.48] So an escrow account is
[291.02 → 292.58] Let's see, the official
[292.58 → 295.42] Escrow account is a temporary pass-through account
[295.42 → 296.40] Held by a third party
[296.40 → 299.40] During the process of a transaction between two parties
[299.40 → 301.96] So in this case, essentially what that means
[301.96 → 304.74] Is that the people who donated are the first party
[304.74 → 309.24] The second party is whoever needs protection under fair use
[309.24 → 309.56] Okay
[309.56 → 312.80] And then the third party who's going to be controlling the escrow account
[312.80 → 315.16] Is Michael Lee and Ryan Morrison
[315.16 → 318.02] Ryan Morrison, more commonly known as the video game attorney
[318.02 → 318.54] Yes
[318.54 → 321.06] So yeah
[321.06 → 324.20] And the first client of this escrow account
[324.20 → 325.10] If you want to call it that
[325.10 → 325.28] Yeah
[325.28 → 327.76] The first recipient of the escrow account
[327.76 → 331.08] Will be the legal battle that HCH3 is engaged in
[331.08 → 331.30] Yeah
[331.30 → 332.56] Not them specifically
[332.56 → 333.84] But the legal battle
[333.84 → 335.34] Yeah, so that's an important clarification
[335.34 → 337.64] Is it's not like they can just go and be like
[337.64 → 339.50] Oh yeah, we need X amount of dollars
[339.50 → 341.68] And it's just on their word
[341.68 → 344.80] It's specifically Ryan Morrison and Michael Lee
[344.80 → 345.78] Who are controlling the money
[345.78 → 348.14] And then they will just take out as necessary
[348.14 → 351.26] To fight these legal battles on behalf of creators
[351.26 → 351.70] Yeah
[351.70 → 353.56] So it's kind of badass
[353.56 → 356.30] They call it, I think, the fair use protection account
[356.30 → 357.74] A.k.a. the PUPA
[357.74 → 359.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[359.30 → 360.08] Which is great
[360.08 → 362.24] And the PUPA keeps growing, as they say
[362.24 → 366.96] But yeah, it's kind of badass
[366.96 → 370.84] Because, you know, something that Ethan outlined in the follow-up video
[370.84 → 373.52] Was that now there's this bulk of money sitting there
[373.52 → 376.40] That's almost acting like a deterrent to other people
[376.40 → 379.68] Who want to, you know, come in and abuse the broken copyright system
[379.68 → 379.96] Right?
[380.30 → 380.48] Yeah
[380.48 → 386.54] So, you know, obviously there are cases where copyright law should hold up
[386.54 → 388.20] But fair use is there for a reason
[388.20 → 391.02] And these people who might not have had the funds
[391.02 → 394.36] Or the means necessary to be able to defend themselves in the past
[394.36 → 395.36] Will have that now
[395.36 → 396.76] So that's a pretty incredible thing
[396.76 → 398.50] Yeah, and like that
[398.50 → 402.36] It's almost acting a complete opposite way
[402.36 → 403.54] As this guy probably wanted it to
[403.54 → 405.84] Because one of the big things brought up was
[405.84 → 408.24] The first thing that they wanted to do was just like
[408.24 → 409.68] Oh, like give us four grand
[409.68 → 410.96] And take the video down
[410.96 → 411.96] And you can move on
[411.96 → 414.14] And the reason why they didn't just do that
[414.14 → 415.14] Because that's
[415.14 → 417.28] It's setting a really dangerous precedent
[417.28 → 419.70] Because as soon as the attorney of this guy goes
[419.70 → 421.88] Oh yeah, Ethan and Hila gave me four grand
[421.88 → 423.72] Because I came and threatened him with a lawsuit
[423.72 → 427.44] Then they come to, you know, Joey Salads or whoever
[427.44 → 429.30] And they go, hey, I got four grand out of Ethan and Hila
[429.30 → 430.50] But I can get ten for you
[430.50 → 431.92] Or I can go over to Leafy
[431.92 → 434.00] And I can get, you know, however much from him
[434.00 → 438.16] So yeah, it's a really important thing that they're doing
[438.16 → 439.28] And like they've been saying
[439.28 → 443.46] It's way bigger than just the battle that is Ethan and Hila versus both guys
[443.46 → 445.38] Yeah, because now, especially with the big fund
[445.38 → 448.10] Instead of it being this lawyer behind the scenes
[448.10 → 449.86] Just going like, hey, I got four grand for them
[449.86 → 452.18] It's lawyers behind the scenes
[452.18 → 453.76] Receiving people trying to do this
[453.76 → 455.46] And going like, I don't know
[455.46 → 455.76] Yeah
[455.76 → 459.10] Because those guys just got super slammed
[459.10 → 460.80] So I don't think I want to waste my time with this
[460.80 → 463.24] And it also, like, I, you know
[463.24 → 465.44] I'm going to probably say something completely stupid here
[465.44 → 467.30] Because I'm not entirely familiar with how
[467.30 → 469.30] The legal system in America works
[469.30 → 470.46] It's a little different up here in Canada
[470.46 → 472.84] But it also sets a precedent, right?
[472.90 → 474.54] If Ethan and Hila go in, and they win
[474.54 → 477.14] Then that can be used as a case
[477.14 → 479.84] Like a case study, essentially
[479.84 → 481.60] For future cases
[481.60 → 482.16] Yeah
[482.16 → 484.30] When fair use is being abused, right?
[484.40 → 488.06] So, you know, that can come into play as evidence for future cases
[488.06 → 489.82] And it just helps build up the backing of fair use
[489.82 → 491.78] I'm pretty sure that's definitely a thing in the States
[491.78 → 493.50] I don't actually know if that's a thing in Canada
[493.50 → 494.66] Is it a thing in Canada?
[495.02 → 495.94] I'm pretty sure, yeah
[495.94 → 496.34] Okay
[496.34 → 497.36] It is a thing in Canada
[497.36 → 498.44] Because we're based on
[498.44 → 499.84] Or
[499.84 → 501.74] We're based on the
[501.74 → 503.98] Now I'm confused of which is which
[503.98 → 504.78] Hey, John
[504.78 → 508.42] Can we borrow you for a sec?
[508.96 → 509.28] Okay
[509.28 → 510.32] We need legal advice
[510.32 → 510.94] We need legal
[510.94 → 512.34] Yeah, we need the legal department
[512.34 → 512.74] Okay
[512.74 → 513.40] So
[513.40 → 515.84] In this case
[515.84 → 516.66] With Ethan and Hila
[516.66 → 517.94] Being sued by some dude
[517.94 → 519.24] If they win
[519.24 → 521.44] Can lawyers in the future
[521.44 → 522.88] Use the fact that they won?
[522.88 → 524.38] Is the U.S. based on case law?
[524.74 → 525.02] Yes
[525.02 → 526.06] In the same jurisdiction
[526.06 → 526.46] Yeah
[526.46 → 526.88] I mean
[526.88 → 528.60] I think Canada is the same way too
[528.60 → 528.94] Sure
[528.94 → 529.56] So if like
[529.56 → 530.92] There is a disposition
[530.92 → 532.22] Like in one jurisdiction
[532.22 → 533.04] Like in one state
[533.04 → 533.94] Or in one circuit court
[533.94 → 534.56] In the U.S.
[534.94 → 536.72] And there's a similar case later on
[536.72 → 537.52] Then
[537.52 → 538.88] Whatever the holding was
[538.88 → 540.18] Is binding precedent
[540.18 → 540.66] It essentially
[540.66 → 540.92] Right
[540.92 → 541.74] It's a force of law
[541.74 → 542.12] So yeah
[542.12 → 542.36] Oh wow
[542.36 → 543.18] It's a big deal
[543.18 → 543.72] Okay
[543.72 → 544.04] Okay
[544.04 → 544.74] So yeah
[544.74 → 546.40] I don't know if you guys could hear the full thing there
[546.40 → 546.94] But essentially
[546.94 → 548.40] Like I said
[548.40 → 550.12] It sets a precedent for future cases
[550.12 → 552.34] Under case law
[552.34 → 555.10] Where this can then be used as evidence
[555.10 → 556.26] In other cases
[556.26 → 557.48] To defend fair use
[557.48 → 557.74] So
[557.74 → 558.22] Yeah
[558.22 → 559.06] I mean overall
[559.06 → 559.56] Like
[559.56 → 562.24] When I first saw the video of them being sued
[562.24 → 563.90] I think it was only like two days ago or something
[563.90 → 564.82] Not that long ago
[564.82 → 565.98] I was like
[565.98 → 566.78] Wow that sucks
[566.78 → 568.06] Like this is a huge burden
[568.06 → 568.92] And it's actually
[568.92 → 570.08] Really inspiring to see
[570.08 → 571.52] Like the whole community come together
[571.52 → 572.58] And support
[572.58 → 574.02] Not only Ethan and Hila
[574.02 → 575.22] But support setting a precedent
[575.22 → 576.34] And building a precedent here
[576.34 → 578.18] So there's even a new Twitter
[578.18 → 578.54] Yeah
[578.54 → 579.72] I'm going to show this on screen
[579.72 → 580.62] This is fantastic
[580.62 → 582.36] There's even a new Twitter account
[582.36 → 583.62] Called Pupa for Freedom
[583.62 → 587.38] And it even has like a logo
[587.38 → 588.28] And everything
[588.28 → 591.10] And I'm sure they'll get a cover image on here
[591.10 → 591.58] But this
[591.58 → 593.94] There's no way this has been up for very long at all
[593.94 → 595.54] Looks like 21 hours
[595.54 → 595.90] Yeah
[595.90 → 597.28] 21 hours ago
[597.28 → 598.42] This Twitter account was created
[598.42 → 599.94] It has 34 tweets
[599.94 → 600.52] That's it
[600.52 → 603.98] And it already has 27.7 thousand followers
[603.98 → 604.76] But this is
[604.76 → 605.70] As it says
[605.70 → 608.08] The fair use protection account
[608.08 → 610.54] Keeping the internet free of copyright trolls
[610.54 → 611.58] Funded by you
[611.58 → 613.22] Led by H3H3 Productions
[613.22 → 614.50] Mr. Ryan Morrison
[614.50 → 616.44] And Geek Attorney
[616.44 → 617.20] So yeah
[617.20 → 617.90] I think Geek Attorney
[617.90 → 618.02] Wow
[618.02 → 621.16] Is the alias of Michael Lee
[621.16 → 621.68] Right
[621.68 → 622.38] Who's the business partner
[622.38 → 623.84] And then there's Morrison Lee
[623.84 → 625.46] Slash Pupa
[625.46 → 627.32] Which is what I'm assuming
[627.32 → 628.98] Once it loads here
[628.98 → 630.82] Is the new
[630.82 → 632.02] Yeah
[632.02 → 633.08] The like submission
[633.08 → 634.44] Area
[634.44 → 635.44] So this is their like
[635.44 → 637.74] Because this is the internet attorneys whatever thing
[637.74 → 637.94] Right
[637.94 → 638.90] So this is where
[638.90 → 641.00] Like they're housing the information about it
[641.00 → 643.66] Taking down copyright trolls
[643.66 → 645.38] Not anymore
[645.38 → 646.70] I don't know
[646.70 → 647.46] I think it's pretty cool
[647.46 → 647.62] Yeah
[647.62 → 648.26] And like
[648.26 → 649.54] One of the things that
[649.54 → 651.72] Again Ethan mentioned in the second video
[651.72 → 652.16] Was like
[652.16 → 653.14] It's not like people
[653.14 → 654.58] Haven't had support in the past
[654.58 → 656.12] Because the video game attorney
[656.12 → 656.54] And his partner
[656.54 → 657.90] Have been like
[657.90 → 658.74] Protecting these people
[658.74 → 659.62] Sometimes even
[659.62 → 660.60] Like free of charge
[660.60 → 662.36] Offering legal advice
[662.36 → 663.00] Free of charge
[663.00 → 664.44] Not even charging for their services
[664.44 → 664.88] So
[664.88 → 667.58] Essentially everybody wins
[667.58 → 668.24] In this situation
[668.24 → 669.06] It's
[669.06 → 669.74] You know
[669.74 → 670.52] A huge
[670.52 → 673.00] A huge deterrent
[673.00 → 674.14] For copyright trolls
[674.14 → 674.74] In that sense
[674.74 → 675.82] And then also
[675.82 → 676.94] These guys are able to
[676.94 → 677.24] You know
[677.24 → 678.56] Do what they love to do
[678.56 → 679.78] Help the people that need help
[679.78 → 680.36] And then also
[680.36 → 680.92] Eat
[680.92 → 681.96] Which is great
[681.96 → 682.18] Yeah
[682.18 → 683.58] Like we haven't really had any major
[683.58 → 684.80] Problems with this
[684.80 → 685.50] Have we had any
[685.50 → 686.86] I don't think so
[686.86 → 688.64] We don't really cover other people's stuff
[688.64 → 688.84] Yeah
[688.84 → 689.08] I mean
[689.08 → 690.64] We're way different
[690.64 → 692.50] So we're not really in this realm
[692.50 → 692.88] But
[692.88 → 695.80] We still kind of want to protect our own
[695.80 → 696.36] I guess
[696.36 → 696.60] Of course
[696.60 → 697.92] So it's good to see
[697.92 → 699.36] This kind of stuff happen
[699.36 → 700.74] I do kind of wish
[700.74 → 702.34] That this little thing in the corner
[702.34 → 703.74] Also mentioned
[703.74 → 704.28] You know
[704.28 → 704.66] Like
[704.66 → 705.32] Phil Franco
[705.32 → 706.76] The guy that like
[706.76 → 708.08] Yeah
[708.08 → 709.74] It's probably fine
[709.74 → 710.88] It's not really a big deal
[710.88 → 711.68] I just think it would have been
[711.68 → 713.08] Kind of cool to give a shout-out to
[713.08 → 714.14] Yeah
[714.14 → 714.68] For sure
[714.68 → 715.84] No
[715.84 → 716.82] Oh
[716.82 → 719.26] We're still
[719.26 → 719.92] We're still alive
[719.92 → 720.30] No
[720.30 → 721.92] Just give it
[721.92 → 722.56] Just give it a sec
[722.56 → 723.30] Give it a sec
[723.30 → 724.36] I'm just not going to touch it
[724.36 → 724.84] Give it a sec
[724.84 → 725.42] We're going to
[725.42 → 727.06] I can still show
[727.06 → 728.14] My screen here
[728.14 → 728.60] Move on
[728.60 → 730.50] Mike1496 says move on
[730.50 → 731.82] We will
[731.82 → 732.32] I'm okay with that
[732.32 → 733.94] I can't change the scene
[733.94 → 735.80] On XSplit
[735.80 → 736.34] Yeah
[736.34 → 737.30] It's still not going to work
[737.30 → 740.20] And I'm afraid of crashing
[740.20 → 741.14] The whole thing
[741.14 → 742.20] But
[742.20 → 743.00] We're going to talk about
[743.00 → 744.30] The next topic
[744.30 → 745.28] Which will
[745.28 → 746.12] Oh my
[746.12 → 747.16] There we go
[747.16 → 747.86] One second
[747.86 → 749.04] Which will be
[749.04 → 749.64] Fitbit
[749.64 → 752.24] Fitbit trackers are highly inaccurate
[752.24 → 753.18] That's in a
[753.18 → 754.22] Quote thing
[754.22 → 756.78] Apparently there's some
[756.78 → 758.04] Lawsuit thing going on
[758.04 → 758.34] Right now
[758.34 → 759.36] Where someone's suing them
[759.36 → 760.88] For giving inaccurate
[760.88 → 761.82] Health data
[761.82 → 763.58] Fitbit has responded
[763.58 → 764.20] By saying
[764.20 → 765.24] It's not supposed to be
[765.24 → 765.56] Like
[765.56 → 766.52] Health
[766.52 → 767.32] Data
[767.32 → 768.52] It's supposed to give
[768.52 → 770.18] A rough representation
[770.18 → 770.66] Or
[770.66 → 771.06] I think
[771.06 → 771.74] I don't
[771.74 → 772.10] Okay
[772.10 → 772.92] I'm going to try to find
[772.92 → 774.14] Their actual quote here
[774.14 → 775.58] Give me one second
[775.58 → 776.98] Here let's see
[776.98 → 778.60] Fitbit called the study
[778.60 → 779.18] Bias
[779.18 → 779.96] Baseless
[779.96 → 781.20] And saying that it lacked
[781.20 → 782.24] Scientific rigour
[782.24 → 784.96] Which is pretty rough
[784.96 → 786.42] So the study was done
[786.42 → 786.90] By researchers
[786.90 → 787.94] At the California State
[787.94 → 788.88] Polytechnic University
[788.88 → 789.94] Who tested the heart rates
[789.94 → 791.14] Of 43 healthy adults
[791.14 → 791.90] With Fitbit's
[791.90 → 793.32] Pure pulse heart rate monitors
[793.32 → 794.90] And then they used
[794.90 → 795.82] The Fitbit surge
[795.82 → 796.50] Watches
[796.50 → 797.84] And charge HR bands
[797.84 → 799.10] On each wrist
[799.10 → 801.08] Subjects were then hooked up
[801.08 → 802.56] To a bioharness device
[802.56 → 804.88] That produced an electrocardiogram
[804.88 → 806.18] Or an ECG
[806.18 → 808.02] So like highly accurate
[808.02 → 809.20] Medical grade stuff
[809.20 → 809.42] Yeah
[809.42 → 810.52] To record against the data
[810.52 → 812.86] The results showed
[812.86 → 813.80] That Fitbit devices
[813.80 → 815.14] Miscalculated heart rates
[815.14 → 816.52] By up to 20 beats
[816.52 → 817.82] Per minute on average
[817.82 → 818.94] 20 or 30
[818.94 → 819.58] Yeah
[819.58 → 821.08] So that's during
[821.08 → 822.18] More intensive workouts
[822.18 → 823.64] And again
[823.64 → 823.82] Yeah
[823.82 → 824.42] Fitbit said that
[824.42 → 825.36] The study was biased
[825.36 → 827.06] And I'm sure that
[827.06 → 828.06] In their terms of use
[828.06 → 828.86] It says somewhere
[828.86 → 830.42] That Fitbit is not
[830.42 → 831.46] Intended to be used
[831.46 → 832.28] As a medical device
[832.28 → 833.22] And it's an approximation
[833.22 → 834.00] Of blah blah blah
[834.00 → 834.26] Yeah
[834.26 → 835.60] It's actually not
[835.60 → 837.26] It says here that
[837.26 → 838.80] The devices are designed
[838.80 → 840.04] To provide meaningful data
[840.04 → 840.70] To our users
[840.70 → 841.54] To help them reach
[841.54 → 842.82] Their health and fitness goals
[842.82 → 843.98] And are not intended
[843.98 → 844.62] To be scientific
[844.62 → 845.66] Or medical devices
[845.66 → 846.64] And in my opinion
[846.64 → 847.56] This isn't like
[847.56 → 848.68] Vitamin water
[848.68 → 849.62] Saying that no one
[849.62 → 850.86] Could possibly think
[850.86 → 851.78] That their drink
[851.78 → 852.72] Was supposed to be healthy
[852.72 → 854.06] I think this is literally
[854.06 → 855.00] Them going like
[855.00 → 856.24] Okay we made a device
[856.24 → 857.30] That sits on your wrist
[857.30 → 859.00] And gives you a roughish
[859.00 → 860.20] Calculation of your heartbeat
[860.20 → 860.66] Right
[860.66 → 862.48] And that should somewhat
[862.48 → 863.28] Be able to help you
[863.28 → 863.94] With your workouts
[863.94 → 865.12] Obviously they're not
[865.12 → 865.66] Looking to like
[865.66 → 866.56] Diagnose people
[866.56 → 867.16] In hospitals
[867.16 → 868.20] By putting Fitbit's on
[868.20 → 869.42] I think that's okay
[869.42 → 870.70] I don't think
[870.70 → 871.62] That it should be off
[871.62 → 872.22] By an average
[872.22 → 873.70] Of 20 beats per minute
[873.70 → 874.42] That's insane
[874.42 → 876.60] But I don't know
[876.60 → 878.72] One little spoiler thing here
[878.72 → 880.48] Is I have a Fitbit
[880.48 → 881.96] And actually many other
[881.96 → 882.96] Fitness trackers
[882.96 → 883.84] Sitting in the room
[883.84 → 885.02] Over there
[885.02 → 886.16] And we are going to be
[886.16 → 887.22] Doing our own testing
[887.22 → 888.26] Not because this
[888.26 → 888.90] Just came up
[888.90 → 889.68] This is just kind of
[889.68 → 890.20] Coincidental
[890.20 → 891.14] We were actually going to
[891.14 → 891.64] Do our testing
[891.64 → 892.56] Before this
[892.56 → 894.28] Just someone lost
[894.28 → 895.60] The chest strap band
[895.60 → 897.40] But
[897.40 → 899.78] Yeah so that kind of sucks
[899.78 → 900.38] I guess
[900.38 → 901.98] Because I wanted to
[901.98 → 902.46] Benchmark them
[902.46 → 903.34] Against a chest strap
[903.34 → 904.06] Which are supposed to be
[904.06 → 904.84] Actually pretty good
[904.84 → 906.08] Yeah it's not as accurate
[906.08 → 906.78] As an ECG
[906.78 → 907.24] No
[907.24 → 908.68] I'm still
[908.68 → 909.08] Pretty good
[909.08 → 910.04] Now that we are back
[910.04 → 910.56] Because okay
[910.56 → 911.24] I was going to do that
[911.24 → 911.76] In Mexico
[911.76 → 912.46] Because I wanted to like
[912.46 → 913.04] Run on the beach
[913.04 → 914.22] And make it look all cool
[914.22 → 914.56] And stuff
[914.56 → 917.86] But now I might actually
[917.86 → 919.08] Try to talk to a local
[919.08 → 919.72] Medical clinic
[919.72 → 920.62] Which I had already
[920.62 → 922.30] Decided before this
[922.30 → 923.06] Thing came out
[923.06 → 924.04] Which is again
[924.04 → 924.62] Coincidental
[924.62 → 925.38] And I might try to
[925.38 → 926.40] Hook up to an ECG
[926.40 → 927.12] And then wear a bunch
[927.12 → 927.56] Of these watches
[927.56 → 928.26] And see what happens
[928.26 → 929.58] But I don't know
[929.58 → 930.40] I am interested
[930.40 → 932.38] We're kind of a
[932.38 → 933.60] Third party
[933.60 → 934.52] We haven't been paid
[934.52 → 935.26] By anyone to make
[935.26 → 935.76] That video
[935.76 → 936.86] We bought our
[936.86 → 937.56] Fitbit tracker
[937.56 → 938.20] And I don't think
[938.20 → 938.90] We've ever had a
[938.90 → 939.88] Sponsorship from
[939.88 → 941.12] We've never had a
[941.12 → 941.84] Sponsorship from
[941.84 → 942.94] Any fitness tracker company
[942.94 → 945.14] What are some of
[945.14 → 945.70] The brands you're using
[945.70 → 947.06] We have Garmin
[947.06 → 948.66] We have Vivo Fit
[948.66 → 949.86] We have Jawboned
[949.86 → 952.24] We have Fitbit
[952.24 → 955.84] I think that's about it
[955.84 → 956.72] So like
[956.72 → 957.98] We don't have
[957.98 → 958.74] A horse in the race
[958.74 → 959.94] We have an Apple Watch
[959.94 → 961.12] And we might get
[961.12 → 961.74] Like one or two
[961.74 → 962.28] Android ones
[962.28 → 963.10] Although I'm not too sure
[963.10 → 963.84] There's just a billion
[963.84 → 964.46] Android watches
[964.46 → 965.00] I don't really know
[965.00 → 965.70] Which one to cover
[965.70 → 966.74] But we're doing ones
[966.74 → 967.78] That have heart rate monitors
[967.78 → 968.68] That's the whole point
[968.68 → 969.78] So Apple Watch is in there
[969.78 → 970.66] A few other ones are in there
[970.66 → 971.52] But we haven't had
[971.52 → 972.60] A sponsorship from anyone
[972.60 → 973.48] Unless we include
[973.48 → 974.68] Like an Asus watch
[974.68 → 977.32] Then if it won
[977.32 → 978.02] That would suck
[978.02 → 979.28] We could also just
[979.28 → 980.62] Not include an Asus watch
[980.62 → 982.10] And just go from there
[982.10 → 983.18] I don't know
[983.18 → 984.40] I don't follow the
[984.40 → 985.56] Android trackers
[985.56 → 986.08] Very closely
[986.08 → 986.68] I don't know if
[986.68 → 987.72] Plus one for Nike
[987.72 → 988.50] Fuel Band
[988.50 → 989.22] Do we have a Nike
[989.22 → 989.78] Fuel Band
[989.78 → 990.62] We do not currently
[990.62 → 991.54] Have a Nike Fuel Band
[991.54 → 992.36] Should we get one
[992.36 → 992.80] Maybe
[992.80 → 994.06] Somebody says plus one
[994.06 → 997.64] Flea bagged
[997.64 → 998.72] I've heard that
[998.72 → 1000.02] They're good
[1000.02 → 1000.92] But no I don't know
[1000.92 → 1002.18] This is interesting
[1002.18 → 1003.52] The whole reason
[1003.52 → 1004.36] Why I wanted to do
[1004.36 → 1005.82] The fitness tracker showdown
[1005.82 → 1006.58] Which is what I've just
[1006.58 → 1007.12] Been describing
[1007.12 → 1009.06] Is because it's confusing
[1009.06 → 1010.28] When you go to buy something
[1010.28 → 1010.54] You're like
[1010.54 → 1011.66] I want this fitness implement
[1011.66 → 1012.90] They all say
[1012.90 → 1014.14] That they have
[1014.14 → 1015.64] Heart rate monitors
[1015.64 → 1017.26] But like
[1017.26 → 1018.86] It's like an approximation
[1018.86 → 1020.32] How accurate is it
[1020.32 → 1021.66] Right so what I wanted to do
[1021.66 → 1022.94] Is I'm very frustrated
[1022.94 → 1024.34] Right now with where
[1024.34 → 1025.32] Smartwatches
[1025.32 → 1026.66] And fitness trackers
[1026.66 → 1027.00] Are
[1027.00 → 1027.86] I don't feel like
[1027.86 → 1028.84] There's a happy medium
[1028.84 → 1029.90] So much
[1029.90 → 1032.04] Because like
[1032.04 → 1033.16] Good
[1033.16 → 1035.70] Smartwatches
[1035.70 → 1036.74] Don't seem to also
[1036.74 → 1037.84] Be good fitness trackers
[1037.84 → 1038.76] And vice versa
[1038.76 → 1039.84] Good fitness trackers
[1039.84 → 1040.34] Don't seem to be
[1040.34 → 1041.06] Good smartwatches
[1041.06 → 1042.26] And the Apple Watch
[1042.26 → 1043.52] Is just not a good
[1043.52 → 1044.04] Smartwatch
[1044.04 → 1044.68] But I've heard that
[1044.68 → 1045.76] It is a good fitness tracker
[1045.76 → 1047.04] So you've got that
[1047.04 → 1047.42] Hey
[1047.42 → 1048.50] It's also an expensive
[1048.50 → 1049.16] Fitness tracker
[1049.16 → 1049.52] Hey
[1049.52 → 1051.18] Yeah
[1051.18 → 1052.10] Nice
[1052.10 → 1052.88] Wicked
[1052.88 → 1053.50] Alright
[1053.50 → 1054.66] The show goes on
[1054.66 → 1055.48] Good things come
[1055.48 → 1056.44] To those who wait
[1056.44 → 1056.88] Yeah
[1056.88 → 1058.06] But I've heard
[1058.06 → 1058.90] It's a good fitness tracker
[1058.90 → 1059.64] But who knows
[1059.64 → 1060.52] And what I want to do
[1060.52 → 1061.36] Is narrow it down
[1061.36 → 1062.42] To like the top three
[1062.42 → 1063.56] And then do individual
[1063.56 → 1064.88] Reviews on those
[1064.88 → 1066.02] Fitness trackers
[1066.02 → 1067.44] Later on
[1067.44 → 1067.62] Maybe
[1067.62 → 1068.76] Someone says this is boring
[1068.76 → 1069.56] And that we should bring on
[1069.56 → 1070.64] The PC hardware topics
[1070.64 → 1071.24] Have they ever been
[1071.24 → 1071.96] To this show before?
[1073.26 → 1074.72] Not enough stuff happens
[1074.72 → 1075.72] Have you been here before?
[1076.24 → 1077.24] Do you know what this is?
[1078.08 → 1078.64] I like
[1078.64 → 1079.68] I know this guy's different
[1079.68 → 1080.10] But like
[1080.10 → 1080.96] Do you know what this
[1080.96 → 1082.10] This whole thing is?
[1083.62 → 1084.76] I'll let you think on that
[1084.76 → 1088.12] Speaking of
[1088.12 → 1089.60] Hardware technology stuff
[1089.60 → 1090.38] If you want to talk about
[1090.38 → 1091.66] The extremely few things
[1091.66 → 1092.50] That happened this week
[1092.50 → 1094.18] In the computer hardware
[1094.18 → 1095.00] Realm of things
[1095.00 → 1095.32] Because
[1095.32 → 1096.52] Spoiler alert
[1096.52 → 1098.02] Computer is coming up
[1098.02 → 1098.92] So most people are
[1098.92 → 1099.70] Keeping their information
[1099.70 → 1100.16] For that
[1100.16 → 1101.28] There's a bunch
[1101.28 → 1101.86] We're not going to
[1101.86 → 1103.06] Really probably cover it
[1103.06 → 1103.84] Much on this show
[1103.84 → 1105.08] But there's like
[1105.08 → 1106.70] Every brand of 1080
[1106.70 → 1108.06] Has already shown off
[1108.06 → 1108.88] Their like
[1108.88 → 1110.14] External cooling solution
[1110.14 → 1111.66] So rip
[1111.66 → 1112.44] All of my
[1112.44 → 1113.34] Computer coverage
[1113.34 → 1114.42] But we'll be there
[1114.42 → 1115.10] We'll be there
[1115.10 → 1116.02] And I'll be able to like
[1116.02 → 1118.78] Hold it and turn it around
[1118.78 → 1119.42] And show you
[1119.42 → 1120.78] The Asus one that I saw today
[1120.78 → 1121.58] Was pretty bad
[1121.58 → 1122.40] It looks sick
[1122.40 → 1124.10] So the Asus one has like
[1124.10 → 1124.84] An RGB
[1124.84 → 1125.60] I'll try it here
[1125.60 → 1125.62] I'll try it here
[1125.62 → 1126.18] I'll try it here
[1126.18 → 1127.18] Oh oh oh
[1127.18 → 1128.34] I'm going to try to bring it up
[1128.34 → 1128.66] Sure
[1128.66 → 1130.50] Yeah it has RGB on it
[1130.50 → 1131.20] Which I don't think
[1131.20 → 1132.48] Anyone's completely sure
[1132.48 → 1135.70] How they're controlling that yet
[1135.70 → 1140.44] Let's go to Asus PC DIY
[1140.44 → 1141.58] Because that's literally
[1141.58 → 1142.36] Their thing
[1142.36 → 1143.40] I wonder if it's like
[1143.40 → 1145.06] A thing where you have to use
[1145.06 → 1145.94] What is their
[1145.94 → 1147.64] Motherboard RGB thing
[1147.64 → 1148.12] Called again
[1148.12 → 1149.30] Like Aurora or something
[1149.30 → 1150.52] Oh yeah something like that
[1150.52 → 1151.24] I wonder if it like
[1151.24 → 1152.16] Ties into that somehow
[1152.16 → 1153.28] So it looks like that
[1153.28 → 1154.20] When all the like
[1154.20 → 1155.74] Lights are off and stuff
[1155.74 → 1157.48] Big fatty cooler
[1157.48 → 1158.76] And it's got a metal backplate
[1158.76 → 1159.64] Stop on it
[1159.64 → 1160.44] Metal backplate
[1160.44 → 1160.86] Yep
[1160.86 → 1161.84] That looks badass
[1161.84 → 1162.76] Which is right there
[1162.76 → 1163.16] Yep
[1163.16 → 1164.32] Asus Strip
[1164.32 → 1165.50] Cool
[1165.50 → 1166.34] Awesome
[1166.34 → 1167.88] And then you can see here
[1167.88 → 1168.64] Oh yeah Aura
[1168.64 → 1170.12] Looks like Aura
[1170.12 → 1171.20] I thought no one knew
[1171.20 → 1172.66] Apparently PC DIY
[1172.66 → 1174.64] Which is Asus' thing
[1174.64 → 1175.40] Was like yo
[1175.40 → 1176.78] I guess everyone can know now
[1176.78 → 1177.46] So that's cool
[1177.46 → 1178.82] So it has static
[1178.82 → 1179.40] Breathing
[1179.40 → 1180.00] Strobing
[1180.00 → 1180.90] Colour cycle
[1180.90 → 1182.02] Music effect
[1182.02 → 1183.32] Which is horrible
[1183.32 → 1184.02] In my opinion
[1184.02 → 1185.54] And CPU temperature
[1185.54 → 1186.54] Levels
[1186.54 → 1187.02] Which is kind of cool
[1187.02 → 1187.46] Wait what has this
[1187.46 → 1188.20] Strobing effect
[1188.20 → 1188.84] With your music
[1188.84 → 1189.82] No it has
[1189.82 → 1191.08] It has just music effect
[1191.08 → 1192.22] Which pulses to the beat
[1192.22 → 1192.80] Of your music
[1192.80 → 1193.32] Yeah
[1193.32 → 1194.62] Because it's 1994
[1194.62 → 1196.36] My dad
[1196.36 → 1197.34] Okay that joke
[1197.34 → 1198.04] Is because
[1198.04 → 1198.68] It's got some sick
[1198.68 → 1199.40] Undergoal on it
[1199.40 → 1200.12] I guess 1994
[1200.12 → 1201.06] Is actually too late
[1201.06 → 1201.82] 1984
[1201.82 → 1202.86] I don't know
[1202.86 → 1203.68] My dad
[1203.68 → 1204.02] When he
[1204.02 → 1205.10] Earlier than that
[1205.10 → 1206.10] How old are you dad
[1206.10 → 1206.78] I don't know
[1206.78 → 1207.26] Anyway
[1207.26 → 1208.42] When my dad was in like
[1208.42 → 1209.32] High school or something
[1209.32 → 1210.86] He made this like
[1210.86 → 1211.42] Electronic thing
[1211.42 → 1212.00] You thought your dad
[1212.00 → 1212.74] Was in high school
[1212.74 → 1213.50] In 1994
[1213.50 → 1214.64] Yeah I got confused
[1214.64 → 1218.18] I was four
[1218.18 → 1218.72] When my dad
[1218.72 → 1219.40] Was in high school
[1219.40 → 1220.40] He was a
[1220.40 → 1221.38] Early breeder
[1221.38 → 1222.06] Anyway
[1222.06 → 1223.60] So I think
[1223.60 → 1223.98] What happened
[1223.98 → 1224.60] Was you plugged
[1224.60 → 1225.52] Your 3.5mm
[1225.52 → 1226.24] Into one end
[1226.24 → 1227.18] And then it passed
[1227.18 → 1228.46] Through to your speakers
[1228.46 → 1230.26] And it would like
[1230.26 → 1231.08] Light up
[1231.08 → 1232.18] With it
[1232.18 → 1233.02] He made that
[1233.02 → 1234.26] When he was in high school
[1234.26 → 1235.60] That's pretty dope
[1235.60 → 1236.94] So we're bringing it back
[1236.94 → 1237.64] Alright
[1237.64 → 1238.34] Yeah
[1238.34 → 1239.12] Cool
[1239.12 → 1239.92] Anyway
[1239.92 → 1240.60] The LEDs on it
[1240.60 → 1241.18] Look actually
[1241.18 → 1241.80] Pretty cool
[1241.80 → 1242.62] And pretty well-placed
[1242.62 → 1243.16] In my opinion
[1243.16 → 1243.70] Cool
[1243.70 → 1244.24] Just kind of go around
[1244.24 → 1244.64] The outside
[1244.64 → 1245.08] Looks pretty safe
[1245.08 → 1245.92] I saw it
[1245.92 → 1246.32] I was like
[1246.32 → 1246.90] Yeah
[1246.90 → 1248.32] I like it
[1248.32 → 1249.10] I-O configuration
[1249.10 → 1250.00] Looks standard
[1250.00 → 1250.44] No
[1250.44 → 1252.32] Two
[1252.32 → 1253.20] Two HDMI
[1253.20 → 1254.70] Two DisplayPort
[1254.70 → 1255.76] And one DVI
[1255.76 → 1257.78] An interesting choice
[1257.78 → 1258.62] So what's standard?
[1259.38 → 1260.56] Unless I'm crazy
[1260.56 → 1261.44] I believe standard
[1261.44 → 1262.94] Is one HDMI
[1262.94 → 1263.60] 2.0
[1263.60 → 1265.00] Three DisplayPort
[1265.00 → 1266.28] 1.4s
[1266.28 → 1267.80] And DVI
[1267.80 → 1268.36] Oh okay
[1268.36 → 1269.28] I could be wrong
[1269.28 → 1270.02] So they just swapped
[1270.02 → 1271.02] Out a DisplayPort
[1271.02 → 1271.54] For an HDMI
[1271.54 → 1272.08] And it's
[1272.08 → 1274.14] $639.99
[1274.14 → 1275.66] Which confirms
[1275.66 → 1276.44] What I thought
[1276.44 → 1277.94] That the add-in cards
[1277.94 → 1278.54] Are going to be
[1278.54 → 1279.78] Less than the founders
[1279.78 → 1280.50] More
[1280.50 → 1282.04] The founders is $599
[1282.04 → 1282.86] Oh
[1282.86 → 1284.28] Is that right John?
[1284.58 → 1284.90] Yeah
[1284.90 → 1285.54] Yeah
[1285.54 → 1286.70] So the reason why
[1286.70 → 1287.26] I thought this
[1287.26 → 1287.80] Was because they were
[1287.80 → 1288.22] Saying like
[1288.22 → 1289.22] Oh MSRP
[1289.22 → 1290.24] Of add-in board
[1290.24 → 1290.86] Partner cards
[1290.86 → 1291.24] Will be
[1291.24 → 1291.90] Way
[1291.90 → 1293.10] Like $100 lower
[1293.10 → 1294.34] $499 or whatever
[1294.34 → 1294.62] Right
[1294.62 → 1295.42] But
[1295.42 → 1296.64] I think that
[1296.64 → 1297.40] Didn't account
[1297.40 → 1298.22] For any changes
[1298.22 → 1298.88] That they made
[1298.88 → 1300.00] So ASUS
[1300.00 → 1301.12] Brought in like
[1301.12 → 1302.06] RGB
[1302.06 → 1303.42] And all this
[1303.42 → 1304.10] Other kind of stuff
[1304.10 → 1304.60] And it costs
[1304.60 → 1305.28] Way more now
[1305.28 → 1305.86] Right
[1305.86 → 1306.64] So maybe
[1306.64 → 1307.38] But they said
[1307.38 → 1308.08] Add-in cards
[1308.08 → 1308.96] I know
[1308.96 → 1309.82] But I think
[1309.82 → 1310.56] But like
[1310.56 → 1311.46] This is a badass
[1311.46 → 1312.26] Add-in card
[1312.26 → 1312.72] Yeah
[1312.72 → 1313.64] So like
[1313.64 → 1314.22] So like
[1314.22 → 1314.84] I think someone
[1314.84 → 1315.62] Might make like
[1315.62 → 1316.62] Some plastics shroud
[1316.62 → 1317.42] And it might be cheap
[1317.42 → 1318.52] And then it can be
[1318.52 → 1319.68] As low as
[1319.68 → 1320.56] $499
[1320.56 → 1321.16] I don't think
[1321.16 → 1321.90] It's going to be like
[1321.90 → 1322.76] This is what
[1322.76 → 1323.36] They're all going to be
[1323.36 → 1324.02] I think it's going to be like
[1324.02 → 1325.16] This is the baseline
[1325.16 → 1326.18] Of add-in board
[1326.18 → 1326.70] So like
[1326.70 → 1327.42] The cheapest
[1327.42 → 1329.14] 1080 that you're going to be able to get
[1329.14 → 1330.00] Is going to be $499
[1330.00 → 1330.64] I think
[1330.64 → 1331.84] Hopefully
[1331.84 → 1332.48] Yeah
[1332.48 → 1333.58] That would be pretty dope
[1333.58 → 1334.64] I guess we might as well
[1334.64 → 1335.22] Just go through
[1335.22 → 1336.34] Everyone's 1080s
[1336.34 → 1337.22] Because why not
[1337.22 → 1338.28] VGA
[1338.28 → 1338.98] 10
[1338.98 → 1340.22] MSRP is $599
[1340.22 → 1342.70] Sorry
[1342.70 → 1343.84] That's the founders card
[1343.84 → 1344.74] You're off by $100
[1344.74 → 1345.98] What?
[1347.20 → 1348.54] The founders card is $599
[1348.54 → 1349.68] The founders card is $699
[1349.68 → 1351.24] Oh $699
[1351.24 → 1351.56] Okay
[1351.56 → 1353.00] So is it cheaper then?
[1353.56 → 1354.14] It's what cheaper?
[1354.24 → 1355.74] This is $639
[1355.74 → 1356.30] Right?
[1356.36 → 1357.20] It's less than $799
[1357.20 → 1360.32] So the crazy RGB triple fan Strip
[1360.32 → 1361.46] Is less than the founders?
[1361.46 → 1362.86] Is less than the founders' edition
[1362.86 → 1364.52] Yeah
[1364.52 → 1365.16] Yeah
[1365.16 → 1365.52] Yeah
[1365.52 → 1366.74] Alright
[1366.74 → 1367.64] Cool
[1367.64 → 1368.12] What?
[1368.52 → 1369.28] That's kind of insane
[1369.28 → 1371.78] The stock cooled variant will be $620
[1371.78 → 1373.52] And this is only $640?
[1373.52 → 1374.60] Stock clocked variant
[1374.60 → 1374.96] Sorry
[1374.96 → 1378.16] The hot clocked OC version will be $640
[1378.16 → 1381.38] Which I have a video on overclocking 1080s
[1381.38 → 1382.76] That will be coming out
[1382.76 → 1383.04] Soon
[1383.04 → 1384.38] Soonish
[1384.38 → 1385.42] Probably after Computer
[1385.42 → 1385.98] I'm not sure
[1385.98 → 1389.14] There's some really cool new stuff
[1389.14 → 1390.44] With GP Boost 3.0
[1390.44 → 1392.54] 4 fan hitters
[1392.54 → 1393.48] Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1393.48 → 1396.74] I want them to tell me about power
[1396.74 → 1398.54] National horsepower
[1398.54 → 1399.54] That's not what I meant
[1399.54 → 1401.38] Twitch chat's so funny man
[1401.38 → 1402.08] What are they saying?
[1402.62 → 1403.92] They're just so funny man
[1403.92 → 1406.78] Not in the EU
[1406.78 → 1408.38] Yeah not in Canada either bro
[1408.38 → 1410.32] Yeah not at all in Canada either
[1410.32 → 1411.24] Not at all
[1411.24 → 1413.24] Hmm
[1413.24 → 1414.46] Ooh
[1414.46 → 1416.64] GP Boost clock of 1936
[1416.64 → 1418.48] That actually sounds
[1418.48 → 1420.10] Right around
[1420.10 → 1421.96] Quite similar
[1421.96 → 1423.50] To the
[1423.50 → 1425.38] Like not super crazy
[1425.38 → 1426.02] Pushing it
[1426.02 → 1427.18] But kind of borderline
[1427.18 → 1428.54] Of the Founders Edition
[1428.54 → 1429.48] So I think you can
[1429.48 → 1431.34] Definitely get more out of that too
[1431.34 → 1432.56] But uh
[1432.56 → 1433.32] We'll talk about that later
[1433.32 → 1434.70] Let's move on to the VGA
[1434.70 → 1435.22] Bring
[1435.22 → 1436.64] Sure
[1436.64 → 1437.48] 1080
[1437.48 → 1441.76] An on tech
[1441.76 → 1443.36] And Total
[1443.36 → 1444.20] Two birds
[1444.20 → 1444.90] One stone dude
[1444.90 → 1445.80] There we go
[1445.80 → 1446.80] The Total one
[1446.80 → 1447.58] Ah
[1447.58 → 1448.90] We'll see
[1448.90 → 1449.98] See like this
[1449.98 → 1450.70] Push the limit
[1450.70 → 1451.64] Is maybe
[1451.64 → 1452.22] Nah
[1452.22 → 1453.02] Maybe alright
[1453.02 → 1454.38] And then
[1454.38 → 1455.88] Oh it doesn't show the back
[1455.88 → 1457.24] Come on
[1457.24 → 1457.90] Show me all the pictures
[1457.90 → 1458.68] It's just like giant
[1458.68 → 1459.42] Push the limit
[1459.42 → 1461.50] Yeah which I'm not super
[1461.50 → 1462.36] Sure about
[1462.36 → 1463.88] Let's just do this
[1463.88 → 1465.34] Total
[1465.34 → 1466.18] 1080
[1466.18 → 1468.76] And then images
[1468.76 → 1470.76] Wow
[1470.76 → 1471.84] What are those
[1471.84 → 1473.00] That's kind of insane
[1473.00 → 1474.50] I haven't seen that yet
[1474.50 → 1475.68] PGF edition
[1475.68 → 1477.12] So we're gonna check
[1477.12 → 1477.76] All these things
[1477.76 → 1478.60] More in depth
[1478.60 → 1479.42] When we're at the show
[1479.42 → 1480.14] But this looks like
[1480.14 → 1481.16] A height extended
[1481.16 → 1482.26] And width extended
[1482.26 → 1482.94] Graphics card
[1482.94 → 1483.84] From Total
[1483.84 → 1485.84] That's huge
[1485.84 → 1487.08] There this is the one
[1487.08 → 1487.92] That I was talking about
[1487.92 → 1489.26] Like it looks like
[1489.26 → 1489.86] They just slapped
[1489.86 → 1490.64] A sticker on it
[1490.64 → 1491.54] That says push the limit
[1491.54 → 1492.80] And the thing that really
[1492.80 → 1494.02] Makes me sad
[1494.02 → 1495.88] Is it looks so sweet
[1495.88 → 1496.60] Without that
[1496.60 → 1497.30] Right
[1497.30 → 1498.64] Without the like
[1498.64 → 1499.38] Weird like
[1499.38 → 1500.56] Push the limit
[1500.56 → 1501.34] Yeah like I like
[1501.34 → 1501.90] The striping
[1501.90 → 1502.32] Yeah
[1502.32 → 1503.48] And if I remember correctly
[1503.48 → 1504.80] The lower end one
[1504.80 → 1505.66] Not the like
[1505.66 → 1506.06] Amp
[1506.06 → 1506.78] Doesn't have that
[1506.78 → 1508.58] Yeah it doesn't have that
[1508.58 → 1509.46] So let's go to the link
[1509.46 → 1509.92] Real quick
[1509.92 → 1511.32] This is on video cards
[1511.32 → 1512.32] So there's the
[1512.32 → 1512.88] Two fan and
[1512.88 → 1513.92] Three fan versions
[1513.92 → 1515.64] The three fan version
[1515.64 → 1516.88] Has push the limit on it
[1516.88 → 1518.66] The omega and the extreme
[1518.66 → 1519.08] Or whatever
[1519.08 → 1519.52] Yeah
[1519.52 → 1521.68] Three fan version
[1521.68 → 1522.28] Push the limit
[1522.28 → 1523.12] Two fan version
[1523.12 → 1524.06] Clean back
[1524.06 → 1525.06] See I like that
[1525.06 → 1526.00] And it looks better
[1526.00 → 1526.42] And it's like
[1526.42 → 1527.42] Damn it
[1527.42 → 1528.44] Oh you can see
[1528.44 → 1530.56] There are two power fingers there
[1530.56 → 1531.22] Good
[1531.22 → 1532.82] Yes
[1532.82 → 1535.46] Okay
[1535.46 → 1536.24] That's awesome
[1536.24 → 1537.28] One thing that I've
[1537.28 → 1538.52] Been a little bit annoyed about
[1538.52 → 1539.34] By the Founders Edition
[1539.34 → 1540.24] Is spoiler alert
[1540.24 → 1542.02] For my overclocking video
[1542.02 → 1542.68] That's coming out
[1542.68 → 1543.62] One of the things
[1543.62 → 1544.48] That held it back
[1544.48 → 1545.62] Multiple times
[1545.62 → 1547.08] With the new OC scanner mode
[1547.08 → 1548.32] Which I'll explain in that video
[1548.32 → 1549.90] Is it was hitting power limits
[1549.90 → 1551.42] And I think that's because
[1551.42 → 1552.08] Of the one
[1552.08 → 1553.04] PCI Express power
[1553.04 → 1553.82] That was powering it
[1553.82 → 1555.40] So hopefully this card
[1555.40 → 1556.72] Will give it more
[1556.72 → 1557.46] Both of these cards
[1557.46 → 1557.92] Will give it more
[1557.92 → 1558.40] Because they have
[1558.40 → 1560.06] Two PCI Express power plugs
[1560.06 → 1561.26] That's what I was looking for
[1561.26 → 1562.64] On the ASUS page
[1562.64 → 1563.48] And couldn't find it
[1563.48 → 1563.80] Sure
[1563.80 → 1565.74] Give me one second
[1565.74 → 1569.36] VGA 1080
[1569.36 → 1572.02] 1080 Founders Edition
[1572.02 → 1572.64] No I want your
[1572.64 → 1573.40] After market one
[1573.40 → 1579.82] There we go
[1579.82 → 1581.14] That looks pretty sweet
[1581.14 → 1582.82] It's all like metal
[1582.82 → 1584.32] It's like not symmetrical
[1584.32 → 1584.74] Though
[1584.74 → 1585.66] Not symmetrical
[1585.66 → 1586.48] Oh you're right
[1586.48 → 1588.22] That kind of bothers me
[1588.22 → 1589.06] That's a little weird
[1589.06 → 1591.16] And honestly
[1591.16 → 1591.72] This part
[1591.72 → 1592.48] I don't like at all
[1592.48 → 1595.32] I'm actually okay with it
[1595.32 → 1595.70] Really?
[1596.10 → 1596.42] Yeah
[1596.42 → 1598.26] Like that's
[1598.26 → 1599.68] I guess it's not plugged in
[1599.68 → 1600.14] So you can't tell
[1600.14 → 1601.16] If it is like glows or anything
[1601.16 → 1603.72] Maybe it has like backlighting
[1603.72 → 1604.78] It might
[1604.78 → 1605.64] RGB backlit
[1605.64 → 1606.48] That would be pretty
[1606.48 → 1607.26] F'n cool
[1607.26 → 1608.58] Here we go
[1608.58 → 1609.74] It looks like it is lit up
[1609.74 → 1610.62] Maybe not RGB
[1610.62 → 1613.04] But it's white backlighting
[1613.04 → 1614.14] That looks clean
[1614.14 → 1615.52] I actually like that
[1615.52 → 1616.52] I like that a lot
[1616.52 → 1617.22] It might look alright
[1617.22 → 1618.36] I don't know if it looks great
[1618.36 → 1619.88] With that board in particular
[1619.88 → 1620.32] Sure
[1620.32 → 1621.28] But I think like
[1621.28 → 1622.02] If you used
[1622.02 → 1623.96] Not to just chill
[1623.96 → 1625.56] But the coloured thing
[1625.56 → 1626.16] Works together
[1626.16 → 1626.92] The Asus
[1626.92 → 1628.62] Like deluxe board
[1628.62 → 1629.12] In white
[1629.12 → 1629.44] Sure
[1629.44 → 1630.88] Considering that's white backlighting
[1630.88 → 1631.76] Then the green SC
[1631.76 → 1633.28] Would bother some people
[1633.28 → 1633.74] Yeah
[1633.74 → 1634.56] I don't know though
[1634.56 → 1635.20] I don't know
[1635.20 → 1635.50] Maybe
[1635.50 → 1636.96] We'll see
[1636.96 → 1640.08] Anyway
[1640.08 → 1641.06] Graphics cards
[1641.06 → 1641.62] We'll be covering
[1641.62 → 1643.40] A bunch of those
[1643.40 → 1644.84] At Computer
[1644.84 → 1645.66] More in depth
[1645.66 → 1647.22] Talking about their clock speeds
[1647.22 → 1648.24] Their prices
[1648.24 → 1648.88] Hopefully
[1648.88 → 1652.74] What power delivery systems
[1652.74 → 1653.12] They have
[1653.12 → 1653.94] All that kind of stuff
[1653.94 → 1654.94] At Computer
[1654.94 → 1656.10] There will be a few videos
[1656.10 → 1656.46] There
[1656.46 → 1658.28] I wouldn't worry too much
[1658.28 → 1658.56] About it
[1658.56 → 1659.14] VGA
[1659.14 → 1660.68] That's another one
[1660.68 → 1661.82] We need to figure out
[1661.82 → 1662.32] But
[1662.32 → 1663.46] I forgot about that
[1663.46 → 1664.44] Okay
[1664.44 → 1665.56] Moving on
[1665.56 → 1671.96] Another like
[1671.96 → 1673.48] People getting sued
[1673.48 → 1674.18] Thing
[1674.18 → 1676.42] The jury has sided with Google
[1676.42 → 1678.30] In a battle over Android software
[1678.30 → 1679.26] With Oracle
[1679.26 → 1680.14] So
[1680.14 → 1681.40] Android
[1681.40 → 1682.02] Google
[1682.02 → 1682.84] Dodged a
[1682.84 → 1683.38] Nine
[1683.38 → 1684.78] Billion dollar
[1684.78 → 1685.70] Potential bullet
[1685.70 → 1685.94] Here
[1685.94 → 1686.52] Which would have been
[1686.52 → 1687.30] Very brutal
[1687.30 → 1688.24] The federal jury
[1688.24 → 1689.12] Just found
[1689.12 → 1689.92] On Thursday
[1689.92 → 1690.40] That Google
[1690.40 → 1691.14] Didn't need
[1691.14 → 1691.72] Permission
[1691.72 → 1692.64] To use
[1692.64 → 1693.18] Arrival's
[1693.18 → 1694.00] Programming tool
[1694.00 → 1694.94] As it built
[1694.94 → 1695.36] Android
[1695.36 → 1696.04] Also known as
[1696.04 → 1697.12] Java
[1697.12 → 1698.06] And stuff
[1698.06 → 1699.84] So Google
[1699.84 → 1700.54] Argued that
[1700.54 → 1701.28] Because it
[1701.28 → 1702.26] Used only a
[1702.26 → 1703.00] Small part
[1703.00 → 1703.48] Of Java
[1703.48 → 1703.92] To create
[1703.92 → 1704.32] Android
[1704.32 → 1705.14] It qualified
[1705.14 → 1705.64] For a
[1705.64 → 1706.34] Fair use
[1706.34 → 1706.80] Exemption
[1706.80 → 1707.66] From copyright
[1707.66 → 1708.98] And apparently
[1708.98 → 1709.82] The jury's verdict
[1709.82 → 1710.86] Marks Google's
[1710.86 → 1712.10] Second victory
[1712.10 → 1713.06] In the case
[1713.06 → 1714.10] Wow
[1714.10 → 1716.68] That's kind of crazy
[1716.68 → 1718.08] That is pretty crazy
[1718.08 → 1718.64] Especially because
[1718.64 → 1719.84] They just got slammed
[1719.84 → 1720.80] In I don't remember
[1720.80 → 1721.08] Where
[1721.08 → 1722.04] For like
[1722.04 → 1722.88] Not paying taxes
[1722.88 → 1723.42] Or something
[1723.42 → 1724.86] So like
[1724.86 → 1725.98] Billions of dollars
[1725.98 → 1726.42] There
[1726.42 → 1727.30] Billions of dollars
[1727.30 → 1727.70] Here
[1727.70 → 1728.34] That could have been
[1728.34 → 1728.88] A pretty brutal
[1728.88 → 1729.28] Combo
[1729.28 → 1729.62] But
[1729.62 → 1730.50] Oracle said
[1730.50 → 1731.00] It will appeal
[1731.00 → 1731.68] The latest verdict
[1731.68 → 1733.12] On numerous grounds
[1733.12 → 1735.82] Saw that coming
[1735.82 → 1736.36] Yeah
[1736.36 → 1737.04] I mean
[1737.04 → 1738.72] With every appeal
[1738.72 → 1739.40] It gets more difficult
[1739.40 → 1739.80] For them
[1739.80 → 1740.36] But like
[1740.36 → 1740.68] I'm sure
[1740.68 → 1741.02] They're not
[1741.02 → 1741.34] Just going to
[1741.34 → 1741.78] Let it go
[1741.78 → 1742.20] Yeah
[1742.20 → 1743.10] Android's huge
[1743.10 → 1744.72] 9 billion dollars
[1744.72 → 1745.56] Is something
[1745.56 → 1746.58] To fight for
[1746.58 → 1747.36] Speaking of
[1747.36 → 1747.90] Lots of money
[1747.90 → 1748.64] To fight for
[1748.64 → 1749.70] Japan
[1749.70 → 1750.94] There was an
[1750.94 → 1751.80] ATM heist
[1751.80 → 1752.90] That reportedly
[1752.90 → 1753.36] Involved
[1753.36 → 1754.36] Over a hundred
[1754.36 → 1755.54] Or about a hundred
[1755.54 → 1756.24] People exactly
[1756.24 → 1756.94] And they stole
[1756.94 → 1757.98] What is equivalent
[1757.98 → 1759.62] To 12.7 million
[1759.62 → 1760.44] US dollars
[1760.44 → 1762.64] Or 1.4 billion
[1762.64 → 1763.02] Yen
[1763.02 → 1763.50] It used
[1763.50 → 1764.76] South African
[1764.76 → 1766.00] Credit cards
[1766.00 → 1766.42] They hit
[1766.42 → 1767.00] 1,400
[1767.00 → 1767.48] Different
[1767.48 → 1768.14] ATMs
[1768.14 → 1769.06] And they withdrew
[1769.06 → 1769.88] About the equivalent
[1769.88 → 1770.50] Of 900
[1770.50 → 1771.26] US dollars
[1771.26 → 1772.24] At each
[1772.24 → 1772.78] ATM
[1772.78 → 1773.96] You know
[1773.96 → 1774.28] It's kind of
[1774.28 → 1774.50] Funny

[1847.22 → 1847.40] Ago
[1847.40 → 1847.60] Now
[1847.60 → 1847.76] But
[1847.76 → 1847.84] I
[1847.84 → 1848.04] Remember
[1848.04 → 1848.28] Hearing
[1848.28 → 1848.50] About
[1848.50 → 1848.68] Something

[1850.92 → 1851.08] I
[1851.08 → 1851.36] Think

[1855.00 → 1855.12] Is
[1855.12 → 1855.78] Insane
[1855.78 → 1856.10] 100
[1856.10 → 1856.40] People
[1856.40 → 1856.96] Coordinated
[1856.96 → 1857.16] In
[1857.16 → 1857.26] An
[1857.26 → 1857.52] Attack
[1857.52 → 1857.78] That
[1857.78 → 1857.88] Is
[1857.88 → 1858.36] Ridiculous
[1858.36 → 1859.24] It
[1859.24 → 1859.36] Is
[1859.36 → 1859.68] Ridiculous
[1859.68 → 1859.86] And
[1859.86 → 1859.92] The
[1859.92 → 1860.10] Thing
[1860.10 → 1860.26] Is
[1860.26 → 1860.44] You
[1860.44 → 1860.82] Catch
[1860.82 → 1861.22] Some
[1861.22 → 1861.34] Of
[1861.34 → 1861.48] Them
[1861.48 → 1861.84] And
[1861.84 → 1861.96] That

[1862.74 → 1863.00] Catch
[1863.00 → 1863.34] Others
[1863.34 → 1863.78] So
[1863.78 → 1863.98] I
[1863.98 → 1864.12] Guess
[1864.12 → 1864.30] We'll

[2090.04 → 2090.68] And
[2090.68 → 2090.94] Then
[2090.94 → 2092.30] Robot
[2092.30 → 2092.80] Ex
[2092.80 → 2092.88] Now
[2092.88 → 2093.00] Essentially
[2093.00 → 2093.30] I
[2093.30 → 2093.50] Think
[2093.50 → 2093.80] I
[2093.80 → 2093.92] Think
[2093.92 → 2094.08] The
[2094.08 → 2094.28] First
[2094.28 → 2094.48] One
[2094.48 → 2094.74] Was
[2094.74 → 2094.94] Steam
[2094.94 → 2095.20] Second
[2095.20 → 2096.24] Anyway
[2096.24 → 2097.36] But
[2097.36 → 2098.66] What
[2098.66 → 2099.00] Essentially
[2099.00 → 2099.32] Ends
[2099.32 → 2099.50] Up
[2099.50 → 2100.12] Happening
[2100.12 → 2100.46] In
[2100.46 → 2100.58] The
[2100.58 → 2100.82] First
[2100.82 → 2101.08] Two
[2101.08 → 2101.46] Is
[2101.46 → 2101.76] That
[2101.76 → 2102.36] Yeah
[2102.36 → 2102.74] The

[2103.80 → 2103.98] Get
[2103.98 → 2104.28] Cut
[2104.28 → 2104.98] And
[2104.98 → 2105.28] Then
[2105.28 → 2105.78] Those
[2105.78 → 2106.06] People
[2106.06 → 2106.22] Are
[2106.22 → 2106.74] Actualized

[2108.52 → 2108.82] This
[2108.82 → 2109.06] Time
[2109.06 → 2109.44] Around
[2109.44 → 2109.98] I
[2109.98 → 2110.24] Mean
[2110.24 → 2110.86] In
[2110.86 → 2111.30] This
[2111.30 → 2111.72] Series
[2111.72 → 2112.98] That
[2112.98 → 2113.38] May
[2113.38 → 2113.86] Happen

[2115.68 → 2115.90] More

[2116.16 → 2116.42] Become

[2117.42 → 2117.58] Is
[2117.58 → 2117.98] Instated
[2117.98 → 2119.26] But
[2119.26 → 2119.66] We're
[2119.66 → 2119.90] Heading
[2119.90 → 2120.16] Down

[2120.88 → 2121.08] For
[2121.08 → 2121.30] Sure
[2121.30 → 2121.60] I
[2121.60 → 2121.74] Don't

[2125.72 → 2126.12] Yeah
[2126.12 → 2126.50] Just
[2126.50 → 2127.04] Because
[2127.04 → 2128.12] I'm
[2128.12 → 2128.42] Sure
[2128.42 → 2129.04] When
[2129.04 → 2130.28] Electricity
[2130.28 → 2130.40] Was

[2133.26 → 2133.82] And
[2133.82 → 2135.62] Was
[2135.62 → 2135.96] Freaking
[2135.96 → 2136.26] Out
[2136.26 → 2136.68] But
[2136.68 → 2137.16] The

[2137.54 → 2137.82] Right
[2137.82 → 2138.18] Now
[2138.18 → 2140.06] In
[2140.06 → 2140.28] My
[2140.28 → 2140.68] Opinion
[2140.68 → 2141.34] Is
[2141.34 → 2141.50] That
[2141.50 → 2141.74] There's
[2141.74 → 2142.28] Already

[2194.62 → 2195.48] You're
[2195.48 → 2195.68] Putting
[2195.68 → 2196.00] Yourself
[2196.00 → 2196.20] Out of
[2196.20 → 2196.30] A
[2196.30 → 2196.52] Job
[2196.52 → 2196.84] What
[2196.84 → 2196.92] Are
[2196.92 → 2197.02] You
[2197.02 → 2197.36] Doing
[2197.36 → 2197.82] Yeah
[2197.82 → 2198.54] So
[2198.54 → 2199.06] I
[2199.06 → 2199.82] I
[2199.82 → 2200.12] I
[2200.12 → 2200.44] Don't
[2200.44 → 2200.52] I
[2200.52 → 2200.90] Don't
[2200.90 → 2201.30] Be
[2201.30 → 2202.18] The
[2202.18 → 2202.48] Guy
[2202.48 → 2202.82] Who
[2202.82 → 2204.34] Brings
[2204.34 → 2204.98] Thunderstorms
[2204.98 → 2205.08] And
[2205.08 → 2205.36] Says
[2205.36 → 2206.12] Oh
[2206.12 → 2206.30] This
[2206.30 → 2206.40] Is
[2206.40 → 2206.52] The
[2206.52 → 2206.68] End
[2206.68 → 2206.92] But
[2206.92 → 2207.18] I
[2207.18 → 2207.38] Mean
[2207.38 → 2207.74] It's
[2207.74 → 2208.08] It's
[2208.08 → 2208.38] Scary
[2208.38 → 2208.66] For
[2208.66 → 2208.90] Sure
[2208.90 → 2209.36] And
[2209.36 → 2209.64] At
[2209.64 → 2209.78] The
[2209.78 → 2210.04] Very
[2210.04 → 2210.28] Least
[2210.28 → 2210.48] It's
[2210.48 → 2210.58] An
[2210.58 → 2210.94] Extremely
[2210.94 → 2211.46] Transitional
[2211.46 → 2211.78] Time
[2211.78 → 2218.28] and a lot of people are going to be caught in the crap yeah and there's massive news reports
[2218.28 → 2223.72] everywhere like Uber trying as hard as they can actively to make this so that they never have to
[2223.72 → 2229.48] have another driver again, and it's all automated um transport industries everywhere are on the
[2229.48 → 2235.90] brink of just like firing everyone because they can automate all of their driving oh my goodness
[2235.90 → 2239.58] like I used to work for a company called Canada bread factory if that place doesn't get automated
[2239.58 → 2245.78] in a year I would be surprised because there's like nothing there was literally a job where you
[2245.78 → 2251.96] go like this, and you pick up the bread, and then you rotate for like a little bit and then put it in a
[2251.96 → 2257.84] tray and then go back and pick up the bread and then rotate and put it in a tray like the fact that
[2257.84 → 2263.60] wasn't already automated is pretty incredible wild so it'll be automated eventually and the driving from
[2263.60 → 2268.38] that place was you because it wasn't really a warehouse it's just a distribution centre they
[2268.38 → 2273.64] would drive semi trucks not very far and dump off all the bread and then drive them back and it
[2273.64 → 2279.24] was routine routes every single time and people not the drivers would just fill up the trucks so if
[2279.24 → 2284.48] they automated filling up the trucks which would be extremely easy and automated the driving which
[2284.48 → 2288.86] would be extremely easy because it's the same route every single time that just no one needs to work
[2288.86 → 2294.60] there except for mechanics and like you, you could say like oh everyone's just going to get a
[2294.60 → 2300.38] specialized trade and just fix the robots not enough jobs at all our population is constantly
[2300.38 → 2306.76] increasing yeah and like not enough jobs and so many people are caught in like I said the wave of crap
[2306.76 → 2312.60] of like okay now you're useless and you either have to go back to school or figure something else out
[2312.60 → 2320.92] um yeah it's just it's going to be it's going to be interesting it's going to be very least yeah
[2320.92 → 2324.10] not so sure about that anyway
[2324.10 → 2334.70] ad spots and Nick is here this time so if I super screw them up he can just tell me in person
[2334.70 → 2340.26] immediately which is good I'm doing my lynda.com dance because I like lynda.com I can find the notes
[2340.26 → 2343.74] on this it's used by millions of people around the world more than 3 000 courses are available
[2343.74 → 2348.70] in topics like web development photography visual design and business I'm taking a photography course
[2348.70 → 2354.30] even though I'm trying to learn how to film stuff the reason why I'm doing that is because it has
[2354.30 → 2361.48] more like slower for people that have no idea what they're talking about including me explanations of
[2361.48 → 2367.16] different things like exposure theory and stuff like that so then I can apply that to the video side
[2367.16 → 2370.74] of things what I really like about the course that I'm going through I'm going to skip most of the
[2370.74 → 2375.36] notes and just go over my personal stuff but i I'll try to get through the notes anyway um is that
[2375.36 → 2379.68] I can like be doing something else and listening to it and then go like okay I think I missed like
[2379.68 → 2384.48] half of that because I got way too engrossed in what I was working on skip back to the last word in
[2384.48 → 2389.48] the script that you can read below the video that I heard and recognized or if I don't understand
[2389.48 → 2393.42] something fully I can just skip back to the beginning of the word it's just a really easy way of
[2393.42 → 2398.34] skipping through videos I can also take notes on their app and I can log the like library of
[2398.34 → 2402.44] courses that I want to go through so I created a course plan for myself that gets me through all
[2402.44 → 2407.38] the different photography courses that I want to do and that gets me into some filming courses and
[2407.38 → 2411.44] then gets me into some editing courses and stuff right yeah because you can make your own playlists
[2411.44 → 2417.82] right yeah, yeah so I like made my own thing yeah and then I'm just going along it which is way easier
[2417.82 → 2423.84] because I basically formed my own overall course out of a bunch of course modules that they
[2423.84 → 2428.84] gave me, and they do have overall courses that they can just use uh that you can just use on your own
[2428.84 → 2433.20] I just have a weird random amount of knowledge from like working with Brandon and stuff so I could

[2511.82 → 2516.66] deposits before it does the work so you can make sure that the guy doesn't just try to like kick it

[2627.94 → 2633.66] uh with your continued support we will hopefully not be replaced by robots although Nick might like
[2633.66 → 2638.90] that because the robots probably wouldn't screw up the sponsor spots yeah but then I would get
[2638.90 → 2647.26] replaced by robot probably as well yeah I like how you said you can make a website or a blog about your
[2647.26 → 2655.22] cat, and then you didn't say dog oh well because your dog is you're like you can make a website or
[2655.22 → 2662.24] blog about your cat or like other stuff I was like I thought he was going to just rap like a Squarespace
[2662.24 → 2667.54] rap oh I probably should have that would have been or like uh whatever that that theme song that they
[2667.54 → 2673.64] did like a couple of years ago Squarespace started today I don't remember the whole thing I don't know
[2673.64 → 2679.86] that was dropped super uh man Squarespace needs to get a slogan they probably dropped it because
[2679.86 → 2685.10] you made fun of it let's be honest really, but then they should have kept you should or build it
[2685.10 → 2693.82] beautiful because we made it awesome monster kid that's not live so you can't like to see it
[2693.82 → 2699.34] happening I know okay somebody said I didn't mean the show is not live I just want to clarify that
[2699.34 → 2704.46] before people start going all conspiracy theory um I've showed my screen on screen look you can
[2704.46 → 2711.54] see the like date and time and stuff and like an bulker said we must stop technology this has gone
[2711.54 → 2716.10] too far destroy all the robots exclamation exclamation exclamation that's a little aggressive I don't think
[2716.10 → 2720.92] destroying all the robots is the right idea robots by the way I'm on your side uh speaking of which
[2720.92 → 2725.80] being on the side of the robots and whatever else the first tesla driver was caught sleeping with
[2725.80 → 2732.94] autopilot on have you heard about this no he was crashed in the car like okay oh crashed is the
[2732.94 → 2739.94] wrong thing to say I was like he crashed whoa that's not okay to say in this context he was zonked out he
[2739.94 → 2747.16] was asleep he was asleep so he's asleep in the car you can see on this video it's vertically filmed and
[2747.16 → 2753.96] stuff he's he's out literally see that unless he has like one eye open and is just driving like this
[2753.96 → 2759.76] super doubt it extremely unlikely super doubt it so he's out, and you can see autopilot driving him
[2759.76 → 2765.14] he's he's stopped there because traffic slowed down, and he picks up again he's just scooting along in
[2765.14 → 2770.98] traffic no big deal it's its tight traffic like it's not like this is superfast speeds or anything
[2770.98 → 2778.18] this car is almost stopping again just keeps rolling amazing so the guy fell asleep in the car
[2778.18 → 2785.72] and autopilot saved him which is like not really a feature don't do that, but it's maybe he had
[2785.72 → 2790.84] autopilot on, and he's just been sleeping in his car on his way home from work the whole like for three
[2790.84 → 2795.12] months and like nobody's caught him yet, and it's just getting better and better and learning the
[2795.12 → 2802.78] whole time maybe he's a national hero that's cool he's teaching autopilot how to be sentient I could be
[2802.78 → 2808.32] super wrong I don't think you can give autopilot like a map I think it just drives down the road
[2808.32 → 2815.88] so he's going to like wake up like super far down I could be wrong someone in twitch chat's gonna
[2815.88 → 2824.00] like leaves Vancouver he ends up in like Kelowna that's like that's like four hours away yeah
[2824.00 → 2827.38] someone in twitch chat's going to correct me I'm waiting for twitch chat to catch up
[2827.38 → 2832.72] Google Maps I would totally do that in traffic cars you shouldn't do that you should not do that
[2832.72 → 2838.90] that's not like a thing yet anchorman 2 what does that have to do with anything I have no idea
[2838.90 → 2842.86] actually I'll wake up when the tesla runs out of batteries that is incorrect okay
[2842.86 → 2851.40] you're wrong okay so I guess you can put a map in because people are very angry that's that's that's
[2851.40 → 2856.16] fine it probably would run some people are saying that it's fake which is a little bit disappointing
[2856.16 → 2862.20] um knowing they say everything's fake yeah but knowing the internet these days a lot of it could
[2862.20 → 2868.32] be fake yeah, yeah so I don't know I wouldn't be super surprised let's get our tinfoil hats on it was
[2868.32 → 2873.02] done by the oil companies maybe it was actually that would be a really bad thing for them to do
[2873.02 → 2878.80] because it's kind of promotion for how awesome autopilot is yeah but at the same time then they
[2878.80 → 2886.14] could spin it as like doing PR releases about like tesla drivers are totally idiots
[2886.14 → 2892.56] that was really bad i just I need to go I'm gonna I'm going to go appease the twitch chat real quick
[2892.56 → 2898.24] what how you're going to appease the twitch chat real quick what does that mean what are you doing
[2898.24 → 2903.52] what is it I don't get it oh come here
[2903.52 → 2909.16] I'm going to try to find a dentist appropriate topic
[2909.16 → 2910.52] you're the co-host now
[2910.52 → 2913.08] oh wait a walk in the water
[2913.08 → 2915.46] oh what are you doing
[2915.46 → 2917.14] he just wanted to show his butt off
[2917.14 → 2918.20] this was a mistake
[2918.20 → 2920.24] no it wasn't he just wanted to show his butt off
[2920.24 → 2921.90] it's gonna work really well
[2921.90 → 2922.50] hello
[2922.50 → 2926.58] what do you think about twitter relaxing the 140-character limit
[2926.58 → 2933.00] there's still 140-character limits but like at tagging people and posting photos and GIFs and videos
[2933.00 → 2937.64] and polls and quoting people's tweets and various media will not count against the character limit
[2937.64 → 2940.84] oh i I hate the limit thing
[2940.84 → 2941.36] you hate the limit
[2941.36 → 2946.46] it just gets everyone's grammar worse because I have to tie u to u
[2946.46 → 2948.46] n to n
[2948.46 → 2951.68] yeah, yeah, so everyone's grammar is going to look stupid
[2951.68 → 2952.96] that's why I hate that
[2952.96 → 2953.88] so are they getting
[2953.88 → 2956.02] so they're not getting rid of the character limit
[2956.02 → 2957.58] the character limit is still exactly the same
[2957.58 → 2957.78] yeah
[2957.78 → 2960.30] but like tagging someone in your tweet
[2960.30 → 2961.52] that's that's helpful
[2961.52 → 2968.82] uh putting in a like photo or video or poll or quoting someone's tweet or anything like that won't count against the limit
[2968.82 → 2969.82] that's good
[2969.82 → 2974.38] so basically what you say will be 140 characters instead of all the junk inside of it
[2974.38 → 2976.38] I wish they don't count space
[2976.38 → 2978.38] oh
[2978.38 → 2982.38] so 140 characters just for like the various words and stuff
[2982.38 → 2983.38] yeah
[2983.38 → 2983.60] okay
[2983.60 → 2985.98] they can count space and common
[2985.98 → 2987.42] common common common in
[2987.42 → 2987.90] commas
[2987.90 → 2989.26] period
[2989.26 → 2995.82] I think like within reason that could be cool like if you do more than one space
[2995.82 → 2997.18] it counts against it
[2997.18 → 2997.38] yeah
[2997.38 → 3002.06] and if you do more than three periods it should count against it
[3002.06 → 3003.98] in a row because you can do the dot dot dot
[3003.98 → 3009.98] they need to have responsible responsibility for everyone's grammar so they need to open up
[3009.98 → 3015.98] I think the thing is people are just going to say more at that point and then just chop up their grammar again anyway
[3015.98 → 3017.98] whatever
[3017.98 → 3021.98] whatever okay that's fine my grammar is not good
[3021.98 → 3025.98] no dude everyone's grammar sucks because they're twitter that is a thing you're not wrong
[3025.98 → 3027.98] pre-recorded chat
[3027.98 → 3029.98] how do you pre-record the chat I don't know man
[3029.98 → 3031.98] um
[3031.98 → 3033.98] when are they
[3033.98 → 3035.98] whoa this got changed
[3035.98 → 3037.98] when are they doing that
[3037.98 → 3039.98] it's cool updating the thing literally as we go
[3039.98 → 3041.98] so at names no longer count towards the 140 character count
[3041.98 → 3043.98] media attachments
[3043.98 → 3045.98] so when you attach things it doesn't count towards it
[3045.98 → 3047.98] yeah
[3047.98 → 3049.98] putting a tweet of your own
[3049.98 → 3050.98] doesn't count towards it
[3050.98 → 3051.98] um
[3051.98 → 3052.98] and
[3052.98 → 3053.98] the
[3053.98 → 3057.98] you know when you want to like tweet to someone, but you want to make it public so you put a period at the beginning
[3057.98 → 3058.98] oh I don't know
[3058.98 → 3059.98] have you ever done that
[3059.98 → 3060.98] no
[3060.98 → 3061.98] okay well that thing
[3061.98 → 3063.98] you don't have to worry about that anymore that's that's solved
[3063.98 → 3065.98] I don't know
[3065.98 → 3069.98] dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[3069.98 → 3071.98] I'm trying to find another Dennis topic
[3071.98 → 3072.98] yeah
[3072.98 → 3074.98] are these too hard for me
[3074.98 → 3076.98] no I just don't think you'll care
[3076.98 → 3077.98] haha
[3077.98 → 3081.98] who would Dennis care about
[3081.98 → 3083.98] hello everyone
[3083.98 → 3085.98] there was a marijuana social network
[3085.98 → 3086.98] do I care
[3086.98 → 3087.98] maybe
[3087.98 → 3088.98] uh
[3088.98 → 3089.98] that
[3089.98 → 3090.98] haha
[3090.98 → 3091.98] um
[3091.98 → 3092.98] called mass roots
[3092.98 → 3095.98] which was supposed to be a Facebook for pot
[3095.98 → 3098.98] and it was apparently not allowed to join the NASDAQ exchange
[3098.98 → 3099.98] why
[3099.98 → 3106.98] the Denver based social network has 775 000 users from the 24 states where marijuana is
[3106.98 → 3107.98] um
[3107.98 → 3110.98] at least to some degree legal I guess
[3110.98 → 3111.98] um
[3111.98 → 3114.98] including states where it's legal recreationally
[3114.98 → 3115.98] which is like two
[3115.98 → 3116.98] right
[3116.98 → 3117.98] um
[3117.98 → 3118.98] I think it's three
[3118.98 → 3120.98] another one just passed or something
[3120.98 → 3121.98] um
[3121.98 → 3126.98] Washington Colorado and I think maybe a lot of people are lying about that
[3126.98 → 3128.98] okay so maybe three states that it's legal in
[3128.98 → 3132.98] mass roots said that it meets the criteria for listing on NASDAQ
[3132.98 → 3139.98] it has a 40 million dollar uh market capitalization value it has well over 300 shareholders
[3139.98 → 3141.98] um through over-the-counter markets
[3141.98 → 3149.98] NASDAQ's denial has sent mass roots off exchange shares down 18 percent which is actually pretty aggressive
[3149.98 → 3160.98] what is marijuana social network what does it do I actually have no idea they say that it's supposed to be the Facebook for pot so I guess it's here I guess we can just go to it
[3160.98 → 3166.98] like a forum for people who do 420
[3166.98 → 3167.98] who do 420
[3167.98 → 3168.98] yes
[3168.98 → 3170.98] yes it's a forum for people who do 420
[3170.98 → 3181.98] apparently you have to be at least 21 years old or have a valid medical marijuana patient or RA okay there we go
[3181.98 → 3183.98] I guess I can't click this
[3183.98 → 3185.98] wait you wait like
[3185.98 → 3188.98] no because then it would be showing it to the whole stream
[3188.98 → 3189.98] oh
[3189.98 → 3191.98] is it
[3191.98 → 3194.98] why wouldn't it be I don't know
[3194.98 → 3197.98] but does that mean I'm a bad person
[3197.98 → 3200.98] does that mean you're promoting the marijuana
[3200.98 → 3201.98] yeah I don't know
[3201.98 → 3206.98] because I'm not telling people to do so but I would be showing them a website that's behind a
[3206.98 → 3209.98] I don't know what is true no said about it
[3209.98 → 3211.98] I don't know
[3211.98 → 3216.98] I don't know, but then we're the stream is going into the states in California where it's not legal right
[3216.98 → 3219.98] it's legal if you have a permit I'm assuming
[3219.98 → 3226.98] I've seen like pot magazines being sold openly in mainstream bookstores in states where it's very illegal I don't think
[3226.98 → 3228.98] okay so let's just confirm it
[3228.98 → 3230.98] and it brings us to nothing
[3230.98 → 3231.98] there's an app
[3231.98 → 3232.98] join for
[3232.98 → 3234.98] editor's choice
[3234.98 → 3235.98] buds
[3235.98 → 3236.98] wow
[3236.98 → 3238.98] I guess the like friends feed is called buds

[3248.98 → 3250.98] investors and investor
[3250.98 → 3251.98] which is very weird
[3251.98 → 3255.98] for like an actual social network but anyway that's fine
[3255.98 → 3256.98] let's click on the about us

[3261.98 → 3263.98] let's look at the brand
[3263.98 → 3266.98] marijuana is super illegal in Taiwan
[3266.98 → 3267.98] is it?
[3267.98 → 3268.98] mm hmm
[3268.98 → 3269.98] super illegal?
[3269.98 → 3270.98] yeah
[3270.98 → 3272.98] beyond regular illegal?
[3272.98 → 3274.98] yeah compared to some
[3274.98 → 3278.98] do you get like branded with a m for marijuana?
[3278.98 → 3279.98] yeah
[3279.98 → 3280.98] yeah

[3282.98 → 3283.98] no
[3283.98 → 3284.98] not an for adultery?
[3284.98 → 3285.98] no
[3285.98 → 3291.98] it's just as they think it's as bad as some other kind of pills drugs like I don't know
[3291.98 → 3292.98] like the bad ones
[3292.98 → 3293.98] like the bad ones
[3293.98 → 3294.98] uh what's that called
[3294.98 → 3296.98] like cocaine or meth and stuff
[3296.98 → 3297.98] or like heroin

[3305.98 → 3308.98] you don't go to jail if you take ketamine
[3308.98 → 3309.98] ketamine
[3309.98 → 3310.98] ketamine in Taiwan
[3310.98 → 3312.98] but you go to jail if you smoke
[3312.98 → 3313.98] really?
[3313.98 → 3314.98] what?
[3314.98 → 3315.98] yes
[3315.98 → 3316.98] extremely backwards
[3316.98 → 3317.98] okay
[3317.98 → 3319.98] I'm assuming considering you can
[3319.98 → 3323.98] there's your buds tab which I'm assuming is your friends
[3323.98 → 3330.98] and then there's the local tab I'm assuming that you can use it for like smoking weed get-togethers
[3330.98 → 3336.98] so this app will have like a fairly normal amount of traffic, and then it'll be April 20th
[3336.98 → 3343.98] and the whole app will just crash because way too much traffic, and then it'll be April 21st and everything will come back down
[3343.98 → 3346.98] and then it'll go back to normal amounts of traffic again
[3346.98 → 3348.98] hmm
[3348.98 → 3351.98] what does twitch chat think about that idea?
[3351.98 → 3354.98] I don't know let's see what twitch chat has to say about this
[3354.98 → 3356.98] kids don't do drugs
[3356.98 → 3357.98] yup
[3357.98 → 3359.98] yes I'm going to compute x
[3359.98 → 3362.98] stoner paradise
[3362.98 → 3363.98] we'd get together
[3363.98 → 3366.98] yeah I think that's I think that's what it is
[3366.98 → 3368.98] now it's for
[3368.98 → 3372.98] I wonder if one of their first users was uh snoop dog
[3372.98 → 3373.98] probably
[3373.98 → 3374.98] yeah
[3374.98 → 3375.98] snoop dog's just like
[3375.98 → 3378.98] yeah I'll run like this whole thing for you if you want
[3380.98 → 3383.98] someone in chat just said in all capital letters I like dick
[3383.98 → 3385.98] yeah I was going to say that
[3385.98 → 3386.98] that's super helpful
[3386.98 → 3387.98] I didn't read that out
[3387.98 → 3388.98] for what we're currently talking about
[3388.98 → 3389.98] I didn't read that out
[3389.98 → 3392.98] maybe they can post that on the weed social network
[3392.98 → 3397.98] and someone can be like let's do an exchange here I'll give you some weed
[3397.98 → 3399.98] wait no I'd have to go the other end
[3399.98 → 3400.98] you give me some weed
[3400.98 → 3401.98] and I'll
[3401.98 → 3402.98] you know
[3402.98 → 3403.98] what
[3403.98 → 3404.98] facilitate
[3404.98 → 3405.98] I wonder if that would be prostitution
[3405.98 → 3406.98] would that be prostitution?
[3406.98 → 3409.98] I mean if it's completely consensual through both people
[3409.98 → 3410.98] yeah but so is regular prostitution
[3410.98 → 3415.98] and if you're sharing it, it's not technically a trade or exchange
[3415.98 → 3417.98] you're just sharing things that you put
[3417.98 → 3422.98] actually I don't think it is anyway because I think it has to be like actual pecuniary compensation
[3422.98 → 3423.98] I think
[3423.98 → 3424.98] cash
[3424.98 → 3425.98] I don't know
[3425.98 → 3426.98] you're just going to be actually not
[3426.98 → 3427.98] exchanging weed for
[3427.98 → 3428.98] not weed
[3428.98 → 3429.98] for access to penis
[3429.98 → 3433.98] it's just one of those things that sounds illegal but probably
[3433.98 → 3434.98] I have no idea
[3434.98 → 3435.98] aside from
[3435.98 → 3436.98] I really wonder though
[3436.98 → 3438.98] this would be very interesting
[3438.98 → 3440.98] anyway
[3440.98 → 3444.98] I guess it's time to move on in topics
[3444.98 → 3449.98] uuuhhhh
[3449.98 → 3450.98] let's see here
[3450.98 → 3451.98] what's some interesting stuff
[3451.98 → 3453.98] do do do
[3453.98 → 3455.98] so much of this sucks
[3455.98 → 3458.98] way to put really dumb topics in the list Colton
[3458.98 → 3459.98] thanks Colton
[3459.98 → 3460.98] I'm just roasting Colton
[3460.98 → 3461.98] because I didn't uh
[3461.98 → 3463.98] I didn't approve any of this before we started
[3463.98 → 3464.98] so he's like
[3464.98 → 3465.98] MMM
[3465.98 → 3469.98] apparently cry orig has announced a new mac pro inspired case
[3469.98 → 3473.98] so everyone's just ignored the fact that it's basically literally just a garbage can
[3473.98 → 3478.98] uh so enable system makers and enthusiasts to build mac pro styled gaming computers
[3478.98 → 3482.98] so we're probably going to review this so that Linus can make a holy shit episode
[3482.98 → 3483.98] okay
[3483.98 → 3484.98] MMM let's see
[3484.98 → 3485.98] thatch
[3485.98 → 3486.98] today
[3486.98 → 3487.98] it's a cylinder
[3487.98 → 3488.98] oh
[3488.98 → 3491.98] wow
[3491.98 → 3494.98] designed by gamers
[3494.98 → 3495.98] kind of
[3495.98 → 3496.98] inspired by the mac pro
[3496.98 → 3500.98] I guess it would technically be designed by gamers if those people gamed
[3500.98 → 3508.08] gamers if those people gamed. Ah, see they have a 1080 in there. It's a pretty efficient
[3508.08 → 3512.44] way to make a small low volume computer, I guess.
[3512.44 → 3515.08] Dennis, we're going to build you one they call the power tower.
[3515.08 → 3519.08] Oh, power tower, that would be cool. We should make the whole thing look like a okay, we
[3519.08 → 3524.32] should do a modding video where we make the whole thing look like a big red fist. Then
[3524.32 → 3527.56] we just give it to Dennis and call it the power tower. Oh, that would be so cool.
[3527.56 → 3535.84] Like a demonic looking red fist. Wouldn't we want to make it look like an actual power
[3535.84 → 3542.62] tower like he was talking about in the game? The transmitter? Yeah.
[3542.62 → 3546.88] Transmitter? What are you talking about? It's called transmitter, right?
[3546.88 → 3554.24] Okay, yeah. Electronic power tower. Were you guys talking about this off camera or something?
[3554.24 → 3558.02] No, remember 3D Dictionary? Yeah. 3D Dictionary. It said power really loudly.
[3558.02 → 3562.52] Oh, I never watch it. Okay. Oh, you can tell. Yeah, I don't know. I have no idea. It was hysterical.
[3562.52 → 3569.24] Yeah. The 1080 looks pretty cool in there with its PCIe extension thing going on.
[3569.24 → 3575.52] Mm-hmm. Cold come in, heat go out. Very helpful. Good. Yes. The top looks kind of cool.
[3575.52 → 3580.16] Yes. The top looks kind of cool. It looks like one of those ginormous drills that they
[3580.16 → 3583.74] used to drill like underground. Oh, like a tunnel boring machine. Yeah. It kind of does. Yeah.
[3584.38 → 3588.56] So you might be able to tunnel bore with your computer case, which is always a helpful feature.
[3588.56 → 3597.10] Yeah. So it supports SFX power supplies, mini IT motherboards. It weighs 5 kilograms. Its dimensions in
[3597.10 → 3606.18] terms of width, height, and depth is 226 millimetres, 378.5 millimetres, 205 millimetres. It has one 3.5
[3606.18 → 3610.60] inch drive bay, which is actually kind of impressive. I didn't realize that. And it has one or two 2.5
[3610.60 → 3615.82] inch drive bay. So I'm assuming that 3.5 inch is just, you know, both. It supports cooler,
[3615.82 → 3623.46] CPU cooler dimensions of up to 72 to 82 millimetres in height. I don't know why there's like a range
[3623.46 → 3631.70] there and why it's not just 82 millimetres in height. Anyway, graphics card's length is 280 millimetres
[3631.70 → 3636.30] and power supply length is 130 millimetres. You are probably going to have to take note of like
[3636.30 → 3640.18] all of those dimensions, and they will probably be quite important because it's pretty compact.
[3641.06 → 3644.38] The external connectors are power, audio, USB 3.0, and display.
[3645.82 → 3651.24] But that's just for the case. So obviously if you put a motherboard in there, you would have
[3651.24 → 3656.82] more IO. Is this one that interests you? What is it? You like that more?
[3657.64 → 3658.34] Oh, that's cool.
[3659.06 → 3659.74] It is pretty cool.
[3659.74 → 3660.04] This is a joy.
[3660.38 → 3664.04] Wait, the case has a display board connector? Is that what you said?
[3664.26 → 3666.78] It says display. I don't know.
[3667.08 → 3667.80] Whatever that means.
[3667.80 → 3672.42] It's probably like an LCD. I don't think we saw it on here.
[3673.44 → 3677.26] Maybe it's this like whitish thing. Maybe that's an LCD.
[3678.22 → 3682.30] Because the motherboard and the graphics card aren't in there yet, so they can't claim those.
[3682.32 → 3684.32] Oh, it's like that thing that the Phoenix has.
[3684.48 → 3686.18] Yeah, I think so.
[3687.16 → 3689.68] The Take, neat, slim, holds your display.
[3690.32 → 3691.40] That's actually pretty cool.
[3691.40 → 3694.48] It's like a computer tray.
[3696.62 → 3700.42] This might be a new announcement as well. I'm not sure. I've never seen it before personally.
[3700.60 → 3701.38] It looks awesome.
[3702.14 → 3703.66] I kind of like this one more.
[3704.40 → 3705.26] The drawer one?
[3705.80 → 3706.18] Yeah.
[3707.32 → 3714.36] It's super basic because we've had like slim tower computers that lay flat for a long time.
[3714.52 → 3714.72] Yeah.
[3714.72 → 3719.76] But I actually really like how you can pull it out as if it's on a tray.
[3720.40 → 3721.50] That's super cool.
[3721.64 → 3724.36] Because we did a desk PC.
[3724.72 → 3725.08] Mm-hmm.
[3725.30 → 3728.16] But you have to go down to change things if you need to.
[3728.42 → 3731.80] Yeah, and you don't necessarily have to like, again, this has been done.
[3731.94 → 3736.60] I don't think the pullout tray necessarily has been done, but a flat computer isn't exactly new.
[3736.84 → 3739.80] But you can strap this onto the bottom of your desk, which would make it super cool.
[3739.80 → 3743.94] I like the implementation that they have, which is where it's just a stand for your monitor.
[3744.18 → 3745.02] That's actually pretty sweet.
[3745.16 → 3751.38] Because your monitor, if I remember correctly, the middle of your monitor is supposed to be right at your eye height.
[3751.58 → 3756.40] So like this monitor that we have here, which its top is here, is clearly too low for me.
[3757.02 → 3758.50] Because that's the top of the monitor.
[3759.12 → 3763.86] So it should be, the top should be like way up here, and the middle should be here, and it's not.
[3764.34 → 3764.42] So...
[3764.42 → 3766.02] It's the Sentry all over again, man.
[3766.14 → 3767.18] Yeah, the Sentry.
[3767.36 → 3767.92] Yeah, exactly.
[3767.92 → 3772.10] So like, it's helpful to prop monitors up on things.
[3772.34 → 3772.72] I don't know.
[3772.90 → 3773.76] I think that's pretty cool.
[3774.16 → 3774.96] What do you think, Dennis?
[3775.20 → 3776.14] What one is your favourite?
[3777.40 → 3778.10] Those two?
[3778.40 → 3778.62] Yeah.
[3779.18 → 3780.46] I like the drawer one.
[3780.72 → 3782.06] The drawer one, not the cylinder one?
[3782.30 → 3782.56] Yeah.
[3782.70 → 3783.40] Not the power tower?
[3785.08 → 3790.06] The drawer one.
[3790.06 → 3792.70] I like the thing you can put on the desk.
[3793.46 → 3794.10] You can open it.
[3794.30 → 3794.48] Yeah.
[3794.90 → 3795.16] Yeah.
[3796.52 → 3796.92] Cool.
[3796.92 → 3797.84] The drawer one.
[3799.28 → 3803.20] Well, I always think that kind of design is kind of like a garbage can.
[3805.92 → 3808.48] Although now it doesn't like, look like it dips in.
[3808.74 → 3810.32] Because the heat sinks at the top.
[3810.38 → 3811.72] That's a good-looking one.
[3811.90 → 3814.00] Rays out of the top and look like fins.
[3814.00 → 3816.22] So it probably won't really look like a garbage can anymore.
[3816.36 → 3816.62] Yeah.
[3816.88 → 3819.50] But I prefer flat thing.
[3819.66 → 3819.88] Yeah.
[3821.46 → 3822.66] You heard it here first.
[3823.18 → 3824.74] Dennis here prefers it flat.
[3825.28 → 3826.02] Not round.
[3826.02 → 3828.64] Doesn't like the round really just curves.
[3828.64 → 3829.88] Curves.
[3831.56 → 3832.30] You like curves?
[3832.56 → 3833.02] Curves.
[3833.18 → 3833.76] You like curves.
[3833.76 → 3834.16] Curves.
[3834.40 → 3834.98] You like curves.
[3835.50 → 3836.42] Dennis likes curves.
[3836.62 → 3836.86] Okay.
[3837.12 → 3837.60] Good to know.
[3839.68 → 3840.16] Anyway.
[3840.98 → 3842.18] Are you excited for Computer?
[3842.18 → 3842.92] Yeah.
[3843.30 → 3844.18] We're leaving tonight.
[3844.18 → 3845.12] Let's talk about that for a second.
[3845.52 → 3848.12] Tell me about the school that you told me about.
[3848.42 → 3852.58] Oh, so in Taiwan there's an e-sports school.
[3852.84 → 3853.04] Yeah.
[3853.04 → 3859.42] Like professional, there's a professional team, and they have them as a coach.
[3859.70 → 3860.64] So you can go there.
[3860.66 → 3861.92] You can sign up there for free.
[3862.64 → 3864.28] But I don't know if they're still doing that.
[3864.38 → 3866.00] Like probably two years ago, a year ago.
[3866.08 → 3866.82] Do you know what it's called?
[3867.08 → 3869.68] It's called Spider e-sports.
[3871.14 → 3871.58] And okay.
[3871.96 → 3873.92] So you sign up on every Wednesday.
[3874.16 → 3875.98] They have like two days or three days training.
[3876.38 → 3878.54] So you have to go there and sleep there.
[3878.54 → 3879.34] They have a dorm.
[3879.88 → 3880.62] And you can shower.
[3881.20 → 3882.46] And they have all the rows.
[3882.46 → 3884.82] And your parents need to sign a contract too.
[3885.20 → 3888.62] Saying your kids are staying there for like two or three days training.
[3889.04 → 3889.24] Wow.
[3889.86 → 3890.62] Did you find it?
[3890.68 → 3891.32] No, I can't find it.
[3891.32 → 3893.92] No, don't put Taiwanese.
[3895.12 → 3897.88] Spider e-sports school.
[3904.92 → 3906.44] Comes over the schools from Norway.
[3907.78 → 3908.56] Don't worry about it.
[3908.64 → 3909.12] Just keep going.
[3909.26 → 3910.46] Oh, that would be cool to show.
[3910.78 → 3912.10] I'll try to keep looking.
[3912.10 → 3912.70] But you can join.
[3912.70 → 3914.88] So you can sign up for free.
[3915.16 → 3916.54] And they have two or three days training.
[3916.84 → 3920.84] They teach you how to play Counter Strike.
[3921.84 → 3923.44] And the other kind of games.
[3923.52 → 3928.40] And they have all the PCs and teachers for you.
[3928.40 → 3933.06] But I don't know if they still do that now.
[3933.14 → 3934.46] I tried to contact them.
[3934.62 → 3937.14] But no one's answer.
[3937.58 → 3938.46] Did you find their website?
[3939.42 → 3939.64] Yeah.
[3940.14 → 3941.30] But they don't have phone number.
[3941.50 → 3943.62] I download their sign-off form.
[3944.90 → 3945.48] Oh, that one.
[3947.74 → 3948.78] That's a Wikipedia.
[3948.78 → 3949.40] Oh, here?
[3949.40 → 3949.78] Yeah.
[3949.78 → 3950.34] Can you?
[3950.34 → 3951.34] Not that one.
[3951.34 → 3952.34] Not that one.
[3952.34 → 3953.34] Not that one.
[3953.34 → 3953.88] One sec, guys.
[3953.88 → 3954.34] Okay.
[3954.34 → 3954.88] This?
[3954.88 → 3955.38] No.
[3955.38 → 3955.88] Okay.
[3955.88 → 3956.52] So there's another school.
[3956.52 → 3968.86] There's another two or three universities in Taiwan.
[3969.32 → 3971.18] They have esports.
[3971.70 → 3974.06] You can major in esports in the university.
[3975.06 → 3975.82] That's super weird.
[3976.04 → 3976.28] Yeah.
[3976.80 → 3978.12] So you get an esports degree.
[3978.56 → 3978.88] Yes.
[3978.88 → 3981.96] So is that like to become a coach or to become a player?
[3982.16 → 3982.48] Player.
[3983.44 → 3983.76] Player.
[3984.12 → 3987.08] And they do their team in their school.
[3987.52 → 3990.70] And because esports is getting perfect now in Taiwan.
[3991.00 → 3995.90] The government kind of start focusing the development of esports now.
[3996.70 → 3996.86] Yeah.
[3997.28 → 4000.38] The new government likes to do new things.
[4001.14 → 4004.72] So we have a lot of esports things going on in Taiwan.
[4004.72 → 4009.62] If you want to learn or join a team, you can go to Taiwan.
[4009.98 → 4010.46] Yes.
[4010.56 → 4013.50] A lot of try out you can do.
[4013.80 → 4015.22] Like every week, I think.
[4015.40 → 4015.64] Wow.
[4016.10 → 4016.64] That's crazy.
[4017.28 → 4022.32] Getting a degree in being an esports player seems ridiculous to me.
[4022.44 → 4029.96] Because like university and post-secondary education degrees in general are constantly
[4029.96 → 4037.80] sort of losing their value compared to experience because of how easy it is to show your experience
[4037.80 → 4038.38] these days.
[4038.62 → 4038.78] Yeah.
[4038.78 → 4043.16] Due to how connected the internet is, it's easy to show how much of something you've done
[4043.16 → 4044.68] or prove how much of something you've done.
[4044.74 → 4047.00] So I think, okay.
[4047.56 → 4048.50] It's a very general statement.
[4048.50 → 4052.72] In certain positions, being able to show your experience is much more effective than showing
[4052.72 → 4053.14] your degree.
[4053.28 → 4054.60] In other positions, you need a degree.
[4054.60 → 4060.06] I don't see esports being a thing where you have to show your degree.
[4060.86 → 4063.66] I feel like you'd be like, hey, look at my KD ratio.
[4064.14 → 4065.84] Look at this demo reel.
[4066.24 → 4067.36] Play a game with me.
[4067.60 → 4067.88] Watch.
[4069.46 → 4069.98] Sorry?
[4070.24 → 4071.20] This address.
[4071.76 → 4072.36] Sf.
[4073.36 → 4074.00] Sf.
[4074.56 → 4076.28] W-A-Y-I.
[4076.70 → 4077.76] W-A-Y-I.
[4078.38 → 4078.60] W-A-Y-I.
[4078.60 → 4079.72] W-A-Y-I.
[4079.72 → 4080.26] Oh.
[4080.26 → 4084.32] So I can show you guys the thing.
[4086.08 → 4086.44] Okay.
[4086.78 → 4087.92] So that's their website.
[4089.36 → 4090.84] So this is their website.
[4091.48 → 4091.80] Uzi.
[4093.02 → 4098.94] They have an advertisement for an Uzi on the front of their thing.
[4100.22 → 4100.60] Oh.
[4101.10 → 4101.40] What's?
[4102.08 → 4103.00] It's Sf.
[4103.00 → 4103.44] That one.
[4103.70 → 4104.06] Uzi.
[4105.14 → 4105.58] Sf.
[4105.58 → 4106.04] What's that?
[4106.48 → 4106.92] Oh, that's it.
[4107.04 → 4108.10] Now they're an online game.
[4108.50 → 4109.38] They're so many online games.
[4109.38 → 4111.34] Special Forces.
[4111.54 → 4114.66] Is this like a specific game that they play?
[4114.66 → 4115.58] Not that one.
[4115.96 → 4116.60] Not this one.
[4117.38 → 4117.66] This.
[4120.18 → 4120.58] Sf.
[4121.30 → 4122.30] W-A-Y.
[4123.24 → 4123.56] Dot com.
[4123.72 → 4124.02] T-W.
[4124.28 → 4124.88] Slash index.
[4125.00 → 4125.58] Yeah, this is it.
[4125.68 → 4126.62] Oh, but why is it different?
[4126.98 → 4128.16] Because you're on the mobile site.
[4128.40 → 4128.74] Oh.
[4129.58 → 4129.86] Yeah.
[4130.18 → 4130.44] Okay.
[4131.76 → 4132.20] Sam.
[4132.40 → 4133.34] Spider Sam.
[4133.82 → 4134.24] Yeah.
[4135.12 → 4135.84] He's awesome.
[4135.98 → 4136.72] I'm going to click on him.
[4139.38 → 4144.78] Internet's going slow because it's coming from Taiwan.
[4147.18 → 4152.22] Does it actually matter if we go to different countries' website?
[4152.38 → 4152.78] Sort of.
[4153.20 → 4153.44] Oh.
[4153.44 → 4156.62] They could have caching servers in different areas and stuff.
[4156.86 → 4157.64] I'm assuming they don't.
[4157.66 → 4158.64] Let me see if I can.
[4159.56 → 4159.90] Cool.
[4160.06 → 4162.06] So I'm assuming this is like them in class?
[4163.66 → 4163.96] Uh.
[4164.06 → 4164.72] The ESL.
[4166.66 → 4168.18] That looks like a classroom.
[4168.18 → 4173.34] They are saying like, okay, his father supports him to reach his dream.
[4173.58 → 4182.34] So his parents worry about he will just abandon his school if he's doing esport.
[4182.58 → 4182.76] Yeah.
[4182.80 → 4183.82] And they support him.
[4184.92 → 4186.40] But they're worried about him leaving school.
[4186.40 → 4187.48] So he joined to the team.
[4187.92 → 4188.18] Okay.
[4188.18 → 4193.58] If you go to this school, do you still take normal classes?
[4194.40 → 4194.52] No.
[4194.62 → 4196.46] That's not like formal class.
[4196.72 → 4197.88] Like not formal university.
[4198.30 → 4198.80] That's just like.
[4198.80 → 4199.76] Extracurricular activities.
[4199.80 → 4200.02] Yeah.
[4200.04 → 4201.68] It's like a learning centre.
[4202.08 → 4202.30] Yeah.
[4202.34 → 4202.52] Okay.
[4202.58 → 4202.78] Somewhere.
[4203.06 → 4204.38] That's the place, I think.
[4205.04 → 4205.32] Um.
[4205.66 → 4206.42] So there are some.
[4206.66 → 4211.96] There's a school called Taipei City College.
[4212.32 → 4216.20] Taipei City Technology or Technology University or something.
[4216.20 → 4219.68] They have like program you can take.
[4220.54 → 4221.06] Esports.
[4222.68 → 4223.44] Very cool.
[4223.88 → 4224.06] Right.
[4224.14 → 4226.04] So we might try to go check these guys out.
[4226.18 → 4228.34] But they haven't responded to us or whatever.
[4228.62 → 4230.50] I'm trying really hard to reach them.
[4230.94 → 4232.28] Hey, you can get a fun buddy.
[4233.92 → 4234.68] That's cool.
[4235.00 → 4235.64] Fun buddy.
[4236.22 → 4237.18] That was fun.
[4238.64 → 4239.12] Yeah.
[4239.60 → 4241.46] You have ever gotten a fun buddy off this website, Dennis?
[4242.30 → 4242.62] Oh.
[4244.42 → 4246.16] And what else we're going to check?
[4246.44 → 4249.00] We might go check some internet café.
[4249.58 → 4249.84] Yeah.
[4249.92 → 4250.20] In Taiwan.
[4250.72 → 4250.94] Yeah.
[4251.02 → 4252.38] We have a lot of internet café.
[4252.52 → 4257.00] They have gaming, PC, and all the set-up for you.
[4257.24 → 4258.66] And for a really cheap price.
[4258.94 → 4260.28] They do like hourly.
[4260.50 → 4263.32] And you can stay for probably like four bucks for two hours.
[4263.66 → 4264.84] Or I don't remember.
[4265.22 → 4266.06] It's just really cheap.
[4266.20 → 4267.74] Or you can stay there overnight.
[4268.02 → 4269.26] Just open 24 hours.
[4269.94 → 4271.64] And they have a shower room for you.
[4271.64 → 4272.22] If you need a shower.
[4272.26 → 4273.14] And they have meals.
[4273.92 → 4274.76] And they have.
[4274.76 → 4282.84] So there's relatively common stories of people that just stay at these internet cafés for extremely extended periods of time.
[4283.16 → 4286.46] And I don't mean like, oh my god, 26 hours.
[4286.80 → 4289.64] I mean like weeks and stuff.
[4289.64 → 4290.20] Yeah.
[4290.20 → 4290.34] Yeah.
[4291.34 → 4298.30] And so a lot of high school students or junior high school students, when they, after school, they just go there.
[4298.84 → 4299.84] Go to internet café.
[4300.22 → 4306.64] And when I was in junior high school, our teachers, they ban people to go there.
[4306.92 → 4307.18] What?
[4307.42 → 4307.62] Yeah.
[4307.68 → 4308.46] They don't.
[4308.62 → 4308.78] Yeah.
[4308.88 → 4309.00] They.
[4309.54 → 4310.30] How do you do that?
[4310.48 → 4310.84] They go.
[4311.08 → 4311.32] Yeah.
[4311.66 → 4313.60] Once you leave the school, aren't you on your own time?
[4313.64 → 4316.62] Well, they go to internet café to catch you if you go there.
[4317.36 → 4319.12] So if you're not studying.
[4319.84 → 4320.86] If you're not studying.
[4321.00 → 4322.48] And you stay there for long.
[4322.66 → 4328.56] And they say that they think internet café is just as bad as like a nightclub.
[4328.70 → 4329.88] So you shouldn't go there.
[4330.22 → 4332.28] Are they going to nightclubs to find suits?
[4332.28 → 4332.46] They think.
[4332.46 → 4334.00] That sounds so obscene.
[4334.14 → 4336.78] They think people are addicted to games in Taiwan.
[4336.78 → 4340.14] So the teachers ban their students.
[4340.32 → 4340.42] Yeah.
[4340.58 → 4340.78] Yeah.
[4340.92 → 4343.52] Not just in Taiwan, but everywhere people are addicted to games.
[4343.80 → 4344.04] Yeah.
[4344.36 → 4345.18] It's kind of ridiculous.
[4345.56 → 4347.52] That's not their business, I think.
[4347.60 → 4347.86] Yeah.
[4348.00 → 4348.84] That is nuts.
[4348.98 → 4351.40] That's their parents have to do that, not them.
[4351.70 → 4351.98] Yeah.
[4352.52 → 4352.84] So.
[4354.32 → 4357.14] But now in Taiwan, there are so many internet cafés.
[4357.82 → 4358.70] That's cool, though.
[4358.76 → 4359.54] We only have like.
[4360.06 → 4361.10] I have never seen one here.
[4361.20 → 4361.80] Do we have one?
[4361.80 → 4363.46] There used to be one in Langley.
[4363.62 → 4365.24] And then there was a fire in it.
[4365.50 → 4366.36] And it's gone.
[4366.36 → 4366.72] Oh.
[4366.90 → 4367.90] And it never came back.
[4368.24 → 4369.76] I think there's one in Vancouver.
[4370.12 → 4373.68] And there was one on Vancouver Island when I used to live there.
[4373.74 → 4374.92] Other than that, I don't know of any.
[4375.14 → 4376.36] It's not really a thing here.
[4377.20 → 4378.18] What was I just going to say?
[4378.24 → 4381.00] We're also going to some street where they sell a bunch of computer stuff.
[4381.00 → 4381.62] Oh, yeah.
[4381.62 → 4382.64] We're going to.
[4382.64 → 4388.26] We're trying to go to a place called Kuan Hua Mall.
[4389.78 → 4390.52] They have all the.
[4390.52 → 4390.78] Kuan Hua Mall.
[4390.78 → 4391.26] Kuan Hua Mall.
[4391.26 → 4393.58] They have all the PC stuff.
[4393.58 → 4395.14] And in that area.
[4395.14 → 4396.18] Outside the mall.
[4396.18 → 4397.00] On the street.
[4397.00 → 4397.96] There are all PCs.
[4397.96 → 4399.40] Some cameras.
[4400.40 → 4401.20] Technology stuff.
[4401.32 → 4401.94] All the stores.
[4402.82 → 4402.96] Yeah.
[4403.46 → 4406.18] And there's also another place.
[4407.18 → 4410.00] It's called Underground Street Market.
[4411.00 → 4413.98] Underneath of the Taipei Main Station.
[4414.78 → 4414.90] Yeah.
[4415.02 → 4416.34] All the gaming.
[4417.18 → 4417.82] Not PC gaming.
[4418.02 → 4419.30] Like just console gaming.
[4419.64 → 4419.88] Right.
[4420.02 → 4420.12] Right.
[4420.24 → 4420.40] Yeah.
[4421.04 → 4421.44] Animation.
[4422.20 → 4423.44] A lot of people gather their.
[4423.46 → 4423.92] Animation?
[4424.24 → 4424.66] Animation.
[4424.84 → 4424.96] Yeah.
[4425.26 → 4425.66] Oh, wow.
[4426.48 → 4427.42] Japanese animation.
[4428.02 → 4428.42] Oh.
[4429.10 → 4429.30] Okay.
[4429.42 → 4429.54] Postplay.
[4430.00 → 4430.12] Yeah.
[4430.22 → 4430.40] Yeah.
[4430.48 → 4430.66] Yeah.
[4430.66 → 4430.96] Yeah.
[4430.96 → 4431.02] Yeah.
[4431.02 → 4432.16] People stay there and gaming.
[4432.34 → 4433.54] You can see people just sit there.
[4433.74 → 4435.88] A lot of people just playing game.
[4436.98 → 4437.38] Yeah.
[4437.56 → 4438.06] It's pretty cool.
[4438.94 → 4440.52] Anyway, I think that's it for the show.
[4440.52 → 4444.52] Because Dennis and I have to like pack and leave to Taiwan.
[4444.96 → 4445.04] Yeah.
[4445.76 → 4447.04] Like very soon.
[4448.04 → 4452.40] Plane takes off in like eight hours or something.
[4452.54 → 4453.26] Seven and a half.
[4453.44 → 4454.16] Seven and a half.
[4454.26 → 4455.50] Seven and a half hours.
[4455.72 → 4457.16] So we got to go.
[4457.40 → 4458.20] Thanks for watching.
[4459.40 → 4460.78] And we'll see you next time.
[4460.84 → 4462.22] I'm going to actually remember to do this thing.
[4470.52 → 4491.20] There we go.
[4491.64 → 4494.20] There will very possibly be an after party.
[4494.20 → 4496.30] But I have to pack first.
[4496.68 → 4496.96] So.
[4498.22 → 4499.50] It won't be immediately.
[4499.88 → 4500.70] I know that much.
[4501.08 → 4502.52] We have to leave like.
[4503.06 → 4503.74] Really soon.
[4504.54 → 4504.88] Yeah.
[4505.44 → 4505.74] Yeah.
[4506.96 → 4509.42] So if there is one, it'll only be for a very short period of time.
[4509.42 → 4510.54] And I have to pack first.
[4510.54 → 4510.74] We have to leave like ten.
[4511.70 → 4512.42] We have to leave at eleven.
[4513.50 → 4514.22] No, we don't.
[4514.56 → 4515.78] Oh, we have to leave earlier than that.
[4515.88 → 4516.26] Oh, Geez.
[4516.26 → 4516.50] Plus two.
[4516.74 → 4517.00] Okay.
[4517.20 → 4517.90] Anyway, bye.
[4517.90 → 4517.96] Bye.
