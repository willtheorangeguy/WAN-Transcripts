[0.00 → 8.16] the start of the show you know it's perfect that you're the one who sings copyrighted theme
[8.16 → 14.64] songs and jingles um whenever we sing them on the show because I think your interpretations
[14.64 → 25.04] of them are very unlikely to get us uh to get us sued that turned from I think
[25.04 → 33.04] Indiana Jones into Star Wars like i it would be very difficult to attack
[36.16 → 41.52] which Harrison Ford movie is this from I'm not criticizing you I'm saying it's a good thing
[42.88 → 47.84] uh welcome to the wan show guys sorry we're a little late I know that you grow you've grown
[47.84 → 54.24] tired of our excuses and there really is honestly it was I have never seen this one before please
[54.24 → 61.52] so the funny thing is this is at least partially my fault even if I didn't realize it a little bit
[61.52 → 68.16] so I had requested to XSplit and this is actually really cool I had requested a feature in the
[68.16 → 76.32] software because we have one camera in particular that you cannot turn off the output of the onboard
[76.32 → 83.92] microphone over HDMI, and we have one capture card that does not allow you to select a single mono
[83.92 → 91.92] channel and output it in stereo mono okay so I requested a feature that was that would allow
[91.92 → 99.68] you in XSplit to clone the left channel to the right or the right channel to the left they obliged
[99.68 → 107.04] they provided said feature so I was trying to set up the show today I didn't realize this okay I was
[107.04 → 114.16] trying to set up the show today and I had levels on the microphone and I was talking into the microphone
[114.16 → 120.08] and the recorded file which I always check now because I'm tired of you guys being the ones to
[120.08 → 128.56] inform me that uh that I'm doing it wrong so I did a pre-recording and I checked it to discover that uh oh
[128.56 → 138.24] there 's's no audio on the output file turns out my features there except it was cloning the empty
[138.24 → 146.00] channel because we have a mono microphone to both channels which the audio level monitor doesn't account
[146.00 → 154.64] for so uh maybe additional feature is to check if the channel is empty and then make the default option
[154.64 → 162.16] to copy the non-empty channel one store and says pre-recorded to which I would reply I am either a
[162.16 → 171.92] freaking genius or uh big and tasty posted two Squirtle I like Squirtle a lot I like Squirtle
[171.92 → 179.12] yeah uh, and we've got a bunch of you saying there's no audio, but we've also uh an I checked and b we've got
[179.12 → 184.96] some of you saying that indeed there there is audio so um so there you go that's what
[184.96 → 191.28] happened today I have been diagnosing why I have audio levels on my indicator and no audio in
[191.28 → 202.48] my files you know because I'm not audiophile oh, oh dang um snore but whatever says totally not live
[203.28 → 208.48] um so there you go all right lets uh let's get into the show we've got a lot of great topics for you
[208.48 → 217.44] guys today number one is of course google Io sort of big deal uh number two is after I scroll
[217.44 → 224.64] through all the Google things um NVIDIA has posted official GTX 1070 specifications pretty similar to
[224.64 → 229.44] what we were thinking but uh it's nice to have that confirmed yes also there's an English bank that is
[229.44 → 236.64] literally going to electroshock you if you spend too much money which is fantastic i i I think that is
[236.64 → 242.32] wonderful and hilarious also Uber is joining the race for driverless cars because screw employees
[243.12 → 248.32] who needs them who may or may not be employees by the way you know because oh if AI gets
[248.32 → 253.28] so sophisticated that we create a massive AI force to do all the work for us then we have to pay them
[253.28 → 264.96] wouldn't that suck
[264.96 → 294.64] wow that is a big sponsor call out that violates our normal sponsored spot guidelines cook bah cook
[294.64 → 303.52] dot bah blue apron started by Vikings not true possibly true not sure what the hell are you talking
[303.52 → 304.56] about cook dot bah
[308.40 → 315.60] that's what I'm talking about okay so I feel like the first thing that we should probably acknowledge
[315.60 → 323.84] um is the way we tried to pull the wool over your eyes last week with a pre-recorded man show
[324.72 → 331.20] so to be clear not a lot of forethought went into that nope we sat down to record the show and i
[331.20 → 336.08] was like you know what we should do it would be funny we should pretend that it's live we should
[336.08 → 340.88] pretend we're live the internet connection there was awful there was no way it was going to be able to be
[340.88 → 350.64] live no that was not going to be a thing um and I will confess that while our plan did not
[350.64 → 357.12] extend to altering the time on the clock in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen
[360.16 → 369.28] whoops it did extend to um us starting the pre-recorded broadcast a little late so you guys
[369.28 → 374.32] wouldn't think something was up, and we did like a few people said this uh we did say that like the
[374.32 → 379.36] chats complaining about the camera or whatever else yeah which is we were noticing those things we
[379.36 → 385.12] probably would have super noticed the massive glaring audio issues that we apparently had so
[385.12 → 390.80] I figured out after the fact what the audio issues had to do with it seemed like they were related to
[391.44 → 399.20] um the audio input from that recording camera not coming in anymore because the battery died
[399.28 → 407.36] or something and then it just it took the microphone a bit to get its crap together the
[407.36 → 412.72] weird thing about it is that we were using a single microphone we were recording on a racer siren and
[412.72 → 418.00] that microphone was running the whole time and that was responsible for both the left and the right
[418.00 → 424.96] channels, but only one channel was messed up so that's why the archive didn't have the audio issues which
[424.96 → 432.72] took me until about 6 a.m to fix by the way because um non-fixed frame rate footage is a nightmare um
[432.72 → 441.20] when the camera switched to the webcam was causing a resync even in Sony Vegas which handles um non-fixed
[441.20 → 446.32] frame or variable frame rate footage not non-fixed variable frame rate footage better than anything else
[446.32 → 451.68] I went through handbrake FFmpeg because I'm familiar with taking variable frame rate footage and turning
[451.68 → 457.04] it into something that premiere can recognize with FFmpeg there is a procedure for that it's a pain in
[457.04 → 461.92] the butt, but it's doable but I tried that that didn't work handbrake didn't work premiere didn't
[461.92 → 468.32] work Vegas didn't even work and to make matters worse I didn't have any of those programs installed
[468.32 → 473.44] on my laptop the internet was awful so I was trying to do all of this stuff remotely because I had
[473.44 → 478.48] actually already sent the file back to the office right and then I would have to upload them from the
[478.48 → 485.76] office to YouTube wait for processing on a 55-minute video and then I could preview it back in
[485.76 → 493.20] my hotel room to find out if the synchronization was working that sounds horrible uh question though
[494.40 → 500.48] how does split footage end up being mixed frame rate so uh because it's not always mixed frame rate
[500.48 → 505.44] I think they have an I think they okay it was a new installation okay because I was streaming off of a
[505.44 → 510.08] machine that I don't normally stream on okay so I hadn't gone through all of my all of my procedures
[510.08 → 515.52] but the weird thing is that it wasn't FLV it was variable frame rate mp4 which I think may have
[515.52 → 522.40] actually had to do not with XSplit screwing up but with XSplit covering my butt when the camera changed
[522.40 → 531.52] to the webcam oh so I think we ended up with a variable frame rate mp4 that XSplit somehow managed
[531.52 → 535.28] to merge because the webcam was running at a different frame rate yeah okay because I was going to
[535.28 → 540.96] say I've used XSplit to record things a number of times and imported into Adobe Premiere and had no
[540.96 → 546.00] problems but I do also know that people have had problems doing that yes so I wasn't sure how that
[546.00 → 549.52] worked, but we had no choice because the battery died you know the funny thing is about after that
[549.52 → 555.52] broadcast where I had and some of you actually noticed this is hilarious my laptop was running off
[555.52 → 562.48] of a portable battery bank that couldn't output enough current to run my laptop so I had to constantly
[562.48 → 568.56] keep turning it back on because the overcurrent protection was triggering um but right after the
[568.56 → 575.12] show I found an outlet on the wall it was like right beside it yeah that was rough oh man oh
[575.76 → 582.48] that trip was actually pretty tiring I had a lot of fun uh travel day back was uh was kind of uh kind
[582.48 → 588.88] of a drag because it was I don't know I just like went on my ah yeah I don't I don't mind layovers as
[588.88 → 595.12] much as most people do because I'm in like this place that has everything that I probably need and
[595.12 → 602.24] it probably spent okay if it has wall outlets, and it has wall outlets mostly unless you're in like Malaysia
[602.24 → 607.60] yeah then it's fine and most airports in the states have those things so I just like plugged in my laptop
[607.60 → 613.12] plugged in my earbuds or my other headphones which I bring both of just in case I get annoyed with one
[613.12 → 618.16] of them like I don't know I have everything that I need in my bag always and I'm in a place that has
[618.16 → 623.52] everything else that I would really need, and it's just like okay well yep yeah I don't have as much of
[623.52 → 628.24] an issue with it either which probably made me less empathetic than I probably should have been um
[629.52 → 635.76] all right, so this was posted by suicidal Franco on the forum well like the yeah the general discussion
[635.76 → 640.72] thread was posted by suicidal Franco, and then we're going to have a bunch of like different things from
[640.72 → 648.32] like the verge or techno buffalo or whoever else happened to cover it yeah so uh google Io kind of
[648.32 → 656.08] a big deal so first up our original article here is from techno buffalo let's go ahead and uh no buffalo
[656.08 → 662.80] screen share here our good friend john Ettinger over there no, no no Brandon Russell so one of his guys but
[662.80 → 670.40] I'm sure john glanced at it at some point or another this is the Google home there's all there's
[670.40 → 676.88] also home.google.com if you want to see uh news directly from Google it's its kind of Google's
[676.88 → 683.04] response to the Amazon Echo which did we actually release a review on that okay so the Amazon Echo we
[683.68 → 688.24] we bought one yeah we got it here in spite of the fact that it's not available in Canada we realized that
[688.24 → 693.52] nothing worked in Canada, and we couldn't even like VPN trick it in any kind of because like it just
[693.52 → 699.52] didn't know how to do like with uh Microsoft for Cortana I don't think you have to anymore but
[699.52 → 703.92] for a while there to get it to work you had to VPN out to get it to work, but then it actually was
[703.92 → 707.76] kind of fine I understood why they didn't do it because didn't know everything yeah for most general
[707.76 → 714.96] things it was fine not echo just yeah no so we had a contract writer that was writing tech
[714.96 → 721.04] quickies for us for at the time, and we sent the echo to him to do a LTT for the first time ever
[721.04 → 725.84] and he basically disappeared off the face of the earth, and now he has an Amazon Echo I was just gonna
[725.84 → 731.28] say got that echo though he's a nice he's a nice enough dude i I harbour no ill will towards him
[731.28 → 735.60] there was some crazy stuff going on yeah probably just misplaced his life was complicated at the time
[736.16 → 744.32] but uh he has an echo, and we do not yes um google ALO ALO ALO google ALO
[744.32 → 749.20] all right oh really we're not going to talk anymore about the echo excuse me I guess that
[749.20 → 753.04] was the problem I felt like we stopped talking about the echo but we actually just yeah anyway
[753.04 → 754.80] no, no you're right you did it too
[757.44 → 764.48] anyway it will answer questions it will play music it will have LEDs thanks for them notes brush
[764.48 → 769.68] um it will be customizable with different coloured shells so you can like if you just need to kind of
[769.68 → 773.28] put it somewhere in a dark corner where you don't really see it you can probably get it in black the
[773.28 → 777.36] one that they have in their main picture on home.google.com is in white which looks like
[777.36 → 782.88] nice and clean and stuff it can communicate with a Chromecast that's cool which is actually quite cool
[782.88 → 788.40] yep um it, but it won't support multiple google accounts on launch, but it might uh do that later
[788.40 → 793.04] I don't know if you said it plays music it does do that as well yeah so that should tie in pretty
[793.04 → 800.64] well to the Chromecast tie-in uh yes because hopefully Chromecast music or chrome music or whatever
[800.64 → 804.80] they decided to I forget what they call it yeah but the music version of the Chromecast
[804.80 → 808.40] can tie in with this thing, and then it can play sound because I don't really trust
[808.40 → 813.20] this like tiny little speaker to be very good or useful in terms of playing sound google's branding
[813.20 → 819.12] sometimes in its simplicity gets complicated yeah because we're working with the Google store on like
[819.12 → 823.20] a Father's Day thing I don't know if you know about this I've heard about it um so I'm I'm going to be
[823.20 → 829.76] um actually I don't know if the contract is signed so maybe I won't be but um in theory possibly I'm
[829.76 → 835.84] actually going to be showing a bunch of Google technology to my grandpa in not necessarily just
[835.84 → 843.84] like a straight-up elders react TM uh type of rip-off okay that I will probably get you know sued for or
[843.84 → 851.20] something um at least we know but more it's more about you know here's a guy who I tried to set up
[851.20 → 856.56] with an internet connection 10 years ago with like a hand-me-down CRT monitor and like a cheap tower
[856.56 → 861.12] and like i I tried to make it as affordable for him as possible, and he loved it, but it was like
[861.12 → 866.08] it was like really hard on his eyes because the screens were small and stuff at the time so
[866.08 → 871.92] here's me kind of trying to bring that into the year 2016 and show him some of the cool applicable
[871.92 → 877.04] things that some of Google's technologies would allow um things like better medic medication
[877.04 → 883.04] notifications and reminders definitely yeah I'd love to see him try VR um so I've just yeah
[883.04 → 891.68] uh old people in VR are like so I think they're sending a smartwatch um a nexus 6p so a nice big
[891.68 → 896.24] smartphone I'll have to see if it has like old man vision mode it probably do I think it does
[896.24 → 903.12] there's an app you can get yeah um they're sending a Google cardboard um uh that there's some there's some
[903.12 → 907.52] other stuff too so I'm working on that but anyway getting back to my point that I was trying to make
[907.52 → 911.60] uh one of the things that they were saying was we want you to be really clear that you're working with
[911.60 → 919.44] google store I'm like yeah they're like that is not a retail like google store it's like a website
[919.44 → 924.40] google store and I'm like yeah, and they're like it is separate from the Google Play Store which is
[924.40 → 930.88] not the Google store because the Google store sells physical items the Google web physical store
[930.88 → 942.56] uh, uh so, so anyway but doesn't the Google Play Store also sell devices or is that wrong I think
[942.56 → 948.56] it has I thought you could, I think it has at times yeah oh so so so back to where we were trying
[948.56 → 955.44] to figure out Chromecast I was going to suggest that maybe it was like google music but then
[955.44 → 960.00] now that's like play music because I couldn't remember what they call the damn thing yeah and
[960.00 → 969.04] um that's a nightmare yeah so, so yeah like is it Chromecast music or which is different from Google
[969.04 → 973.44] the best thing is we could have just googled this the whole time I know with their own software we
[973.44 → 980.64] could find it out um oh there's people commenting in the chat about the uncensored f-bomb in one of our
[980.64 → 987.28] recent videos what video oh was it me no oh good and well you wouldn't have edited it anyway
[988.08 → 995.60] like it was an editor now did I say it no it was an editor saying it no I said it oh yeah wasn't me this
[995.60 → 1004.72] time yeah so no I just said uh I just said here is uh you know gold star for smarty-pants is already
[1004.72 → 1011.28] knowing how like um PMI or and wake on land and like all that stuff works I was just like well
[1011.28 → 1017.28] here's a gold star for the rest of you here's a video um, and it was supposed to be I should have said
[1017.28 → 1026.08] that on the synergy video yeah it was done by yeah well you know part of it was seeing those comments
[1026.08 → 1030.16] on some of your videos as well where people will like people will watch our videos, and they'll go
[1030.16 → 1036.24] is this the first time you ever heard of wake on land I've known about this for 15 years it's like
[1036.24 → 1041.28] okay yeah that's good what if it's someone's first year into computers brush then why are you clicking
[1041.28 → 1047.44] on a video about wake on land maybe just don't maybe just don't I mean click it anyway we love your views
[1047.44 → 1051.60] you know we love to talk to you guys sometimes we make jokes and maybe there's something in
[1051.60 → 1057.04] there that you didn't know about or maybe there's something that we missed, and you can help inform
[1057.04 → 1061.52] people you know in the comments you could say something helpful or constructive it's like I've
[1061.52 → 1068.56] known about this forever and so i was proactively responding to those comments and giving
[1068.56 → 1074.64] them gold internet stars um which I think is important you know you like a gold star for
[1074.64 → 1079.84] something that you've known for a long time that I didn't right sure makes you feel like a big man yeah
[1079.84 → 1083.76] gold star right there buddy that would actually be wonderful if we all got gold star stickers
[1083.76 → 1088.80] like anytime someone around the office helps you like to put a gold star on their shirt
[1091.60 → 1099.92] you know what's your knowing what's horrible is like from my experience as a parent and as a swimming
[1099.92 → 1109.60] teacher managing kids and from my experience as a small business owner managing adults it would
[1109.60 → 1113.44] probably work the principles are really not very different yeah, and you know what's hilarious is
[1113.92 → 1119.68] what you're saying and joking about is really not that different from the kinds of principles you
[1119.68 → 1125.20] will read about in management books the only difference is the physicality of it gold star
[1125.20 → 1130.48] yeah because walking around doing the same thing giving people little attaboys for doing something right
[1130.48 → 1137.92] is actually by far the best way to reinforce positive behaviour yeah and actually by uh by doing so
[1137.92 → 1143.84] eliminate bad behaviour yeah maybe I should get sheets of gold stars I think people feel like I'm
[1143.84 → 1148.56] patronizing them a little yes I think that, but that's that's why you remove the physicality because
[1148.56 → 1155.76] then it doesn't see if it feels so patronizing what is that bad word um it's only bad in certain
[1155.76 → 1163.44] contexts I think like because okay so let's break it down patron so like that's a different word
[1163.44 → 1169.20] okay because a patron is like you could be a patron at a bar no no okay that's a different
[1169.20 → 1175.76] way of using the word, but patron can be the same as matron which would be the male form of of of like
[1175.76 → 1181.52] like a mother or a father figure yes so patronizing its funny we talk about how the gold stars would be
[1181.52 → 1188.56] more like dad and the kids means treating you like a child yes so that's where that's where now that
[1188.56 → 1194.64] I've sort of because patronizing is so bad but then like maternal instinct is a good thing yeah and
[1194.64 → 1201.36] like and feeling cared for in the same way that your parents would care for you is something that we
[1201.36 → 1208.40] crave and something that we want we just don't want them to act like they're our parents anyway after
[1208.40 → 1217.44] all that it's called Chromecast audio we got there um all right so original article here is from
[1217.44 → 1225.76] techno buffalo again we've got google aloe which uh heals your burns yeah I needed some of that
[1226.56 → 1232.32] still sort of do yeah Mexico was fun for everyone but Luke on the day when he got second degree
[1232.32 → 1238.16] burns on his freckles yeah which sounds like a very specific injury, but it's a thing
[1238.40 → 1243.60] yeah I didn't know that yeah that's apparently a thing the rest of my skin was like I'm fine
[1243.60 → 1251.36] where the freckles are roasted wow it was bad uh yeah so I want you to find this it's not that hard
[1251.36 → 1257.04] to find google him find this thing because this ties into what we're exactly okay yeah yeah I'll find the
[1257.04 → 1262.64] tweet I'll bring that up okay you talk about it in the meantime okay so Snowden has tweeted about
[1262.64 → 1268.64] google's allo thing uh he says that google's security expert blogs discussing how allo
[1268.64 → 1278.56] is unsafe by default um hours later he erased that part of the uh uh blog um, and he says below that i
[1278.56 → 1286.32] believe I have it up Google's decision yep there's another tweet actually google's decision to disable
[1286.32 → 1292.56] end-to-end encryption by default in its new allo chat app is dangerous and makes it unsafe and he
[1292.56 → 1300.96] recommends avoiding it for now that has 8 000 retweets and 7 800 likes so with that warning in
[1300.96 → 1306.16] the back of your mind let's talk a little bit about what it is yes uh it's a new messaging app for mobile
[1306.16 → 1314.08] only to which you might kind of go what the hell why do we need this what happened to g talk and then
[1314.08 → 1324.80] what about don't we have hangouts and uh doesn't uh oh man doesn't google own like uh some other
[1324.80 → 1331.04] stuff I think yeah so hold on who owns Snapchat again is that Facebook is like I think Facebook
[1332.96 → 1342.72] yeah Snapchat owned by Facebook I thought google bought something anyway the point is why do we need
[1344.08 → 1350.56] another messaging app and maybe this is more of a question for the people that use other
[1350.56 → 1359.52] messaging apps like I still can't quite figure out why people need um any more than just like yeah one
[1359.52 → 1366.72] I can't figure out what happened to that concept of like awesome desktop clients like trillion that just
[1367.52 → 1373.76] um amalgamated all your different chats and made if it's like and I used trillion for a long time i
[1373.76 → 1380.40] loved trillion, but they just couldn't keep the bugs out of it because it feels like the um the chat
[1380.40 → 1385.76] platform owners were constantly changing things just to screw with trillion um I don't know if it's
[1385.76 → 1391.12] perfect these days I'd love to hear from you guys but um the answer is that it is meant to be a
[1391.12 → 1395.68] fresh start for Google's new communications division you sign up with a phone number and
[1395.68 → 1402.80] you can connect your Google account to it so it's WhatsApp but with additional nonsense yeah
[1403.76 → 1409.52] speaking of which who owns WhatsApp again that's Facebook owned by Facebook oh okay yeah there we go
[1409.52 → 1415.44] that's Facebook yeah I know that one yep um you can shrink or enlarge texts before sending it in
[1415.44 → 1420.88] messages which sounds super annoying I mean remember when MSN messenger had the ability to
[1420.88 → 1426.08] change your font size okay that was kind of cool you had pink font yeah no I just mean it's not
[1426.08 → 1430.88] innovative right okay remember when MSN messenger added the ability to write with your mouse can
[1430.88 → 1436.00] Microsoft just make MSN again I would actually go back I would go back yeah 100 like that especially
[1436.00 → 1445.04] if it worked on my phone oh my god so good I would hardcore go back to MSN it was by far the best it had
[1445.04 → 1450.72] like the ability to send files to people it actually worked remote desktop control was built into
[1450.72 → 1455.20] it oh I diagnosed so many computers that way I was like oh you have MSN yeah okay sweet we can just
[1455.20 → 1460.72] do this you know now it's like a huge mess we're going to have to implement a new policy for wan show
[1460.72 → 1466.48] anytime we talk about a messaging app we can't just talk about MSN okay that's probably fair
[1467.36 → 1473.92] and this is emoji support was worlds ahead of what other applications you could import your own and you
[1473.92 → 1480.24] could send them yep which was freaking awesome um I wasn't a huge fan of them when they implemented them
[1480.24 → 1486.64] but when they introduced like the higher definition ones like that you had like all this
[1486.64 → 1494.64] variety like yeah okay so speaking of which you can send and receive indicators emojis and custom stickers
[1494.64 → 1503.60] they do say that uh conversations are encrypted on the wire which means nobody on the internet can read
[1503.60 → 1510.16] them as you send your message which is a funky way of saying that um they're they're the response to
[1510.16 → 1515.52] Snowden's thing about it being not end-to-end encrypted is apparently that that is done because of
[1516.40 → 1524.72] the voice command side of things um my response to that is figured it out there is some cool stuff
[1524.72 → 1529.84] to be clear like for example if you're discussing with a friend like uh hey we want to go out for
[1529.84 → 1535.28] dinner you can actually bring google now features like recommending a restaurant right into the chat
[1535.28 → 1539.84] that's super cool which I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't be able to do with hangouts which
[1539.84 → 1546.64] also has video and works cross-platform why do companies think that single platform mobile only
[1546.64 → 1552.48] is better that's very stupid um one thing that I do like is the uh if your friend sends you a message
[1552.48 → 1557.52] aloe puts some suggested replies at the bottom that's super cool because if your phone can tell that
[1557.52 → 1563.20] you're like working out, or you're at work, or you're I love how work was in both of those, or it can
[1563.20 → 1568.32] like tell you're doing something like you're driving it or that although you might not want an automated
[1568.32 → 1575.92] reply unless it's a lie yeah like hey I'm petting the dog yeah yeah yeah um or like driving
[1575.92 → 1580.64] or something if you're doing something where you don't really have time to respond you can be able
[1580.64 → 1587.52] to respond easily in a like pre-done little packaged thing which is kind of cool um this is actually a
[1587.52 → 1593.60] suggestion not for aloe but for a messaging application that I'm actually likely to use like maybe hangouts
[1593.60 → 1597.84] so if anyone from Google is watching this was actually Terran's suggestion I think he was like
[1598.32 → 1602.08] because I was just reading the bit about how it has a feature where you can doodle on the pictures
[1602.08 → 1607.04] that people send you, or it can like to suggest to you whether you're the picture of your friend's dog
[1607.04 → 1614.96] is cute or not what yeah I don't think that's that useful um but what about this what if you could set
[1615.84 → 1622.80] contacts to send you pixelated versions of their images by default so you could tell if it's a
[1622.80 → 1630.72] dick pic before you open it I thought that was easel was it ed maybe it's ed I don't know someone
[1630.72 → 1635.12] someone talking to me about that too yeah someone in there was talking about that I was like that is
[1635.12 → 1642.08] brilliant I mean who wouldn't want especially like at work like yeah say for example if you know hangouts
[1642.08 → 1647.76] wasn't a complete piece of trash and had a desktop client which it should have um so that you could
[1647.76 → 1653.04] actually have settings that stuck with computers rather than just being account wide you know there
[1653.04 → 1658.32] are reasons that client applications still make sense um so at work you could enable the feature
[1658.32 → 1663.04] that automatically blurs pictures so you wouldn't have an awkward situation where someone you know
[1663.04 → 1668.48] walks and looks over your shoulder and there's like boom dick pic yeah there's a good idea free of
[1668.48 → 1676.48] charge it's a thing um speaking of good ideas free of charge um let's see so that's kind of boring yeah
[1676.48 → 1681.68] yeah there's Google Duo I guess which is a video calling app because they need another app for
[1681.68 → 1689.28] communication okay so as a companion to the brand-new messaging app yay we're splitting it up so we
[1689.28 → 1700.88] have more than one app to do the same thing yep um so yeah um so basically it has caller id
[1700.88 → 1708.24] which is the unique feature where you can see a stream of the person before you answer the call
[1708.24 → 1710.96] yeah um
[1714.08 → 1720.08] which I guess is the kind of thing that's going to lead to a lot of accidental nose picking
[1721.36 → 1727.68] while someone's looking at you while people figure out that that's a feat i I can't think of an any
[1727.68 → 1733.44] possible reason on the planet why I would want someone else's stream when they're calling me
[1733.44 → 1737.92] to start automatically before I pick up the call I know who it's from
[1740.48 → 1750.08] why and I mean this is not like I'd like I hope to I hope I guess like if you're going to do like
[1750.08 → 1755.20] uh we're going to get a little TMI here for a second but if you're going to have like a FAP session with your
[1755.20 → 1760.80] partner, and it happens to be their mom that is using their phone to video call you might be a
[1760.80 → 1766.56] good idea for you to know it'd be like I should cover up before I answer this why would you ever
[1766.56 → 1770.72] answer a video call naked I mean you're just ready to go
[1774.80 → 1779.68] okay so why would you be ready to go if there wasn't some kind of pre-planning in place and if
[1779.68 → 1785.28] there was pre-planning wouldn't you know that who is operating the other end because if it's their
[1785.28 → 1792.00] mom while you're having a discussion about video calling maybe communications with this person
[1792.00 → 1798.48] are just so often uh that you're just you know you're just, or maybe you want to like surprise them
[1798.48 → 1805.76] it's the naked man tactic from how I met your mother where you're like I'm ready to go, and then it's
[1805.76 → 1810.64] their mom, and you're like crap maybe I'm still ready to go, but it's not appropriate but a little less
[1814.48 → 1822.24] wow um Luke getting his freak on here I mean you know uh the kids the twitch chat's
[1822.24 → 1829.20] exploding now sex each other what says Tristan we can't do that we're in person yeah it's against
[1829.20 → 1837.04] the twitch regulations anyway come on to get your act together yeah um so okay another app that I'm
[1837.04 → 1843.60] clearly too old to understand the value of so there you go it's apparently very simple to use and quick
[1843.60 → 1851.44] as demonstrated by the verge I managed to teach my 67-year-old father who was still running iOS 6 like
[1851.44 → 1859.92] three months ago how to chat on Hangouts in like 40 seconds so I'm pretty sure that a video call in
[1859.92 → 1865.20] hangouts probably wasn't that hard to use the entire app is approximately five megs of
[1865.84 → 1872.56] duplicating a function of an app that i literally by default definitely already have installed on my
[1872.56 → 1883.28] phone if it's an android phone, and it's mobile only because screw you yeah I screw you people who you
[1883.28 → 1888.96] know want to sit in a chair at a desk and see a reasonable size image and not hold something while
[1888.96 → 1895.20] they chat with somebody yeah I mean because that that ties up one of your hands why is it always coming
[1895.20 → 1900.00] back to this one thing that is really annoying about the mobile only thing though actually the main
[1900.00 → 1905.60] thing in my opinion is a lot of work stuff like of course I'm going to usually use that app on my
[1905.60 → 1909.92] mobile device yeah to be completely honest but if I'm sitting at a desk it's really nice to be able
[1909.92 → 1915.60] to not pick up my phone and access it there Lenovo you can figure your crap out will eventually be
[1915.60 → 1922.96] releasing the Lenovo link 32 GB which looks great and I don't know what that is waiting to get it ever
[1922.96 → 1928.88] since CES and have been on an email list so that once they release it I can buy it personally bring it
[1928.88 → 1934.80] in here and then make a review about it, and they still haven't oh my god what is if it's an USB
[1934.80 → 1938.56] pass-through device kind of thing that you plug into your computer, and then you plug a charging cable
[1938.56 → 1945.52] to your phone into, and then it makes it so that you get your phone on your computer which can already
[1945.52 → 1951.68] be done with like yeah Asus includes that I think but who runs an Asus phone yeah, and it's its device
[1951.68 → 1956.56] agnostics you can do it with whatever the heck you want um it's very fast there's something that you can
[1956.56 → 1960.72] do with like uh having your computer be a server and your phone communicates with it wireless yeah
[1960.72 → 1966.48] it's the Wi-Fi, but it's extremely fast the link has storage built into it which is nice um, and it has
[1966.48 → 1971.28] like a few other features like it can tell what orientation the phone is in oh okay, and it like
[1972.00 → 1976.48] can you can drag and drop file there are a few things that it could do I can't remember exactly what they
[1976.48 → 1984.16] are right now that are better than the thing that the app could do and the other solutions it was it looks
[1984.16 → 1991.20] very nice and Luke likes his pc like he likes his girls oily sometimes they don't need oil
[1995.20 → 2001.12] sometimes they're just good to go um so the android n beta speaking of being good to go
[2001.12 → 2008.56] has started it is an open beta type of relationship if you know what I mean and the full release will be
[2008.56 → 2016.48] coming later on this summer I don't need that I have done absolutely my relationship is 100 satisfactory
[2016.48 → 2019.52] I have uh no need for really that's not what you told me
[2022.64 → 2029.04] um I have actually done literally zero research into android n and why we would care because i actually
[2029.04 → 2034.88] follow very little pre-release uh news these days i kind of wait till the product lands and go oh yeah
[2034.88 → 2038.08] I like this or I don't like this because the reality of it is a lot of the features that get
[2038.08 → 2043.84] announced for products or software never end up making it into the product in the first place or
[2043.84 → 2049.20] the implementation is just kind of half-assed and stupid anyway yeah um so anyway android and open
[2049.20 → 2058.32] beta coming so it's supported by the uh nexus 6 nexus 9 nexus 5x nexus 6p nexus player pixel c and general mobile 4g
[2058.32 → 2064.16] and that'll be a story that's the full release coming this summer not like
[2065.04 → 2071.84] more beta-ness or whatever people might have interpreted that to mean um speaking of coming
[2071.84 → 2078.96] this summer coming this summer to a kitchen near you is blue apron and the oh by the way this is cool
[2078.96 → 2085.84] the first 250 people to use this link get two free meals on their first order so blue apron
[2085.84 → 2093.92] is the most upsetting sponsor for me that we have ever had because it's only in the US right now
[2093.92 → 2102.08] just going to complain yep i know, and it sounds amazing it sounds so cool they deliver farm fresh
[2102.08 → 2107.36] ingredients that are locally sourced right to your doorstep in the right proportions for you to create
[2107.36 → 2114.24] the meal that they send you um they have two plans a two-person plan and a family plan the recipes are
[2114.24 → 2118.40] delivered in a refrigerated box, so the ingredients will stay fresh even if you're not at home and
[2118.40 → 2123.12] they offer a large selection of recipes, and they're always adding new dishes to the menu every week
[2123.12 → 2129.76] each menu is about 500 to 800 calories per person and the meals can be prepared in 40 minutes or less
[2129.76 → 2136.96] so with blue apron you cook for yourself, but you get a quality meal you don't waste food yeah and
[2136.96 → 2142.80] huge thing if you says one to two people so like I live on my own wasting food if I want to make
[2142.80 → 2148.56] interesting complicated meals is basically inevitable it's like even if you buy like one
[2148.56 → 2153.12] stupid thing of cilantro it's more than you need oh yeah and unless you're going to use cilantro again
[2153.12 → 2159.44] tomorrow it's all witty and gross yeah exactly so like making anything fancy is really frustrating
[2159.44 → 2163.60] and like I just cook chicken every day it's one of those things where it's like it's a fundamental
[2163.60 → 2170.48] problem with the system okay I end up buying a bag of carrots this big every time I buy carrots why
[2170.48 → 2175.84] because the bag of carrots this big at superstore costs as much as buying the three carrots that i
[2175.84 → 2184.72] need to make pasta sauce today at Lester's market so even though I might only use three of those carrots
[2184.72 → 2188.16] and that's this is an extreme example obviously I'm going to use more of the carrots than that we
[2188.16 → 2192.80] actually like do cook and stuff and munch them and whatnot yeah, so yeah let's even if I'm only gonna
[2192.80 → 2198.96] use three of these carrots I'm still better off on my grocery trip to superstore which I'm going to do
[2198.96 → 2206.24] anyway I'm better off stocking up on stuff that I don't need only to end up wasting it later than I am
[2206.24 → 2213.92] buying the correct quantity from a place that sells lower quantity things off the shelf and carrots are not
[2213.92 → 2217.76] even the best example because you can actually buy individual carrots at superstore if I recall correctly
[2217.76 → 2221.84] same with celery uh celery stocks you can buy individual sticks yeah you can buy individual
[2221.84 → 2229.04] sticks funny story I didn't realize that a celery stock was all of them and a celery stick was one
[2229.04 → 2234.96] see I used to work in the produce section very recently um, so blue apron lets you get out of your
[2234.96 → 2240.32] comfort zone it actually takes if you can make the meal in 40 minutes that is and my wife and I have
[2240.32 → 2246.72] done the numbers that is actually less time than it takes to drive somewhere sit down like be seated
[2246.72 → 2251.68] especially if it's like dinner time yeah and you have to wait 15 20 minutes to get seated order your
[2251.68 → 2257.92] food and wait for your food it is actually more efficient to eat at home and more affordable with
[2257.92 → 2262.16] blue aprons so I've talked about this for a really long time I want to add one quick thing before we're
[2262.16 → 2265.76] done sure and I probably won't bring this up if we do sponsor spots for them in the future but i just
[2265.76 → 2273.52] want to bring this up here uh my girlfriend she has an uncle or like some form of family connection
[2273.52 → 2279.84] who's this really fantastic chef, and he had basically this idea and made a kickstarter for it
[2280.48 → 2287.52] and checked out the kickstarter and I was like wow this is a wonderful idea, but the kickstarter is
[2287.52 → 2294.32] bad yeah and the kickstarter failed and I was kind of sad and now I just hope that blue apron comes up here
[2294.32 → 2302.16] so i again I won't do this next time we do a spot for this but um Yvonne and I have a business plan for this
[2302.16 → 2309.68] from like about a year ago that's that's actually pretty in line with the kickstarter I hadn't seen
[2309.68 → 2318.40] that um I was trying to convince her to uh to leave Costco and even if she didn't want to pursue a
[2318.40 → 2324.08] career at Linus media group I still really felt like her talents would be better suited to something
[2324.08 → 2330.32] bigger than running a pharmacy, and we actually kicked this idea around, and we came up with it together
[2330.32 → 2336.24] where we would leverage the strengths of Linus media group to promote and to uh provide video
[2336.24 → 2342.08] guides to go along with the recipes I would oh man I would have loved to do that this was like it was
[2342.08 → 2346.16] a really cool idea oh that would have been fun because it was, and it was I know the idea is not
[2346.16 → 2351.84] the newest thing ever like food being delivered yeah um but we sort of had this concept for how we
[2351.84 → 2359.60] could leverage partnerships just locally and start it locally and then create this kind of this fun
[2359.60 → 2365.76] cooking with whoever it is um and these personas and these video personalities to go along with
[2365.76 → 2372.80] it that we really thought could take it to the next level and would be way cooler um but so there you go
[2372.80 → 2379.60] if blue aprons watching this spot guys video uh video instructions would be like super-duper cool
[2379.60 → 2386.40] um and you guys could have like a side thing which is like call it like fun food and do like not
[2386.40 → 2392.08] necessarily just like a meal do you like to have like a fun food yeah Super Bowl edition, and you know
[2392.08 → 2398.16] some really cool video content creators up in uh Vancouver Canada who would love to do more around food
[2398.72 → 2405.20] just kind of saying yeah speaking of things that I'm just kind of saying um I fix it I'm not going to
[2405.20 → 2410.00] deny that I fix it is sponsoring the video today like I did with that other video that I then found out
[2410.00 → 2417.12] later they were indeed the sponsor of um I fix it is your complete DIY electronics repair solution from
[2417.12 → 2422.96] their 19 000 free step-by-step repair guides to their huge inventory of replacement parts they have got
[2422.96 → 2428.80] you covered, and today we're talking about these notes are a awful way to go Colton and nick today we're
[2428.80 → 2435.84] talking about their latest and greatest the all new pro tech toolkit completely reimagined design but just as
[2435.84 → 2442.64] rugged and portable it's got more driver bits than ever before 64 compared to 54 okay it is actually
[2442.64 → 2447.20] better it comes in a better case it's got a magnetic thing that holds the screwdriver in place and the
[2447.20 → 2451.60] lid on the screwdriver kit it's got a better swivel top precision screwdriver it actually feels a lot
[2451.60 → 2455.84] nicer in the hand you can get more torque um torque was a problem with the last it comes with the
[2455.84 → 2462.00] suction cup uh which the old one didn't which I actually used on our trip to Mexico to pry open an iPhone
[2462.00 → 2467.84] 6s it's not as good as their special tool for opening iPhones but I was able to do it and i
[2467.84 → 2472.00] didn't break anything so you've got like everything you kind of need and the best part is that it's
[2472.00 → 2479.52] backed by a lifetime warranty and is available for 70 bucks, and you can save five dollars off a purchase
[2479.52 → 2485.28] of ten dollars or more on their store by going to ifixit.com slash minus and using offer code when
[2485.28 → 2501.76] when you do it speaking of when you do it oh snap Squarespace has Squarespace done more when show
[2501.76 → 2507.28] sponsorships than any other brand they've probably done more when show sponsorships than like a fair
[2507.28 → 2514.24] number of other brands combined I think that is probably a fair thing for you to say uh oh Nick's
[2514.24 → 2519.76] Nick's giving nick sending me messages during the sponsor spots that's never good it's always bad
[2519.76 → 2524.56] no I'm I'm not gonna look at it sorry nick oh no I'm just kidding i I looked at I looked at I'll get
[2524.56 → 2529.92] to it nick um to Squarespace simple powerful beautiful that's the slogan they had when we
[2529.92 → 2536.24] first started working with them which is when these notes are actually from they've got 24 7 support
[2536.24 → 2540.56] via live chat and email it's only eight dollars a month you get a free domain if you buy Squarespace

[2566.72 → 2572.00] looking for you know other features to spice up your Squarespace site they've got little things
[2572.00 → 2578.00] like their logo design helper um they've got uh let's see yeah you can dig into the code a
[2578.00 → 2582.56] little bit more if you want to you can play around with those things um you can keep it accessible and
[2582.56 → 2588.56] just use all the web-based you know UI modifications drag this here move this there alter this text
[2588.56 → 2594.00] and you can start a trial with no credit card required and start building your website today
[2594.72 → 2599.36] but don't just do that and forget about it when you decide to sign up for Squarespace you should
[2599.36 → 2604.72] make sure you use offer code Linus to get 10 off your first purchase thank you Squarespace for
[2604.72 → 2610.80] supporting the wands show that's actually in there I never say that Squarespace build it beautiful you
[2610.80 → 2618.08] should those are old notes yes they are simple power beautiful powerful beautiful I mean how old is that
[2618.08 → 2623.20] slogan I'm going to go on Squarespace's website right now and see if they have like a new slogan I don't think
[2623.20 → 2634.16] so I think it's still you should still you should oh hold on no I don't see you should anywhere no
[2637.68 → 2646.48] perfect websites trusted by the world's best why aren't we on here because oh so we're not as cool as
[2646.48 → 2652.24] like fast company and freeman's yeah and what the heck is hashtagged girl boss I don't know I'm sure
[2652.24 → 2659.36] someone knows but I don't over one million paying customers wow you can do that math hey whoa
[2661.44 → 2669.20] balling so hard that's like the new World of Warcraft Squarespace of warcraft world of Squarespace
[2669.20 → 2675.68] I mean can you imagine a MMO based on the website building the boss is like this really complicated
[2675.68 → 2683.52] extensive website it's like flash yeah and inherently because this is classic world of Squarespace you
[2683.52 → 2687.84] need a 40-person team and a huge part of the difficulty is just coordinating all of those
[2687.84 → 2693.84] developers to create this like intense flash based website you know what the worst thing about this
[2693.84 → 2699.92] conversation is this sounds like exactly the kind of asinine idea that would get thrown around
[2699.92 → 2707.44] in like a boardroom full of like how do we gamify building websites well you know I heard a word of
[2707.44 → 2717.12] World of Warcraft once you know maybe we need like website craft squares in spacecraft
[2717.12 → 2723.68] it's like star craft but like not just stars all space
[2727.68 → 2734.64] all right android where 2.0 getting back on topic somewhat is a huge new update one about which I am
[2734.64 → 2745.20] extremely disappointed i recently oh yeah i recently completely my own fault and I have no one to blame
[2745.20 → 2752.08] but myself broke my zen watch 2 by diving to about 70 feet you should blame the zen watch to salt water
[2752.08 → 2757.12] then watch 2 should have a warning being like we're detecting water you should resurface yeah that's
[2757.12 → 2766.32] why I'm so salty not because of the water yeah salinity yeah um to be fair I'm kidding that was a joke
[2766.32 → 2770.32] so it includes a new smart reply feature allowing you to respond to incoming notifications quickly by
[2770.32 → 2773.68] scribbling on the touch screen this just means you're going to get a new watch
[2773.68 → 2778.88] uh, uh I think it should be a software update I guess I'll find out because I still there's
[2778.88 → 2784.88] still a g watch over there I might just steal that um, but you know what I want is more granularity in
[2784.88 → 2789.68] the control of what I do with notifications and ways to synchronize across devices that is really my only
[2789.68 → 2794.88] complaint about android wear it kind of already does everything I could possibly want it to do other than
[2794.88 → 2801.20] the fact that it really makes me mad when I reply to something with voice and then that email is still
[2801.20 → 2806.40] sitting unread in my inbox because it's just why let me know what you think about this I'm going to
[2806.40 → 2810.88] deviate a little bit I was just thinking in my head about how like you do the traditional watch thing
[2810.88 → 2816.96] and I'm thinking about doing the fitness watch thing um I'm gonna still do the video that we had planned
[2816.96 → 2824.08] first yeah yeah um should I say yeah yeah yeah okay so I'm going to benchmark um a bunch of traditional
[2824.08 → 2832.16] fitness trackers against like a Fitbit not like a zen watch but like a Fitbit yeah against a chest strap
[2832.16 → 2838.32] which is traditionally a lot better um at accurately determining your heart rate and then comparing
[2838.32 → 2843.28] how well the wrist version does and then what I'm thinking is take the top one maybe two and do a
[2843.28 → 2848.08] proper review on them that's a good idea so be like okay these are really accurate these
[2848.08 → 2851.44] are probably the ones you should be going for if you want a fitness tracker now I'm going to properly
[2851.44 → 2857.36] review are they actually any good just as a usable device there are huge amounts of issues on that side
[2857.36 → 2865.20] of things holy crap um and like I'm very frustrated right now with the fact that the like more like
[2865.20 → 2871.44] I'm going to say traditional but that is so literally the wrong word um the like smartwatch side of
[2871.44 → 2877.60] things are kind of terrible generally I'd like to see the people who call you burger boy fight you
[2877.60 → 2884.64] burger boy someone called you Luke burger boy I would love to fight them too um the yeah the like
[2884.64 → 2888.96] smartwatch kind of stuff is usually terrible at doing fitness stuff the Apple Watch is pretty good
[2888.96 → 2894.16] but then it has other issues and then the fitness watches suck at being smartwatches, and we just need
[2894.16 → 2900.72] them to yeah do the thing together um yeah no I think that's a great idea I think that makes a ton of
[2900.72 → 2906.64] sense um so let's see what else it's got it's that there are updates to the fitness software allowing you
[2906.64 → 2910.24] to leave your phone at home and track your activity automatically using a third-party app on android
[2910.24 → 2915.20] where it's set to launch this fall uh devs can create watch faces that show information from any android
[2915.20 → 2919.36] where app so that's cool I guess those are both good things um let's move into some of our more rapid
[2919.36 → 2924.88] fire news for this week uh original article here is from pcgamer.com or geforce.com if you want to get
[2924.88 → 2932.80] it directly from the horse's mouth uh NVIDIA posts an overwatch advertisement uh GTX 1070 specifications
[2932.80 → 2938.08] which is super exciting because it's actually quite a bit cheaper, and it's probably the more relevant one
[2938.80 → 2945.92] because that is that is well the 599 price point versus the 379 price point is like
[2946.56 → 2952.40] whoa a lot more people are going to be yeah, so this is going to in terms of performance effectively
[2952.40 → 2956.48] displace the do you want to come say bye to the Sancho people no
[2962.72 → 2968.48] goodbye Sancho people this is ash you may recognize him from such YouTube videos as
[2968.48 → 2975.36] videos that he's made um I'm I'm sure the twitch chat's going to freak out, and you're already going to be
[2975.36 → 2981.04] gone anyway it was really nice hanging out today and lunch and all that stuff is that a high 10 yeah
[2981.04 → 2991.20] okay yes bye see you later, and we'll talk soon um so yeah so at 375 79 dollars for not a founder's
[2991.20 → 3000.88] edition yeah wow it's going to have the performance of a GTX 980 ti it looks like oh because a 980 ti is
[3000.88 → 3007.04] that's a thing I mean that is a good VR experience, and you will have the new stuff which almost matters
[3007.04 → 3012.40] more uh depending on what you're doing than the like raw performance because you'll have SMP so
[3012.40 → 3017.20] I'm saying he's multi-production and ZIL if you're into that kind of stuff but mainly smp makes
[3017.20 → 3025.04] stuff like VR and multi-monitor support like crazy amounts better um so yeah looking pretty cool okay
[3025.04 → 3030.56] so you're really still oh we never actually talked about what the specs are we did a bad job okay so the
[3030.56 → 3037.60] it's still a gp104 so that's not big pascal that's like smaller same guy as the 1080 just
[3037.60 → 3046.00] uh lower binned one yeah, so the core clock is 1506 the boost clock is 1683 very close to 1080 yes do
[3046.00 → 3053.12] remember that uh clock for clock on graphics cards isn't really a thing um although 1080 versus 1070 it
[3053.12 → 3057.04] will be more of a thing but like compared to other generations don't necessarily do that calculation
[3057.04 → 3066.48] uh your VRAM clock speed is 8 000 that is gddr5 not DDR if eight gigs of ram your bus width is 256
[3066.48 → 3071.52] bit um there's some question mark specs on here so I guess they haven't fully released everything
[3071.52 → 3076.32] I'm pulling up the one the official one from NVIDIA here oh sweet okay um yeah it looks like they are
[3076.32 → 3085.04] not being 100 clear about everything released a lot of yeah 150 watt TDP um two slot cooler blah blah blah
[3085.04 → 3091.68] blah blah the 1080 is being released on the 27th so I believe it's being released for sale on the 27th
[3091.68 → 3099.68] and then the uh launch date of the 1070 is June 10th so is that rumoured or is that confirmed that's
[3099.68 → 3105.52] shown without a question mark on here okay so I'm assuming that that's yeah that's from the pc
[3105.52 → 3111.04] gamer article um I actually haven't gotten a confirmation from NVIDIA exactly when 1070 is dropping so
[3111.04 → 3116.40] okay uh so don't quote don't quote us on that don't get us in trouble because uh we talked
[3116.40 → 3123.68] about um three-way SLI not being a thing on the 1080 on the wan show and I got this frantic email from
[3123.68 → 3129.84] NVIDIA oh guys they're like actually guys Luke was like super sick during that part of the presentation
[3130.48 → 3136.80] um that's not a thing to be fair the way that they're doing is really dumb yes, and it's like kind
[3136.80 → 3141.92] of sketchy, and it's probably going to suck a lot like way worse than it normally does, and we'll probably
[3141.92 → 3146.96] have a video on that yeah, and we super don't agree with how they're doing it yeah I haven't talked to
[3146.96 → 3150.48] you about it but I don't agree and I assumed you don't I don't agree either what is your reason though
[3150.48 → 3155.20] might as well talk about it, I think software unlocks for a product that you bought to enable functionality
[3155.20 → 3160.16] that you gave me with the last generation product is a dick move yep um I understand the reason why they're
[3160.16 → 3166.32] doing it because these are people with more money than cents anyway um well I think part of it's
[3166.32 → 3171.60] because the way like it is I think uh yeah I'm still a little misinformed I'm waiting until we get
[3171.60 → 3177.68] the actual bridges so I'm probably going to get another mad email from BDR sorry um but I think if it's being
[3177.68 → 3183.36] enabled it's through the back end through dx12 and not at all through their stuff so I think they don't
[3183.36 → 3190.16] want it to happen but I think because of dx12 they don't have a huge amount of choice because
[3190.16 → 3196.64] they'll either look like the terrible guy for locking it down no matter what, or they'll look like
[3197.76 → 3203.04] kind of not very good if they have it enabled for everybody, and then it just sucks I think it's just
[3203.04 → 3207.28] going to suck the same amount as it always has really I think it's going to suck more you think it's gonna
[3207.28 → 3214.96] suck more okay well then stay tuned let's find out just how much yeah um but yeah i I do kind of
[3214.96 → 3220.56] agree with the like if you're gonna SLI you should probably stop it too yeah kind of mentality anyway
[3220.56 → 3227.04] so if you're gonna SLI you should definitely stop it to three and four is for people with more money
[3227.04 → 3233.68] than cents it is legitimately not better take it from me how many video cards do you think I could
[3233.68 → 3238.96] take home at the end of the day if I felt like it that'd be annoying because then they wouldn't be in
[3238.96 → 3245.52] inventory right but i get you how many could I yeah a lot I mean I could just I could just so
[3245.52 → 3252.00] many titans I could just okay I could like to call up anyone literally any video card maker I could say hey
[3252.00 → 3258.40] I need four video cards I'm doing a personal rig update video, and they would be in the mail literally
[3258.40 → 3268.00] any video card maker I do not run those because it's a bad idea yeah it's its a bad experience
[3268.00 → 3275.12] themselves in an extremely difficult demo that they were like pushing really hard to run two-way SLI
[3275.12 → 3285.44] with a physics card not three-way not four-way so like, so please don't speak of please don't
[3286.00 → 3291.76] don't spend all your money you love this topic i absolutely love this topic it is so cool okay so
[3292.56 → 3297.52] there's an English bank um what is it called intelligent environments or something I don't
[3297.52 → 3304.64] even really care, but it gives you like a wristband and if the funds in your account go below an agreed
[3304.64 → 3310.40] limit the band kicks in and will hit you with 200 with a 255 volt shock
[3310.40 → 3318.56] I hope it does it every single time that the value continues to go further down so it's like man i
[3318.56 → 3323.52] really want to buy a sandwich because I'm pretty hungry but I'm going to get electric shocked and i
[3323.52 → 3329.04] really hope that like people don't just take it off because that is so fabulously hilarious there's
[3329.04 → 3336.32] another thing uh oh no oh no, no it's a British firm giving bank customers an electric shop so no bank
[3336.32 → 3343.92] has actually announced support yet so it could be across multiple banks which is really cool and
[3343.92 → 3349.60] they're looking to add more functionality like the ability to turn down your nest heating to save on your
[3349.60 → 3359.12] energy bill if the funds are low honestly I think with the way that okay I forget I wanted to add more
[3359.12 → 3365.20] and be like if you leave the house and the central heating is still on it'll just like shock you
[3365.20 → 3372.00] like every 10 minutes until you remotely turn it down like I want this thing to just be like hey you're
[3372.00 → 3378.24] screwing up hey fix it this is why you shouldn't design the product but I was having one for myself
[3380.64 → 3385.20] just mod it yeah I'm sure there will be mods yeah I'm sure you'll be able I'm sure any company that
[3385.20 → 3390.16] designs something to electroshock people I'm sure you could convince them to make a more hardcore
[3390.16 → 3395.52] version I'm sure they'd be down yeah yeah um but I was talking to Brendan about this where he's like
[3395.52 → 3402.72] yeah like it seems like our generation doesn't save money like can't save money yeah and i you know
[3402.72 → 3409.20] part of the conversation with him was like look at the way that you know everything from the smell
[3409.20 → 3415.84] in a retail store is designed like the amount of research and like psychology that goes into making
[3415.84 → 3424.16] people buy stuff I mean I'm not saying that you know oh poor you bought that 200 pair of jeans and
[3424.16 → 3429.28] now you can't afford your rent you're such a victim I'm not saying that that's not that's not
[3429.28 → 3435.20] what's happening here but I am saying that you are up against forces that are bigger than you probably
[3435.20 → 3441.20] realize when it comes to huge people trying to get your money from there's even like uh road
[3441.20 → 3446.56] signs that you can drive past that emit the smell of like steak before you come up to a steak shop like
[3446.56 → 3452.00] there's oh there's some stuff out there lots of stuff going on so it's refreshing to see
[3452.00 → 3458.16] intelligent environments giving a crap um and my okay my reason for this a bunch of people in
[3458.16 → 3462.32] the chat it's the padlock wristband by the way is what the product's called which is kind of funny
[3462.32 → 3466.72] um, but they're calling me mass or whatever which is like that's fine I get where you're coming from
[3466.72 → 3472.24] but my actual reasoning for this is uh myself and a lot of other people I will self-admit this
[3472.24 → 3475.92] find it easy to put things off because I'll just be like oh I have something more important to do right
[3475.92 → 3480.88] now the importance of things increases when you are literally being electroshocked
[3483.92 → 3488.88] and if like I left the heat on and I'm like well crap I'm doing whatever right now I'm driving right
[3488.88 → 3493.84] now I don't want to do this if it's like and I'm like okay I should probably pull over
[3493.84 → 3498.80] deal with this and then keep driving because honestly that's fine it's not going to take me
[3498.80 → 3502.16] that much time to pull over to the side of the road deal with it and keep driving it's not a big
[3502.16 → 3509.44] that's a crazy background um but like it just I don't know I want it I think it would be good
[3511.20 → 3516.64] um Uber joins the race for driverless cars the original article here is from the verge
[3517.28 → 3526.80] meet Uber's first self-driving car it's a Ford Fusion hybrid how exciting um so I mean this shouldn't
[3526.80 → 3531.20] come as any surprise I think two weeks ago we were talking about Lyft working with whoever the crap it
[3531.20 → 3538.72] was to deploy a fleet of them like immediately um I mean the amount of money that someone like Uber
[3538.72 → 3543.20] could save remember how much you can charge for a service doesn't necessarily have anything to do
[3543.20 → 3547.60] with the cost of providing the service it has to do with how much it costs someone else to provide the
[3547.60 → 3551.68] service so if you are the first one to have a fleet of driverless cars you can effectively
[3552.80 → 3557.60] just make mad bank because you don't have to pay the person that someone else has to pay in order to
[3557.60 → 3563.76] compete with you um there's not really a lot to say other than that the things I'm going to
[3563.76 → 3569.52] find interesting are like uh refuelling them recharging them this sort of things is they
[3569.52 → 3574.00] going to have to pair up with gas stations to make it, so the driverless car can drive up and there'll be
[3574.00 → 3578.16] an attendant that will fill it and if you were a gas station would you want that Uber contract
[3578.16 → 3585.20] definitely I sure would holy crap yeah yeah um or are they all electrics do they know like
[3585.20 → 3590.64] Roomba's to go like pull back into a parking spot so they can keep charging and then keep going or
[3590.64 → 3596.72] like how was it tesla talking about like wireless charging pads yeah yeah but like but are they
[3596.72 → 3601.84] going to have to program intelligence for them to like to go home for a while and charge sounds fairly
[3601.84 → 3606.88] simple it wouldn't be that bad but like that'd be fascinating to drive by like the little
[3606.88 → 3611.76] the little nest of cars that provide all the Uber transactions for the city is this going to become
[3611.76 → 3618.32] cheaper for a lot of people if there's electric driverless cars that you just call on your phone
[3618.32 → 3624.00] and are there extremely fast than owning a vehicle for sprawling cities like Vancouver like they're
[3624.00 → 3629.84] like we're just it's just this like suburban sprawl because there's already go cars I can see this
[3629.84 → 3635.28] legitimately eliminating the need for people to own at least own two cars like maybe they only need one
[3635.28 → 3640.40] now, and they really like legitimately needed two because they commute this way and that way yeah he's
[3640.40 → 3644.80] talking about like families yeah yeah not individuals needing to own two cars this is
[3644.80 → 3649.12] the biggest first world problem ever yeah it's like oh which one should I drive today I mean this
[3649.12 → 3653.60] one like looks cooler but this one's more utilitarian I'm not sure yeah I know he's talking about like
[3653.60 → 3658.16] families that have to go different directions um speaking of going different directions I'm going
[3658.16 → 3663.12] a different direction I'm going backwards in terms of topics what if your bank account went below
[3663.12 → 3669.60] your limit while you were like in the checkout on like a porn site and your hand was like occupied
[3671.04 → 3675.92] this is uh e Pete's asking about what if you get a shock while you're kind of you know busy well than
[3675.92 → 3679.76] it's worse well then it's worse I guess you just gotta deal with it so you probably shouldn't be
[3679.76 → 3684.72] spending your last dollar yeah you should then be more aware right of what your current bank account
[3684.72 → 3688.80] is like watching like a live cam or something like that, and you're just kind of throwing money at
[3688.80 → 3694.88] it then you should be more than you should probably be shocked that's your fault okay yes entirely if
[3694.88 → 3699.92] you want to throw money at it, you need to set yourself a limit yeah and play within the limit
[3699.92 → 3706.16] that's how gambling works that's like financial tips yeah, yeah just the tips exactly um unless they
[3706.16 → 3716.40] want more let's see oh this is horrible um a California dad accidentally uh live stream child's birth
[3716.40 → 3722.88] from the delivery room um the mom says I was okay I was just focused on pushing it's a beautiful thing
[3722.88 → 3728.96] nothing to be ashamed of good response I've had two kids um I don't agree with I don't agree with that
[3728.96 → 3735.84] either but how do you accidentally live stream I agree that it was the right response um
[3737.28 → 3742.32] you know given this given the circumstances how do you again how do you accidentally live the video
[3742.32 → 3749.68] was shown through Facebook live has now been viewed over 300 000 times um and to be clear guys we're
[3749.68 → 3754.24] talking about this news topic we are not recommending that you go you know I would recommend that you
[3754.24 → 3759.36] don't I would recommend that you not because you know it's one of those things where for the 12 year
[3759.36 → 3765.04] olds in the audience it might sound pretty cool it's not nope it's not like it's kind of gross even
[3765.04 → 3771.76] yeah it's not um I don't want a kid let's see let's see what else we uh let's see what else we
[3771.76 → 3776.48] got oh yeah this sucks uh so I knew about this already this happened a while ago actually but uh
[3776.48 → 3781.84] oculus DRM kills the hack that ports games to competing headsets um they had already figured
[3781.84 → 3786.88] this out when I was trying to play lucky's tale on the five which I believe I should have every right
[3786.88 → 3793.20] to do I have already paid for an Oculus Rift they just haven't shipped it to me so why can't I play
[3793.20 → 3799.04] lucky's tale on my five anyway they just had it exclusive to the store not exclusive to the
[3799.04 → 3805.52] headset uh i yeah no i I understand their perspective but i also fully understand my
[3805.52 → 3811.36] perspective I shouldn't have to play on the headset I don't want to play on if I legitimately own the
[3811.36 → 3818.24] game even if it's a game you can only get by buying a rift if you owned both the uh setup use
[3818.24 → 3824.64] case of lucky's tale would play better on a rift I just want to play it I know and if you don't own
[3824.64 → 3827.76] both then that's better the reason why I say that is just because the rift is more comfortable and
[3827.76 → 3832.88] lighter, and it's just a seated experience anyway so it's better for that so they had it they had
[3832.88 → 3838.32] tweaked it so that when I tried to do the hack uh your controller wouldn't work so maybe now it's even
[3838.32 → 3843.92] more uh has been passionate I have a perfect feeling that someone's going to beat that because if
[3843.92 → 3848.32] they're just making it so that your controller doesn't work i have to imagine someone's just gonna
[3848.32 → 3853.60] make a thing that tricks it into thinking that it's a different controller you know i have to imagine
[3853.60 → 3859.20] that in the world of like dorky dorks who code dorky things for other dorks and don't have money
[3859.20 → 3868.16] that's always the best combination yeah VR is going to be like a thing for uh for hacks um speaking of
[3868.16 → 3873.60] being a thing Nokia wasn't a thing for phones for a bit there they're returning to mobile with android
[3873.60 → 3879.92] phones and tablets I was just thinking you know what we don't have enough makers of android phones
[3879.92 → 3885.04] and tablets yeah when I read this I was like wow I don't care so yeah I guess we're in the same boat
[3885.04 → 3890.72] so Microsoft is offloading Nokia's old phone business to Foxconn's subsidiary and a company called HMD
[3890.72 → 3896.64] global of for 350 million it's probably more than it's worth um Nokia has revealed that HMD is also
[3896.64 → 3900.56] acquiring rights to use the Nokia name on smartphones and tablets for the next 10 years
[3900.56 → 3908.72] head mounted display no, no no, no not head mounted anyway um so there you go Nokia's involvement in
[3908.72 → 3916.08] the new devices will be very limited so basically it'll be Chinese smartphones and tablets with Nokia
[3916.72 → 3922.88] name on them sure stuff um, so there was one more topic that I wanted to hit before we close out the
[3922.88 → 3932.80] show today and i oh crap I forget where it went where did it go where did it go oh no oh yeah no
[3932.80 → 3941.68] I guess that was it I just wanted to um yeah I just wanted to show nerd sports so it's hilarious um
[3942.64 → 3948.64] there was an issue with our network connection last time I tried to show you guys a teaser from a nerd
[3948.64 → 3954.32] sports episode that made it look like vessel didn't work because the timing was perfect um so
[3954.32 → 3961.44] that's not actually what happened, so this is my follow-up to that where I wanted to show you guys
[3961.44 → 3967.28] some clips from the hockey episode of nerd sports, so all five episodes are out now and vessels available
[3967.28 → 3972.40] at the link under the wan show uh for with a free one-week trial so you can actually check them all out
[3972.40 → 3978.00] and then decide if the early access is worth it for you or not um if you're like nerd sports is behind
[3978.00 → 3987.60] a paywall I mean just if you can watch five episodes in a week yeah these guys were they were mostly nice
[3987.60 → 3993.84] except when they celebrated after knocking over Dennis yeah this is that was that you trying to help him
[3993.84 → 4001.12] up yeah yeah I couldn't skate either a bunch of people have sent me things being like I thought
[4001.12 → 4007.76] you'd be better at hockey I'm actually pretty good at ball hockey I went like uh you're better than Colton
[4007.76 → 4013.44] I went like look at him skate look at him skate oh no Colton
[4016.88 → 4020.32] so this is them skating around in hula-hoops so for those of you who don't really
[4020.32 → 4025.36] get the whole nerd sports concept we almost got that one that was you passing to me oh
[4025.36 → 4029.76] that was actually pretty good that's not bad I screwed up the shot I remember I apologize to
[4029.76 → 4036.24] you about this like so many times you oh no, no oh we both almost got it there were a few times that
[4036.24 → 4042.80] we did that uh but I screwed up oh, oh wow so at that point in the video they're actually playing
[4042.80 → 4047.92] with little plastic hockey sticks skating with hula-hoops and I think they're holding pineapples
[4047.92 → 4054.08] tables or something like that, so the idea behind nerd sports is that is not just that nerds go up
[4054.08 → 4060.40] against real athletes but that we actually try to level the playing field yeah um as creatively as
[4060.40 → 4067.44] we can and uh sometimes we have to go pretty hardcore in order to get them to uh to be competitive
[4067.44 → 4072.48] with us that sequence like if is you ignore the fact that those guys didn't have sticks and
[4072.48 → 4076.08] couldn't skate because they had hula-hoops around each of their skates looked pretty good like
[4076.08 → 4082.16] that looked like a legit like cool scoring chance yeah I like yeah to reiterate my hockey thing i
[4082.16 → 4087.20] played a lot of ball hockey played on like a national level it was great could never afford to play ice
[4087.20 → 4094.96] hockey ice hockey is like easily one of the most expensive of that type of sports um like the gear
[4094.96 → 4101.44] is extremely expensive like American football you get your gear from your club, and then you give it
[4101.44 → 4106.80] back at the end of the year ice hockey is not that way you buy all of your own gear, and it's extremely
[4106.80 → 4114.32] expensive could not afford it as a kid never was into ice hockey not very good I knew like where i
[4114.32 → 4119.92] should be and what I should be doing and was just not really able to do it because of the skates which
[4119.92 → 4131.28] was so frustrating my the extent of my hockey experience is watching it on TV yeah and i uh I had
[4131.28 → 4138.24] played ice hockey at like a company event about I was still in university, so this must have been about
[4138.24 → 4147.28] 10 years ago um for about 20 30 minutes and I had never i had done a lot of like I'm pretty good
[4147.28 → 4154.24] on rollerblades um inline skates excuse me I used to be yeah like i I am pretty fast I am pretty stable
[4154.24 → 4160.00] I'm I'm pretty good on rollerblades and I had done a lot of like skating around on the concrete slab at home
[4160.00 → 4167.28] with the orange ball and the hockey stick and the way that that slab was set up um there were no walls
[4167.28 → 4174.88] anywhere so if I missed the net I had to go hike um so i I'm like an okay shot with a ball so like i
[4174.88 → 4179.84] know the wrist action yeah it's different um, but the extent of my ice hockey experience was like that
[4179.84 → 4185.04] 20 30 minutes at like that company thing and the extent of my ice skating experience is probably less
[4185.04 → 4189.52] than 10 hours on ice including all my elementary school trips to the rink yeah I wouldn't be surprised
[4189.52 → 4196.72] if I was similar so we did our best but uh it was not good um and then the last thing the thing
[4196.72 → 4202.08] that nick was bugging me about is that he wants me to do a call-out for the foil shirts like the ones
[4202.08 → 4205.36] that I am wearing right now those are limited edition shirts I'm going to go ahead and post
[4205.36 → 4211.52] those in the twitch chat here boom there's a silver one and uh here's the gold one the gold one actually
[4211.52 → 4215.60] the consensus around the office seems to be that the gold one looks better so maybe check out that
[4215.60 → 4220.72] gold one that's the second link I just put up if you want uh a limited edition foil shirt not this
[4220.72 → 4225.04] at all but the idea of what I'm doing that ties into this can I call that out yeah sure yeah yeah
[4225.04 → 4231.28] yeah yeah I'm doing a charity stream starting after party but not but it oh it's not
[4231.28 → 4235.60] starting tonight so I'm going to be doing an after party tonight for sure okay um which is going to be
[4235.60 → 4240.00] setting the whole after party thing is going to be working on like dos box and like setting up a
[4240.00 → 4246.32] bunch of stuff because I'm doing a charity stream starting tomorrow Saturday at noon PST which is
[4246.32 → 4252.72] going to be I think like 27 plus hours long which is ridiculous I'm starting in 1990 and playing you
[4252.72 → 4257.20] better be conscious when you come in on Monday yeah it's the reason why I'm starting at noon is so that
[4257.20 → 4262.88] I have enough time to sleep for like 12 hours or something before I have to come to work um yeah no
[4262.88 → 4268.80] it's its okay it's its planned out um so I'm going to be doing a different game every hour starting with
[4268.80 → 4274.48] a game from 1990 and iterating the year every time, so the first hour will be Super Mario worlds from 1990
[4274.48 → 4279.76] the second hour will be civilization one from 1991 and then I think it goes like Wolfenstein 3d
[4280.48 → 4284.80] doom and like progresses all the way through and there are a bunch of different games throughout the
[4284.80 → 4289.20] way it's not like what was the best game from that year it's what was the most like influential
[4289.20 → 4294.64] game on me, so there are a bunch of Elder Scrolls there's halo one and two there's like some
[4294.64 → 4298.96] series stuff like that but yeah it'll be a lot of fun, and it's going to be a giant charity stream for
[4298.96 → 4305.84] extra life so come on by should be fun all right i uh posted a link to Luke's channel in the uh in
[4305.84 → 4310.24] the chat there so guys uh check that out if you're into that sort of thing I've got people asking you
[4310.24 → 4314.08] to play total annihilation I still need to teach you supreme commander so we can play sometime it's such
[4314.08 → 4320.32] a good game I think there's still like uh like an underground like group that maintains uh rankings
[4320.32 → 4324.80] and servers and stuff like that that's awesome you know a game was perfect when that happens
[4324.80 → 4330.08] mm-hmm it was just too cult that's too niche yeah all right so good night guys thank you for tuning
[4330.08 → 4338.80] into the Wankel we'll see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
