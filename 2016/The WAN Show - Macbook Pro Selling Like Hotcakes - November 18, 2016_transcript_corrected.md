[0.00 → 2.78] He didn't know what Twitch is. He's like, is this sort of like dark website?
[2.88 → 4.52] I'm just like, no, I explained to him the cost of Twitch.
[5.32 → 9.14] I explained to him the context of Twitch, and I told him about like,
[9.20 → 11.90] hey, some people were making like six figures just playing video games,
[11.96 → 12.96] and other people were watching, so.
[14.60 → 17.02] And he wasn't depressed by this. By the way, we're live.
[17.36 → 18.96] No. Oh, awesome.
[19.10 → 22.50] Yeah, John was explaining live-streaming on the internet to his dad,
[22.56 → 23.58] who's apparently watching.
[23.92 → 24.30] Hi, Dad.
[24.84 → 25.98] So hi, John's dad.
[26.80 → 29.98] That's, uh, that's, uh, that's...
[29.98 → 37.82] You know, it's funny, I forget, because I spend so very much time in front of the camera,
[37.96 → 41.92] that like, being on a show is like, maybe a thing.
[42.26 → 44.94] Yeah, it's like a big deal to some folks still.
[45.26 → 47.38] So, yeah, there we go.
[47.52 → 49.78] Yeah, see, I'm taller than you, and I was way down here.
[50.38 → 51.38] Who's sitting this usually?
[51.64 → 51.96] Luke.
[51.96 → 52.96] Luke, so, yeah.
[53.40 → 53.90] Okay, fair enough.
[53.90 → 55.70] So welcome to the WAN show, you guys.
[55.76 → 57.32] We've got a great show for you guys today.
[57.62 → 63.64] Luke is down at IEM, so he's working on some pretty cool content from the Intel Extreme Masters,
[63.96 → 68.54] and so I have brought in my Luke substitute for the day, John.
[69.74 → 71.14] He's gonna point at you.
[71.32 → 71.54] Mm-hmm.
[71.62 → 73.30] And it won't be awkward at all, I promise.
[76.84 → 80.16] In other news, we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today.
[80.16 → 85.98] Okay, President Trump has determined that exploring Mars is not grand enough.
[86.04 → 87.80] No, he's going to have the best NASA.
[88.02 → 88.58] The best.
[88.70 → 89.72] The greatest NASA.
[89.96 → 90.16] Okay.
[90.46 → 91.50] The greatest NASA.
[91.72 → 92.16] The best.
[93.22 → 94.10] Just the best.
[94.26 → 96.66] So they're going to explore even further than Mars.
[97.06 → 100.94] Probably he'll find a way to do that within the four years that his term will last.
[100.96 → 101.48] No question.
[101.86 → 102.38] No question.
[102.40 → 103.02] No question.
[104.06 → 105.18] They'll launch tomorrow.
[106.12 → 107.08] The best launch.
[107.30 → 107.70] Anyway.
[107.96 → 109.22] It'll be the greatest launch you've ever seen.
[109.22 → 112.26] The greatest launch with the greatest lunch you've ever eaten.
[113.12 → 114.22] Launch and lunch.
[114.36 → 115.10] Dude, Trump steaks, man.
[115.12 → 115.76] At the same time.
[116.02 → 116.36] Trump steaks.
[116.64 → 117.12] Can't beat them.
[117.24 → 117.78] They're the greatest.
[118.16 → 122.96] Okay, so the new MacBook Pro, speaking of the greatest, the reviews are coming in, and
[122.96 → 124.26] it doesn't look good.
[125.00 → 126.30] More MacBook Pro news.
[126.80 → 130.72] The new MacBook Pro outsold every competing laptop in just five days.
[132.46 → 135.26] So I guess that's pretty good if you're Apple.
[135.46 → 136.16] It's not surprising.
[136.16 → 140.98] I'd love to say nothing surprises me anymore.
[141.54 → 142.50] It's official.
[143.28 → 145.58] Nothing can surprise me anymore.
[145.92 → 149.72] You can make six figures game streaming, and we have a reality TV star as our president.
[149.86 → 150.46] Nothing surprising.
[150.66 → 150.98] That's right.
[151.04 → 151.64] Your president.
[152.28 → 153.50] The hour was not our.
[153.72 → 155.34] It was him hour.
[155.34 → 156.22] For now.
[156.52 → 159.52] For, well, have I talked to you about that?
[160.98 → 161.98] No, seriously.
[162.10 → 162.66] Did I tell you?
[162.74 → 163.36] I don't recall.
[163.48 → 169.86] I think one of Trump's moves could be to invade Canada, because realistically, who would stop him?
[171.40 → 173.54] I think it's politically extremely unpopular.
[173.68 → 174.44] We don't want Canada.
[174.58 → 176.34] Politically unpopular, yes.
[176.92 → 183.50] But would anything stop Trump's America from simply marching north and declaring Canada to be theirs?
[183.62 → 184.74] He loves the Canadians, though.
[185.34 → 186.32] I don't think he does.
[186.44 → 191.56] I think he, I think, no, I think he's happy that all the celebrities who don't like him are moving to Canada.
[191.92 → 192.92] If anything, I think.
[192.96 → 194.62] Yeah, I think they're all reneging on that, aren't they?
[194.62 → 195.56] Of course they are.
[195.64 → 195.82] Yeah.
[195.82 → 196.48] It happens every time.
[196.48 → 197.82] You can't just walk in.
[197.90 → 199.40] I don't understand how people like, oh, I'm moving in.
[199.40 → 199.94] Well, you did.
[201.14 → 206.16] I had to, like, get, I had to stack a paperwork that was, like, it was huge.
[206.24 → 207.14] Did they even look at it, though?
[207.24 → 207.44] What?
[207.62 → 208.32] Did they look at it?
[208.36 → 211.58] So I hand it to the guy, and he kind of flips through it really disinterested.
[211.64 → 212.70] He's like, all right, I'll be back in a minute.
[213.10 → 217.62] And so, and then he gave me a fancier piece of paper, and he said, okay, bye.
[218.06 → 218.84] And here I am.
[219.48 → 220.36] But you can't just walk in.
[220.46 → 220.78] You can't.
[220.78 → 221.02] Okay.
[221.20 → 223.78] Our other major news story this week.
[223.78 → 232.38] More gamers are gaming on AMD graphics than Intel and NVIDIA combined, says a study from
[232.38 → 236.84] GFXSpeak.com, which I had never heard of until this study made headlines.
[237.36 → 238.72] Is it a sensationalist headline?
[240.34 → 240.74] Yes.
[241.12 → 243.28] But we'll explain what they're talking about at 11.
[243.34 → 245.20] Do we have the confusing flowchart to show everyone?
[245.40 → 246.54] Yes, we do.
[246.60 → 246.98] Okay.
[247.20 → 248.08] Yes, we can.
[248.10 → 248.66] Lovely.
[249.34 → 250.58] The best flowchart.
[250.60 → 251.00] Yes, we can.
[251.04 → 252.62] You're dating yourself a little bit there, my friend.
[252.62 → 253.64] Oh, you sure can.
[253.78 → 255.00] No one else is going to date me.
[257.32 → 258.62] Isn't that kind of big deal?
[259.50 → 259.74] No.
[260.38 → 262.06] Well, no, you're supposed to date me.
[262.18 → 263.54] Like, you're supposed to have a big night.
[263.54 → 263.62] You're supposed to date me.
[263.62 → 263.74] You're supposed to date me.
[263.84 → 264.32] Spouse.
[264.42 → 266.36] Yeah, but, like, it's not dating me.
[267.12 → 268.46] Well, that's why they do that.
[268.46 → 269.30] Yeah, that's a weird, I think.
[269.38 → 271.14] Because everyone knows it's all a big lie.
[274.14 → 276.38] I am also married, and I have no comment.
[276.66 → 276.96] So.
[277.48 → 278.38] Yeah, you know what?
[278.40 → 278.90] I love you, honey.
[278.90 → 279.30] What?
[279.36 → 283.60] The married people are actually slowly taking over here.
[284.36 → 284.46] So.
[284.82 → 286.14] So there's you, there's me.
[286.32 → 287.38] Yeah, there's Colton.
[287.38 → 287.54] There's Colton.
[287.82 → 289.20] So that's three of us now.
[289.42 → 289.66] Mm-hmm.
[290.18 → 292.78] I mean, we're still woefully outnumbered.
[293.20 → 297.04] But I think it's a matter of time for Brandon.
[297.04 → 302.22] I think it's, I think someone's going to lock up that Nick Light character quick fast.
[302.32 → 303.16] Just a hunch.
[303.28 → 303.42] Yeah.
[303.46 → 303.94] Just a hunch.
[303.94 → 307.44] Someone's going to, someone's going to, I mean, all that?
[307.94 → 309.18] Who doesn't want all that?
[311.68 → 312.58] Again, no comment.
[312.94 → 318.72] Well, I mean, my wife has said to me multiple times, this is exactly the same as when we were dating.
[318.90 → 320.86] Except there's just, like, legal crap now.
[321.04 → 322.68] It's like, it's the same thing.
[322.96 → 323.04] So.
[323.16 → 326.12] But then, when you guys were dating, you were in law school.
[326.12 → 326.96] No, I wasn't.
[326.98 → 328.04] This was, like, way after I graduated.
[328.86 → 330.56] Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[330.70 → 330.86] Yeah.
[331.44 → 333.48] But you were trying to find a job as a lawyer.
[333.68 → 333.82] Yes.
[333.82 → 334.90] So there was legal crap.
[335.34 → 336.26] It's a very different kind of legal crap.
[336.26 → 337.86] Yeah, there's always, there's always legal crap in life.
[337.86 → 340.90] I'm just trying to find a technical way to tie the two together.
[341.08 → 342.00] I'll give you a six out of ten.
[342.04 → 342.54] Thank you.
[343.58 → 345.50] It's about as well as I ever do with my wife, so.
[345.60 → 345.84] Oh.
[346.26 → 346.44] Oh.
[347.08 → 347.54] All right.
[348.48 → 354.22] Let's do, okay, no, I promise this will not be the Bittered Married Men show today.
[354.22 → 357.30] It's like, this is what happens when I bring you in instead of Luke.
[357.68 → 358.04] Oh.
[358.38 → 360.22] Let's move on to our first topic of the day.
[360.28 → 362.36] This was posted by Hey Yo on the forum.
[362.46 → 365.02] The original article here is from 9to5Mac.
[365.56 → 366.16] Actually, no.
[366.28 → 367.52] Let's not do this one first.
[367.70 → 367.98] Okay.
[367.98 → 370.36] Let's do, let's do the first, let's do the second one first.
[370.36 → 370.76] The Touch Bar.
[371.06 → 372.34] Also from 9to5Mac.
[372.44 → 376.48] This one posted by, what's her, what's her face?
[379.48 → 379.88] DJDWSK97.
[379.88 → 381.46] Thank you for the username.
[381.64 → 385.34] That is impossible for me to actually say as a word.
[386.68 → 388.00] So here we go.
[388.56 → 389.28] Touch Bar.
[390.20 → 391.58] Let's check the dates on these.
[391.58 → 398.24] Three days ago, Touch Bar MacBook Pro models have non-upgradable SSDs, seemingly undersized
[398.24 → 398.82] batteries.
[400.22 → 406.04] And so the reviews are, the reviews are supposedly not looking good.
[406.38 → 406.96] Let's have a look.
[407.64 → 410.44] SSDs and RAM are both soldered to the logic board.
[410.60 → 413.42] The battery cells look comically small.
[413.42 → 418.62] Some speculating that Apple limited their size to hit a weight target, with others saying
[418.62 → 424.18] that this could be an intentional choice to give the batteries room to expand or limit
[424.18 → 427.32] heat buildup inside the otherwise tightly packed casing.
[427.54 → 431.50] Perhaps avoiding a Note 7 style issue, although I doubt that very much.
[431.56 → 436.06] That seems to be a tongue in cheek, tongue firmly planted in cheek comment.
[436.16 → 439.22] There is a tongue emoticon like literally right next to it.
[439.22 → 439.46] Yeah.
[439.60 → 443.02] So that's, that's how I figured out that it was tongue in cheek.
[443.42 → 444.52] Excellent deductive reasoning.
[444.64 → 445.34] Very smart.
[445.46 → 450.08] That's, that is why, that is why I am a YouTube sensation.
[451.22 → 454.60] Actually, I don't think anyone anywhere on Earth considers me a sensation.
[454.84 → 454.98] I'm more of a light.
[454.98 → 456.56] I consider you a sensation, Linus.
[456.80 → 457.36] Thank you.
[458.62 → 459.94] Is Canada on Earth?
[460.72 → 462.30] Does Trump's Earth include Canada?
[462.40 → 463.02] I'm not a citizen.
[463.12 → 463.58] You tell me.
[464.86 → 465.34] Okay.
[465.34 → 470.56] Reviewers are stating they're seeing nowhere near Apple's claimed 10-hour battery life.
[470.56 → 476.34] The Verge reported five to six hours while Business Insider got a more promising eight
[476.34 → 481.86] hours under ideal conditions, six hours under normal use, which is a shame because Apple
[481.86 → 489.86] historically has advertised battery times that have been fairly aligned with real world usage,
[489.86 → 492.94] even going after other companies for exaggerating their claims.
[492.94 → 499.36] Quite frankly, I have no idea what anyone's battery life ratings are based on.
[499.96 → 500.36] Yeah.
[500.46 → 505.58] Like I'm looking at, I have the thing in front of me and the Verge guy says he kept open
[505.58 → 510.48] Slack, Safari, Mail, Tweet Bot, and Text Edit watching the occasional YouTube video and opening
[510.48 → 512.70] various Apple apps here and there for testing.
[512.94 → 513.40] Why, thank you.
[513.40 → 519.78] So, I mean, yeah, that's a reasonable workload, but Lord knows how they tested it in Cupertino
[519.78 → 521.54] or, you know, how anyone else uses it.
[521.54 → 529.06] So, this news comes after Apple's claims that the lack of a 32 gig option was due to a focus
[529.06 → 530.38] on power savings.
[531.08 → 535.98] General performance, trackpad, keyboard, and touch bar are all considered positives depending
[535.98 → 537.46] on who you ask.
[537.46 → 542.86] I know there are a lot of developers that are upset about the removal of the top row as
[542.86 → 543.86] a no, okay.
[544.16 → 546.42] And I got to be really clear about my wording here.
[546.52 → 547.30] Got to be really careful.
[548.00 → 554.86] So, a lot of people are saying there's no physical escape key while technically a touchpad with
[554.86 → 557.06] like a spot on it is physical.
[557.42 → 562.04] But it's not like a button you can physically push down on and then something happens as a
[562.04 → 564.40] result of a keyboard actuator thing.
[564.40 → 568.52] So, a lot of developers are upset about the lack of a physical, which to be clear is still
[568.52 → 568.84] physical.
[568.96 → 572.36] It does exist in the physical plane of existence.
[572.56 → 573.28] It's not, it's not telepathy.
[573.28 → 574.08] It's not spiritual.
[574.36 → 574.52] Yeah.
[574.68 → 574.86] Yeah.
[575.32 → 577.38] But the lack of a physical escape key.
[578.30 → 583.56] And Louis Grossman in particular is the only person I've really seen this complaint from,
[583.62 → 586.00] but it's super upset about the louder keyboard.
[586.84 → 589.00] I haven't personally tried it yet.
[589.00 → 594.46] But my MacBook Pro is going to arrive in like Monday.
[594.82 → 596.16] Should arrive on Monday or Tuesday.
[596.76 → 599.48] I like how you need to look at your watch for that because I was thinking you were going
[599.48 → 600.82] to say like two hours.
[600.86 → 601.14] I didn't.
[601.14 → 601.38] Monday.
[601.60 → 603.18] I didn't know what day of the week it was.
[603.68 → 604.08] Which?
[604.24 → 604.54] Friday.
[604.68 → 605.02] Why don't you?
[605.12 → 605.44] Come on.
[605.50 → 606.28] I know.
[606.40 → 607.04] I know that.
[607.16 → 610.42] Like cognitively I know that, but emotionally I don't know that.
[611.20 → 612.28] Spiritually I don't know that.
[612.60 → 613.80] Physically I might know it.
[614.14 → 614.36] Yeah.
[614.36 → 618.46] Well this has been a very taxing time for like my chi and whatnot too.
[618.46 → 619.86] But emotionally there's no escape.
[621.50 → 622.38] Eat Arby's dude.
[622.72 → 623.12] Escape?
[624.24 → 624.60] Oh.
[625.04 → 625.44] Oh.
[625.60 → 626.02] Oh okay.
[626.36 → 627.08] Seven out of ten.
[627.20 → 628.14] Luke would have caught that.
[628.58 → 629.58] Four out of ten co-hosts.
[629.60 → 630.52] Well you know what?
[630.58 → 631.52] I'm sorry I'm not Luke.
[631.60 → 632.90] I try to grow a beard out.
[633.08 → 633.74] It's itchy.
[633.88 → 634.82] It comes in patchy.
[635.02 → 635.26] You know.
[635.38 → 635.80] I've tried.
[636.10 → 636.30] You know.
[637.32 → 637.68] Sorry.
[637.86 → 640.92] You know there's more to the Luke package than just the beard.
[641.00 → 641.20] Yeah.
[641.24 → 642.44] It's like 90% that though.
[643.08 → 643.36] I'm Luke.
[643.36 → 643.78] All right.
[643.78 → 656.40] So I think this segues pretty perfectly into a short discussion on our video about the MacBook Pro's lack of a 32 gig option.
[656.62 → 662.44] Our much maligned video about the lack of a 32 gig option.
[662.56 → 662.74] Now.
[663.08 → 663.40] Okay.
[664.34 → 665.86] John actually wrote the video.
[666.20 → 667.34] It was hosted by Luke.
[667.80 → 670.50] But I also proofread it.
[670.50 → 672.66] So to be very clear.
[672.86 → 675.34] I'm not going to try and pin the blame on anyone.
[675.84 → 684.70] We all collectively didn't consider or missed that the reason.
[684.70 → 705.92] So that the electrical traces connected from one thing to another thing reason that the MacBook Pro 2016 only comes in 16 gig options or less is that the Skylike CPU in it only supports 16 gigs of LPDDR3 on a single channel.
[705.92 → 710.08] We all kind of collectively served on that.
[710.08 → 711.08] So we're sorry.
[711.08 → 711.58] So we're sorry.
[712.28 → 712.92] Our bad.
[714.24 → 726.90] However, that doesn't really change any of the overall message, especially in light of the reviews for the MacBook Pro coming in complaining about the battery life.
[726.90 → 735.72] So, John, do you want to kind of give us the top level summary of what we were trying to achieve by investigating the power consumption of RAM?
[736.52 → 751.98] Mostly that RAM modules are not only small and not terribly difficult to fit in a mobile device like a laptop, but they're also typically one of the lower power consumption components of any system, whether desktop or laptop.
[751.98 → 757.08] If you watch the video, obviously we tested like a bunch of different RAM configurations in the Predator.
[757.46 → 765.66] We were using DDR4 SO Simms, which are actually the same voltage as the LPDDR3 that they're using in the MacBook Pro.
[765.76 → 766.70] It's 1.2 volts.
[767.14 → 775.88] So it would take an engineer at Intel or Samsung or Apple or something to tell us the exact milliwatt difference or whatever it ends up being.
[775.88 → 779.58] Yeah, they're not exactly the same, but they do run at the same voltage.
[779.58 → 781.76] So you'd expect them to be similarity, you know.
[781.98 → 790.52] And so when we ran, you know, we did everything from, you know, one stick of eight to two sticks of 16 in the Predator.
[790.62 → 794.06] There's only two SO DIMM slots in the Predator, but we did this.
[794.32 → 801.74] And the differences while they were there, they were quite – they were very, very marginal when you looked at the actual battery capacity.
[801.74 → 809.00] The difference between the most draining and the least draining RAM config, it was about 100 milliwatt hours.
[809.00 → 813.06] Yeah, it was about 100 milliwatt hours, about 4% of the battery, no matter which way you slice it.
[813.06 → 822.94] So in that vein, we were just – the point we were trying to make was more, I'm not sure that power consumption is, like, the best explanation for this.
[823.02 → 828.94] Even had they gone with DDR4, even if the power had been, like – the power consumption would have been more of a concern.
[828.94 → 836.78] It seems to me, anyway, that the bigger concern would have possibly been space because, obviously, if you put in the SODIUM, you have the slot there.
[836.90 → 839.28] There's some additional bulk as opposed to –
[839.28 → 844.94] Or even if you were to solder on 32 gigs of DDR4, that would still take up more PCB space.
[845.08 → 845.10] It would, yeah.
[845.10 → 846.86] And it is an tiny PCB.
[846.86 → 852.14] So, like Linus said, it was sort of a team effort deep, if you will, on that.
[852.56 → 862.32] But at the same time, it does – I still am kind of raising my eyebrow a little bit, as Luke said in the video, about why exactly that design decision was made.
[862.52 → 871.28] And to be clear, we are also aware that implementing dual-channel memory versus single-channel memory may have also affected power consumption.
[871.48 → 871.84] Absolutely.
[871.84 → 885.84] But then back to John's point, where the greatest delta we were able to observe testing different RAM amounts in different systems was 4% of –
[885.84 → 888.00] A Predator battery.
[888.02 → 888.58] A Predator battery.
[888.58 → 891.94] Which is how many – because you could probably do the math because the –
[891.94 → 896.02] Well, 4% is 4%, so it would be 4% of any battery, 4% of overall power consumption.
[896.10 → 897.08] I guess it could be more.
[897.08 → 902.40] No, no, no, no, no, because we measured it in milliwatt hours, which is like a unit of energy.
[902.86 → 903.20] Oh, I see.
[903.30 → 903.76] So, I think – yeah.
[903.90 → 911.76] So, it's not that, but it's more that the difference between the lowest and highest was so little, and it was so insignificant that – yeah.
[911.76 → 917.32] So, in response then, let's say 5% to cover our bases.
[917.32 → 924.16] Let's say if they had allowed a dual-channel 32 gig option, that might have consumed 5% more power.
[924.84 → 931.16] And let's say that that would have added, you know, this much PCB space or whatever the case may be.
[932.48 → 935.14] Let's say that was the answer.
[935.70 → 938.24] It doesn't change the conclusion of our video.
[938.24 → 952.96] The conclusion of our video where we say ultimately it came down to some kind of manipulation of people's upgrade cycles or some kind of space-saving measure.
[954.24 → 956.10] Ultimately, that is still the answer.
[956.78 → 960.62] Did we overlook an important point in arriving at our conclusion?
[961.10 → 961.38] Yes.
[961.46 → 962.84] And for that, again, we are very sorry.
[962.84 → 970.50] But that really doesn't change that the reason this happened is not due to power consumption.
[971.10 → 974.80] It is part of an equation that has multiple variables.
[975.04 → 976.48] There's a power consumption equation.
[976.86 → 978.46] There is a performance equation.
[978.62 → 980.34] There is a space equation.
[980.90 → 982.66] And there is a heat equation.
[982.88 → 985.16] There's actually – there's many, many, many, many, many variables.
[985.16 → 995.28] So for Apple to come out and say it was due to power consumption, it was to keep power consumption acceptable, is still a ridiculous statement.
[995.68 → 997.80] Because that is not the entire truth.
[998.10 → 999.32] It is a fraction.
[999.90 → 1004.80] It is the X in an equation that also has Y, Z, A, B, and C variables.
[1005.44 → 1007.20] It might not be as good.
[1007.30 → 1013.12] But also, if they put in DDR4 and gave you a 32 gig option, it's not like battery life would just plummet.
[1013.12 → 1019.08] So, yeah, it's a little bit – and there's also – you also have to wonder if it is the same thing with the SSDs.
[1019.18 → 1023.04] You know, because, you know, part of the reason it's getting a little bit hammered on in the reviews.
[1023.16 → 1024.44] Like, oh, the SSDs are soldered on.
[1024.48 → 1025.32] Everything's soldered on.
[1025.42 → 1031.40] And you think about how big an M.2 2280 SSD, how small these are.
[1031.46 → 1033.38] Well, Apple managed to fit them in their laptops before.
[1033.54 → 1034.00] There we go.
[1034.14 → 1036.16] Yeah, so you also have to think about that, too.
[1036.32 → 1037.92] You arrive at the same conclusion, though.
[1037.96 → 1039.12] Is it space management?
[1039.26 → 1041.76] Is it trying to affect people's upgrade cycles?
[1041.76 → 1043.20] I guess that's the nicest way you can say it.
[1043.28 → 1045.70] But, you know, I guess it's just a little bit unclear at this point.
[1045.94 → 1048.40] So basically, there you go.
[1048.88 → 1054.80] Right conclusion, wrong methodology, Linus Media Group.
[1055.04 → 1055.26] Okay.
[1057.16 → 1058.60] Linus Media Group, we try.
[1059.30 → 1059.58] Yeah.
[1059.98 → 1060.72] We try.
[1061.00 → 1061.58] We try.
[1061.68 → 1062.04] Darn it.
[1062.04 → 1069.64] Please, please look at us as, like, the lovable orchards and not the completely inept, terrible people.
[1070.62 → 1071.66] Lovable orchards.
[1071.76 → 1073.88] I hope you're not comparing us to, like, the Cleveland Browns, Linus.
[1075.62 → 1075.98] Yeah.
[1076.18 → 1078.70] We do sometimes win with things that we try to do.
[1078.72 → 1078.84] Yeah.
[1078.84 → 1079.94] We do win sometimes.
[1080.14 → 1081.84] Apologies to any of our fans from Cleveland.
[1082.84 → 1084.80] But, yeah, kind of been a rough time for them.
[1084.88 → 1085.08] Anyway.
[1085.08 → 1086.08] Okay.
[1087.08 → 1088.68] Moving on to our next topic.
[1088.82 → 1091.08] So this is also from 9to5Mac.
[1091.22 → 1093.26] And this was posted by Hey Yo.
[1094.70 → 1101.08] The new MacBook Pro outsold every competing laptop in its first five days of being on sale.
[1101.08 → 1114.86] So, now, to be clear, the way that they arrive at this data is actually not based on numbers that are being released by Microsoft, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and Apple.
[1114.86 → 1120.94] Because Apple, to my knowledge, hasn't shared any sales numbers of the new MacBook Pro yet.
[1121.42 → 1122.86] So this is based on...
[1123.78 → 1125.50] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1125.76 → 1126.50] Component orders.
[1127.50 → 1130.68] Component orders and slice intelligences.
[1131.58 → 1132.88] Something or other.
[1133.08 → 1133.88] Something, something, something.
[1133.98 → 1134.52] I can't remember.
[1134.62 → 1138.72] I'm going to go back to my notes because that's where I have the information that I'm trying to tell you.
[1140.56 → 1141.66] Note, note.
[1141.82 → 1145.80] I read the article, so I knew that that thing...
[1145.80 → 1146.64] Okay, yeah, yeah, here we go.
[1146.64 → 1148.64] So it comes from...
[1148.64 → 1155.60] The data comes from analyzing email receipts among its panel of 4.4 million online shoppers.
[1156.50 → 1162.90] So this is not by any means comprehensive, but it also isn't a completely insignificant sample size.
[1163.36 → 1176.72] With that said, depending on how you obtain your sample audience, like, oh, I don't know, say, for example, you get people to join your panel on exclusively Apple websites, for example.
[1176.72 → 1177.72] Mm-hmm.
[1177.72 → 1185.72] Well, obviously, that's going to affect the sales of maps proportional to PCs in your testing, in your data.
[1186.18 → 1188.66] So we don't really know much about that.
[1188.82 → 1198.18] But what we do know is that in five days, it achieved a sales number that is slightly less than...
[1198.18 → 1200.36] Here, let me just pull up this graphic here.
[1201.32 → 1204.20] It's cut off on the bar next to it, which is awesome.
[1204.88 → 1210.38] So it is almost double the Dell XPS 13, the newest MacBook.
[1211.00 → 1213.70] It is almost quadruple.
[1215.08 → 1216.50] The Microsoft something...
[1216.50 → 1216.92] What is that?
[1217.02 → 1217.96] It's cut off on my two.
[1217.96 → 1218.88] Why is this cut off?
[1218.88 → 1222.02] That is just horrible, like, CSS, I guess.
[1222.16 → 1222.68] Here we go.
[1222.70 → 1223.20] Oh, there we go.
[1223.20 → 1223.58] Okay, cool.
[1223.58 → 1226.24] So let's go over to intelligence.slice.com.
[1226.32 → 1226.88] Here we go.
[1227.30 → 1233.32] So the newest MacBook Pro is almost caught up to the 12-inch MacBook, which was a complete...
[1233.32 → 1240.78] I guess even by Apple standards is now officially a turd, because it's been on sale since April 2015.
[1241.68 → 1244.98] It has crushed the Surface Book by almost 4X.
[1244.98 → 1252.60] It has crushed the Asus Chromebook Flip, which I'm really actually not sure what that has to do with the MacBook Pro, but...
[1252.60 → 1254.22] It's a completely separate market segment.
[1254.44 → 1255.60] Sure, yeah.
[1255.96 → 1263.96] 40% Apple laptop buyers from 2014 purchased their next laptop from another brand, which is pretty interesting, I guess.
[1264.52 → 1267.28] MacBook Pro shoppers mirror Apple Watch early adopters.
[1268.74 → 1270.60] So 20% female, 80% male.
[1270.76 → 1271.88] That's all very interesting data.
[1271.88 → 1276.98] I mean, again, we don't really know much about where they get their data set from exactly.
[1277.62 → 1284.12] Their sample size is not comprehensive or anything like that, but there you have it.
[1285.34 → 1292.42] I guess a lot of people fancy themselves pros and bought a MacBook Pro, so they can show off how pro they are.
[1292.48 → 1293.02] Very pro.
[1293.10 → 1294.28] When they pull it out in class.
[1294.44 → 1296.08] Nothing screams pro like the touch bar.
[1296.46 → 1298.48] Hey, nothing screams like when I pull it out in class.
[1298.48 → 1298.56] Okay.
[1301.88 → 1304.14] I think we've all been there.
[1306.96 → 1308.00] You know what?
[1308.12 → 1310.76] I want to hear from you guys.
[1311.56 → 1312.02] Straw pull?
[1312.20 → 1313.88] Yeah, we got to straw pull this.
[1315.02 → 1315.30] Okay.
[1315.56 → 1318.56] So, hey, on the MacBook Pro 2016.
[1319.80 → 1320.10] Okay.
[1321.38 → 1321.94] Deserved.
[1321.94 → 1330.52] And I'm actually going to get you guys to rate it on a scale of one to five.
[1331.24 → 1333.68] So five is the most deserving.
[1336.62 → 1339.56] And one is going to be the least deserving.
[1339.56 → 1340.92] You've got two threes, bro.
[1342.76 → 1343.80] Well, you know what?
[1344.12 → 1345.32] Not all of us are perfect.
[1346.26 → 1348.72] You know, not all of us are trained proofreaders.
[1348.72 → 1353.14] Aren't you also like our editor-in-chief?
[1354.14 → 1355.80] I wasn't trained to do that.
[1356.82 → 1358.72] You went to school to proofread things.
[1358.80 → 1359.36] No, I didn't.
[1359.56 → 1360.66] That's what lawyers do.
[1360.94 → 1362.90] That's like a tiny part of what lawyers do.
[1363.04 → 1364.92] We don't have proofreading class in law school.
[1365.02 → 1365.60] We don't do that.
[1365.68 → 1367.20] Well, it's important to proofread.
[1367.62 → 1370.56] And I'm sure they cover the importance of it in law school.
[1371.26 → 1375.48] I just figured you would be able to type the numbers one through five in succession without much difficulty.
[1376.40 → 1377.26] Perhaps I was wrong.
[1377.96 → 1378.72] Perhaps you were.
[1379.06 → 1379.74] Perhaps you were.
[1379.80 → 1382.52] Lions is going to fire me after the show is over with, by the way.
[1382.84 → 1384.18] No, I don't have to fire you.
[1384.22 → 1385.12] I can deport you.
[1385.94 → 1387.44] I don't think I can, actually.
[1387.52 → 1389.12] No, you have to get Truro to do that for you.
[1389.24 → 1389.48] Okay.
[1389.56 → 1391.74] And he would probably try to talk to me about my feelings before that happens.
[1391.76 → 1392.36] So joke's on you.
[1393.02 → 1393.60] Oh, all right.
[1393.78 → 1394.10] Okay.
[1394.20 → 1394.90] Hold on a second.
[1394.90 → 1401.16] Is this really going to become like a head of state showdown?
[1401.92 → 1406.92] Because I will put Trudeau up against Trump any day of the week.
[1407.36 → 1408.46] Even in a fist fight.
[1408.54 → 1410.90] Your head of state is Queen Elizabeth, not Justin Trudeau.
[1411.06 → 1413.24] That's fair.
[1413.24 → 1415.06] But does she know it anymore?
[1415.22 → 1416.32] I mean, what is she, like 110?
[1417.76 → 1420.54] Either way, I wouldn't want to see her match get into a fist fight.
[1420.70 → 1422.06] I don't think that would turn out very well.
[1422.08 → 1423.74] She's kind of a badass lady.
[1423.74 → 1425.30] Could she sit the corgis on somebody?
[1425.38 → 1426.52] She could do that, the royal corgis?
[1426.56 → 1427.88] I had no idea.
[1428.12 → 1429.86] She, like, served in World War II.
[1430.64 → 1432.34] Oh, she was like, yeah, what did she do?
[1432.40 → 1433.52] I think I remember hearing about this.
[1433.66 → 1436.60] I think she was a driver for, like, something, something.
[1436.76 → 1438.92] But it wasn't, like, it wasn't a purely ceremonial role.
[1439.04 → 1439.86] She actually did stuff.
[1439.86 → 1440.10] Yeah, she did things.
[1440.16 → 1440.74] Yeah, there we go.
[1440.84 → 1441.00] Yeah.
[1441.16 → 1441.86] That's actually kind of awesome.
[1441.86 → 1443.04] Apparently her dad was furious.
[1444.04 → 1448.64] But it was just, like, yeah, like, she's actually, like, way cooler than I thought.
[1448.84 → 1449.00] Yeah.
[1449.00 → 1453.78] Well, I mean, hey, let's see you be, like, still awesome when you're, like, a billion years old.
[1453.86 → 1457.44] So, you know what's fascinating about the results for our straw poll?
[1458.76 → 1460.72] Apparently, I'm psychic.
[1460.92 → 1464.90] Because the least important option was the one I glossed over.
[1465.66 → 1466.76] We didn't have a two.
[1467.82 → 1468.78] And no one cares.
[1469.62 → 1472.44] Only 6% of the people would have even voted for your two.
[1472.66 → 1474.68] Maybe the Twitch viewers were just trying to spite me.
[1474.68 → 1477.52] It would not have affected the results of the election.
[1478.98 → 1480.42] Unlike Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.
[1482.38 → 1484.32] Okay, yeah, there's an argument that could be made for that.
[1486.08 → 1487.30] All right, so there you go.
[1487.44 → 1491.18] Apparently, most of you are pretty much on board with Apple's latest Mac Pro,
[1491.32 → 1494.02] pretty much deserving the hate that it's getting right now.
[1494.48 → 1495.96] With that said, you know what?
[1496.10 → 1497.90] Okay, we're going to move on to our next topic.
[1498.18 → 1501.16] But I want you guys to answer this next straw poll in the meantime.
[1501.76 → 1504.28] Who knows someone who bought one?
[1504.68 → 1511.70] Okay, I'm not talking like you watch a Twitch streamer.
[1511.76 → 1512.88] Who personally knows someone.
[1512.88 → 1514.16] Yeah, you have to personally know them.
[1514.26 → 1519.34] You have to have spoken to them in the last six months
[1519.34 → 1522.12] or emailed them in the last month
[1522.12 → 1526.28] or IM'd them in the last two weeks or something like that.
[1526.28 → 1527.56] I know someone who was very close,
[1527.70 → 1531.00] but they ultimately ended up going with the newest MacBook,
[1531.16 → 1532.82] the regular MacBook, not the Pro model.
[1533.92 → 1535.58] With like the Core M whatever.
[1535.76 → 1538.46] Which I guess is cheaper, so it has that going for it.
[1538.72 → 1541.20] Yeah, it's just one of those things where, you know,
[1541.30 → 1543.90] I think if you don't need every bell and whistle
[1543.90 → 1545.36] and you don't need hyper-threading.
[1545.36 → 1546.22] Or a port.
[1546.88 → 1550.28] Or a computer that doesn't throttle to literally 50% of its performance
[1550.28 → 1551.68] as soon as you do anything intensive.
[1551.94 → 1552.44] Oh, yeah.
[1552.68 → 1555.46] I mean, I was just thinking about getting like the brakes removed from my car
[1555.46 → 1557.20] and just selling them because like who needs those?
[1557.32 → 1560.02] You know, I could just sort of, you know, Fred Flintstones to stop it.
[1560.74 → 1561.00] Whatever.
[1561.54 → 1561.92] All right.
[1561.92 → 1568.42] Let's move on to our next highly controversial topic of the day.
[1568.86 → 1571.66] This was posted by Lil Trekkie on the forum.
[1572.30 → 1576.60] And the original article here is from gfxspeak.com.
[1576.82 → 1578.74] And the headline here is
[1578.74 → 1581.78] The Balance of Power in Gaming.
[1583.24 → 1584.18] Do you think I read that okay?
[1585.66 → 1588.62] It sounded like, you sounded like Schwarzenegger
[1588.62 → 1590.08] but with like a mouth full of mashed potato.
[1590.08 → 1593.56] Doesn't he always kind of sound like he has a mouth full of mashed potato?
[1594.34 → 1595.50] I think you read it fine, Linus.
[1595.66 → 1596.32] Thank you.
[1597.26 → 1597.70] Okay.
[1598.26 → 1600.16] So this is,
[1600.52 → 1603.74] if you're confused by the end of me scrolling down this page,
[1604.32 → 1608.88] let me tell you that I am firmly in the same camp as you are.
[1608.88 → 1609.74] It's pretty bad.
[1609.74 → 1611.92] So gamers fall into several camps.
[1612.04 → 1615.54] Device size, main processor type, OS screen size, budget, time spent.
[1616.54 → 1618.20] The gaming community is so large
[1618.20 → 1620.42] that no single demographic can define it.
[1621.02 → 1621.72] Moving on.
[1622.12 → 1622.56] Lord.
[1622.70 → 1623.02] Okay.
[1623.38 → 1624.56] So, okay.
[1624.74 → 1625.80] We got your PC.
[1626.44 → 1628.34] Then we got your desktop notebook.
[1628.64 → 1630.90] And there's a new category that maybe they'll add
[1630.90 → 1632.80] just to make things a little bit more confusing.
[1633.12 → 1634.58] I have that handheld PC
[1634.58 → 1636.80] that we're releasing a YouTube video on very soon.
[1636.92 → 1638.12] Windows 10 handheld device.
[1638.58 → 1638.86] Okay.
[1638.96 → 1640.02] So then you got you're discrete.
[1640.24 → 1641.98] You got you're onboard.
[1642.62 → 1643.40] You got you're discrete.
[1643.52 → 1644.36] You got you're onboard.
[1644.84 → 1646.10] Don't forget to add external.
[1646.30 → 1649.46] Like if we just want to make this chart phenomenally.
[1649.54 → 1650.86] Yeah, like a Razor Core or something.
[1650.88 → 1651.34] Yeah, Razor Core.
[1651.46 → 1651.78] Razor Core.
[1651.84 → 1652.58] Don't forget about that.
[1653.58 → 1654.32] Then in discrete,
[1654.58 → 1657.16] you got your mainstream performance enthusiast workstation.
[1659.26 → 1659.62] Okay.
[1660.88 → 1663.34] And you got your discrete notebook.
[1663.70 → 1665.58] Mainstream rich media workstation.
[1665.58 → 1667.14] I like how the differences between these
[1667.14 → 1669.00] are just so obvious from this chart.
[1669.22 → 1670.16] Enthusiast is missing.
[1670.16 → 1671.56] Last time I checked,
[1671.68 → 1674.08] there are GTX 1080s in notebooks,
[1674.28 → 1675.86] but I guess we're not going to stress about that too much.
[1675.86 → 1677.40] Is that enthusiast or is that like,
[1677.70 → 1678.28] you know,
[1678.50 → 1680.56] or is Titan X enthusiast?
[1680.62 → 1680.82] Okay.
[1680.88 → 1683.02] And then everything ultimately makes its way to a display.
[1683.92 → 1684.38] Gotcha.
[1684.52 → 1684.92] We would hope.
[1685.56 → 1687.68] The tiers for gamer time commitment
[1687.68 → 1690.30] are light, moderate, intensive, and extreme.
[1691.46 → 1691.86] Okay.
[1692.66 → 1693.40] And that,
[1693.72 → 1694.06] oh,
[1694.18 → 1695.34] hold on a second.
[1695.94 → 1697.36] And then there's this thing.
[1697.68 → 1697.84] What?
[1697.84 → 1701.36] So there's a semiconductor fab,
[1701.86 → 1705.02] which goes to the discrete GPU supplier,
[1705.66 → 1708.10] which go to contract manufacturers.
[1708.90 → 1710.18] So this is AMD or NVIDIA.
[1710.38 → 1712.16] I'm going to do my best to make my way through this.
[1712.48 → 1714.92] So this goes to your Tulsa
[1714.92 → 1716.02] and your,
[1716.02 → 1718.44] like,
[1718.56 → 1720.60] Abuses and gigabytes of the world
[1720.60 → 1722.36] who actually take those chips
[1722.36 → 1722.94] and, like,
[1723.28 → 1724.78] buy memory and PCBs
[1724.78 → 1725.76] and bolt them all together.
[1725.76 → 1727.80] So they sell them
[1727.80 → 1731.36] to AIB partners mostly.
[1731.88 → 1734.76] So that would be guys like your Avgas of the world.
[1735.58 → 1735.76] Yeah,
[1735.84 → 1736.42] Total.
[1736.64 → 1736.88] No,
[1736.94 → 1737.88] Total's a manufacturer.
[1738.02 → 1738.14] Oh,
[1738.20 → 1738.54] that's right.
[1738.76 → 1739.14] They are now.
[1739.26 → 1739.36] So,
[1739.62 → 1741.26] but Gigabyte and...
[1741.26 → 1741.42] No,
[1741.48 → 1742.36] Gigabyte is a manufacturer.
[1742.54 → 1742.68] Okay.
[1742.68 → 1742.86] In fact,
[1742.94 → 1744.08] I'm actually really...
[1744.08 → 1746.10] I'm just going off the rails today,
[1746.14 → 1746.48] I guess.
[1746.48 → 1747.88] There's been a lot of consolidation
[1747.88 → 1755.26] in the actual assembly and brand space.
[1755.48 → 1756.98] So it used to be
[1756.98 → 1759.10] that there were a handful of manufacturers,
[1759.36 → 1761.30] your Fox cons and your whoever else,
[1761.80 → 1763.70] and then it was, like,
[1763.74 → 1765.44] a lot of guys rebranding,
[1765.50 → 1767.24] like the BFG techs of the world.
[1767.24 → 1768.80] But nowadays,
[1769.24 → 1771.10] a lot of them are more vertically integrated,
[1771.42 → 1774.18] or they're just kind of a brand name
[1774.18 → 1778.00] that has a manufacturer above them.
[1778.18 → 1778.40] So,
[1778.66 → 1778.80] yeah,
[1778.84 → 1781.00] that would be things like Galaxy,
[1781.40 → 1782.06] for example.
[1782.60 → 1782.74] Like,
[1782.96 → 1785.34] Galaxy owns manufacturing,
[1785.52 → 1787.46] even though the Galaxy brand itself
[1787.46 → 1788.22] is just a
[1788.24 → 1788.62] like,
[1788.68 → 1790.30] a fabricated brand
[1790.30 → 1792.08] targeting North America
[1792.08 → 1795.36] for that much larger company.
[1795.58 → 1795.80] Okay.
[1796.80 → 1797.20] So,
[1797.52 → 1798.96] some of them go to OEMs,
[1799.00 → 1800.66] so that would be your Dells of the world.
[1801.34 → 1802.76] Some of them go to special systems,
[1802.84 → 1804.00] so there's your boutique builders.
[1805.66 → 1806.06] Okay.
[1806.24 → 1807.06] From AIB,
[1807.34 → 1808.34] some goes to distribution,
[1808.92 → 1811.12] some goes to...
[1811.12 → 1813.74] Is direct sales supposed to be
[1813.74 → 1814.96] retail and e-tail?
[1815.16 → 1815.34] Well,
[1815.38 → 1816.66] I guess if you're buying off of
[1816.66 → 1818.12] ebga.com instead of
[1818.12 → 1818.92] eweg.com,
[1819.00 → 1819.94] that would be direct sales.
[1819.94 → 1821.78] I think they mean retail.
[1822.48 → 1824.18] I think that's what they actually...
[1824.18 → 1825.56] Or maybe distribution channel
[1825.56 → 1826.46] is meant to be retail?
[1826.52 → 1826.64] Well,
[1826.66 → 1826.80] yeah,
[1826.88 → 1829.00] because New egg is basically retail,
[1829.10 → 1829.28] right?
[1829.34 → 1829.48] So,
[1829.54 → 1829.68] like,
[1829.72 → 1831.14] if you're buying it off of there
[1831.14 → 1832.50] instead of from ebga.com,
[1832.54 → 1832.68] that would be distribution.
[1832.68 → 1832.84] Yeah,
[1832.88 → 1834.18] and there's absolutely...
[1834.18 → 1834.34] Okay,
[1834.42 → 1836.10] so they're saying 10% direct sales.
[1836.22 → 1836.36] Okay,
[1836.44 → 1838.06] so 82%,
[1838.06 → 1838.94] so let's call that
[1838.94 → 1840.48] direct-to-retailer sales
[1840.48 → 1842.86] and distributors like
[1842.86 → 1845.16] D&H and Ingram Micro
[1845.16 → 1846.00] and all that kind of stuff.
[1846.82 → 1847.22] Okay,
[1847.32 → 1848.12] some of the OEMs
[1848.12 → 1848.74] go to embedded
[1848.74 → 1850.48] and special systems suppliers.
[1850.48 → 1851.04] Wait,
[1851.14 → 1851.90] so hold on.
[1851.90 → 1852.62] From special systems
[1852.62 → 1853.28] to direct sales.
[1853.46 → 1854.00] So is this supposed
[1854.00 → 1854.96] to be the consumer,
[1855.12 → 1855.30] maybe?
[1856.90 → 1857.12] Okay,
[1857.16 → 1857.68] I'm not actually...
[1857.68 → 1857.78] No,
[1857.86 → 1859.08] because consumers are here.
[1859.18 → 1859.32] Yeah,
[1859.38 → 1860.44] all the red
[1860.44 → 1861.86] is all going to consumers
[1861.86 → 1862.44] after,
[1862.92 → 1863.36] like,
[1863.42 → 1864.22] once you get to AIB.
[1864.62 → 1865.84] And then distribution channels,
[1866.10 → 1867.00] some goes to enterprise,
[1867.18 → 1867.96] but we don't have percentages
[1867.96 → 1868.44] for that.
[1868.52 → 1869.30] Some goes to government.
[1869.52 → 1869.88] Presumably,
[1869.96 → 1871.10] they need graphics cards, too.
[1871.56 → 1872.70] Does not include workstation.
[1872.86 → 1873.08] Okay,
[1873.44 → 1873.68] okay,
[1873.74 → 1874.80] so the conclusion here
[1874.80 → 1877.52] is approximately 73.8%
[1877.52 → 1879.32] of all graphics AIBS
[1879.32 → 1880.60] end up in gaming PCs,
[1880.98 → 1883.44] which is a very interesting conclusion,
[1883.44 → 1885.36] but I'm not 100% sure
[1885.36 → 1888.18] that I can agree with that,
[1888.34 → 1888.90] necessarily.
[1891.90 → 1893.94] Just because one thing
[1893.94 → 1896.32] that is not tracked that closely
[1896.32 → 1897.48] by Enthusiast Press
[1897.48 → 1898.76] is the sales
[1898.76 → 1900.00] of things like
[1900.00 → 1901.44] GT240s.
[1902.16 → 1902.96] I had
[1902.96 → 1904.94] no idea.
[1905.30 → 1905.42] Like,
[1905.44 → 1906.04] back when I was working
[1906.04 → 1906.68] at NCI
[1906.68 → 1908.24] and I was the product manager
[1908.24 → 1908.94] for Total,
[1910.86 → 1912.22] we weren't selling a lot
[1912.22 → 1912.90] at Total.
[1913.60 → 1914.78] But it turned out
[1914.78 → 1915.34] that
[1915.34 → 1916.36] we were,
[1916.46 → 1916.70] like,
[1917.10 → 1918.12] by far
[1918.12 → 1918.92] the biggest seller
[1918.92 → 1919.40] of, like,
[1919.42 → 1920.26] the high-end stuff.
[1920.62 → 1921.50] And at NCI,
[1921.50 → 1922.62] I was also managing
[1922.62 → 1923.38] MSI
[1923.38 → 1924.00] and VGA
[1924.00 → 1924.48] at the time,
[1924.56 → 1924.98] so I'm seeing,
[1925.08 → 1925.14] like,
[1925.18 → 1926.46] these huge numbers
[1926.46 → 1927.86] on things like,
[1928.06 → 1928.36] you know,
[1928.66 → 1930.82] GTX 680s
[1930.82 → 1931.58] or whatever it would have been
[1931.58 → 1932.00] at the time
[1932.00 → 1933.34] that I was still working there.
[1934.14 → 1934.54] Like,
[1934.62 → 1935.00] huge,
[1935.08 → 1935.60] huge numbers
[1935.60 → 1936.10] on, like,
[1936.18 → 1936.66] $500,
[1936.84 → 1938.12] $600 graphics cards.
[1938.16 → 1938.82] And I'm sitting here going,
[1938.88 → 1939.00] yeah,
[1939.04 → 1940.10] this is a very small revenue number.
[1940.16 → 1940.92] So it turns out,
[1941.42 → 1941.82] you know,
[1942.14 → 1943.08] talking to people
[1943.08 → 1943.70] who know people
[1943.70 → 1944.38] who know people,
[1945.06 → 1946.00] I'm not going to name any names,
[1946.04 → 1946.58] I don't want to throw anyone
[1946.58 → 1947.10] under the bus,
[1947.16 → 1947.46] but, like,
[1948.36 → 1950.26] the kind of numbers
[1950.26 → 1952.24] that a brand like Total,
[1952.80 → 1954.60] where they're basically
[1954.60 → 1955.42] Best Buy exclusive,
[1955.42 → 1956.72] the kind of numbers
[1956.72 → 1957.20] they're doing
[1957.20 → 1958.32] on stupid cards
[1958.32 → 1959.90] like GT730s
[1959.90 → 1961.40] and 610s,
[1961.66 → 1961.76] whatever,
[1962.16 → 1962.94] huge!
[1963.58 → 1963.82] Like,
[1963.98 → 1964.60] huge!
[1965.24 → 1966.34] It blew my mind!
[1966.82 → 1967.10] I'm like,
[1968.08 → 1969.06] maybe I just haven't
[1969.06 → 1969.78] spent enough time
[1969.78 → 1971.30] standing in Best Buy
[1971.30 → 1973.16] by the video card counter,
[1973.74 → 1975.38] watching for people
[1975.38 → 1975.80] to come up
[1975.80 → 1977.12] and try and buy that crap
[1977.12 → 1978.12] so that I can tell them
[1978.12 → 1978.84] to turn around,
[1979.22 → 1979.86] walk away,
[1980.34 → 1981.28] and to be clear,
[1981.38 → 1981.48] like,
[1981.54 → 1982.00] this is something
[1982.00 → 1982.96] a lot of people
[1982.96 → 1984.78] got really confused about
[1984.78 → 1985.84] in the video
[1985.84 → 1986.22] that I made
[1986.22 → 1987.06] a couple of years ago
[1987.06 → 1987.96] called Low End,
[1988.30 → 1989.66] this video card
[1989.66 → 1990.20] is garbage,
[1990.30 → 1990.80] no one buy it
[1990.80 → 1991.42] or something like that.
[1992.06 → 1993.12] I understand
[1993.12 → 1994.76] that some people
[1994.76 → 1995.50] just need
[1995.50 → 1996.60] a basic graphics card
[1996.60 → 1997.50] because their onboard
[1997.50 → 1998.18] video died
[1998.18 → 1998.78] or whatever,
[1999.10 → 1999.62] or they want to
[1999.62 → 2000.36] hook up two monitors.
[2001.06 → 2001.68] I get it.
[2002.24 → 2003.28] The problem
[2003.28 → 2004.36] is that a lot
[2004.36 → 2004.98] of these cards
[2004.98 → 2005.38] are like
[2005.38 → 2006.54] $70, $80,
[2007.34 → 2007.78] $90,
[2007.78 → 2009.42] when,
[2009.66 → 2010.54] if all you need
[2010.54 → 2011.08] is an output,
[2011.72 → 2012.74] you can get those
[2012.74 → 2013.98] for like $30.
[2015.26 → 2016.32] That's my point.
[2016.76 → 2017.54] The point is
[2017.54 → 2019.30] they are priced
[2019.30 → 2020.64] very close
[2020.64 → 2021.12] to cards
[2021.12 → 2022.16] that are legitimately
[2022.16 → 2022.86] good
[2022.86 → 2024.56] to accelerate games
[2024.56 → 2025.34] or video editing
[2025.34 → 2026.62] or any GPU
[2026.62 → 2027.56] accelerated workload.
[2028.20 → 2028.96] They're close,
[2029.12 → 2029.90] but the performance
[2029.90 → 2030.80] is closer
[2030.80 → 2031.88] to the $30 one.
[2031.94 → 2032.78] That's the problem.
[2032.88 → 2033.16] Anyway,
[2034.00 → 2034.90] huge numbers
[2034.90 → 2035.30] of these
[2035.30 → 2036.04] people buy.
[2036.60 → 2037.28] I had no idea.
[2037.78 → 2038.38] I was completely
[2038.38 → 2039.00] ignorant of that.
[2040.64 → 2041.42] But let's say
[2041.42 → 2041.86] for a second
[2041.86 → 2042.50] that their numbers
[2042.50 → 2042.78] are right.
[2042.84 → 2043.24] Let's go back
[2043.24 → 2044.42] to the confusing
[2044.42 → 2044.74] article.
[2045.66 → 2046.40] Based on Steam
[2046.40 → 2046.92] user data,
[2047.02 → 2047.44] we conclude
[2047.44 → 2049.00] that 16.5%
[2049.00 → 2049.92] of desktop machines
[2049.92 → 2050.52] used for gaming
[2050.52 → 2050.92] are using
[2050.92 → 2051.58] Intel integrated
[2051.58 → 2052.06] graphics.
[2052.94 → 2053.92] Southeast Asia,
[2054.10 → 2054.44] that's apparently
[2054.44 → 2055.00] what they're going
[2055.00 → 2055.46] based on,
[2055.52 → 2056.06] represents about
[2056.06 → 2057.18] 6.5%
[2057.18 → 2058.76] of global Steam
[2058.76 → 2059.22] users.
[2059.38 → 2059.70] Steam data
[2059.70 → 2060.04] does not
[2060.04 → 2060.52] differentiate
[2060.52 → 2061.18] desktop from
[2061.18 → 2061.72] notebook graphics.
[2061.84 → 2062.30] It's the same
[2062.30 → 2062.86] percentage to Intel
[2062.86 → 2063.22] for notebooks.
[2064.08 → 2064.76] Based on the
[2064.76 → 2065.60] AMD to Intel
[2065.60 → 2066.48] integrated notebook
[2066.48 → 2067.04] ratio,
[2067.04 → 2068.44] our quarterly
[2068.44 → 2069.72] data collection
[2069.72 → 2070.12] of mobile
[2070.12 → 2070.50] integrated
[2070.50 → 2070.68] ...
[2070.68 → 2070.92] Okay.
[2071.76 → 2072.28] For the past
[2072.28 → 2072.62] seven years,
[2072.72 → 2073.12] the three major
[2073.12 → 2073.78] vendors install
[2073.78 → 2074.78] base for GPUs
[2074.78 → 2075.40] for PC gaming
[2075.40 → 2076.26] declined slowly
[2076.26 → 2076.84] following the
[2076.84 → 2077.76] PC's decline.
[2079.38 → 2080.26] Console data
[2080.26 → 2080.76] something,
[2081.12 → 2081.38] something.
[2081.64 → 2081.78] Okay.
[2081.90 → 2082.40] So eventually,
[2082.76 → 2083.60] we end up with
[2083.60 → 2084.38] GPU gaming
[2084.38 → 2085.12] hardware market
[2085.12 → 2085.94] 30 billion
[2085.94 → 2087.36] PCs something
[2087.36 → 2088.40] consoles.
[2088.40 → 2090.52] Okay.
[2090.82 → 2091.80] So basically,
[2092.04 → 2092.66] the conclusion
[2092.66 → 2093.04] is,
[2093.08 → 2093.52] and it's
[2093.52 → 2095.32] kind of
[2095.32 → 2097.52] cliquey
[2097.52 → 2098.46] sort of
[2098.46 → 2101.32] thought experiment,
[2101.68 → 2102.40] but the conclusion
[2102.40 → 2103.18] is that when
[2103.18 → 2104.58] x86-based gaming
[2104.58 → 2105.22] is examined,
[2106.06 → 2106.88] AMD is the
[2106.88 → 2107.50] clear winner.
[2108.18 → 2108.56] And I was
[2108.56 → 2109.06] kind of looking
[2109.06 → 2109.52] at that going,
[2109.68 → 2110.20] okay,
[2110.44 → 2110.88] I'll see where
[2110.88 → 2111.20] you're going
[2111.20 → 2111.62] with this.
[2111.86 → 2113.22] With x86-based
[2113.22 → 2113.98] machines falling
[2113.98 → 2114.50] into three
[2114.50 → 2115.00] platforms,
[2115.20 → 2115.58] consoles,
[2115.58 → 2116.00] notebooks,
[2116.22 → 2117.28] and desktops.
[2118.82 → 2119.62] When tracking
[2119.62 → 2120.24] equipment,
[2120.40 → 2120.88] they considered
[2120.88 → 2121.62] the installation
[2121.62 → 2122.28] base of the
[2122.28 → 2123.14] latest consoles,
[2123.44 → 2123.96] so the
[2123.96 → 2124.50] Xbox One,
[2124.56 → 2124.76] the Wii,
[2124.80 → 2125.98] and the Wii U,
[2126.22 → 2126.48] and the
[2126.48 → 2127.32] Sony PS4.
[2129.98 → 2131.80] And the
[2131.80 → 2133.94] blah, blah, blah,
[2134.10 → 2134.74] adding boards
[2134.74 → 2135.20] for gaming.
[2137.32 → 2137.84] Yeah.
[2138.48 → 2139.14] So, okay.
[2139.62 → 2139.74] So,
[2140.42 → 2141.74] so there
[2141.74 → 2142.42] you have it.
[2143.44 → 2144.18] PC data.
[2144.18 → 2145.64] Intel is the
[2145.70 → 2146.20] this is the
[2146.20 → 2146.64] conclusion.
[2147.42 → 2148.04] Intel is the
[2148.04 → 2148.66] volume leader
[2148.66 → 2149.18] in integrated
[2149.18 → 2150.16] GPUs and PCs.
[2150.48 → 2151.02] NVIDIA is the
[2151.02 → 2151.34] leader in
[2151.34 → 2152.32] discrete GPUs
[2152.32 → 2153.08] in PC,
[2153.44 → 2154.22] which I get
[2154.22 → 2154.90] was not exactly
[2154.90 → 2155.58] a great mystery
[2155.58 → 2156.06] to anyone.
[2156.46 → 2156.90] Then when you
[2156.90 → 2157.82] look at x86
[2157.82 → 2159.14] as a whole,
[2159.90 → 2160.66] more gamers
[2160.66 → 2161.30] are playing
[2161.30 → 2163.06] on Radeon
[2163.06 → 2163.78] graphics than
[2163.78 → 2164.24] Intel and
[2164.24 → 2165.22] NVIDIA combined.
[2165.70 → 2166.10] Which is not
[2166.10 → 2166.90] strictly speaking
[2166.90 → 2167.18] true,
[2167.24 → 2167.72] because I don't
[2167.72 → 2168.30] believe AMD
[2168.30 → 2168.98] applies their
[2168.98 → 2169.96] Radeon branding
[2169.96 → 2172.10] to console
[2172.10 → 2173.56] products.
[2173.56 → 2173.78] Oh yeah,
[2173.80 → 2174.14] I wonder how
[2174.14 → 2174.80] much of that
[2174.80 → 2176.28] is PS4
[2176.28 → 2177.06] and Xbox
[2177.06 → 2177.44] One.
[2177.58 → 2178.12] I think,
[2179.06 → 2179.74] let me see,
[2179.94 → 2181.56] so this
[2181.56 → 2182.14] says,
[2182.92 → 2183.30] they actually
[2183.30 → 2184.04] call it Radeon
[2184.04 → 2185.34] GCN architecture
[2185.34 → 2186.34] for the Xbox
[2186.34 → 2186.74] One.
[2187.08 → 2187.48] So I don't
[2187.48 → 2188.88] know if they
[2188.88 → 2189.46] put that,
[2189.74 → 2190.30] they stick that
[2190.30 → 2191.02] on the box
[2191.02 → 2191.74] or if Microsoft
[2191.74 → 2192.20] puts that
[2192.20 → 2192.74] anywhere that's
[2192.74 → 2193.24] really visible
[2193.24 → 2193.94] to a consumer,
[2194.34 → 2194.84] but that is
[2194.84 → 2195.30] what I've
[2195.30 → 2195.86] seen.
[2195.86 → 2196.26] So.
[2199.34 → 2200.04] One way to
[2200.04 → 2200.50] find out.
[2200.50 → 2204.30] Here we
[2204.30 → 2204.56] go.
[2204.92 → 2205.38] Oh yeah,
[2205.52 → 2207.74] the shot of
[2207.74 → 2208.34] the chip.
[2208.52 → 2208.62] Yeah,
[2208.66 → 2209.02] let's pull up
[2209.02 → 2209.38] the shot of
[2209.38 → 2209.68] the chip.
[2210.06 → 2210.40] So is that
[2210.40 → 2210.56] it?
[2211.00 → 2211.40] Well,
[2211.64 → 2212.30] that's clearly
[2212.30 → 2212.90] not on an
[2212.90 → 2213.68] Xbox because
[2213.68 → 2214.32] it says Sony
[2214.32 → 2214.72] computer.
[2214.84 → 2214.98] Yeah,
[2215.08 → 2215.52] this is a
[2215.52 → 2217.14] PS4 APU.
[2217.38 → 2217.94] Thank you
[2217.94 → 2218.48] internet.
[2221.48 → 2221.88] Okay,
[2222.20 → 2222.64] so no.
[2223.40 → 2223.96] Are they
[2223.96 → 2224.52] both rocking
[2224.52 → 2225.04] sort of like,
[2225.18 → 2225.38] well,
[2225.56 → 2226.28] the Xbox One
[2226.28 → 2226.80] doesn't have an
[2226.80 → 2227.66] APU style setup,
[2227.76 → 2227.92] does it?
[2227.92 → 2228.68] Like if you
[2228.68 → 2229.40] look at the
[2229.40 → 2229.90] shot of the
[2229.90 → 2230.30] whole board,
[2230.36 → 2231.02] isn't it CPU
[2231.02 → 2231.64] and then GPU
[2231.64 → 2232.24] somewhere else?
[2232.64 → 2232.82] No,
[2232.88 → 2233.26] I thought they
[2233.26 → 2234.02] were both Apus.
[2234.10 → 2234.22] Okay,
[2234.24 → 2234.50] I could be
[2234.50 → 2234.68] wrong,
[2234.72 → 2235.06] I don't know.
[2235.80 → 2236.20] Yeah,
[2236.38 → 2237.06] frankly,
[2237.22 → 2237.64] I don't pay
[2237.64 → 2238.18] as close
[2238.18 → 2239.10] attention to
[2239.10 → 2241.04] console stuff
[2241.04 → 2242.32] as I probably
[2242.32 → 2243.54] should and
[2243.54 → 2244.58] possibly could.
[2245.52 → 2246.12] Speaking of,
[2246.14 → 2246.30] no.
[2246.52 → 2246.66] Yeah,
[2246.70 → 2247.10] you're right.
[2247.34 → 2247.36] Yeah,
[2247.48 → 2247.70] yeah.
[2248.08 → 2248.72] Speaking of
[2248.72 → 2249.14] consoles,
[2249.50 → 2250.60] our PS4 Pro
[2250.60 → 2251.16] arrived.
[2251.30 → 2251.52] Fine.
[2251.78 → 2252.10] How's that
[2252.10 → 2252.28] going?
[2253.32 → 2253.72] Well,
[2253.90 → 2254.72] yeah,
[2255.10 → 2256.04] we're going
[2256.04 → 2256.62] to be getting
[2256.62 → 2257.50] started on that
[2257.50 → 2258.00] very,
[2258.14 → 2258.48] very early
[2258.48 → 2259.08] next week.
[2259.60 → 2260.16] It should be
[2260.16 → 2260.70] quite interesting.
[2260.86 → 2261.28] I appreciate
[2261.28 → 2261.76] you guys'
[2261.94 → 2262.82] great response
[2262.82 → 2263.22] and feedback
[2263.22 → 2263.72] for the
[2263.76 → 2264.42] we did the
[2264.42 → 2265.50] Xbox One S
[2265.50 → 2266.66] versus $500 PC
[2266.66 → 2267.04] video.
[2267.88 → 2268.36] So,
[2268.52 → 2269.06] we look forward
[2269.06 → 2270.52] to bringing
[2270.52 → 2271.06] you something
[2271.06 → 2272.90] else worthy
[2272.90 → 2273.44] of your time
[2273.44 → 2274.30] for the PS4 Pro.
[2274.38 → 2274.78] I'm looking forward
[2274.78 → 2275.14] to getting started
[2275.14 → 2275.80] on that pretty soon.
[2276.28 → 2276.46] Yeah,
[2276.54 → 2276.96] so do you have
[2276.96 → 2277.48] any thoughts
[2277.48 → 2280.12] on some of
[2280.12 → 2281.58] the sort of
[2281.58 → 2282.08] comments on
[2282.08 → 2283.26] PS4 Pro so far?
[2283.36 → 2283.64] Apparently,
[2283.84 → 2285.50] it runs much
[2285.50 → 2286.10] hotter than the
[2286.10 → 2287.42] original PlayStation 4.
[2287.50 → 2288.90] and performance
[2288.90 → 2289.44] doesn't scale
[2289.44 → 2289.78] very well.
[2289.84 → 2290.22] Does that remind
[2290.22 → 2290.64] you of anything?
[2294.54 → 2295.02] Performance
[2295.02 → 2295.62] not scaling
[2295.62 → 2296.28] well and it
[2296.28 → 2297.00] runs hotter.
[2297.66 → 2297.80] Oh,
[2297.88 → 2298.08] yeah.
[2299.56 → 2300.00] Crossfire.
[2301.26 → 2302.26] Dual GPU,
[2302.46 → 2302.48] man.
[2302.48 → 2303.04] Take me a second.
[2303.58 → 2304.32] Dual GPU.
[2304.82 → 2305.42] Would you do
[2305.42 → 2305.60] it?
[2306.64 → 2307.30] Only if I
[2307.30 → 2307.64] needed to.
[2307.88 → 2308.38] Only if I
[2308.38 → 2308.66] needed to.
[2308.76 → 2309.54] Only if,
[2309.78 → 2310.08] like,
[2310.18 → 2311.32] define need.
[2312.04 → 2312.86] Let's say
[2312.86 → 2313.24] that.
[2313.24 → 2313.48] Let's say
[2313.48 → 2314.34] someone had a gun
[2314.34 → 2315.36] to your family's
[2315.36 → 2315.90] head saying,
[2315.90 → 2316.22] if you don't
[2316.22 → 2316.72] put two
[2316.72 → 2317.48] graphics cards
[2317.48 → 2318.96] in your system.
[2319.38 → 2319.80] We're starting
[2319.80 → 2320.06] out with
[2320.06 → 2321.06] excessive violence.
[2321.06 → 2321.28] I mean,
[2321.30 → 2322.08] what is need?
[2322.50 → 2322.92] So,
[2323.12 → 2323.50] for me,
[2323.62 → 2323.90] it's like,
[2324.00 → 2324.72] suppose,
[2325.02 → 2325.36] like,
[2325.44 → 2325.94] I'm walking
[2325.94 → 2326.64] down the street
[2326.64 → 2327.14] and I happen
[2327.14 → 2327.60] to find,
[2327.68 → 2327.92] like,
[2327.98 → 2328.18] oh,
[2328.26 → 2328.62] here's an
[2328.62 → 2329.18] ultra-wide
[2329.18 → 2329.58] monitor,
[2329.72 → 2329.90] or,
[2330.00 → 2330.28] oh,
[2330.58 → 2331.20] Linus is just
[2331.20 → 2331.72] giving me
[2331.72 → 2333.18] two 4K screens
[2333.18 → 2333.66] he doesn't need
[2333.66 → 2334.12] anymore because
[2334.12 → 2334.52] he's such a
[2334.52 → 2335.20] nice guy.
[2335.50 → 2335.64] You know,
[2335.72 → 2336.04] so,
[2336.42 → 2336.82] wow,
[2336.94 → 2337.40] keep trying,
[2337.50 → 2337.66] John.
[2337.66 → 2338.78] if I just
[2338.78 → 2339.22] want,
[2339.36 → 2341.12] I have no need
[2341.12 → 2341.78] for dual 4K
[2341.78 → 2342.02] screens,
[2342.06 → 2342.32] but anyway,
[2342.62 → 2344.68] if I was
[2344.68 → 2346.10] in a situation
[2346.10 → 2347.18] where I have
[2347.18 → 2347.56] some sort of
[2347.56 → 2348.06] setup in front
[2348.06 → 2348.40] of me that I
[2348.40 → 2348.74] want to take
[2348.74 → 2349.48] full advantage
[2349.48 → 2350.36] of where I'm
[2350.36 → 2350.50] like,
[2350.60 → 2350.76] oh,
[2350.88 → 2351.04] well,
[2351.22 → 2352.12] this won't be
[2352.12 → 2353.10] smooth unless
[2353.10 → 2353.72] I do the
[2353.72 → 2354.30] dual GPU,
[2354.80 → 2355.42] then I would
[2355.42 → 2356.14] go for it.
[2356.46 → 2356.78] But,
[2357.10 → 2357.54] again,
[2357.74 → 2358.06] that's not
[2358.06 → 2358.44] something,
[2358.68 → 2359.06] it's not
[2359.06 → 2359.52] something that
[2359.52 → 2360.20] I'm going to
[2360.20 → 2361.00] be looking to
[2361.00 → 2361.26] do in my
[2361.26 → 2361.76] personal rig
[2361.76 → 2362.02] or anything
[2362.02 → 2362.48] like that.
[2362.58 → 2362.78] So,
[2362.90 → 2363.34] just not worth
[2363.34 → 2363.48] it.
[2364.16 → 2364.40] Yeah.
[2364.52 → 2364.88] At least in
[2364.88 → 2365.32] my opinion.
[2366.36 → 2366.72] Okay,
[2366.72 → 2369.04] let's actually,
[2369.16 → 2369.28] oh,
[2369.36 → 2369.70] you know what
[2369.70 → 2369.98] we should
[2369.98 → 2370.52] probably do
[2370.52 → 2370.94] is got back
[2370.94 → 2371.24] to that
[2371.24 → 2371.96] straw poll
[2371.96 → 2372.36] that we
[2372.36 → 2373.14] promised to
[2373.14 → 2373.68] bring everyone
[2373.68 → 2374.04] the results.
[2374.10 → 2375.42] 13% for yes.
[2375.58 → 2375.72] So,
[2375.94 → 2377.58] 13% of our,
[2377.68 → 2378.32] at that time,
[2378.40 → 2379.56] about 5,000
[2379.56 → 2381.10] viewers knew
[2381.10 → 2382.04] someone who
[2382.04 → 2382.48] bought one
[2382.48 → 2382.82] already.
[2383.58 → 2383.76] So,
[2383.90 → 2384.54] let's say,
[2384.62 → 2385.24] let's say for
[2385.24 → 2385.74] the sake of
[2385.74 → 2387.52] argument that,
[2388.74 → 2389.78] let's do some
[2389.78 → 2390.52] GFX,
[2390.70 → 2391.20] whatever that
[2391.20 → 2391.66] site was
[2391.66 → 2391.96] called,
[2392.06 → 2392.34] math.
[2393.20 → 2393.52] So,
[2393.74 → 2394.28] so,
[2394.28 → 2394.30] so,
[2394.30 → 2396.30] 300,
[2396.72 → 2397.40] million.
[2397.86 → 2398.02] Now,
[2398.04 → 2398.34] it's actually
[2398.34 → 2398.86] closer to like
[2398.86 → 2399.72] 330 million,
[2399.80 → 2399.96] right?
[2401.20 → 2401.44] Oh,
[2401.50 → 2401.94] people of the
[2401.94 → 2402.10] US?
[2402.24 → 2402.44] Yeah.
[2402.54 → 2402.84] I think it's
[2402.84 → 2403.36] like 320,
[2403.58 → 2404.48] 320 million.
[2404.60 → 2404.82] Whatever,
[2404.98 → 2405.42] let's assume,
[2405.50 → 2405.88] let's assume
[2405.88 → 2406.26] there are 10
[2406.26 → 2406.72] million in
[2406.72 → 2406.98] Canada.
[2408.38 → 2408.78] Okay.
[2408.98 → 2409.36] There's 1
[2409.36 → 2409.78] million in
[2409.78 → 2410.02] Canada.
[2410.78 → 2411.38] Divided by
[2411.38 → 2412.94] 5,000.
[2413.96 → 2414.40] Okay.
[2415.06 → 2415.54] So,
[2416.10 → 2417.42] hold on.
[2417.56 → 2417.82] So,
[2417.92 → 2418.18] hold on.
[2418.22 → 2418.62] Divided by
[2418.62 → 2419.48] 5,000.
[2419.48 → 2419.88] So,
[2420.04 → 2420.54] that means
[2420.54 → 2421.66] times,
[2421.90 → 2423.26] times 13%.
[2423.26 → 2425.00] I've actually
[2425.00 → 2425.82] lost myself
[2425.82 → 2426.96] with what I'm
[2426.96 → 2427.48] doing here.
[2427.76 → 2428.32] Hold on a
[2428.32 → 2428.50] second.
[2428.68 → 2429.12] Maybe try
[2429.12 → 2429.44] again.
[2429.56 → 2429.84] What are you
[2429.84 → 2430.22] trying to do
[2430.22 → 2430.58] exactly?
[2430.70 → 2431.24] I'm trying to
[2431.24 → 2431.72] figure out how
[2431.72 → 2432.14] many people
[2432.14 → 2432.98] bought MacBooks,
[2433.82 → 2434.46] MacBook Pros.
[2434.60 → 2434.72] Well,
[2434.80 → 2435.48] there's also the
[2435.48 → 2436.12] fact that the
[2436.12 → 2436.72] 13%...
[2436.72 → 2438.16] Oh,
[2438.16 → 2438.72] well,
[2438.82 → 2440.02] the 13% of
[2440.02 → 2440.58] our viewers,
[2440.82 → 2441.22] they're also
[2441.22 → 2441.82] skewed because
[2441.82 → 2442.42] we have a more
[2442.42 → 2443.00] tech-oriented
[2443.00 → 2443.44] audience,
[2443.56 → 2443.94] so they're more
[2443.94 → 2444.50] likely to know
[2444.50 → 2444.80] someone that
[2444.80 → 2445.20] bought a MacBook.
[2445.26 → 2445.40] So,
[2445.46 → 2445.94] Apple has
[2445.94 → 2448.40] sold 42,900,000
[2448.40 → 2452.26] MacBook Pros
[2452.26 → 2453.12] so far in the
[2453.12 → 2453.66] US alone.
[2453.72 → 2454.08] The numbers
[2454.08 → 2454.58] don't lie.
[2454.66 → 2455.08] You heard it
[2455.08 → 2455.60] here first,
[2455.72 → 2456.00] folks.
[2456.72 → 2457.36] According to
[2457.36 → 2458.08] my terrible,
[2458.28 → 2458.88] terrible
[2458.88 → 2459.56] calculator
[2459.56 → 2460.72] mouse math,
[2462.38 → 2463.16] indisputable.
[2463.56 → 2464.00] Indisputable.
[2465.48 → 2465.84] Oh,
[2465.92 → 2466.38] you know what?
[2466.86 → 2467.04] Shoot,
[2467.26 → 2468.24] we should do
[2468.24 → 2468.64] our sponsors
[2468.64 → 2469.36] for the day.
[2470.04 → 2470.44] Are you going

[2473.44 → 2473.72] it's okay.
[2473.78 → 2474.04] I'll do it.
[2474.10 → 2474.28] Oh,
[2474.38 → 2474.58] well,

[2474.96 → 2475.84] I put the

[2476.66 → 2476.96] time.

[2531.14 → 2532.20] your first purchase.
[2532.20 → 2532.60] Squarespace.
[2533.02 → 2533.56] Right there.
[2533.64 → 2534.10] That's where it
[2534.10 → 2534.28] is.
[2534.42 → 2535.30] Well, that's the
[2535.30 → 2535.60] URL.
[2536.50 → 2537.26] Yeah, there we
[2537.26 → 2537.48] go.
[2537.94 → 2538.40] I actually don't
[2538.40 → 2539.16] think it matters.
[2539.34 → 2539.88] Does it matter if
[2539.88 → 2540.44] they use our URL?
[2541.84 → 2542.46] Ask Nick.
[2542.56 → 2543.16] I don't handle the
[2543.16 → 2543.34] money.
[2544.78 → 2545.52] I don't know.
[2545.68 → 2546.22] But yes,
[2546.32 → 2547.30] Squarespace, I
[2547.30 → 2547.80] don't think they
[2547.80 → 2548.48] have a catchy
[2548.48 → 2549.64] slogan right now.
[2549.76 → 2550.50] Are you sure?
[2551.06 → 2551.60] I don't know.
[2552.82 → 2553.96] Can we find out?
[2554.38 → 2556.16] Are slogans just
[2556.16 → 2557.00] like too mainstream
[2557.00 → 2558.38] for Squarespace now?
[2558.58 → 2559.36] I don't think so.
[2559.64 → 2560.40] Slogans are never
[2560.40 → 2560.98] too mainstream.
[2560.98 → 2561.76] Do we have a
[2561.76 → 2562.26] company slogan?
[2563.22 → 2563.74] What's our
[2563.74 → 2564.24] company slogan?
[2564.34 → 2565.18] I have no idea.
[2565.32 → 2566.02] Let's go to our
[2566.02 → 2566.92] Squarespace site.
[2570.50 → 2571.06] Uh-oh.
[2571.44 → 2572.14] Oh, crap.
[2572.26 → 2572.84] We screwed up
[2572.84 → 2574.20] our DNS settings.
[2576.60 → 2578.22] Oh, no, no, no,
[2578.32 → 2578.48] no.
[2578.52 → 2578.92] I screwed up
[2578.92 → 2579.78] my typing settings.
[2581.20 → 2581.94] Well, that was
[2581.94 → 2583.12] almost really awkward.
[2583.26 → 2583.90] I was about to
[2583.90 → 2584.34] say, are we going
[2584.34 → 2585.18] to have to try
[2585.18 → 2586.60] a live DNS flush
[2586.60 → 2587.64] and then hope
[2587.64 → 2588.44] that it works?
[2589.66 → 2590.72] What we do
[2590.72 → 2592.90] our team
[2592.90 → 2596.94] logo designed
[2596.94 → 2597.62] at some point
[2597.62 → 2598.22] for the company
[2598.22 → 2598.92] as a placeholder
[2598.92 → 2599.92] but never changed?
[2600.04 → 2600.74] Is that a slogan?
[2601.84 → 2602.20] Sure.
[2602.68 → 2603.72] I think it's fine.
[2604.64 → 2605.54] We don't even have
[2605.54 → 2606.34] Channel Super Fun
[2606.34 → 2606.72] on here.
[2607.66 → 2608.18] It could just be
[2608.18 → 2608.34] called,
[2608.46 → 2609.48] our slogan could just
[2609.48 → 2610.10] be down the street
[2610.10 → 2610.66] from Tim Hortons.
[2610.72 → 2611.04] You know what's
[2611.04 → 2611.72] the worst part?
[2611.86 → 2612.06] Mm-hmm.
[2612.06 → 2620.62] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[2620.74 → 2621.34] We are missing
[2621.34 → 2622.32] literally a third
[2622.32 → 2622.90] of our company.
[2623.34 → 2623.68] Yes.
[2623.86 → 2624.62] 10 is clearly
[2624.62 → 2625.58] a smaller number
[2625.58 → 2626.36] than 15.
[2626.60 → 2627.00] Yep.
[2628.16 → 2629.10] I don't even need
[2629.10 → 2629.58] a calculator
[2629.58 → 2630.24] to know that.
[2631.24 → 2632.54] So there's that.
[2632.66 → 2633.16] So Squarespace,
[2633.96 → 2634.76] whoops,
[2635.44 → 2636.20] sorry, we're back.
[2636.20 → 2637.12] So Squarespace
[2637.12 → 2638.72] can't make
[2638.72 → 2639.52] your site
[2639.52 → 2640.46] updated
[2640.46 → 2642.44] unless you actually
[2642.44 → 2643.22] do something.
[2643.34 → 2644.06] No, Squarespace
[2644.06 → 2645.46] does not offer
[2645.46 → 2646.54] a team of riders,
[2646.68 → 2647.04] unfortunately,
[2647.16 → 2647.70] for your website.
[2647.82 → 2648.22] You have to do
[2648.22 → 2648.70] that yourself.
[2648.82 → 2649.78] But all this other stuff,
[2649.96 → 2650.56] yes, they will take
[2650.56 → 2651.18] care of that for you.
[2651.32 → 2651.80] All right.
[2651.90 → 2653.20] And on that note,
[2653.66 → 2654.28] FreshBooks.
[2654.92 → 2655.80] FreshBooks is the
[2655.80 → 2656.56] easy-to-use
[2656.56 → 2657.54] invoicing software
[2657.54 → 2658.24] that helps small
[2658.24 → 2659.34] businesses look
[2659.34 → 2659.94] professional
[2659.94 → 2661.46] and get paid faster.
[2661.62 → 2662.04] And it's funny
[2662.04 → 2662.62] that that's my
[2662.62 → 2663.26] talking points
[2663.26 → 2663.76] because it does
[2663.76 → 2664.44] more than just
[2664.44 → 2665.06] help you look
[2665.06 → 2665.62] professional
[2665.62 → 2667.26] to have a professional
[2667.26 → 2667.98] looking invoice.
[2668.22 → 2669.68] It's about actually
[2669.68 → 2670.86] being professional,
[2671.18 → 2672.48] like billing accurately,
[2672.70 → 2673.60] billing on time,
[2673.74 → 2674.38] tracking hours,
[2674.52 → 2675.38] tracking expenses,
[2676.00 → 2677.88] all that stuff.
[2678.20 → 2678.86] Being able
[2678.86 → 2680.28] to accept deposits
[2680.28 → 2681.46] and then take
[2681.46 → 2682.50] the rest of it
[2682.50 → 2683.82] on your own schedule,
[2683.98 → 2685.12] being able to see
[2685.12 → 2686.10] when the people
[2686.10 → 2686.94] that you're working with,
[2687.00 → 2687.68] whether it's
[2687.68 → 2688.80] someone who's
[2688.80 → 2689.68] taking weekly
[2689.68 → 2690.50] dance lessons
[2690.50 → 2691.20] in your garage
[2691.20 → 2691.78] or whether it's
[2691.78 → 2692.32] someone who
[2692.32 → 2693.30] you did a plumbing
[2693.30 → 2694.02] job for,
[2694.16 → 2694.56] or whether it's
[2694.56 → 2694.88] someone you're
[2694.88 → 2695.46] doing small-time
[2695.46 → 2696.16] IT work.
[2696.40 → 2697.06] I always come up
[2697.06 → 2697.70] with the same ones.
[2697.76 → 2698.24] Help me come up
[2698.24 → 2698.82] with something else.
[2698.90 → 2699.74] What do small
[2699.74 → 2700.64] business owners do?
[2702.02 → 2703.34] They need people
[2703.34 → 2705.58] to run a leaf blower
[2705.58 → 2706.74] apparently at 8 in the
[2706.74 → 2707.44] morning when everyone's
[2707.44 → 2707.90] trying to sleep
[2707.90 → 2708.54] because that's what
[2708.54 → 2709.30] happens outside my
[2709.30 → 2710.18] place every Wednesday.
[2711.08 → 2712.04] So if you run a
[2712.04 → 2713.22] small-time leaf blowing
[2713.22 → 2713.68] business,
[2713.82 → 2716.14] then FreshBooks,
[2716.62 → 2717.38] even if you're not
[2717.38 → 2718.04] a numbers' person,
[2718.12 → 2718.76] lets you keep track
[2718.76 → 2719.60] of all that stuff
[2719.60 → 2720.92] and run a more
[2720.92 → 2722.34] efficient business
[2722.34 → 2723.10] so you can spend
[2723.10 → 2723.76] your time making
[2723.76 → 2724.54] money instead of
[2724.54 → 2725.38] spending your time
[2725.38 → 2726.96] figuring out money
[2726.96 → 2728.24] in accounting software.
[2728.36 → 2728.88] That's confusing.
[2729.54 → 2731.00] So head over to
[2731.00 → 2731.98] freshbooks.com
[2731.98 → 2732.54] slash when,
[2732.66 → 2733.44] claim your free trial
[2733.44 → 2733.80] today,
[2733.92 → 2734.62] and take advantage
[2734.62 → 2735.94] of their...
[2735.94 → 2737.26] Oh, I actually
[2737.26 → 2737.64] don't know what
[2737.64 → 2738.44] the hours of it are.
[2738.88 → 2739.44] Well, it's okay
[2739.44 → 2740.06] because you can
[2740.06 → 2740.66] take advantage
[2740.66 → 2741.34] of the fact that
[2741.34 → 2742.34] they now offer
[2742.34 → 2743.52] a mobile card reader.
[2743.98 → 2744.30] Oh, yeah.
[2744.58 → 2745.10] They do have that.
[2745.10 → 2745.96] No, I was going
[2745.96 → 2746.72] to say take advantage
[2746.72 → 2747.64] of their tech support
[2747.64 → 2748.28] so you can just
[2748.28 → 2748.80] call them.
[2748.98 → 2749.36] You can call
[2749.36 → 2750.00] their support staff.
[2750.10 → 2750.90] There's no phone tree,
[2751.30 → 2752.08] no return calls.
[2752.16 → 2752.68] You just call them,
[2752.76 → 2753.40] ask them any questions
[2753.40 → 2753.90] you have,
[2754.30 → 2755.54] and then go to
[2755.54 → 2756.46] freshbooks.com
[2756.46 → 2757.30] slash when and enter
[2757.30 → 2757.88] when in the
[2757.88 → 2758.32] how did you hear
[2758.32 → 2759.04] about us section
[2759.04 → 2760.28] to sign up
[2760.28 → 2760.90] for your free trial.
[2761.24 → 2762.18] No escalations.
[2762.30 → 2763.04] That's pretty key.
[2763.48 → 2764.72] Like, let's escalate
[2764.72 → 2765.44] this to someone else
[2765.44 → 2766.00] who doesn't know
[2766.00 → 2766.76] what the answer is.
[2766.84 → 2767.48] Like, that's horrible.
[2767.60 → 2768.14] I'm glad they have
[2768.14 → 2768.84] no escalations.
[2769.90 → 2770.42] You never had that
[2770.42 → 2770.88] happen to you?
[2770.94 → 2772.16] Like, when you call
[2772.16 → 2773.06] tech support for something
[2773.06 → 2775.06] and then they escalate
[2775.06 → 2775.80] to a manager
[2775.80 → 2776.60] but they also have
[2776.60 → 2777.36] no idea what's going on.
[2777.38 → 2777.90] Oh, I thought you were
[2777.90 → 2778.54] going somewhere else
[2778.54 → 2778.84] with that.
[2778.88 → 2779.24] I thought you were
[2779.24 → 2779.52] going to say
[2779.52 → 2780.38] no escalations.
[2780.48 → 2780.88] So what's that?
[2780.96 → 2781.36] So if they don't
[2781.36 → 2781.86] know the answer
[2781.86 → 2782.60] they just hang up?
[2785.32 → 2786.20] I'm not going to ask
[2786.20 → 2787.00] stupid questions
[2787.00 → 2787.80] about the sponsor
[2787.80 → 2788.68] during the sponsor spot.
[2788.78 → 2789.22] Give me a little bit
[2789.22 → 2789.48] of credit.
[2790.52 → 2791.30] It's more credit
[2791.30 → 2791.78] than I get.
[2792.42 → 2793.00] More credit
[2793.00 → 2793.56] than I deserve,
[2793.64 → 2793.94] I think.
[2794.16 → 2794.48] Wow.
[2795.52 → 2796.18] All right.
[2796.32 → 2797.06] So speaking of
[2797.06 → 2797.64] more credit
[2797.64 → 2798.56] than they deserve.
[2798.56 → 2799.58] Positive work environment.
[2799.78 → 2800.10] Come on.
[2800.76 → 2801.84] Forget Mars.
[2803.06 → 2804.06] President Trump.
[2804.44 → 2805.34] President-elect Trump.
[2805.48 → 2806.34] President-elect Trump,
[2806.40 → 2807.20] which is not the same.
[2807.88 → 2809.06] Although he did settle
[2809.06 → 2810.10] the Trump U suit.
[2810.10 → 2810.76] I heard about that.
[2810.94 → 2811.12] Yep.
[2811.22 → 2811.76] So he settled it
[2811.76 → 2812.52] for $25 million
[2812.52 → 2813.24] in spite of saying
[2813.24 → 2814.18] he wouldn't settle it
[2814.18 → 2816.70] and that it was
[2816.70 → 2817.46] a bunch of nonsense.
[2817.68 → 2818.84] Listen to your lawyers, folks.
[2819.36 → 2819.64] Yep.
[2819.74 → 2820.58] They're trying to help you.
[2820.78 → 2821.76] They're trying to help you.
[2822.24 → 2823.06] In this case,
[2823.12 → 2824.70] they probably helped him
[2824.70 → 2826.14] hold on to the presidency
[2826.14 → 2827.26] because settling
[2827.26 → 2827.92] was definitely
[2827.92 → 2828.80] the better option here.
[2831.06 → 2831.86] Forget Mars.
[2831.86 → 2832.74] Trump wants NASA
[2832.74 → 2834.58] to visit Jupiter's moon Europa
[2834.58 → 2836.96] and explore the solar system.
[2837.80 → 2838.60] So that's good,
[2838.68 → 2839.60] but it's only talked
[2839.60 → 2840.60] until there's actually
[2840.60 → 2842.26] like a, you know,
[2842.60 → 2844.14] check that gets written.
[2844.28 → 2845.52] But his new space plan
[2845.52 → 2846.60] focuses on promoting
[2846.60 → 2848.72] a private-public partnership
[2848.72 → 2850.30] as well as setting
[2850.30 → 2851.84] ambitious goals for NASA.
[2852.68 → 2854.00] Trump plans to bring back
[2854.00 → 2855.46] the National Space Council,
[2856.06 → 2856.94] last in operation
[2856.94 → 2858.46] under George H.W. Bush,
[2858.58 → 2859.24] with the goals
[2859.24 → 2860.72] to explore deep space
[2860.72 → 2861.92] and encourage
[2861.92 → 2862.66] commercial partners
[2862.66 → 2864.14] to build a new economy
[2864.14 → 2865.44] in low-Earth orbit.
[2866.26 → 2867.10] The Space Council
[2867.10 → 2867.64] would be headed
[2867.64 → 2868.56] by the vice president.
[2870.30 → 2871.64] So does Mike Pence
[2871.64 → 2873.22] have like space credentials?
[2875.10 → 2875.66] I hope so.
[2875.78 → 2876.32] I actually,
[2876.50 → 2877.46] I hadn't read the notes
[2877.46 → 2878.02] on this one.
[2879.12 → 2880.46] Space credentials,
[2881.08 → 2882.64] Mike Pence.
[2882.64 → 2883.54] Let's have a look here.
[2883.76 → 2884.54] Well, he used to be
[2884.54 → 2885.72] governor of Indiana,
[2885.72 → 2887.00] and that is a state
[2887.00 → 2887.88] that at one point
[2887.88 → 2889.98] tried to set the value
[2889.98 → 2891.68] of pi to be exactly three
[2891.68 → 2892.96] by legislative fiat.
[2894.56 → 2895.54] So that happened.
[2895.90 → 2896.56] That was a long time ago
[2896.56 → 2896.84] to be fair.
[2896.86 → 2897.38] We've actually got
[2897.38 → 2898.44] a lot of articles here
[2898.44 → 2901.06] for missing credentials.
[2903.36 → 2904.56] I like how you actually
[2904.56 → 2905.84] googled space credentials.
[2907.04 → 2907.88] I said that
[2907.88 → 2909.32] in the worst possible way,
[2909.54 → 2910.08] but you went with
[2910.08 → 2910.80] the space credentials.
[2911.82 → 2912.94] Well, I'm not showing off
[2912.94 → 2914.02] my Google foo right now
[2914.02 → 2915.96] because I really don't
[2915.96 → 2917.04] think he has a degree
[2917.04 → 2917.66] in astrology.
[2917.98 → 2919.42] No, I'm just giving
[2919.42 → 2919.96] it is a hard time.
[2920.20 → 2920.90] It's fine.
[2921.00 → 2921.74] And that was intentional,
[2921.88 → 2922.20] by the way.
[2922.26 → 2922.80] I know astrology
[2922.80 → 2923.62] is not astronomy.
[2923.90 → 2924.04] Oh.
[2925.96 → 2926.98] I didn't even catch that.
[2928.38 → 2929.40] What's your sign, Linus?
[2930.12 → 2930.92] What's my sign?
[2931.68 → 2932.08] Stop.
[2934.02 → 2934.60] That's how you,
[2934.72 → 2937.02] that's the counter
[2937.02 → 2938.12] to that pickup line.
[2938.84 → 2939.54] What's your sign?
[2939.66 → 2940.18] Stop sign.
[2940.44 → 2940.96] But I'm not trying
[2940.96 → 2941.62] to pick you up.
[2941.96 → 2942.56] How do I know?
[2944.02 → 2945.70] I mean,
[2945.72 → 2946.44] it's not the first time
[2946.44 → 2946.86] that's happened
[2946.86 → 2947.48] on the LAN show,
[2947.60 → 2948.50] so, you know,
[2948.80 → 2949.46] just saying.
[2949.62 → 2950.08] Do we need to have
[2950.08 → 2950.74] a chat with Luke
[2950.74 → 2951.74] about workplace boundaries?
[2952.84 → 2953.64] We need to have a chat
[2953.64 → 2954.86] with me about workplace boundaries.
[2954.98 → 2956.12] We really, really do.
[2956.26 → 2956.58] All right,
[2956.66 → 2958.30] so the Space Council
[2958.30 → 2958.64] would be headed
[2958.64 → 2959.50] by the Vice President.
[2960.04 → 2961.02] He also has plans
[2961.02 → 2962.68] to abandon climate research,
[2962.88 → 2963.98] transfer Earth monitoring
[2963.98 → 2964.94] funding from NASA
[2964.94 → 2966.42] to NOAA,
[2966.76 → 2967.60] and strengthen
[2967.60 → 2968.66] the U.S. military's
[2968.66 → 2969.68] stance in orbit.
[2970.42 → 2971.08] Reminds me a bit
[2971.08 → 2971.70] of what Reagan
[2971.70 → 2972.20] was trying to do
[2972.20 → 2972.70] with the SDI
[2972.70 → 2973.48] back in the 80s,
[2973.52 → 2974.18] like a little bit.
[2974.24 → 2974.98] It's not the same thing,
[2975.06 → 2975.32] obviously.
[2975.54 → 2975.96] I actually,
[2976.38 → 2977.10] I had,
[2977.20 → 2978.28] I have never followed,
[2980.12 → 2981.34] and you know what?
[2981.48 → 2981.92] I think,
[2982.16 → 2983.06] if nothing else,
[2983.56 → 2984.82] this is a testament
[2984.82 → 2986.28] to the effectiveness
[2986.28 → 2988.00] of reality TV,
[2988.40 → 2992.68] and the incredible concoction,
[2992.82 → 2994.34] more potent than cocaine,
[2994.60 → 2994.82] heroin,
[2994.90 → 2995.84] and meth combined,
[2996.10 → 2998.44] that it has turned out to be
[2998.44 → 2999.82] ever since Survivor
[2999.82 → 3000.88] burst onto the scene
[3000.88 → 3002.06] a bazillion years ago.
[3002.90 → 3004.96] But I have never followed
[3004.96 → 3006.60] U.S. politics before
[3006.60 → 3007.44] in my life,
[3007.62 → 3009.24] other than being vaguely aware
[3009.24 → 3011.30] that, like, Obama
[3011.30 → 3011.88] or something
[3011.88 → 3013.20] was president.
[3013.58 → 3014.10] Yeah, hope and change
[3014.10 → 3014.26] or something.
[3014.26 → 3015.60] And he wasn't an old white man
[3015.60 → 3017.30] for the first time ever.
[3017.42 → 3018.18] Which is surprising
[3018.18 → 3019.50] because all I heard
[3019.50 → 3020.52] was Canadians follow
[3020.52 → 3021.34] our politics more
[3021.34 → 3022.02] than your own.
[3022.12 → 3022.68] I don't know if that's true.
[3022.74 → 3023.60] Oh, I still followed it.
[3023.60 → 3024.84] I followed it more
[3024.84 → 3025.32] than my own.
[3026.08 → 3026.48] Anyway,
[3027.32 → 3028.62] until Trump,
[3029.04 → 3030.36] I had never really followed it.
[3030.40 → 3031.28] Now, all of a sudden,
[3031.64 → 3032.34] I'm like,
[3032.62 → 3033.48] I'm reading about
[3033.48 → 3034.58] congressional races,
[3034.92 → 3035.90] and I'm reading about
[3035.90 → 3037.24] what some weird senator
[3037.24 → 3038.52] in wherever the crap is,
[3038.58 → 3038.88] Stan,
[3039.38 → 3040.36] was doing.
[3040.56 → 3040.82] And, like,
[3040.82 → 3041.24] all of a sudden,
[3041.28 → 3041.74] I have, like,
[3041.76 → 3043.08] this interest
[3043.08 → 3044.36] in American politics.
[3045.14 → 3046.30] So I have no idea
[3046.30 → 3046.90] what Reagan tried
[3046.90 → 3047.58] to do in the 80s.
[3047.62 → 3048.06] And if you,
[3048.50 → 3049.92] if you want to enlighten me,
[3049.96 → 3051.00] then go ahead.
[3051.66 → 3052.02] Basically,
[3053.50 → 3054.26] so talking about
[3054.26 → 3054.70] building stuff
[3054.70 → 3055.74] in low Earth orbit,
[3056.32 → 3056.84] SDI,
[3057.10 → 3058.36] the Strategic Defence Initiative,
[3058.58 → 3059.54] it was to have,
[3059.60 → 3060.16] I believe,
[3060.62 → 3061.54] weapons placed
[3061.54 → 3062.44] in low Earth orbit
[3062.44 → 3063.20] to sort of
[3063.20 → 3064.04] counter the Soviets.
[3064.22 → 3064.78] Everyone called it
[3064.78 → 3065.24] Star Wars.
[3065.28 → 3065.74] So basically,
[3065.74 → 3066.28] it's an episode
[3066.28 → 3067.28] of Ani maniacs.
[3069.98 → 3070.38] Oh,
[3071.20 → 3071.66] Pinky and the Brain.
[3071.68 → 3072.30] Pinky and the Brain.
[3072.38 → 3073.54] Why did I think Ani maniacs?
[3073.66 → 3074.04] Wow, I was thinking like...
[3074.04 → 3074.34] Well, no,
[3074.46 → 3075.34] it's because it started
[3075.34 → 3076.26] as a segment
[3076.26 → 3077.44] on Ani maniacs,
[3077.50 → 3078.04] and then it became
[3078.04 → 3078.48] its own show
[3078.48 → 3080.56] later on, so...
[3080.56 → 3081.16] Didn't know that,
[3081.22 → 3081.74] but thank you.
[3081.78 → 3082.78] That was a great recovery
[3082.78 → 3083.26] for me.
[3083.40 → 3084.06] You're hired.
[3084.88 → 3085.16] Again.
[3085.46 → 3086.52] Oh, I see what you did there
[3086.52 → 3087.26] because of the apprentice.
[3087.54 → 3087.66] Yeah.
[3088.54 → 3089.42] No, I didn't.
[3089.74 → 3090.74] Oh, oh, well...
[3090.74 → 3091.60] You're making me look...
[3091.60 → 3092.88] I'm making you look great.
[3092.90 → 3093.74] You're making me look like
[3093.74 → 3095.22] there are so many layers
[3095.22 → 3096.52] to what I'm saying.
[3096.60 → 3097.32] This is awesome.
[3097.60 → 3098.00] Let's see.
[3098.22 → 3099.66] Proposed missile defence system
[3099.66 → 3100.64] intended to protect
[3100.64 → 3102.00] the U.S.
[3102.04 → 3102.80] from attack by
[3102.80 → 3103.90] ballistic strategic
[3103.90 → 3104.74] nuclear weapons
[3104.74 → 3105.84] such as ICBMs
[3105.84 → 3106.60] from the Soviets.
[3106.60 → 3107.86] So, this was
[3107.86 → 3109.32] proposed back
[3109.32 → 3110.54] in the mid-80s.
[3111.24 → 3112.28] I think détente
[3112.28 → 3112.66] and all that
[3112.66 → 3113.22] was happening,
[3113.36 → 3113.90] but the Cold War
[3113.90 → 3114.70] was still going on,
[3114.82 → 3115.86] and so Reagan was like,
[3116.08 → 3116.90] hey, why don't we
[3116.90 → 3117.76] just put countermeasures
[3117.76 → 3118.28] in space?
[3118.42 → 3119.68] And he was serious
[3119.68 → 3120.02] about it,
[3120.04 → 3120.76] but I think the funding
[3120.76 → 3121.26] wasn't there.
[3121.58 → 3122.48] It didn't happen,
[3122.74 → 3123.64] but, you know...
[3123.64 → 3124.30] But, yeah.
[3124.48 → 3125.18] So, it was a little bit
[3125.18 → 3125.72] before my time,
[3125.80 → 3126.60] obviously, but...
[3127.20 → 3127.50] Cool.
[3127.74 → 3128.10] All right.
[3128.46 → 3129.18] Let's move on.
[3129.18 → 3129.40] There we go.
[3129.40 → 3129.92] This was posted
[3129.92 → 3132.86] by Good Tofu Friday
[3132.86 → 3133.94] on the forum.
[3134.06 → 3134.66] The original article
[3134.66 → 3137.20] is from MaxConsole.com.
[3137.28 → 3138.22] Good Tofu Friday.
[3138.42 → 3139.34] Which sounds like
[3139.34 → 3141.72] an amazing, like,
[3141.72 → 3143.62] PlayStation superhero
[3143.62 → 3144.22] or something.
[3145.58 → 3145.84] So,
[3146.70 → 3148.04] at NMTW
[3148.04 → 3148.80] has tweeted out
[3148.80 → 3149.74] the first picture
[3149.74 → 3151.58] of a PS4 Pro console
[3151.58 → 3152.88] melting down...
[3152.88 → 3153.42] That is just
[3153.42 → 3153.84] painful to look at.
[3153.84 → 3155.04] ...after a few hours
[3155.04 → 3155.56] of using it.
[3155.60 → 3156.30] Now, the thing
[3156.30 → 3158.14] that makes my
[3158.14 → 3159.28] skepticism
[3159.28 → 3161.32] helmet
[3161.32 → 3163.24] appear in my hand
[3163.24 → 3164.60] to be put onto my...
[3164.60 → 3165.06] I don't actually
[3165.06 → 3165.98] have a skepticism helmet,
[3166.08 → 3166.54] so I'll wear this
[3166.54 → 3167.52] Linus Tech Tips mug.
[3168.06 → 3169.76] But I need a skepticism
[3169.76 → 3170.94] helmet because
[3170.94 → 3173.62] every AMD
[3173.62 → 3174.84] and Intel
[3174.84 → 3176.80] CPU, anyway,
[3177.18 → 3177.78] for, like,
[3178.62 → 3179.54] 10 years
[3179.54 → 3180.68] has had a
[3180.68 → 3181.36] thermal throttling
[3181.36 → 3182.94] mechanism built into it
[3182.94 → 3184.18] that will cause
[3184.18 → 3184.74] the system
[3184.74 → 3186.00] to shut down
[3186.00 → 3187.18] or in...
[3187.18 → 3187.62] I don't know
[3187.62 → 3188.44] if AMD has this,
[3188.52 → 3189.52] but Intel definitely does,
[3189.58 → 3190.52] or in Intel's case,
[3190.52 → 3192.52] cause the CPU
[3192.52 → 3193.94] to throttle
[3193.94 → 3195.12] so aggressively
[3195.12 → 3196.42] that many of them
[3196.42 → 3196.96] can actually
[3196.96 → 3198.20] continue to run
[3198.20 → 3199.68] without a heat sink
[3199.68 → 3200.04] on them.
[3200.16 → 3200.92] I don't actually know
[3200.92 → 3201.54] if the current ones
[3201.54 → 3201.94] can do that,
[3202.00 → 3203.14] but there were chips
[3203.14 → 3203.84] where you could
[3203.84 → 3204.86] pull the heat sink off
[3204.86 → 3205.92] and they would run,
[3206.06 → 3207.94] albeit very slowly,
[3208.18 → 3208.88] with little to no
[3208.88 → 3209.48] cooling on them.
[3211.80 → 3212.28] So,
[3212.52 → 3213.42] it's actually
[3213.42 → 3215.04] been a very
[3215.04 → 3216.38] long time
[3216.38 → 3217.60] since chips
[3217.60 → 3218.48] have had
[3218.48 → 3219.46] no thermal
[3219.46 → 3220.14] protection
[3220.14 → 3221.68] cutoff mechanisms
[3221.68 → 3222.92] whatsoever,
[3223.20 → 3223.90] and they usually
[3223.90 → 3224.60] kick in
[3224.60 → 3225.44] around the
[3225.44 → 3226.30] 100 to
[3226.30 → 3227.32] 105,
[3227.56 → 3228.90] 110 degree mark.
[3229.76 → 3230.16] So,
[3230.50 → 3231.78] for someone
[3231.78 → 3232.62] to have had
[3232.62 → 3234.10] a PlayStation 4 Pro
[3234.10 → 3235.30] melt,
[3235.48 → 3236.40] and I guarantee you
[3236.40 → 3236.86] this plastic
[3236.86 → 3237.36] doesn't melt
[3237.36 → 3238.18] at 100 degrees,
[3238.94 → 3239.58] or, well,
[3239.64 → 3239.84] I guess it's possible.
[3239.84 → 3240.18] No way.
[3240.58 → 3241.36] Yeah, no.
[3241.58 → 3241.86] No way.
[3241.96 → 3242.80] No, there's no way.
[3242.98 → 3243.74] I'm sticking with
[3243.74 → 3244.20] that statement.
[3244.80 → 3245.56] This plastic
[3245.56 → 3245.98] doesn't melt
[3245.98 → 3246.70] at 100 degrees.
[3247.22 → 3247.66] Also,
[3248.08 → 3249.86] for the air,
[3250.42 → 3251.96] the exhaust air
[3251.96 → 3253.50] to be 100 degrees,
[3254.04 → 3255.54] the chip itself
[3255.54 → 3256.72] has to be
[3256.72 → 3257.68] hotter than that
[3257.68 → 3258.26] because that's
[3258.26 → 3259.06] how thermal transfer
[3259.06 → 3259.38] works.
[3259.48 → 3260.74] It is a difference
[3260.74 → 3262.72] in temperature
[3262.72 → 3263.80] that causes
[3263.80 → 3265.26] heat to move
[3265.26 → 3266.70] from one object
[3266.70 → 3267.60] to another one
[3267.60 → 3268.14] when we're talking
[3268.14 → 3268.86] about conduction.
[3269.36 → 3270.96] That's how it moves
[3270.96 → 3271.72] between them,
[3271.84 → 3272.44] is that one of them
[3272.44 → 3273.06] has to have less
[3273.06 → 3273.64] than the other.
[3274.20 → 3275.08] That's how it works.
[3275.42 → 3276.28] It's like equilibrium
[3276.28 → 3276.92] and crap.
[3277.56 → 3278.04] Diffusion,
[3278.22 → 3279.18] same kind of principle.
[3279.88 → 3280.76] I'm not a scientist.
[3281.18 → 3282.10] Don't worry about that part.
[3282.40 → 3283.60] The fact of the matter
[3283.60 → 3285.04] is that chip
[3285.04 → 3285.88] would have to be
[3285.88 → 3286.46] hotter
[3286.46 → 3287.76] than the air
[3287.76 → 3288.70] coming out
[3288.70 → 3289.82] of that vent,
[3290.40 → 3291.92] although this isn't a vent,
[3292.22 → 3293.16] so the chip
[3293.16 → 3294.18] could be a little bit
[3294.18 → 3294.66] further away,
[3294.74 → 3295.16] but again,
[3295.22 → 3295.70] the chip would have
[3295.70 → 3296.32] to be hotter
[3296.32 → 3297.74] than the PCB
[3297.74 → 3299.14] that's connected
[3299.14 → 3301.02] to the heat sink bone
[3301.02 → 3301.56] that's connected
[3301.56 → 3303.68] to the bracket bone
[3303.68 → 3304.12] or whatever.
[3304.22 → 3304.86] Whatever's next
[3304.86 → 3305.70] to that plastic,
[3306.30 → 3307.94] I don't buy it.
[3308.36 → 3309.56] The last time
[3309.56 → 3311.20] I had a component
[3311.20 → 3313.18] legitimately die
[3313.18 → 3314.86] due to inadequate
[3314.86 → 3315.64] cooling,
[3316.24 → 3316.74] and we're talking
[3316.74 → 3317.34] like a CPU
[3317.34 → 3317.86] or a GPU,
[3317.98 → 3318.98] an advanced component
[3318.98 → 3319.58] that has like
[3319.58 → 3320.58] a lot of safeties
[3320.58 → 3321.64] and logic built into it,
[3322.00 → 3323.84] was I believe
[3323.84 → 3328.38] a 7900 GT.
[3328.38 → 3330.32] I want to say
[3330.32 → 3331.56] 7900 GT
[3331.56 → 3332.30] because it was
[3332.30 → 3333.62] back in the days
[3333.62 → 3334.88] that I was still
[3334.88 → 3336.98] running MCW60
[3336.98 → 3338.48] GPU-only blocks
[3338.48 → 3340.32] on my SLI video cards,
[3340.90 → 3343.40] and I ran the system
[3343.40 → 3345.34] with no water
[3345.34 → 3346.10] in one of them
[3346.10 → 3346.56] somehow.
[3346.86 → 3347.62] I don't remember.
[3347.70 → 3348.44] It was some careless error,
[3348.70 → 3350.50] and my GPU block
[3350.50 → 3351.18] melted,
[3352.26 → 3352.50] like,
[3353.10 → 3353.90] and the card died.
[3353.90 → 3355.38] That's the last time
[3355.38 → 3355.92] that's happened.
[3357.44 → 3358.64] Has this been,
[3359.06 → 3359.60] is this,
[3360.02 → 3361.88] what's the word
[3361.88 → 3362.36] I'm looking for?
[3362.72 → 3363.12] Has anyone
[3363.12 → 3364.22] really duplicated,
[3364.22 → 3365.04] has it been duplicated
[3365.04 → 3365.78] en masse,
[3365.90 → 3366.78] this result
[3366.78 → 3369.44] of melting PS4 pros?
[3369.50 → 3370.18] Because people
[3370.18 → 3370.56] are claiming
[3370.56 → 3371.20] it's a hoax,
[3371.28 → 3371.94] and I'm wondering
[3371.94 → 3372.62] how many people
[3372.62 → 3373.52] exactly are reporting
[3373.52 → 3374.02] this, you know,
[3374.06 → 3374.66] because it could just
[3374.66 → 3376.70] be a guy who...
[3376.70 → 3377.26] Blowtorched.
[3377.34 → 3377.94] Yeah, exactly.
[3378.24 → 3378.42] Yep.
[3378.88 → 3379.12] I mean,
[3379.14 → 3379.94] you look at how
[3379.94 → 3381.96] explosively viral,
[3382.50 → 3382.74] like,
[3382.86 → 3384.50] exposing a critical flaw
[3384.50 → 3385.52] in a hot new product
[3385.52 → 3385.96] can be.
[3386.08 → 3386.20] You know,
[3386.22 → 3386.64] you look back
[3386.64 → 3387.34] at something like
[3387.34 → 3389.26] Unbox Therapy's
[3389.26 → 3390.62] iPhone 6 Bend gate
[3390.62 → 3392.42] that's got 40 bazillion views
[3392.42 → 3393.12] or whatever it is
[3393.12 → 3393.58] on YouTube.
[3394.70 → 3396.34] That can be a great way
[3396.34 → 3398.20] to get super internet famous
[3398.20 → 3399.16] super quickly.
[3401.74 → 3402.60] I've got people saying
[3402.60 → 3403.20] there are many types
[3403.20 → 3403.66] of plastic,
[3403.80 → 3404.44] and some do melt
[3404.44 → 3405.48] at about 100 degrees Celsius.
[3405.58 → 3406.30] Yes, I know that.
[3406.38 → 3406.92] I just don't think
[3406.92 → 3407.30] they would make
[3407.30 → 3407.98] a game console
[3407.98 → 3409.08] that does run hot
[3409.08 → 3409.50] out of it.
[3409.68 → 3410.74] If they make plastic
[3410.74 → 3411.72] like serving spoons,
[3411.80 → 3412.18] you can stick
[3412.18 → 3413.16] in boiling water,
[3413.28 → 3414.44] which is obviously
[3414.44 → 3415.76] at least 100 degrees Celsius,
[3416.04 → 3416.68] then, you know,
[3416.74 → 3417.42] you'd think they could
[3417.42 → 3417.86] make something
[3417.86 → 3418.76] for the PS4.
[3419.00 → 3419.54] Fun fact,
[3419.74 → 3420.46] boiling water
[3420.46 → 3421.54] is not necessarily
[3421.54 → 3422.78] at least 100 degrees Celsius.
[3422.90 → 3423.28] It depends on
[3423.28 → 3424.06] atmospheric pressure,
[3424.18 → 3424.48] yes, I know.
[3424.50 → 3425.42] And impurities
[3425.42 → 3427.24] in the water.
[3427.84 → 3428.76] I minored in chemistry,
[3428.88 → 3429.20] I know.
[3429.48 → 3430.50] I'm just giving
[3430.50 → 3431.78] an example of why
[3431.78 → 3432.52] they probably
[3432.52 → 3433.60] use a hardier plastic.
[3433.66 → 3433.68] Also,
[3433.68 → 3434.78] in laboratory conditions
[3434.78 → 3435.90] at one atmosphere,
[3435.90 → 3437.38] perfect purity,
[3437.52 → 3438.04] it wouldn't be
[3438.04 → 3439.28] at least 100 degrees Celsius,
[3439.28 → 3440.20] it would be
[3440.20 → 3441.36] exactly 100 degrees Celsius.
[3441.36 → 3441.76] Yes, because
[3441.76 → 3443.32] no more and no less.
[3443.44 → 3444.42] Once it goes up,
[3444.48 → 3445.22] then it's water vapour.
[3445.36 → 3446.56] I'm just bugging him
[3446.56 → 3447.02] because I know
[3447.02 → 3447.66] he knows this stuff
[3447.66 → 3448.28] better than I do,
[3448.34 → 3449.04] but I knew a thing,
[3449.12 → 3449.80] and something he said
[3449.80 → 3450.64] was technically
[3450.64 → 3452.70] not quite perfectly,
[3453.28 → 3453.80] completely
[3453.80 → 3454.82] explanation,
[3455.10 → 3455.78] which is not a word,
[3455.84 → 3456.34] and that's fine.
[3456.52 → 3456.74] Explanation?
[3456.74 → 3458.14] Of the entire situation.
[3458.36 → 3459.14] Technically explanation,
[3459.24 → 3460.32] the best kind of explanation.
[3460.50 → 3460.96] There you go.
[3461.56 → 3463.16] Oh, the entire Twitch chat
[3463.16 → 3464.38] is just like LMAO,
[3464.56 → 3466.20] Linus trying to look scientific.
[3466.60 → 3467.00] Explanation.
[3467.32 → 3468.24] Explanation is a word.
[3468.36 → 3468.72] You win.
[3469.10 → 3469.38] Look at that.
[3469.38 → 3469.60] Really?
[3469.80 → 3470.52] Yeah, check it out.
[3471.66 → 3472.02] Explanation.
[3472.12 → 3472.14] Explanation,
[3472.14 → 3473.48] serving to explain.
[3473.76 → 3474.42] There you have it.
[3474.96 → 3475.32] Yeah!
[3477.20 → 3478.06] Well, I'm happy.
[3479.42 → 3480.42] That made my day.
[3480.42 → 3484.86] Warner Brothers
[3484.86 → 3487.40] acquires gaming culture hub.
[3487.50 → 3488.20] That's optimistic.
[3488.84 → 3489.48] Machining
[3489.48 → 3491.58] in a deal rumoured
[3491.58 → 3492.22] to be valued
[3492.22 → 3494.00] at around $100 million.
[3494.56 → 3495.78] Why didn't we just
[3495.78 → 3496.86] start an MCN?
[3497.00 → 3497.80] Why do we bother
[3497.80 → 3498.92] trying to actually
[3498.92 → 3500.20] create content?
[3500.92 → 3501.82] Why don't we just
[3501.82 → 3503.64] spam every single
[3503.64 → 3504.44] YouTube creator
[3504.44 → 3505.06] and say,
[3505.16 → 3505.90] hey, we want to
[3505.90 → 3506.94] represent you.
[3507.66 → 3508.42] Give us some of
[3508.42 → 3509.28] your money
[3509.28 → 3510.04] and we will
[3510.04 → 3511.24] represent you.
[3511.58 → 3512.36] I guess we wanted
[3512.36 → 3513.72] mentally and intellectually
[3513.72 → 3514.74] stimulating work
[3514.74 → 3515.40] that could lead us
[3515.40 → 3516.40] to an exciting future
[3516.40 → 3517.28] of living in the box
[3517.28 → 3518.04] behind Arby's.
[3518.48 → 3519.20] That's stupid.
[3521.66 → 3523.12] But I'm totally on board.
[3523.66 → 3524.48] Let's keep doing it.
[3525.38 → 3526.60] Alright, so Machining
[3526.60 → 3527.30] will operate
[3527.30 → 3528.54] as a wholly owned part
[3528.54 → 3529.42] of the recently formed
[3529.42 → 3529.96] Warner Brothers
[3529.96 → 3531.12] Digital Networks group.
[3531.78 → 3532.56] The group houses
[3532.56 → 3533.40] the studio's digital
[3533.40 → 3535.02] and over-the-top businesses.
[3535.36 → 3536.00] Machining reaches
[3536.00 → 3538.10] over 151 million viewers
[3538.10 → 3538.90] each month.
[3538.90 → 3541.16] Whatever that's based on.
[3541.82 → 3542.78] Coordinates a talent
[3542.78 → 3543.52] network of over
[3543.52 → 3544.76] 30,000
[3544.76 → 3546.90] exploiters.
[3547.00 → 3547.74] Sorry, people.
[3547.86 → 3548.70] They have people in there.
[3548.72 → 3549.16] Wow.
[3549.56 → 3550.18] Don't hold back.
[3550.24 → 3551.16] Tell us how you really feel.
[3551.52 → 3552.00] Machining,
[3552.16 → 3552.78] this is a quote,
[3552.88 → 3554.22] Machining is a strong
[3554.22 → 3555.98] gamer and fandom content
[3555.98 → 3558.00] and social brand
[3558.00 → 3558.84] with enormous...
[3558.84 → 3559.76] What does that even mean?
[3559.94 → 3560.62] I don't know why
[3560.62 → 3561.46] you think I'm laughing.
[3561.60 → 3563.16] Strong gamer and fandom
[3563.16 → 3565.40] content and social brand.
[3565.40 → 3566.08] Fandom...
[3566.08 → 3567.12] How do you...
[3567.12 → 3568.04] You can brand
[3568.04 → 3569.16] fandom content?
[3569.82 → 3570.42] Like, I mean,
[3570.48 → 3571.12] I kind of get
[3571.12 → 3571.78] what he's saying,
[3571.92 → 3572.64] but it's also...
[3572.64 → 3573.26] They are a brand,
[3573.42 → 3574.16] but they're a...
[3574.16 → 3574.38] Okay,
[3574.62 → 3575.78] in high engagement
[3575.78 → 3576.48] with audiences
[3576.48 → 3577.76] that play our games
[3577.76 → 3578.96] and are big fans
[3578.96 → 3580.18] of DC films
[3580.18 → 3581.46] and television shows.
[3583.14 → 3584.16] What DC films
[3584.16 → 3584.56] are there?
[3585.06 → 3585.86] You mean Batman
[3585.86 → 3586.46] versus Superman?
[3586.46 → 3586.68] Batman and Superman, yeah.
[3586.68 → 3587.48] Is anyone a fan
[3587.48 → 3588.70] of Batman versus Superman?
[3588.82 → 3589.66] What do they have
[3589.66 → 3590.84] besides Batman and Superman?
[3591.24 → 3592.18] And I guess Wonder Woman
[3592.18 → 3593.38] is DC, isn't she?
[3593.66 → 3594.36] Yeah, she is.
[3594.52 → 3595.50] But I don't...
[3595.50 → 3596.42] Like, nothing.
[3596.60 → 3597.34] It seems like Marvel
[3597.34 → 3598.08] has, like,
[3598.16 → 3599.32] the huge hype train going.
[3600.14 → 3601.38] And DC is like...
[3601.38 → 3602.04] Yeah, we're here too.
[3602.24 → 3603.36] We were cool back
[3603.36 → 3604.20] when Michael Keaton
[3604.20 → 3604.82] was Batman.
[3605.46 → 3606.28] That was pretty cool.
[3606.36 → 3606.90] Remember that?
[3607.24 → 3608.20] Is that your Kermit impression?
[3608.50 → 3609.10] Actually, yeah.
[3609.22 → 3609.74] It's not bad.
[3610.24 → 3610.72] That's not...
[3610.72 → 3611.30] Oh, that's not even
[3611.30 → 3612.02] 100% Kermit.
[3612.08 → 3612.50] That's just me
[3612.50 → 3613.30] doing, like, this voice,
[3613.36 → 3614.52] but I can get a little...
[3614.52 → 3615.60] I can get a little more Kermit.
[3615.78 → 3616.14] Very good.
[3618.28 → 3619.22] Maybe I'll use this
[3619.22 → 3619.94] as an opportunity
[3619.94 → 3620.88] to try and get people
[3620.88 → 3622.14] to watch that...
[3622.14 → 3625.08] Channel Super Fun
[3625.08 → 3625.96] murder.
[3626.60 → 3627.52] To try and try
[3627.52 → 3628.30] to watch that
[3628.30 → 3629.80] Mardi Gras murder mystery video
[3629.80 → 3631.12] we did over on Channel Super Fun
[3631.12 → 3632.16] that no one liked.
[3632.76 → 3634.04] I do my Kermit the Frog
[3634.04 → 3634.52] impression
[3634.52 → 3635.50] in that video.
[3635.90 → 3636.66] I like how you got
[3636.66 → 3637.54] Dennis to play a lawyer.
[3637.66 → 3638.34] That was fantastic.
[3639.16 → 3639.52] Yeah.
[3640.18 → 3640.54] Yeah.
[3640.74 → 3642.20] We got Dennis to...
[3642.20 → 3643.36] We got Dennis to do
[3643.36 → 3644.12] something in that video.
[3644.12 → 3644.64] That's for sure.
[3645.36 → 3646.22] All right.
[3646.22 → 3649.38] The HTC Five
[3649.38 → 3650.90] goes wireless
[3650.90 → 3654.86] with a $220 add-on.
[3655.40 → 3656.68] Pre-orders start today.
[3656.78 → 3657.54] Now, to be clear,
[3657.60 → 3659.10] I am not endorsing this.
[3661.24 → 3662.44] Is it going to kill
[3662.44 → 3663.72] the VR backpack market?
[3665.46 → 3667.04] If it works, yeah.
[3667.04 → 3668.00] If it works.
[3668.00 → 3668.82] If it works, yeah.
[3669.12 → 3669.76] But...
[3669.76 → 3670.78] And if it works,
[3671.00 → 3671.86] I'm going to be
[3671.86 → 3673.62] eating my words so hard.
[3673.74 → 3674.80] I've been telling people
[3674.80 → 3675.88] I think we're like
[3675.88 → 3676.80] 10 years away
[3676.80 → 3676.94] from wireless VR.
[3676.94 → 3677.62] Just because of...
[3677.62 → 3679.22] Mostly because of latency issues, yeah.
[3679.30 → 3679.94] Because of latency
[3679.94 → 3680.66] and bandwidth.
[3681.10 → 3681.38] Mm-hmm.
[3681.72 → 3682.08] I mean,
[3682.30 → 3684.28] wireless HDMI does exist
[3684.28 → 3685.44] and low latency
[3685.44 → 3686.66] video feeds do exist.
[3686.76 → 3687.48] But the latency
[3687.48 → 3688.44] has to be...
[3688.44 → 3690.00] Like, spot on.
[3690.12 → 3691.42] Like, your BM...
[3691.42 → 3692.48] The i9, was it?
[3692.52 → 3693.94] At CES earlier this year
[3693.94 → 3694.92] where you had
[3694.92 → 3697.10] the rearview cameras
[3697.10 → 3698.04] and the latency
[3698.04 → 3699.12] was almost nothing.
[3699.30 → 3699.58] Yeah.
[3699.72 → 3700.32] Yeah, it would need
[3700.32 → 3700.98] to be like that.
[3701.02 → 3701.84] It would need to be...
[3701.84 → 3702.00] Yeah.
[3702.00 → 3703.36] I should feel like
[3703.36 → 3704.52] I am looking
[3704.52 → 3705.86] out of my eyes
[3705.86 → 3706.36] at a thing.
[3706.46 → 3706.68] Yeah.
[3708.50 → 3709.88] HTC's Five Chief
[3709.88 → 3710.84] in China, though,
[3711.38 → 3712.58] tells Upload VR
[3712.58 → 3713.30] that there is
[3713.30 → 3715.02] no noticeable difference
[3715.02 → 3715.80] in latency
[3715.80 → 3716.86] when using
[3716.86 → 3718.62] the TP-Cast peripheral.
[3719.34 → 3720.74] Which The Verge said,
[3720.90 → 3722.88] and I am 100% backing
[3722.88 → 3725.08] Sam Buford
[3725.08 → 3726.12] on this,
[3726.44 → 3726.96] is something
[3726.96 → 3727.88] we'd have to see
[3727.88 → 3728.82] for ourselves.
[3729.34 → 3729.56] Mm-hmm.
[3729.56 → 3730.74] Battery life
[3730.74 → 3731.64] is also a concern,
[3731.84 → 3732.84] but Grayling says
[3732.84 → 3733.66] the regular battery
[3733.66 → 3734.10] can deliver
[3734.10 → 3734.78] about an hour
[3734.78 → 3735.66] and a half of power
[3735.66 → 3736.64] with a bigger battery
[3736.64 → 3737.40] designed to be placed
[3737.40 → 3738.24] in users' pockets
[3738.24 → 3739.36] coming later.
[3741.36 → 3741.96] So...
[3741.96 → 3742.84] So it's going to be
[3742.84 → 3743.70] a little bit clunky,
[3743.96 → 3745.08] but there's absolutely
[3745.08 → 3746.08] no way...
[3746.08 → 3747.16] I mean, if it works.
[3747.24 → 3747.96] If it works,
[3748.00 → 3748.56] there's no way
[3748.56 → 3749.42] it will be clunkier
[3749.42 → 3750.08] than, like,
[3750.16 → 3751.30] a VR backpack solution.
[3751.50 → 3752.28] Here's the product.
[3753.08 → 3754.16] Vive.com
[3754.16 → 3754.86] slash CN.
[3755.12 → 3755.44] Oh, sorry.
[3755.44 → 3757.00] So TP-Cast claims
[3757.00 → 3757.76] it adds less than
[3757.76 → 3758.66] two milliseconds,
[3760.10 → 3761.26] which would be
[3761.26 → 3762.54] within the range
[3762.54 → 3765.76] of probably reasonable.
[3766.32 → 3767.30] So, hey,
[3767.36 → 3768.14] if they pull it off,
[3768.24 → 3769.18] I will eat my words
[3769.18 → 3770.06] and I will do it happily
[3770.06 → 3771.98] because I would love
[3771.98 → 3772.72] to not have to carry
[3772.72 → 3773.40] the tether around
[3773.40 → 3774.42] and I never play
[3774.42 → 3775.20] for more than an hour
[3775.20 → 3776.02] and a half at a time
[3776.02 → 3776.60] because, like,
[3776.66 → 3777.98] by then you're, like,
[3778.20 → 3778.78] your face is
[3778.78 → 3779.60] having a thing on it.
[3779.60 → 3779.92] Yeah.
[3780.16 → 3780.40] You know.
[3780.50 → 3781.46] Yeah, and in use,
[3781.52 → 3782.18] that should surprise,
[3782.32 → 3783.16] absolutely nobody.
[3783.16 → 3784.34] I have almost tripped
[3784.34 → 3785.16] over the cord
[3785.16 → 3786.04] once or twice
[3786.04 → 3786.96] while playing the vibe
[3786.96 → 3787.90] that we have here, so.
[3788.22 → 3789.76] So, I'm not sure
[3789.76 → 3791.62] if what I'm about to show
[3791.62 → 3793.04] constitutes
[3793.04 → 3795.00] a violation
[3795.00 → 3796.14] of Twitch's
[3796.14 → 3797.52] terms of service.
[3797.84 → 3798.14] Maybe.
[3798.38 → 3799.06] Oh, dear,
[3799.14 → 3799.88] is this thing,
[3800.04 → 3800.42] isn't it?
[3800.48 → 3801.12] So, this was posted
[3801.12 → 3802.34] by Steve Wazowski
[3802.34 → 3803.16] on the forum.
[3803.98 → 3805.24] The original article
[3805.24 → 3807.20] here is from Kodak.
[3809.54 → 3810.34] You know what?
[3810.42 → 3811.34] Why don't we just kind of,
[3811.48 → 3812.12] how much can we
[3812.12 → 3813.04] shrink the page?
[3813.16 → 3813.70] To make it, like,
[3813.76 → 3815.86] kind of hard to see.
[3816.04 → 3817.74] Like, how low res
[3817.74 → 3818.56] can we make this?
[3819.06 → 3819.98] You could just put,
[3820.04 → 3821.42] like, a little thing
[3821.42 → 3822.06] on top of it.
[3822.06 → 3823.38] Yeah, why don't I do that?
[3823.44 → 3823.92] Why don't I do that?
[3823.96 → 3825.06] But if the point is
[3825.06 → 3827.02] that it's not censored,
[3827.10 → 3828.02] like, if the whole story
[3828.02 → 3829.08] is that it's not censored,
[3829.14 → 3830.02] then it seems to kind of
[3830.02 → 3831.46] defeat the purpose somewhat.
[3831.62 → 3832.38] But you'll just have
[3832.38 → 3833.30] to take my word for it
[3833.30 → 3833.94] or go Google it.
[3834.00 → 3834.62] You know, Google has
[3834.62 → 3836.40] lots of naughty pictures
[3836.40 → 3836.98] on it, I heard.
[3837.42 → 3837.84] Or Bing.
[3837.96 → 3838.10] Yeah.
[3838.20 → 3838.54] Really?
[3838.68 → 3839.18] I can't believe
[3839.18 → 3839.62] they would allow
[3839.62 → 3840.14] such a thing.
[3840.38 → 3841.04] So, here we go.
[3841.04 → 3842.86] Watchdog 2,
[3843.18 → 3844.06] or Watchdog 2,
[3844.16 → 3845.24] Watchdogs 2
[3845.24 → 3846.96] apparently
[3846.96 → 3849.06] managed to get this
[3849.06 → 3850.22] through the ESB
[3850.22 → 3851.28] and all the rating systems
[3851.28 → 3851.94] and all that,
[3851.94 → 3852.98] but apparently
[3852.98 → 3854.66] has fully modelled
[3854.66 → 3855.98] female vaginas
[3855.98 → 3857.92] on some of the
[3857.92 → 3858.58] female
[3858.58 → 3860.24] models.
[3860.24 → 3863.38] So, this screenshot
[3863.38 → 3865.66] apparently from
[3865.66 → 3866.66] Swizzes
[3866.66 → 3867.92] apparently proves
[3867.92 → 3868.88] that there is indeed
[3868.88 → 3869.88] a vagina
[3869.88 → 3871.44] in Watchdogs 2.
[3871.52 → 3872.54] Now, again,
[3872.72 → 3873.56] getting into more
[3873.56 → 3874.68] technicalities here,
[3875.32 → 3877.60] the vagina would not
[3877.60 → 3879.02] necessarily be visible
[3879.02 → 3880.30] from the outside
[3880.30 → 3882.52] because of,
[3882.52 → 3882.92] you know,
[3883.66 → 3884.48] labia and stuff.
[3884.66 → 3885.52] You might more
[3885.52 → 3886.30] accurately say
[3886.30 → 3887.48] fully modelled vulvas
[3887.48 → 3888.76] because the vagina
[3888.76 → 3889.90] is kind of an internal
[3889.90 → 3890.30] structure.
[3890.30 → 3890.94] I appreciate your use
[3890.94 → 3891.58] of all the proper
[3891.58 → 3892.14] terminology.
[3892.28 → 3892.78] I feel like I'm in
[3892.78 → 3893.46] health class
[3893.46 → 3894.50] in like this grade again.
[3894.94 → 3895.86] So, what we're actually
[3895.86 → 3896.94] looking at in that picture
[3896.94 → 3897.76] that I had hidden
[3897.76 → 3898.32] from you guys
[3898.32 → 3899.60] is a fully modelled
[3899.60 → 3900.18] vulva
[3900.18 → 3901.64] with pubic hair,
[3901.86 → 3902.88] not necessarily
[3902.88 → 3903.56] a vagina.
[3904.30 → 3905.18] And we don't really
[3905.18 → 3905.96] have any proof
[3905.96 → 3906.32] that there are
[3906.32 → 3907.34] fully modelled vaginas
[3907.34 → 3909.40] unless we also had
[3909.40 → 3910.10] like some kind
[3910.10 → 3911.06] of camera device
[3911.06 → 3912.72] that we could insert
[3912.72 → 3913.46] into the female
[3913.46 → 3913.96] characters,
[3914.30 → 3915.32] but I suspect
[3915.32 → 3916.38] that did not
[3916.38 → 3916.88] make it into the game.
[3916.88 → 3917.52] Well, this said
[3917.52 → 3918.30] it slipped through
[3918.30 → 3919.08] certification.
[3919.26 → 3919.76] Why do we think
[3919.76 → 3920.26] it necessarily
[3920.26 → 3921.26] slipped through?
[3921.94 → 3922.86] Like...
[3922.86 → 3924.04] Well, probably
[3924.04 → 3925.62] because some
[3925.62 → 3927.18] rogue artist
[3927.18 → 3928.16] or a bunch of
[3928.16 → 3928.82] some people
[3928.82 → 3929.60] knew about it
[3929.60 → 3930.24] and some other
[3930.24 → 3931.00] people didn't.
[3931.44 → 3932.04] So, you're saying
[3932.04 → 3933.36] it's not necessarily
[3933.36 → 3933.90] on there
[3933.90 → 3934.98] or in the game
[3934.98 → 3935.42] on purpose?
[3935.80 → 3936.60] I'm saying that
[3936.60 → 3937.32] someone put it
[3937.32 → 3937.86] there on purpose.
[3937.96 → 3938.24] Well, I mean,
[3938.40 → 3939.16] well, I'm talking
[3939.16 → 3939.72] about when I say
[3939.72 → 3940.16] on purpose,
[3940.26 → 3941.20] I mean by the people
[3941.20 → 3941.72] who have the final
[3941.72 → 3942.56] authority as to what
[3942.56 → 3943.30] it's going to look like.
[3944.78 → 3945.14] Yeah.
[3945.48 → 3945.62] Yeah.
[3945.62 → 3946.92] Okay, so anyway,
[3947.12 → 3947.74] in summary,
[3949.40 → 3951.02] Kodak reports
[3951.02 → 3951.98] that if you take
[3951.98 → 3952.46] a picture
[3952.46 → 3953.84] and share it
[3953.84 → 3954.54] to prove this
[3954.54 → 3955.26] on PlayStation,
[3955.64 → 3956.46] Sony will temporarily
[3956.46 → 3957.40] ban your account,
[3957.96 → 3958.78] which is interesting.
[3960.10 → 3961.60] So, Goron2000
[3961.60 → 3963.24] says how he discovered
[3963.24 → 3963.64] this.
[3964.06 → 3964.94] I received my copy
[3964.94 → 3965.76] of Watch Dogs 2
[3965.76 → 3966.62] on Saturday evening
[3966.62 → 3967.38] due to a mistake
[3967.38 → 3968.36] on Amazon Prime
[3968.36 → 3969.50] and I've been having
[3969.50 → 3969.94] a great time
[3969.94 → 3970.66] with the game so far.
[3970.74 → 3971.44] On Sunday evening,
[3971.56 → 3972.52] I accidentally blew up
[3972.52 → 3973.04] a few women
[3973.04 → 3973.86] in a back alley
[3973.86 → 3974.86] with a gas pipe
[3974.86 → 3976.12] and then I saw it.
[3977.22 → 3978.02] Someone at Ubisoft
[3978.02 → 3978.44] had rendered
[3978.44 → 3979.22] a full vagina.
[3979.44 → 3980.12] Again, we don't know
[3980.12 → 3980.86] if it's a full vagina
[3980.86 → 3981.40] but definitely
[3981.40 → 3982.04] a full vulva
[3982.04 → 3983.40] or maybe more
[3983.40 → 3985.46] on one or maybe more
[3985.46 → 3985.92] of the females
[3985.92 → 3986.36] in the game
[3986.36 → 3986.74] and he shared
[3986.74 → 3987.16] a screenshot
[3987.16 → 3987.90] and had his
[3987.90 → 3988.58] PlayStation account
[3988.58 → 3989.20] banned from using
[3989.20 → 3989.58] the game's
[3989.58 → 3990.24] online features
[3990.24 → 3991.94] due to the image
[3991.94 → 3992.68] breaking Sony's
[3992.68 → 3993.18] code of contact.
[3993.52 → 3993.94] Despite the fact
[3993.94 → 3994.36] it's a game
[3994.36 → 3994.84] they're selling
[3994.84 → 3995.96] on their own platform.
[3996.18 → 3996.40] Yes.
[3998.44 → 3998.92] Okay.
[3998.92 → 4001.22] All right.
[4001.92 → 4002.88] So here's a leak
[4002.88 → 4003.96] from Toys R Us.
[4005.20 → 4006.10] ToysRus.ca
[4006.10 → 4008.24] I doubt this is still up.
[4009.04 → 4009.24] Yeah.
[4009.38 → 4009.68] No.
[4009.98 → 4010.90] I think this is just
[4010.90 → 4011.52] listed here
[4011.52 → 4012.52] because it's like
[4012.52 → 4013.34] the source
[4013.34 → 4014.10] or whatever
[4014.10 → 4016.58] but the Nintendo Switch
[4016.58 → 4017.62] is rumoured
[4017.62 → 4019.64] to go on sale
[4019.64 → 4020.28] at
[4020.28 → 4022.46] $329.99
[4022.46 → 4023.64] Canadian dollars
[4023.64 → 4024.12] which I guess
[4024.12 → 4024.80] would put it around
[4024.80 → 4026.68] $249.99 US.
[4027.20 → 4027.62] Oh, look.
[4027.62 → 4028.24] Okay, look at that.
[4028.28 → 4028.96] They do the math for me.
[4028.98 → 4029.94] $244 USD.
[4030.20 → 4030.78] But it definitely won't be.
[4030.78 → 4031.74] It's not going to be that.
[4031.84 → 4032.40] It's going to be some
[4032.40 → 4033.30] it's going to have a nine
[4033.30 → 4033.96] at the end of it.
[4034.86 → 4035.30] Probably
[4035.30 → 4038.18] probably $249 GBP.
[4038.30 → 4039.58] Sorry, sorry Europeans.
[4039.88 → 4041.34] And probably 249 Euro
[4041.34 → 4043.18] because the conversion
[4043.18 → 4044.16] rarely works that way.
[4044.22 → 4044.60] Sorry guys.
[4045.78 → 4047.06] It's actually hilarious
[4047.06 → 4048.52] how Canadians whine
[4048.52 → 4049.68] so much about
[4049.68 → 4050.86] crappy pricing in Canada
[4050.86 → 4052.96] but more often than not
[4052.96 → 4053.80] if we're not talking
[4053.80 → 4056.00] about like stupid
[4056.00 → 4057.28] kind of like boutique
[4057.28 → 4058.02] fashion brands
[4058.02 → 4058.70] or whatever else.
[4059.08 → 4060.28] When it comes to electronics
[4060.28 → 4061.20] more often than not
[4061.20 → 4062.20] it's pretty much
[4062.20 → 4063.04] a straight conversion
[4063.04 → 4064.62] plus the additional
[4064.62 → 4065.42] logistics cost
[4065.42 → 4065.80] that it takes
[4065.80 → 4066.38] to get it up here
[4066.38 → 4067.08] and the additional cost
[4067.08 → 4067.64] of doing business
[4067.64 → 4068.64] that Canadian businesses
[4068.64 → 4069.04] go through.
[4069.50 → 4070.24] Like it's actually
[4070.24 → 4071.56] electronics pricing
[4071.56 → 4072.34] is not that bad.
[4072.44 → 4073.46] It's just that the Canadian dollar
[4073.46 → 4074.70] is kind of all over the place
[4074.70 → 4075.42] relative to the US.
[4075.44 → 4076.14] You also have to ask
[4076.14 → 4078.08] suppose the CAD
[4078.08 → 4078.94] reaches par
[4078.94 → 4080.20] with our dollar again
[4080.20 → 4081.36] are the prices up here
[4081.36 → 4082.62] necessarily going to go down?
[4082.82 → 4083.56] Yeah, it happens.
[4083.56 → 4085.88] I've heard that it happens
[4085.88 → 4086.66] with certain things
[4086.66 → 4087.48] or to different degrees
[4087.48 → 4088.34] but not with others.
[4088.44 → 4088.94] Like it's not like
[4088.94 → 4089.60] this uniform.
[4090.26 → 4091.60] So it depends.
[4091.90 → 4092.00] Yeah.
[4092.62 → 4093.80] Logitech for example
[4093.80 → 4094.74] and this
[4094.74 → 4095.80] so going back
[4095.80 → 4097.02] to my product management days
[4097.02 → 4098.24] Logitech
[4098.24 → 4099.76] used to assign
[4099.76 → 4101.04] their CAD
[4101.04 → 4101.88] to US
[4101.88 → 4103.42] exchange rate
[4103.42 → 4104.58] like once a year.
[4105.44 → 4106.58] So back in
[4106.58 → 4107.46] I think it was
[4107.46 → 4108.02] 08
[4108.02 → 4109.84] when the Canadian dollar
[4109.84 → 4112.38] absolutely plummeted
[4112.38 → 4114.16] relative to the USD
[4114.16 → 4116.50] Logitech pricing
[4116.50 → 4117.46] was like
[4117.46 → 4119.10] obscenely
[4119.10 → 4120.02] or no
[4120.02 → 4120.36] hold on
[4120.36 → 4120.60] no
[4120.60 → 4121.30] was cheap
[4121.30 → 4121.78] yes
[4121.78 → 4123.38] Logitech was cheap
[4123.38 → 4124.30] and then
[4124.30 → 4125.26] it took them so long
[4125.26 → 4126.00] to respond
[4126.00 → 4126.94] when the CAD
[4126.94 → 4127.48] recovered
[4127.48 → 4128.62] and was actually
[4128.62 → 4129.38] I believe it
[4129.38 → 4130.52] passed the USD
[4130.52 → 4131.34] for a little bit
[4131.34 → 4132.50] but they were basically
[4132.50 → 4134.00] par for quite some time
[4134.00 → 4135.14] Logitech
[4135.14 → 4136.26] products were just
[4136.26 → 4137.70] way overpriced
[4137.70 → 4138.14] in Canada
[4138.14 → 4139.04] and I took to
[4139.04 → 4139.64] sourcing them
[4139.64 → 4140.50] through the grey market
[4140.50 → 4142.34] buying from
[4142.34 → 4143.46] US suppliers
[4143.46 → 4144.10] who were buying
[4144.10 → 4145.20] from US distributors
[4145.20 → 4146.54] and then importing
[4146.54 → 4147.24] them myself
[4147.24 → 4147.80] because it was
[4147.80 → 4148.26] the only way
[4148.26 → 4148.90] to get Logitech
[4148.90 → 4149.50] products that were
[4149.50 → 4150.20] reasonably priced.
[4151.28 → 4152.64] So some manufacturers
[4152.64 → 4153.76] make changes
[4153.76 → 4155.20] all the time
[4155.20 → 4156.44] and some of them
[4156.44 → 4157.12] basically
[4157.12 → 4158.48] don't adjust
[4158.48 → 4159.48] like
[4159.48 → 4161.30] yeah
[4161.30 → 4162.66] So it really just depends
[4162.66 → 4163.98] It really just depends on
[4163.98 → 4165.44] and some of them
[4165.44 → 4166.40] will only adjust
[4166.40 → 4167.04] if something really
[4167.04 → 4167.70] extreme happens
[4167.70 → 4168.58] and they'll just
[4168.58 → 4169.48] kind of absorb it
[4169.48 → 4170.14] if there are small
[4170.14 → 4170.64] fluctuations
[4170.64 → 4171.48] one way or the other
[4171.48 → 4172.92] So someone like Apple
[4172.92 → 4173.50] might set their
[4173.50 → 4174.58] Canadian pricing today
[4174.58 → 4175.64] and then if the CAD
[4175.64 → 4176.18] goes up
[4176.18 → 4177.32] relative to the USD
[4177.32 → 4177.70] will be like
[4177.70 → 4178.18] okay great
[4178.18 → 4178.66] we made some more
[4178.66 → 4179.18] profit on that
[4179.18 → 4179.36] woo
[4179.36 → 4179.76] woo
[4179.76 → 4180.04] woo
[4180.04 → 4181.32] not to say
[4181.32 → 4181.70] that they
[4181.70 → 4182.86] that they necessarily
[4182.86 → 4183.20] will
[4183.20 → 4183.86] because not all
[4183.86 → 4184.68] of Apple's expenses
[4184.68 → 4185.36] are necessarily
[4185.36 → 4186.08] in US dollars
[4186.08 → 4186.50] that's something
[4186.50 → 4187.16] people forget
[4187.16 → 4188.20] is just because
[4188.20 → 4189.12] most companies
[4189.12 → 4191.36] go USA first
[4191.36 → 4192.62] USD first
[4192.62 → 4193.90] in terms of
[4193.90 → 4194.58] their go-to market
[4194.58 → 4195.46] strategy and their
[4195.46 → 4195.98] MSRP
[4195.98 → 4197.26] that doesn't
[4197.26 → 4198.08] necessarily mean
[4198.08 → 4198.84] that the costs
[4198.84 → 4200.12] in their supply chain
[4200.12 → 4201.90] are in US dollars
[4201.90 → 4203.24] so sometimes
[4203.24 → 4204.58] even though the US
[4204.58 → 4205.28] consumer
[4205.28 → 4206.98] doesn't necessarily
[4206.98 → 4207.76] see this
[4207.76 → 4208.42] they could be making
[4208.42 → 4209.18] more or less
[4209.18 → 4210.26] from month to month
[4210.26 → 4211.96] selling at the MSRP
[4211.96 → 4212.60] that they've assigned
[4212.60 → 4213.22] Yeah you've got
[4213.22 → 4214.40] contract manufacturing
[4214.40 → 4215.28] is Foxconn Chinese
[4215.28 → 4215.76] or Taiwanese?
[4216.44 → 4217.18] Foxconn is
[4217.18 → 4217.80] Taiwan
[4217.80 → 4219.26] no hold on a second
[4219.26 → 4220.30] I believe they're
[4220.30 → 4220.86] Taiwan based
[4220.86 → 4221.62] no crap
[4221.62 → 4222.24] they might be Chinese
[4222.24 → 4222.98] we can look it up
[4222.98 → 4223.26] very quickly
[4223.26 → 4224.08] hold on
[4224.08 → 4224.60] hold on let me
[4224.60 → 4225.40] give a final answer
[4225.40 → 4226.58] before I'm going to
[4226.58 → 4226.96] go to China
[4226.96 → 4227.82] it's Taiwan
[4227.82 → 4228.82] crap
[4228.82 → 4230.18] so you have
[4230.18 → 4232.32] contract manufacturing
[4232.32 → 4232.80] in Taiwan
[4232.80 → 4233.92] and obviously Apple
[4233.92 → 4234.76] is not just
[4234.76 → 4235.14] another tech
[4235.14 → 4236.24] they have manufacturing
[4236.24 → 4236.74] in China
[4236.74 → 4237.74] oh I'm sure they do
[4237.74 → 4238.18] but you know
[4238.18 → 4239.06] Foxconn's headquartered
[4239.06 → 4239.34] in Taiwan
[4239.34 → 4240.06] either way
[4240.06 → 4240.50] but they have
[4240.50 → 4241.56] manufacturing in Asia
[4241.56 → 4242.26] and they're a huge
[4242.26 → 4242.88] multinational
[4242.88 → 4243.50] so yeah
[4243.50 → 4245.06] there's so much
[4245.06 → 4245.62] that goes on
[4245.62 → 4246.48] that's not in USD
[4246.48 → 4246.98] so
[4246.98 → 4248.18] yep
[4248.18 → 4251.82] this is interesting
[4251.82 → 4253.26] our original article
[4253.26 → 4253.80] here was from
[4253.80 → 4254.46] Ars Technica
[4254.46 → 4255.20] it was posted by
[4255.20 → 4256.50] Lola on the forum
[4256.50 → 4258.10] the FBI
[4258.10 → 4259.16] operated
[4259.16 → 4260.64] 23
[4260.64 → 4261.94] tore hidden
[4261.94 → 4263.20] child pornography
[4263.20 → 4264.04] sites
[4264.04 → 4266.52] dun dun dun dun
[4266.52 → 4268.56] deployed malware
[4268.56 → 4269.26] from them
[4269.26 → 4272.86] so this is
[4272.86 → 4273.68] so researcher
[4273.68 → 4275.62] FBI was likely
[4275.62 → 4276.06] enabled
[4276.06 → 4277.48] to run half
[4277.48 → 4278.50] of all
[4278.50 → 4279.28] child porn
[4279.28 → 4279.78] sites
[4279.78 → 4281.02] on the servers
[4281.02 → 4286.26] a little creepy
[4286.26 → 4286.96] a little ironic
[4286.96 → 4287.74] yeah
[4287.74 → 4288.34] and like
[4288.34 → 4289.20] to be clear
[4289.20 → 4290.84] they were still
[4290.84 → 4292.04] actual
[4292.04 → 4292.82] functional
[4292.82 → 4294.02] child pornography
[4294.02 → 4294.52] sites
[4294.52 → 4296.14] they upgraded them
[4296.14 → 4297.14] to make them
[4297.14 → 4298.04] run smoothly
[4298.04 → 4298.88] and all that stuff
[4298.88 → 4299.28] like they
[4299.28 → 4300.14] they
[4300.14 → 4300.74] can you imagine
[4300.74 → 4301.66] the IT person
[4301.66 → 4302.12] that's tasked
[4302.12 → 4302.66] to do that
[4302.66 → 4303.46] as like their job
[4303.46 → 4304.22] that would be
[4304.22 → 4305.80] very stomach
[4305.80 → 4306.36] turning
[4306.36 → 4307.62] to say the least
[4307.62 → 4308.22] yeah as long
[4308.22 → 4308.90] as it's not
[4308.90 → 4309.42] the scene from
[4309.42 → 4309.92] South Park
[4309.92 → 4311.08] which turns my stomach
[4311.08 → 4312.34] you know the guy
[4312.34 → 4312.80] who monitors
[4312.80 → 4313.88] the security cameras
[4313.88 → 4314.66] in the change rooms
[4314.66 → 4315.68] with the big
[4315.68 → 4316.46] bottle of lube
[4316.46 → 4317.04] next to him
[4317.04 → 4318.38] what episode
[4318.38 → 4319.04] was this
[4319.04 → 4320.22] ah I don't remember
[4320.22 → 4320.70] I'm sorry
[4320.70 → 4321.84] um
[4321.84 → 4323.86] but uh
[4323.86 → 4324.26] yeah
[4324.26 → 4324.80] basically
[4324.80 → 4325.94] they were
[4325.94 → 4326.64] they were acting
[4326.64 → 4327.32] as a
[4327.32 → 4328.10] as a giant
[4328.10 → 4329.38] um
[4329.38 → 4329.90] lure
[4329.90 → 4331.00] pretty much
[4331.00 → 4331.72] so they were using
[4331.72 → 4332.30] the sites
[4332.30 → 4333.26] keeping them
[4333.26 → 4333.74] operating
[4333.74 → 4334.80] so they were
[4334.80 → 4335.40] seizing them
[4335.40 → 4336.04] they were keeping
[4336.04 → 4336.68] them operating
[4336.68 → 4337.36] quietly
[4337.36 → 4338.90] and uh
[4338.90 → 4339.80] then they were
[4339.80 → 4340.44] just using them
[4340.44 → 4340.78] to
[4340.78 → 4341.24] to
[4341.24 → 4342.82] track down
[4342.82 → 4343.68] people who were
[4343.68 → 4344.00] uh
[4344.00 → 4344.70] trying to get
[4344.70 → 4345.42] child pornography
[4345.42 → 4346.12] it's like
[4346.12 → 4346.84] bait car
[4346.84 → 4347.54] but much more
[4347.54 → 4347.92] disturbing
[4347.92 → 4348.32] that is like
[4348.32 → 4348.94] a very
[4348.94 → 4350.16] gray legal area
[4350.16 → 4350.38] though
[4350.38 → 4350.72] I mean
[4350.72 → 4351.36] the government
[4351.36 → 4352.10] is running
[4352.10 → 4353.28] illegal websites
[4353.28 → 4355.36] I don't know
[4355.36 → 4356.24] every single
[4356.24 → 4356.84] tiny minute
[4356.84 → 4357.56] detail of that
[4357.56 → 4357.88] but I know
[4357.88 → 4359.20] generally um
[4359.20 → 4359.64] are you talking
[4359.64 → 4359.88] about like
[4359.88 → 4360.52] entrapment
[4360.52 → 4361.16] or are you talking
[4361.16 → 4362.06] just about the fact
[4362.06 → 4362.76] they're actually
[4362.76 → 4363.48] running a child
[4363.48 → 4363.88] porn site
[4363.88 → 4364.24] to catch people
[4364.24 → 4364.68] no I'm not
[4364.68 → 4365.10] talking about
[4365.10 → 4365.58] entrapment
[4365.58 → 4366.68] because entrapment
[4366.68 → 4367.60] you have to be
[4367.60 → 4368.38] looking for a
[4368.38 → 4369.16] child porn site
[4369.16 → 4369.80] to find it
[4369.80 → 4370.28] yeah exactly
[4370.28 → 4371.24] entrapment
[4371.24 → 4371.44] yeah
[4371.44 → 4371.96] okay do you want
[4371.96 → 4372.36] to explain the
[4372.36 → 4372.60] difference
[4372.60 → 4373.08] you're the legal
[4373.08 → 4373.32] guy
[4373.32 → 4374.50] okay so um
[4374.50 → 4375.70] the general rule
[4375.70 → 4376.36] with entrapment
[4376.36 → 4377.12] in the U.S.
[4377.24 → 4378.34] is just giving
[4378.34 → 4379.26] the like if you
[4379.26 → 4379.82] ever watch the show
[4379.82 → 4380.40] bait car
[4380.40 → 4381.04] where the cops
[4381.04 → 4381.90] will they'll get
[4381.90 → 4382.38] a car
[4382.38 → 4383.02] and they'll leave
[4383.02 → 4383.70] it is like they'll
[4383.70 → 4384.18] take it to like
[4384.18 → 4385.24] an area that's like
[4385.24 → 4386.00] it's high crime
[4386.00 → 4386.44] there's been a lot
[4386.44 → 4387.44] of car thefts
[4387.44 → 4388.44] they'll park it
[4388.44 → 4389.08] in a parking lot
[4389.08 → 4389.58] or on the curb
[4389.58 → 4389.98] and they'll just
[4389.98 → 4390.78] leave it running
[4390.78 → 4391.46] and they'll walk
[4391.46 → 4392.32] away, and they'll
[4392.32 → 4392.82] just wait for
[4392.82 → 4393.40] someone to come
[4393.40 → 4394.08] and try to steal
[4394.08 → 4395.62] it and so um
[4395.62 → 4396.28] the person steals
[4396.28 → 4396.82] the car and they
[4396.82 → 4397.46] drop for a bit
[4397.46 → 4398.44] but the cops have
[4398.44 → 4399.30] like a have
[4399.30 → 4400.02] a remote switch
[4400.02 → 4400.46] that can both
[4400.46 → 4401.10] kill the engine
[4401.10 → 4401.92] and lock the door
[4401.92 → 4403.18] so not only does
[4403.18 → 4403.92] it demobilizes the
[4403.92 → 4404.56] car but the PERP
[4404.56 → 4405.10] can't go anywhere
[4405.10 → 4405.68] so they come in
[4405.68 → 4406.10] and make a very
[4406.10 → 4406.86] easy arrest
[4406.86 → 4407.54] and we have a
[4407.54 → 4408.14] bait car program
[4408.14 → 4408.54] here too
[4408.54 → 4409.78] and so you can
[4409.78 → 4410.38] and the reason
[4410.38 → 4410.98] the cops can do
[4410.98 → 4411.68] this is because
[4411.68 → 4413.30] just giving someone
[4413.30 → 4414.02] the opportunity
[4414.02 → 4415.28] to commit a crime
[4415.28 → 4416.08] is not considered
[4416.08 → 4416.70] entrapment
[4416.70 → 4417.30] entrapment
[4417.30 → 4418.04] becomes a defence
[4418.04 → 4419.42] when um
[4419.42 → 4420.60] basically the cops
[4420.60 → 4421.86] induce someone
[4421.86 → 4422.78] to commit a crime
[4422.78 → 4423.28] they otherwise
[4423.28 → 4424.16] wouldn't have
[4424.16 → 4425.24] but it's like
[4425.24 → 4426.00] if you go to court
[4426.00 → 4426.46] it's a hard
[4426.46 → 4426.84] example
[4426.84 → 4428.40] oh Geez
[4428.40 → 4429.02] um it's actually
[4429.02 → 4429.84] a good question
[4429.84 → 4430.86] because it's so rare
[4430.86 → 4431.96] that like entrapment
[4431.96 → 4433.34] defences are very hard
[4433.34 → 4434.16] to like to get through
[4434.16 → 4435.02] okay so let's come up
[4435.02 → 4435.74] with a hypothetical
[4435.74 → 4437.46] a hypothetical defence
[4437.46 → 4439.64] um next to
[4439.64 → 4441.22] next to a
[4441.22 → 4443.24] a fly swatter
[4443.24 → 4444.08] store
[4444.08 → 4445.10] they unleash
[4445.10 → 4445.66] a swarm
[4445.66 → 4446.72] of angry bees
[4446.72 → 4447.34] on someone
[4447.34 → 4448.10] prompting them
[4448.10 → 4448.82] to run in
[4448.82 → 4450.08] shoplift one
[4450.08 → 4451.02] and swat the bees
[4451.02 → 4451.56] and then they
[4451.56 → 4452.10] accuse them of
[4452.10 → 4453.82] stealing a fly swatter
[4453.82 → 4455.18] like is that kind of
[4455.18 → 4455.74] would that be
[4455.74 → 4456.46] entrapment then
[4456.46 → 4457.34] I'm no expert
[4457.34 → 4458.26] but I feel like
[4458.26 → 4459.46] that's that's a heck
[4459.46 → 4460.14] of a lot closer
[4460.14 → 4461.04] to it than
[4461.04 → 4461.60] you know
[4461.60 → 4462.32] some of the other
[4462.32 → 4462.86] stuff that I've
[4462.86 → 4463.70] heard people think
[4463.70 → 4465.44] that that people
[4465.44 → 4466.42] think qualifies
[4466.42 → 4467.00] as entrapment
[4467.00 → 4467.48] so okay
[4467.48 → 4467.94] so yeah
[4467.94 → 4468.90] but yeah I mean
[4468.90 → 4469.70] even with that
[4469.70 → 4470.70] question aside
[4470.70 → 4471.66] yeah I mean
[4471.66 → 4472.48] I can see why
[4472.48 → 4473.04] they're trying to
[4473.04 → 4473.40] do that
[4473.40 → 4473.88] but at the same
[4473.88 → 4474.68] time it's like
[4474.68 → 4475.18] you know
[4475.18 → 4475.88] it would be
[4475.88 → 4476.76] like I said
[4476.76 → 4477.02] it would be
[4477.02 → 4477.56] pretty stomach
[4477.56 → 4478.28] turning to be
[4478.28 → 4478.90] like the people
[4478.90 → 4479.56] from the FBI
[4479.56 → 4480.00] who are actually
[4480.00 → 4480.64] working on that
[4480.64 → 4482.20] so anyway
[4482.20 → 4483.22] speaking of
[4483.22 → 4483.90] stomach turning
[4483.90 → 4484.80] AT&T
[4484.80 → 4486.12] oh my god
[4486.12 → 4487.70] AT&T will be
[4487.70 → 4488.74] downgrading mobile
[4488.74 → 4489.48] video streams
[4489.48 → 4490.48] by default
[4490.48 → 4491.32] next year
[4491.32 → 4492.56] stream saver
[4492.56 → 4493.14] which you can
[4493.14 → 4493.84] opt out of
[4493.84 → 4494.34] will limit
[4494.34 → 4495.66] video to DVD
[4495.66 → 4496.14] quality
[4496.14 → 4497.10] unless you
[4497.10 → 4497.80] turn it off
[4497.80 → 4498.56] now
[4498.56 → 4499.86] let's hold on
[4499.86 → 4500.28] let's get through
[4500.28 → 4500.74] all the facts
[4500.74 → 4501.08] here
[4501.08 → 4501.94] in early
[4501.94 → 4502.72] 2017
[4502.72 → 4503.16] they'll turn
[4503.16 → 4503.78] on stream saver
[4503.78 → 4504.50] by default
[4504.50 → 4505.12] the company says
[4505.12 → 4505.62] they'll let people
[4505.62 → 4505.96] know when it
[4505.96 → 4506.56] goes into effect
[4506.56 → 4507.10] they'll include
[4507.10 → 4507.64] instructions on
[4507.64 → 4508.14] how to disable
[4508.14 → 4508.36] it
[4508.36 → 4509.70] you know what
[4509.70 → 4510.44] I'm going to be
[4510.44 → 4511.16] really
[4511.16 → 4511.92] unpopular right
[4511.92 → 4512.36] now and I'm
[4512.36 → 4512.76] going to say
[4512.76 → 4513.64] go for it
[4513.64 → 4514.82] I actually have
[4514.82 → 4515.32] no problem
[4515.32 → 4515.64] with this
[4515.64 → 4515.84] whatsoever
[4515.84 → 4516.22] I was gonna
[4516.22 → 4516.74] say the same
[4516.74 → 4516.98] thing
[4516.98 → 4517.34] I mean to
[4517.34 → 4518.26] me if you
[4518.26 → 4518.94] are
[4518.94 → 4519.96] as long as
[4519.96 → 4520.28] they make it
[4520.28 → 4520.68] clear
[4520.68 → 4521.82] like this is
[4521.82 → 4522.16] happening
[4522.16 → 4522.60] here's how
[4522.60 → 4523.00] to disable
[4523.00 → 4523.14] it
[4523.14 → 4523.40] they make it
[4523.40 → 4523.84] easy to
[4523.84 → 4525.04] because a lot
[4525.04 → 4525.36] of people
[4525.36 → 4525.60] if they're
[4525.60 → 4526.06] watching on a
[4526.06 → 4526.60] smartphone
[4526.60 → 4527.30] let's say
[4527.30 → 4527.70] you're watching
[4527.70 → 4528.10] about this
[4528.10 → 4528.48] distance
[4528.48 → 4529.08] a lot of
[4529.08 → 4529.40] folks won't
[4529.40 → 4529.84] be able to
[4529.84 → 4530.24] tell the difference
[4530.24 → 4531.20] between 480
[4531.20 → 4532.24] and 720 to
[4532.24 → 4532.78] begin with
[4532.78 → 4534.00] and it'll also
[4534.00 → 4534.56] keep you from
[4534.56 → 4535.54] eating up tons
[4535.54 → 4536.24] and tons of
[4536.24 → 4536.62] bandwidth
[4536.62 → 4537.34] there are some
[4537.34 → 4538.02] mobile providers
[4538.02 → 4538.52] that are offering
[4538.52 → 4539.72] like free YouTube
[4539.72 → 4540.24] now where it
[4540.24 → 4540.62] doesn't count
[4540.62 → 4540.94] against your
[4540.94 → 4541.62] limit or free
[4541.62 → 4542.32] Netflix but not
[4542.32 → 4542.90] everyone does
[4542.90 → 4543.34] that and that
[4543.34 → 4543.98] congests the
[4543.98 → 4545.12] network overall
[4545.12 → 4546.50] when what this
[4546.50 → 4547.46] will do is
[4547.46 → 4548.26] free up more
[4548.26 → 4549.04] bandwidth for me
[4549.04 → 4549.38] when I'm trying
[4549.38 → 4549.72] to freaking
[4549.72 → 4550.86] I mean I'm not
[4550.86 → 4551.64] an 1810 customer
[4551.64 → 4552.30] but when I'm like
[4552.30 → 4554.20] trying to freaking
[4554.20 → 4554.96] load up a map
[4554.96 → 4555.66] like right now
[4555.66 → 4556.12] and I'm in a
[4556.12 → 4556.32] hurry
[4556.32 → 4558.26] I actually don't
[4558.26 → 4559.54] see this as a
[4559.54 → 4560.46] terrible way to
[4560.46 → 4561.20] lower congestion
[4561.20 → 4562.94] now you could go
[4562.94 → 4563.64] you could just say
[4563.64 → 4564.48] well 1810 should
[4564.48 → 4564.96] just build more
[4564.96 → 4565.54] towers and they
[4565.54 → 4566.20] should be but
[4566.20 → 4566.86] what you also have
[4566.86 → 4567.26] to understand
[4567.26 → 4568.74] money is that
[4568.74 → 4569.44] does cost money
[4569.44 → 4570.36] and like that
[4570.36 → 4571.04] is a solution
[4571.04 → 4572.02] but it's only
[4572.02 → 4572.90] sort of solution
[4572.90 → 4573.80] because there is
[4573.80 → 4575.26] a limited amount
[4575.26 → 4577.32] of like airspace
[4577.32 → 4578.84] reserved for mobile
[4578.84 → 4579.54] data spectrum
[4579.54 → 4580.70] spectrum we like
[4580.70 → 4581.96] don't actually have
[4581.96 → 4583.20] a ton left
[4583.20 → 4584.60] so finding ways
[4584.60 → 4585.74] to make better
[4585.74 → 4586.58] use of it
[4586.58 → 4588.44] is actually a
[4588.44 → 4588.90] good thing
[4588.90 → 4590.18] and from my
[4590.18 → 4590.70] perspective
[4590.70 → 4591.60] and it's funny
[4591.60 → 4592.02] because it'll be
[4592.02 → 4592.88] the tech enthusiasts
[4592.88 → 4593.92] who are the ones
[4593.92 → 4594.52] who are perfectly
[4594.52 → 4595.70] capable of turning
[4595.70 → 4596.38] this off
[4596.38 → 4597.26] who are whining
[4597.26 → 4597.86] about this
[4597.86 → 4599.96] when I don't
[4599.96 → 4601.98] think 95 percent
[4601.98 → 4602.78] of people will
[4602.78 → 4604.42] ever even notice
[4604.42 → 4605.42] yeah it's
[4605.42 → 4606.34] look at how long
[4606.34 → 4607.28] the move from
[4607.28 → 4608.60] DVD to Blu-ray
[4608.60 → 4609.00] took
[4609.00 → 4611.12] people and that's
[4611.12 → 4612.04] that's on a big
[4612.04 → 4612.62] screen
[4612.62 → 4615.16] people don't
[4615.16 → 4616.16] really care
[4616.16 → 4616.56] and that didn't
[4616.56 → 4617.48] even fully happen
[4617.48 → 4618.14] and no
[4618.14 → 4619.66] and the thing it
[4619.66 → 4620.52] got replaced with
[4620.52 → 4621.36] was streaming
[4621.36 → 4623.36] which enthusiasts
[4623.36 → 4624.80] will defend all day
[4624.80 → 4625.56] streaming is great
[4625.56 → 4626.24] yes it is
[4626.24 → 4627.70] but it also is
[4627.70 → 4630.18] not a proper
[4630.18 → 4631.52] 1080p experience
[4631.52 → 4632.48] compared to
[4632.48 → 4633.56] what we have
[4633.56 → 4634.46] the technology we
[4634.46 → 4635.32] have where you can
[4635.32 → 4635.86] buy a movie on
[4635.86 → 4636.76] Blu-ray and it
[4636.76 → 4637.42] looks a lot better
[4637.42 → 4638.02] than if you stream
[4638.02 → 4638.28] it
[4638.28 → 4639.54] better audio too
[4639.54 → 4640.58] much better audio
[4640.58 → 4642.32] so I'm kind
[4642.32 → 4642.92] of looking at this
[4642.92 → 4643.90] going yeah I'm
[4643.90 → 4644.50] sure i kind of
[4644.50 → 4645.22] agree with this
[4645.22 → 4646.94] um, so there's
[4646.94 → 4648.40] that I'm sure
[4648.40 → 4650.38] that uh I'm
[4650.38 → 4650.90] going to do another
[4650.90 → 4651.38] I'm going to do
[4651.38 → 4652.04] another ranked
[4652.04 → 4653.76] video or I'm
[4653.76 → 4654.20] going to do another
[4654.20 → 4655.02] ranked straw poll
[4655.02 → 4657.02] um while Linus
[4657.02 → 4657.92] gets that set up
[4657.92 → 4659.72] um dad sent me a
[4659.72 → 4660.50] text and he
[4660.50 → 4660.86] was talking about
[4660.86 → 4661.30] the celebrity
[4661.30 → 4661.80] strength to move
[4661.80 → 4662.36] to Canada he
[4662.36 → 4662.90] was wondering if
[4662.90 → 4663.54] you guys can also
[4663.54 → 4664.26] take back Justin
[4664.26 → 4666.24] beaver uh no
[4666.24 → 4668.80] absolutely not
[4668.80 → 4670.04] why not why
[4670.04 → 4670.44] would we
[4670.44 → 4672.50] pump some money
[4672.50 → 4673.06] into the Canadian
[4673.06 → 4674.22] economy people who
[4674.22 → 4674.84] like terrible music
[4674.84 → 4675.26] I don't know
[4675.26 → 4676.02] pump some money
[4676.02 → 4676.68] no because the
[4676.68 → 4677.58] people who can the
[4677.58 → 4678.30] people who buy his
[4678.30 → 4679.64] music are still here
[4679.64 → 4680.44] still putting the
[4680.44 → 4680.88] money into the
[4680.88 → 4681.56] economy he doesn't
[4681.56 → 4682.16] have to be here for
[4682.16 → 4683.16] that concerts though
[4683.16 → 4685.50] he can perform here
[4685.50 → 4686.30] without living here
[4686.30 → 4686.86] what about like
[4686.86 → 4688.08] survivor Canada we
[4688.08 → 4689.10] can send beaver to
[4689.10 → 4690.64] like you know
[4690.64 → 4691.90] somewhere the Yukon
[4691.90 → 4693.72] survivor Canada
[4693.72 → 4694.56] send to the Yukon
[4694.56 → 4695.44] I think survivor's
[4695.44 → 4696.36] gone now isn't it
[4696.36 → 4697.04] I think it's still
[4697.04 → 4697.98] going I could be wrong
[4697.98 → 4698.98] maybe it was
[4698.98 → 4700.10] American Idol that
[4700.10 → 4700.90] was gone now or
[4700.90 → 4701.48] something I was
[4701.48 → 4702.06] like oh that
[4702.06 → 4703.16] popular survivor
[4703.16 → 4705.94] um they're on
[4705.94 → 4708.02] survivor 33 now
[4708.02 → 4708.60] we've had that
[4708.60 → 4709.58] many good lords
[4709.58 → 4711.14] so many let's see
[4711.14 → 4712.30] wow yeah we're
[4712.30 → 4713.18] still going okay
[4713.18 → 4713.88] never mind then
[4713.88 → 4714.60] the series was
[4714.60 → 4715.10] renewed for a
[4715.10 → 4716.06] 33rd season
[4716.06 → 4717.20] survivor millennials
[4717.20 → 4718.08] versus generation
[4718.08 → 4719.22] x which sounds like
[4719.22 → 4721.12] the most horrible
[4721.12 → 4722.40] horrible concept for
[4722.40 → 4723.66] a survivor series ever
[4723.66 → 4724.56] debuted on September
[4724.56 → 4725.60] 21st 2016 don't they
[4725.60 → 4726.66] all sound like the
[4726.66 → 4727.36] most this sounds
[4727.36 → 4728.44] especially horrible
[4728.44 → 4732.00] um so apparently i
[4732.00 → 4732.94] am not that unpopular
[4732.94 → 4734.58] now for my thoughts
[4734.58 → 4735.98] on the whole 480p
[4735.98 → 4738.00] thing what's like the
[4738.00 → 4738.90] most of the least like
[4738.90 → 4740.32] it's one least unpopular
[4740.32 → 4741.48] I didn't make that
[4741.48 → 4743.24] clear so
[4743.24 → 4747.22] so this is either like
[4747.22 → 4748.84] perfect or pretty
[4748.84 → 4749.92] bad I'm not sure
[4749.92 → 4752.32] well at least you know
[4752.32 → 4753.28] that they feel strongly
[4753.28 → 4754.08] about what about you
[4754.08 → 4754.92] one way or another and
[4754.92 → 4755.44] that's better than
[4755.44 → 4755.80] apathy
[4755.80 → 4758.76] thank you john i
[4758.76 → 4759.60] appreciate that
[4759.60 → 4761.00] he pays me to say
[4761.00 → 4761.66] this stuff no I'm
[4761.66 → 4761.78] kidding
[4761.78 → 4764.98] um all right last
[4764.98 → 4765.82] article for the day
[4765.82 → 4766.54] this was posted by
[4766.54 → 4767.44] accepted on the
[4767.44 → 4769.22] forum google will
[4769.22 → 4770.70] soon ban fake news
[4770.70 → 4771.56] sites from using its
[4771.56 → 4772.34] ad network this
[4772.34 → 4773.32] cutting off their
[4773.32 → 4774.56] revenue streams this
[4774.56 → 4775.54] seems to be a direct
[4775.54 → 4776.56] response to the
[4776.56 → 4777.84] election of president
[4777.84 → 4778.68] elect Donald Trump
[4778.68 → 4781.96] um who I don't think
[4781.96 → 4782.76] google has actually
[4782.76 → 4783.90] officially acknowledged
[4783.90 → 4784.88] that they have any
[4784.88 → 4785.90] responsibility for it
[4785.90 → 4786.84] and Facebook straight
[4786.84 → 4788.18] up went nope we're
[4788.18 → 4788.98] washing our hands of
[4788.98 → 4792.14] this um but basically
[4792.14 → 4794.32] fake news including
[4794.32 → 4796.60] uh a blog that had
[4796.60 → 4797.76] risen to the top of
[4797.76 → 4799.14] google's results for
[4799.14 → 4800.24] U.S. election final
[4800.24 → 4801.02] result or something like
[4801.02 → 4801.70] that claiming that
[4801.70 → 4802.60] trump had won the
[4802.60 → 4803.72] popular vote that
[4803.72 → 4804.34] didn't end up being
[4804.34 → 4806.08] true at all um fake
[4806.08 → 4808.58] news and inaccurate
[4808.58 → 4810.46] reporting played a large
[4810.46 → 4812.62] role one way or the
[4812.62 → 4815.02] other in the election
[4815.02 → 4816.22] campaign that we just
[4816.22 → 4817.62] witnessed would it have
[4817.62 → 4818.84] changed the outcome if
[4818.84 → 4819.52] everything that was
[4819.52 → 4821.72] reported was true I don't
[4821.72 → 4822.48] know I'm not going to get
[4822.48 → 4823.24] into that it's not my
[4823.24 → 4825.20] problem but what we do
[4825.20 → 4827.06] know is that google even
[4827.06 → 4828.90] if they haven't said that
[4828.90 → 4829.68] that's why they're doing
[4829.68 → 4832.82] it and even if they don't
[4832.82 → 4834.34] feel bad about their
[4834.34 → 4835.94] involvement or whatever
[4835.94 → 4837.54] else the case maybe they
[4837.54 → 4839.02] are moving to make that
[4839.02 → 4840.42] less of a thing moving
[4840.42 → 4842.64] forward by cutting off
[4842.64 → 4844.70] AdSense from sites that
[4844.70 → 4846.52] use its ad network fund
[4846.52 → 4847.72] themselves create fake
[4847.72 → 4848.86] news to get headlines to
[4848.86 → 4850.36] get traffic and pay
[4850.36 → 4852.74] themselves for posting
[4852.74 → 4854.12] misleading information I do
[4854.12 → 4855.46] hope that will help and
[4855.46 → 4857.38] also Facebook I think
[4857.38 → 4859.02] super super super needs to
[4859.02 → 4859.72] get this act together
[4859.72 → 4861.14] because the Facebook
[4861.14 → 4862.54] trending feature used to
[4862.54 → 4864.06] be pretty good they got
[4864.06 → 4865.20] rid of their human editors
[4865.20 → 4866.66] if that headline i
[4866.66 → 4867.50] remember was correct
[4867.50 → 4869.86] they got rid of them they
[4869.86 → 4870.52] replaced it with an
[4870.52 → 4872.04] automated algorithm and
[4872.04 → 4873.14] the stuff that appears now
[4873.14 → 4874.12] half of it is just complete
[4874.12 → 4875.58] junk, and it's its similar
[4875.58 → 4876.76] to what's going on with
[4876.76 → 4878.32] google I don't know if
[4878.32 → 4879.24] you've noticed this or not
[4879.24 → 4879.88] I'm not sure how much time
[4879.88 → 4880.84] you spend on Facebook but
[4880.84 → 4883.14] very, very little I post
[4883.14 → 4885.28] updates to the Ltd Facebook
[4885.28 → 4887.44] page and then i promptly
[4887.44 → 4888.62] navigate away from the site
[4888.62 → 4889.94] trend yeah trending is
[4889.94 → 4891.30] basically it's basically
[4891.30 → 4892.32] garbage at this point on
[4892.32 → 4894.48] Facebook and what's sad is
[4894.48 → 4896.32] that both the stuff that
[4896.32 → 4897.84] google um is trying to deal
[4897.84 → 4898.72] with here and also with
[4898.72 → 4901.60] Facebook is um is its just
[4901.60 → 4902.56] like these fake news sites
[4902.56 → 4904.42] it's usually one of the two
[4904.42 → 4906.50] large political echo chambers
[4906.50 → 4908.20] and that and people will
[4908.20 → 4909.18] gravitate towards whichever
[4909.18 → 4910.00] one suits their preferences
[4910.00 → 4911.22] and they get their quote
[4911.22 → 4912.74] unquote news from there so
[4912.74 → 4915.32] um but if you don't keep a
[4915.32 → 4916.14] close eye on this kind of
[4916.14 → 4916.92] stuff you're not going to
[4916.92 → 4918.18] know you're not
[4918.18 → 4919.24] going to realize hey
[4919.24 → 4920.58] something's happened here
[4920.58 → 4921.96] where these sites are they're
[4921.96 → 4923.00] adjusting their you know
[4923.00 → 4923.60] they're adjusting either
[4923.60 → 4924.84] their SEO or how they write
[4924.84 → 4926.24] headlines or anything else to
[4926.24 → 4927.88] to get to the top of these
[4927.88 → 4929.08] lists and to be taken more
[4929.08 → 4929.94] seriously which is why
[4929.94 → 4930.90] everyone should watch the
[4930.90 → 4933.64] land show the world's only
[4933.64 → 4935.56] source of actual unbiased
