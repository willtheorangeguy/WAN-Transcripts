[0.00 → 6.08] yeah you have to post like okay all right so are we live so the real question we should be asking
[6.08 → 12.08] ourselves right now um aside from why is Linus streaming from the nerd fusion studio
[12.08 → 18.24] here in Seattle is why is it that with a supposed professional streamer in a supposed
[18.24 → 24.00] professional streaming studio I still can't start the show on time well we were do you want me to
[24.00 → 29.60] answer that go ahead man hit me I can take the blame hit me with your best shot hit me with your
[29.60 → 33.52] best shot I mean it could be because we were filming until 10 minutes after we were supposed to be
[33.52 → 39.92] live okay non-live yes that that could have had something to do with it so yeah actually I guess
[39.92 → 44.96] I'll answer the other burning question on everyone's minds why the hell am I here and the
[44.96 → 50.88] answer is we are down here filming a collab with Matt Severus from nerd fusion we are actually
[50.88 → 58.08] installing that server that we live-streamed the build of like a month ago about a month ago yeah
[58.08 → 64.48] was about a month ago so we were going to ship it down here, but it kept you know I kept not getting
[64.48 → 70.88] around to fixing the problems that he caused when he installed an extra motherboard standoff which I'm
[70.88 → 78.56] pretty sure I didn't do that what I think it was already in there and i just sort of okay so for those of
[78.56 → 88.16] you who watched the live stream you probably saw me ask not one not two but at least three times are
[88.16 → 93.68] you sure are you sure you don't have an extra motherboard standoff and the thing wouldn't post
[93.68 → 100.96] when he left the office so I was stuck diagnosing it by myself after hours at my office listen after
[100.96 → 107.12] hours at my office I was diagnosing it by myself it added drama it added no drama we weren't filming
[108.16 → 113.68] no one got to experience there's drama right now yeah no one got to experience the drama in real time
[113.68 → 120.56] and isn't that everything I want this to be the Linus troll now where everybody who visits
[120.56 → 129.36] your studio just installs an extra standoff oh so anyway we were luckily okay so some of the uh some of
[129.36 → 135.28] the solder points at the back of one of the ram slots are actually like bent over from the motherboard
[135.28 → 142.40] being done I send you the picture you did, and it's fine it works so it's fine okay so it works now so
[142.40 → 147.12] we're down here we installed it we're going to have a video coming very soon where we tell you guys
[147.12 → 153.04] exactly what the crap a bunch of twitch streamers need a like fifteen thousand dollar server in their
[153.04 → 157.92] closet for that's about what that thing costs you know I mean those CPUs alone are like four grand
[157.92 → 162.48] plus or something like that yeah so uh okay so we're we're going to get that going we've also got
[162.48 → 169.60] a bunch of great topics for you guys today including but not limited to uh the Galaxy Note 7 which i
[170.16 → 178.00] posted a very glowing review of I still use it last night well yours didn't explode how great would it
[178.00 → 182.56] be if it happened on camera though well using it's okay just don't try to charge it oh that's what it is
[182.56 → 189.44] right, right okay no problem so we'll talk a little bit about why the shipments have been suspended and
[189.44 → 194.96] a recall notice has been issued for the note 7. uh we are also going to have probably I imagine this
[194.96 → 200.48] will be one of our longer discussions a chat about YouTube being accused of censoring vloggers
[201.12 → 210.80] the EU has demanded that Apple Pay 13 billion euros plus interest in taxes owed to Ireland and a lot of
[210.80 → 215.92] you have been asking me for this up until now I have maintained my silence we will be talking about
[215.92 → 221.84] the tech syndicate controversy um something that has been very much a developing story that I haven't
[221.84 → 226.00] looked at today, so my information may actually be out of date but hey let's face it you don't watch
[226.00 → 232.00] the wands show for the absolute latest in news because a lot of it is from like the previous Saturday
[232.00 → 236.96] let's roll the intro that's a shining endorsement I don't even know why anyone watches this show
[236.96 → 244.56] you could be watching literally anything else right now, but you tuned in here and we
[244.56 → 246.72] appreciate that we do
[256.00 → 260.16] you show the time in the intro why would a motherboard stand-off kill the motherboard
[260.16 → 264.88] just because it was ball bent because it was in the wrong spot because there was no hole there
[264.88 → 271.76] there was no hole there oh, oh wow well that's a mistake I mean it wasn't that big of a deal well
[271.76 → 276.88] well it didn't end up being that big of a deal for you as someone who speaks from experience okay I'm
[276.88 → 282.40] not going to claim I've never done it you can kill motherboards that way have you done this we were
[282.40 → 286.96] lucky we could have also killed a dim because that standoff would have been shorting out those solder
[286.96 → 293.44] points under the memory slot, and we had that dim installed so luckily that dim works the server works but um
[293.44 → 298.32] well there you go all right so I've got pretty much everyone in the twitch chat um accusing us of
[298.32 → 304.96] this being an archive stream it is in fact an archive stream so you guys are honest I mean it's
[304.96 → 310.56] not even like me addressing the people saying the stream is archived is proof of any sort that this is
[310.56 → 315.12] not an archive stream because that happens all the time yeah you're just really smart I could totally
[315.12 → 320.24] fake that at any given moment and there would be a message in twitch chat saying that it's archived so
[320.24 → 324.32] well you guys are on to us, I think this is the first thing that's actually been pre-recorded in
[324.32 → 330.80] this room ever yep so we're setting all kinds of twitch terms of service violating milestones today
[330.80 → 337.28] maybe we should start whipping out the nipples I mean so if you whip out a nipple on my twitch channel
[337.28 → 342.32] who's in trouble you are I am yeah, yeah so I'm responsible for your actions you are that's
[342.32 → 347.92] unfortunate completely it's very unfortunate for you uh the other big thing people are demanding to know is
[347.92 → 352.32] where the crap is Luke he's actually on the pax show floor covering all kinds of cool stuff
[352.32 → 359.76] including but not limited to i heard a rumour that somewhere on the show floor there is a working baby
[359.76 → 366.32] lake sample so uh for those of you who don't know which is probably just you are actually sorry Taryn yeah
[366.32 → 371.44] uh for so for those of you who don't know that is intel's upcoming CPU architecture the successor to
[371.44 → 377.84] skylight only a bit like behind the scenes people can see it well like it depends how obnoxious you
[377.84 → 383.76] are when you walk into the booth so if you're the kind of person who takes a behind closed doors
[383.76 → 389.52] demo kicks the door down grabs the product and points a camera at it then you might have footage
[389.52 → 394.72] of it before anyone else does is that what you did that is the kind of publication we are yes my friend
[395.52 → 404.96] so uh consider it not a rumour um there will be there will be a video so baby lake is coming um so
[404.96 → 410.48] anyway Luke's on the floor there are all kinds of great stuff Logitech has their new 69 dollars across
[410.48 → 415.36] the board set of gaming peripherals that they're showing off um I think we should do a 69 dollar
[415.36 → 422.96] is that real they're really doing 69 yeah the mouse is 69 yeah you can spill they spilled a whole
[422.96 → 427.76] they spilled a whole beer on it during the party really yeah oh I wasn't there yeah it's like it's like a
[427.76 → 435.52] a beer proof keyboard for 69 really yeah that's very cool you know what's hilarious is the only
[435.52 → 441.92] time I've ever really seen that in the past is on Lenovo ThinkPads so IBM used to have uh used to have
[441.92 → 446.72] spill proof keyboards they actually had drainage built into the keyboard so that if you spilled an
[446.72 → 451.76] entire like cup of coffee on it is would actually drain out the bottom of the laptop and bypass all
[451.76 → 456.16] these sensitive internals oh wow probably still sticky there yeah yeah probably still stick I mean
[456.16 → 461.68] coffee is not ideal but especially if it was water you'd be okay but I mean by sort of my logic for
[461.68 → 465.60] something like that is that well hey if you can spill coffee down it, you can probably spill isopropyl
[465.60 → 471.60] down it, and then you can leave the stickiness that way right you know now you're thinking with portals
[471.60 → 477.20] this is with a Kleenex wait sorry what are we talking about what um okay so why don't we jump into our
[477.20 → 484.08] first topic here I think this one is going to be this one is going to be a Linus and Matt top
[484.08 → 489.28] Matt or Severus do you care more people call me Matt nowadays actually than Severus which is surprising
[489.28 → 494.88] you know what's funny is we used to do something similar at leg so I've always gone by yeah I've
[494.88 → 500.16] always gone by Linus because not because I thought it was a good idea but because I didn't have the
[500.16 → 505.12] foresight to use a fake name I actually have a lot of people accuse me of Linus being a fake name and i
[505.12 → 510.64] kind of go that would have been smart it's a perfect fake name yeah yeah it is maybe it
[510.64 → 515.28] really like I've seen I've seen the ultimate troll right here yeah right here I've seen furious
[515.28 → 522.80] posts under our videos about how I'm trading on the fame of Linus Torvalds by who is that
[523.52 → 530.72] really Linus well he's Swedish so that's how they pronounce it all right listen I only know Americans
[530.72 → 538.56] if they is it ain't from America then it can just get out of here that would be both of us
[538.56 → 547.44] yeah uh so all right peace bye I can do this you're from America so that's true I'm actually American yeah
[547.60 → 553.68] um so, so yeah I've had people angrily say I'm just like trading on the fame of Linus Torvalds in order to
[553.68 → 557.28] get my name out there more like no, no actually I wasn't smart enough to do anything like that
[557.28 → 563.52] um but when we added people so my original camera guy at NCI who also did all the editing
[563.52 → 569.76] um who still works there and whose name is still a secret he is just the cameraman the mac guy to my
[569.76 → 576.24] pc-ness I don't even know troll me from behind the camera um he just didn't want his name or his
[576.24 → 582.00] personality out there so we called him the cameraman, and we had all this great banter between me and the
[582.00 → 587.04] cameraman who was like this like sting you know like no one knew who yeah yeah uh every once
[587.04 → 592.24] in a while you might see kind of like a reflection in a camera so we had like a whole Wilson yeah
[592.80 → 597.44] thing going on and that was where the nickname thing came from does nobody know who it is really no one
[597.44 → 602.16] knows who it is I mean I do now this is a challenge I don't know you will have no way of guessing you
[602.16 → 607.04] would have no it's not someone who currently works for you no, no they still work at NCI okay yeah and
[607.04 → 612.24] they're behind the scenes you would have no way of going okay so anyway when Luke joined i kind of
[612.24 → 617.76] went okay well I want to keep up this like the off-camera people have these nicknames and personas
[617.76 → 622.88] thing because it had worked really well like the banter was great um so we were like okay your nickname
[622.88 → 632.48] is slick because your pc is oil cooled oh yeah he was slick wasn't he yeah that's right um and then ed
[632.48 → 638.40] was diesel because I could never remember his name at the beginning and like he looks nothing
[638.40 → 644.96] like Vin Diesel, and he looks nothing like Vin Diesel um and then Brandon was b-roll for fairly
[644.96 → 650.08] obvious reasons yeah that's a good one, and so we had all of them I never got one, and you never got
[650.08 → 655.12] one because it was around that time I think that those guys were just like this is stupid we should
[655.12 → 659.36] just use our real names and I think the audience likes it better too so we just got away
[659.36 → 663.68] from it and now everyone just uses their real names so that was I don't remember where I was
[663.68 → 667.36] going with this story right so you're more Matt now so maybe that's the new thing maybe people don't
[667.36 → 673.44] like nicknames anymore I don't know if that's true I think it's because I do more business stuff nowadays
[673.44 → 680.08] i kind of go by Matt so you're a boring old man now basically oh sorry to hear that boring yeah yeah
[680.88 → 684.80] not very exciting here all right well let's talk about your exciting phone so the original article here
[684.80 → 693.36] posted by Patrick 3027 on the forum here is there we go you can ask me a question like fight like to
[693.36 → 698.96] try to be first because you always say like somebody oh this person posted first on the forum
[698.96 → 704.24] right is there like right when news like this hits like 10 articles that they're praying that you're
[704.24 → 709.04] going to shout them out on the win show I don't think it's that intense I think that I think it's i
[709.04 → 713.68] think it's six of one half it doesn't need the other so I think some people do like the opportunity to
[713.68 → 717.52] have the shout-out on the land show, but we're not consistent enough about remembering to call it out
[718.72 → 725.60] for I think people to be really that into that, but people do like especially the major
[725.60 → 731.60] contributors within the tech news and reviews from around the web forum section I think people do like
[731.60 → 736.40] to be like a major contributor, and they do like people commenting on their posts and that discussion
[736.40 → 742.80] happening so yeah when something major breaks I get like 95 of my tech news from my own forum
[742.80 → 748.48] all I have to do is go online this tech forum and if people are talking about it, it's important
[748.48 → 753.36] and if it's not on there it's probably not important that's that's actually been my rule of
[753.36 → 758.08] the thumb for like the last two years I like it yeah it's great to outsource it to the audience so
[758.72 → 765.36] there you have it Galaxy Note 7 shipments suspended over reports of exploding units now I'm glad I didn't
[765.36 → 772.64] bring mine i actually um I okay, so this is funny now normally when I do a review if I have a
[772.80 → 780.56] review unit die I actually don't bring it up I will let it slide once especially if the review unit dies
[780.56 → 788.16] in a way that is different from you sort of any other reports that I'm seeing um or if it is or if
[788.16 → 793.60] it's something that really looks like a fluke, so mine died, but it didn't explode if it is the battery had
[793.60 → 800.16] exploded your I would have died my first note seven died whoa so what happened was my Nan flash went
[800.16 → 806.40] um and that like i, and so I normally like my general policy is I don't mention a failure unless
[806.40 → 811.68] it's a failure that I can that I can identify as something that should have been preventable
[811.68 → 818.16] um with better design and something like nan flash can die that can happen that's not a knock
[818.16 → 824.24] against an intel SSD any more than it is a knock against a Samsung phone stuff can happen even if your RMA
[824.24 → 832.48] rate is 0.1 that still means that one out of every thousand units dies yeah and and and to be to like
[832.48 → 837.60] to be completely transparent with you guys like from being on the other side of it industry the
[837.60 → 846.16] sales side of it RMA rates from the know one to three percent range are considered very good um with
[846.16 → 851.68] anything above five percent considered to be getting pretty bad so that should give you some idea of what
[851.68 → 856.08] your odds are I mean that's one of the reasons that companies charge to put together a computer
[856.08 → 861.20] for you because by the time you put eight components into a system if you've got about a three to five
[861.20 → 865.44] percent failure rate on any given one of them the odds of having a 10 one is actually not that bad
[866.96 → 871.20] just something to consider that's a reason that a lot of people I know who know how to
[871.20 → 876.32] build a computer actually do pay for someone else to assemble it for them where there's a warehouse of
[876.32 → 884.32] replacement parts in the back if something does go wrong so anyway, so mine actually did die um which
[884.32 → 889.12] I don't remember what the point of me bringing up I've showered with mine but there's been no
[889.12 → 894.40] problems you okay right so that's the reason I don't have mine with me so I'm actually because
[894.40 → 899.36] I'm planning to use it as a daily driver so I'm rocking the regular s7 okay and then that's got my
[899.36 → 905.12] Canadian sim and I've got my US sim and my iPhone 6s yeah i I didn't know who was calling me earlier
[905.12 → 910.48] yeah do I answer this yeah sorry about that yes, yes that was me it was not a phone number leak
[910.48 → 915.04] um you know not that I speak from experience about that I actually have a new phone number now that
[915.04 → 922.80] is not anywhere so go Linus all right um so, so anyway yeah so it would be great if this thing it
[922.80 → 927.60] can't you said it has to be charging for it to and by the way this word explodes have you seen the
[927.60 → 933.68] pictures of it like when I think of the word explode I think of let's go yeah yeah it's more like
[933.68 → 940.48] like expanded and like smoke coming out well not in the picture I saw it was just like
[941.36 → 945.60] fatter it was like a little bit of lava leaked out yeah like that's a battery thing right yeah yeah
[945.60 → 952.80] yeah like lithium batteries will do they'll do that let me see I guess it's an explosion I want
[952.80 → 958.16] like a boom I want to see if I can find a picture so we can show you guys uh so you can, we can show you
[958.16 → 965.44] guys here blah blah blah blah blah blah blah yeah yeah I can't find it right now yeah anyway so not
[965.44 → 971.36] really the point, but they have suspended shipments of the phone to various South Korean telecoms
[971.92 → 980.00] and due to reports of exploding Galaxy Note 7s which is a real shame because I think it puts customers
[980.00 → 984.88] who are very happy with their purchase of the phone like I'm incredibly happy um in a pretty awkward
[984.88 → 991.44] position because what like what can you do as a recall now so what I'm doing is I think in most of
[991.44 → 998.48] the American carriers you have until the end of the month to go give it to them in which they will swap
[998.48 → 1005.60] it out for something of similar quality right there's a way that they put it yeah and then whenever they
[1005.60 → 1013.76] get shipments back in whenever Samsung actually starts sending things than I'll be able to go pick up you
[1013.76 → 1020.40] know pick it up again when I don't know if I'm going to do it but I mean what my goal is to wait
[1020.40 → 1026.08] it out and hope that within the next 30 days shipments come in so I can just go and swap rather
[1026.08 → 1032.88] than having to go to some lesser peon of a phone this is such a crappy position for Samsung to be in
[1032.88 → 1036.88] right now because there are a couple of things that were really going great for them on the note 7.
[1036.88 → 1042.24] apparently the blue colour which is actually what you ended up with the blue colour has just been
[1042.24 → 1048.00] phenomenally popular um so Samsung Canada was saying that by far it was the most pre-ordered colour
[1048.40 → 1054.08] um even though sexy even though this is the first time they've done a pure black phone in quite some
[1054.08 → 1059.92] time and I think they were expecting that to be a pretty big draw no, no that like metallic
[1059.92 → 1066.40] baby blue has just been super hot for them um the note 7 is a great phone, and they're absolutely
[1066.40 → 1074.64] killing the momentum on it and number three is apple is waiting on the doorstep with the iPhone
[1074.64 → 1081.76] set and iPhone 7 plus yeah it's coming in like a couple of weeks while Samsung is going to be putting
[1081.76 → 1090.32] out fires literally processing oh my god do you think so what it is it's its not Samsung's fault
[1090.32 → 1095.84] right so what there's well what I read at least is that it's not the battery cell manufacturer
[1095.84 → 1102.48] which is a subsidiary of Samsung yeah, but it is the people that take those cells and then turn it
[1102.48 → 1111.68] into the packs which is a third party that's who messed up it's a third party so could there be
[1111.68 → 1120.40] so here 's's the thing oh come on we'll pan them off to cause issues do you guys have a tinfoil
[1120.40 → 1124.32] hat prop we do we actually do but I don't know where it is can we get some tinfoil that's very
[1124.32 → 1130.24] tinfoil, but you never know you never know all right okay I doubt it okay so, so then here's the question
[1130.24 → 1137.36] for you then as an owner knowing that because it doesn't even look like all the all the
[1137.36 → 1141.20] batteries were manufactured by the particular factory that they're claiming that's true so
[1142.24 → 1150.00] Samsung is estimating that 24 units on a scale of 1 million were affected by the battery problems
[1151.20 → 1156.96] are you going to chance it are you just going to keep it I will keep it I will absolutely keep it
[1157.60 → 1164.72] if I can't just swap out if there becomes a time this month when I can swap out yeah I'll do that but
[1164.72 → 1170.08] if there's nothing in stock where I can't swap out I'm keeping it screw it all right so I mean one
[1170.08 → 1175.92] thing okay I don't fast charge often okay I occasionally do like when I'm at a con or something
[1175.92 → 1182.72] I need just let's go yeah okay normally I'm just dribbling it up okay so that actually ties in pretty
[1182.72 → 1188.16] well so a lot of people basically half the comments on my note 7 review that went up last night are um
[1188.80 → 1193.76] yo Linus great timing for this review endorsing this phone because yo the batteries are all exploding
[1193.76 → 1199.04] hot way to go that was hilarious you have to admit that was hilarious well I appreciate a good
[1199.04 → 1203.68] ironic twist as much as anyone else, and it was definitely it was there was definitely some irony
[1203.68 → 1210.48] there but to be clear my video was actually uploaded to vessel a week prior so I had no way of knowing
[1210.48 → 1217.68] about this and number two I do still think it's a very solid phone when you can get one that is not
[1217.68 → 1224.72] affected by the recall and number three in my video though unrelated to this particular phone
[1224.72 → 1231.60] and its battery issues I do say I don't recommend fast charging I don't recommend if it's a bad idea
[1231.60 → 1237.52] and there are a couple of very basic reasons for that apply to all phones it's great in a pinch if
[1237.52 → 1245.04] you're at a con, and you have 15 minutes to get like 30 battery that is a very cool piece of technology but
[1245.04 → 1252.24] charging your battery at these higher voltages does cause it to heat up more heat is bad for a
[1252.24 → 1260.00] device but to a much greater extent your battery and so if there is any way that you can avoid fast
[1260.00 → 1266.56] charging on your phone even trickle charging it at 500 Williams overnight is better because it causes
[1266.56 → 1273.68] it to not run as hot, and it is better for the cells so for me personally I have never fast charged my
[1273.68 → 1278.72] note 7.7 either of them actually, and it's something that I wouldn't really plan to do I mean I don't
[1278.72 → 1283.76] have trouble going through a whole day with this phone yeah so if you charge it at night and you
[1283.76 → 1288.88] aren't doing anything crazy like playing Pokémon Go for six hours at a time i I don't really see it as
[1288.88 → 1293.92] an issue um with that said I'm not you're not going to hear like an official minus media group
[1293.92 → 1298.56] recommendation that you not recall your phone and then go and blame me when it lights on fire in
[1298.56 → 1302.48] your pocket I don't want to open up that kind of worms recall your phone recall your phone you heard
[1302.48 → 1309.04] it here first well later after we'll see keep it away from flammable surfaces like you should do that
[1309.04 → 1315.60] anyway right oh keep it away from flat oh I got it I got it yeah keep it away from open flames that's
[1315.60 → 1321.84] all I read that yes keep it off the surface of the sun yeah yeah it's gotcha actually very hard to
[1321.84 → 1328.48] put something on the sun but yeah no i I have had every note that has ever existed and really yeah
[1328.48 → 1335.68] all the whole line and um this is by far the best definitely like bar none it also feels the best it's
[1335.68 → 1342.48] like the curves there's just so much good about it that it's definitely this is my example of how
[1343.44 → 1348.88] you don't always have to continuously do massive leaps forward right it's refined that's what this is
[1348.88 → 1353.20] right yeah you're taking a product and just constantly refining it to the point of almost
[1353.20 → 1358.48] perfection dusting except that it lights on fire except the fact that it might catch on fire yes
[1359.04 → 1363.12] I mean as long as you don't charge it ever yeah you'll be yeah I think that's that's the key okay
[1363.12 → 1368.88] yeah so as long as so it's single use omni how do you even do that I mean if i also wirelessly charge
[1368.88 → 1376.00] everything so is this so is this only through the port do you know um so I avoid wireless charging for
[1376.00 → 1381.76] the same reason yeah more heat yeah uh worse for the battery and that's another thing to consider
[1381.76 → 1388.16] if your battery is on the edge more heat could push it over the edge in a way that not more heat could
[1388.16 → 1394.56] not yeah yeah Brandon would always wirelessly charge his phone and uh his battery was just complete crap
[1394.56 → 1399.28] by the end that was on his nexus 5 right yeah I think yeah he basically had it like sitting on a
[1399.28 → 1404.40] wireless charger just all day all the time yeah oh that's yeah they topped up yeah you should probably
[1404.40 → 1411.28] just plug that thing in to charge it I mean I have to buy USB c cable I know I come on oh my phone
[1411.28 → 1417.84] might explode oh poor Matt with his big nerd fusion studio, and he can't afford a cable he has all these
[1417.84 → 1425.92] wonderful Lego dump trucks that thing is cool okay thank you Taryn that's the first thing he saw when
[1425.92 → 1431.52] you came in this room yeah I know it was we have to keep we have to like to keep him physically away from
[1431.52 → 1437.28] the leg oat work if we want him to stay focused on his editing I do it's fine I'm waiting for him to
[1437.28 → 1443.68] correct I know it's the trigger moment I think I said it so fast really you don't yeah, yeah okay
[1443.68 → 1449.60] you're not supposed to pluralize it well there's another one where people say Lego as in the company
[1449.60 → 1455.68] but it's actually the Lego group, so there's two gotchas yeah Lego is not the company that's the most
[1455.68 → 1462.88] boring fact we've ever had on the LAN show thanks oh beyond yeah I hope we didn't need that the most
[1462.88 → 1466.80] boring fact I'm just trying to think of things that we've discussed like i we've discussed like
[1466.80 → 1472.32] arguments I've had with my wife on the land show, and you took more interesting you took the boring
[1472.32 → 1478.08] cake right there well you got you know i have to top something over here i have to you know all right so
[1478.08 → 1485.12] next article this was originally posted on the forum by card death card with an e pretentious card
[1486.00 → 1495.04] and this is a European commission go in card at the end okay sorry go ahead uh European commission
[1495.04 → 1505.52] press release uh database site here we go Ireland gave illegal tax benefits to apple worth up to 13
[1505.52 → 1514.32] billion euros and the European commission has concluded that because Ireland granted these undue
[1514.32 → 1521.20] tax benefits to apple which is illegal under EU state aid rules because it allowed apple to pay
[1521.20 → 1528.40] substantially less tax than other businesses ireland must now recover that illegal aid
[1528.96 → 1535.36] and there 's are a bunch of different angles that you can go at this from I mean we've got we've got
[1535.36 → 1543.04] sort of we've got the US jumping in and saying to you know apple's an American corporation uh why
[1543.04 → 1549.36] why is Ireland all of a sudden going to be taking this 13 billion euros you know you guys can't
[1549.36 → 1553.20] be getting involved in you guys can't be getting involved in this and if you're getting involved
[1553.92 → 1559.68] why aren't we getting involved like I mean whenever 13 billion euros is changing hands you know someone's
[1559.68 → 1563.76] going to be upset about who's paying it and someone's going to be upset about who's getting it
[1563.76 → 1567.92] um, so there 's's a lot of debate there, but you know what so hold on let me just see if there's
[1567.92 → 1572.48] anything else sort of fact wise then I'll launch into sort of what I think of this so uh blah blah
[1572.48 → 1576.72] blah illegal state aid there's been a suggestion that the bill could be as much as 19 billion after
[1576.72 → 1581.76] interest is added which is pretty, pretty fun by the way I mean honestly I think it's I think it's
[1581.76 → 1586.48] bullshit to be charging apple interest on something that you told them they didn't have to pay yeah um
[1586.48 → 1592.96] um not that I'm saying that I think you know uh state-sponsored tax evasion is necessarily a good
[1592.96 → 1599.60] thing I'm just saying like is that a lot of money 19 billion euros like you must you are so American dude
[1599.60 → 1604.96] no question is like there's the man who can't afford they made they clearly had to have
[1604.96 → 1611.52] made leaps and bounds above that yes because they that's just the tax because Ireland's corporate tax rate
[1611.52 → 1618.72] is already only 12 and a half percent okay so yeah they made way more yes yeah now hang on how
[1618.72 → 1622.72] why would they give these tax breaks in the first place okay so that's a whole other discussion we'll
[1622.72 → 1627.84] get to that after um so Michael Norman the Irish finance minister favours an immediate appeal over
[1627.84 → 1633.28] the tax bill insisted that Ireland had to preserve its status as a low tax base for overseas companies
[1633.84 → 1639.84] um so we'll sort of get into that as well and that the country, so the country made deals with apple
[1639.84 → 1646.56] allowing them to pay tax on profits at a maximum of one percent oh so even compared to their 12 and a
[1646.56 → 1651.68] half percent now to put this in the appropriate context okay oh I thought this was like a different
[1651.68 → 1663.28] kind of tax in British Columbia Canada uh Linus media group pays about 25 corporate tax on its profits
[1663.28 → 1669.20] just to give you guys some idea is that federal or is that that's all together actually you know
[1669.20 → 1672.72] what i I'm going to go to a lifeline on this one because I don't want to give you guys the wrong
[1672.72 → 1681.84] facts it may actually be more both federal and um, um we live in a state where nerd fusion does not pay
[1681.84 → 1687.60] any state income tax because we don't have it really yeah oh that's right I knew that that's the whole
[1687.60 → 1692.48] reason that Vancouver Washington exists right so you can shop in Oregon with no sales tax
[1693.04 → 1697.04] and live in Washington with no income tax you just don't pay tax down there
[1698.32 → 1702.56] wow that's great where do you guys even get roads from well because we charge for the road
[1703.92 → 1709.92] the road I'm driving around the roads our roads have like some lanes that are toll lanes if you want
[1709.92 → 1716.24] to you can pay extra money to go faster basically there 's's uh net neutrality does not exist on our
[1716.24 → 1722.88] roads basically um so okay we've got a couple past lands pay to win we've got a couple more
[1722.88 → 1727.36] statements so the credit ratings agency standard and poor's pointed out that an injection of 13
[1727.36 → 1733.04] billion euros would reduce Ireland's national debt significantly I mean there okay is it a lot
[1733.04 → 1741.12] of money yes um that would be more than five percent of Ireland's gross domestic product domestic
[1741.12 → 1747.84] product five percent of Ireland's GDP um and warned that it could undermine the government at the same
[1747.84 → 1754.80] time now apple CEO Tim Cook has just graciously accepted the ruling has pulled out the check just
[1754.80 → 1762.32] kidding um has you fooled me launched and claimed, so this is a quote the European commission has
[1762.32 → 1767.60] launched an effort to rewrite apple's history in Europe what which is one way of putting it I suppose
[1767.60 → 1775.20] what ignore Ireland's tax laws and rhetoric and upend the international tax system are you kidding
[1775.20 → 1782.64] me that is what the EU commission is doing how can we stand for any of these things the international
[1782.64 → 1788.88] tax system there is no international tax system also that's not part of the thing that Brexit in
[1788.88 → 1796.56] Brexit yeah Ireland yeah is that part of that yeah so do you control it wait I don't know what
[1796.56 → 1801.52] how it's like well I can't remember hold on Scotland is Ireland yeah Ireland's in the UK right like
[1801.52 → 1805.76] what is the UK it's not crap I don't know now we're all the ignorant Americans why did you even bring it
[1805.76 → 1811.44] up oh good heavens now we look so dumb, and we should know more okay I said yes initially so let's find
[1811.44 → 1818.48] out if I'm right why it's more in the compromises four countries England Scotland wales and Northern Ireland
[1818.48 → 1824.96] so this is southern, so this is ireland okay cool so now that there's good now we know that
[1826.00 → 1832.56] it feels so we learned a thing sorry all Americans and Canadians for that matter know about that
[1832.56 → 1839.84] entire like the whole region group of islands is from brave heart yes, and it fits inside Texas fun
[1839.84 → 1847.52] fact so fun fact the kilt which was depicted in brave heart as uh being you know a thing that Scottish
[1847.52 → 1853.44] people wear uh didn't actually become commonplace or even invented for that matter until about 150
[1853.44 → 1858.08] years later after the events of the movie later after 150 years after the events of the movie
[1858.80 → 1862.40] so a more interesting fact than the Lego group yes
[1863.36 → 1869.28] Eric you're still on the bottom i I just don't care any more so let's talk about this okay this is great
[1869.28 → 1877.04] so as a corporation that pays literally uh hold on let me see if my wife who is our actual
[1877.04 → 1882.48] accountant and actually knows these things okay so whatever i I know it's deep into double digits
[1882.48 → 1887.60] so as a corporation that pays deep into double digits taxes yeah we're about the same before
[1887.60 → 1893.60] you do federally yeah oh federally oh so it's just no state tax right we don't have any state tax we
[1893.60 → 1898.72] have there is federal tax on profit yeah okay never mind okay, okay I thought I was I thought we were
[1898.72 → 1901.92] going to be able to have kind of two sides of a debate here I mean it's definitely less than yours okay
[1901.92 → 1907.44] um I really hope that I really hope that I hear back from her that seems like a lot I might even
[1907.44 → 1912.56] just call her because my understanding is so the first little bit like if you're a tiny
[1912.56 → 1918.16] company you don't actually get hit that hard but after a certain point it starts being actually quite
[1918.16 → 1923.12] a lot yeah we have that too which is why we have so I think it's like fun accounting that happens the
[1923.12 → 1929.04] first like uh for us, I think it's the first 500 000 or something like that gets taxed at a lower rate
[1929.04 → 1934.00] wow that's hey um what does our corporate tax rate work out to in percentage
[1936.48 → 1946.16] can you give me a ballpark ours max is out at 33, but oh can can you just ballpark it this is uh
[1946.64 → 1952.24] enthralling three nerds on their okay thank you okay so it's somewhere between 20 and 40 for us
[1952.24 → 1958.56] and I think it goes up to nearly yeah I think we're less yeah so does it bother you
[1958.56 → 1964.16] that multinationals with the capability if they were paying taxes of significantly reducing an
[1964.16 → 1969.52] entire country's national debt yeah are paying one percent is ridiculous how did they how
[1969.52 → 1974.80] did Ireland rationalize it at the beginning like why wouldn't they want the money so I think they want
[1974.80 → 1981.12] the jobs okay so they want the jobs for the citizens and that's I mean that's the kind of our percent of
[1981.12 → 1987.84] their employment going to apple like if that's how much it is I mean Apple employees and that i
[1987.84 → 1993.12] actually okay so that that's another thing to consider is not all the corporations that
[1993.12 → 1998.00] quote unquote have their headquarters in a country like Ireland actually employ a significant number
[1998.00 → 2003.44] of people there sure so there's that can be a factor in this kind of decision but in this case
[2004.00 → 2008.08] I actually don't know that it was because my understanding is that apple in particular does not
[2008.08 → 2012.40] employ a ton of people in Ireland and I'm sure that twitch chat is going to be uh apparently
[2012.40 → 2018.64] they have call centres in Ireland there you go that's it yeah this is all over call centres call
[2018.64 → 2026.88] centres um listen apple needs that 16 billion to build that stupid building they're building in uh
[2026.88 → 2031.20] where is that okay 5 000 okay they commit to invest in infrastructure
[2031.20 → 2037.04] what infrastructure so i I don't know, but infrastructure can mean anything it can mean
[2037.04 → 2041.68] roads it can mean urban development it can mean uh it can mean it pretty, pretty much it's what you
[2041.68 → 2047.36] say to a place to make them be okay with you causing a lot of noise and traffic uh blah blah blah
[2048.96 → 2054.08] okay, okay and this is another good point Ireland wants the one percent because even one percent of
[2054.08 → 2060.96] Apple's profits is better than zero percent of Apple's profits so basically it becomes like a
[2060.96 → 2065.36] bidding war between countries for who can offer the lowest corporate taxes this is great, thank you
[2065.36 → 2070.72] twitch chat for contributing positively to a conversation you guys are awesome today note that i
[2070.72 → 2076.56] said today so Ireland says okay you can be here, and we're only going to charge you the one percent
[2076.56 → 2082.72] and the EU's like hey Ireland now you have to charge them the full price yeah so basically so it's all
[2082.72 → 2087.12] good for Ireland shoot they're in a perfect place I was going to say they're in a perfect place
[2087.12 → 2092.88] unless unless unless apple backs up unless apple bails on Ireland and all the other high-tech
[2092.88 → 2097.44] companies because apple's not the only one that's using Ireland as a tax shelter like this is like
[2097.44 → 2102.64] part of their like if you were making it part of your business as a country to attract one percent
[2102.64 → 2109.76] of the profits of tech giants like apple and google then all of a sudden being stuck where price the
[2109.76 → 2116.48] price is fixed where you have uh like effectively like a minimum advertised price uh similar to
[2116.48 → 2121.12] how retailers are stuck selling a product at the same price if that's part of the manufacturer
[2121.12 → 2125.44] agreement like if they're stuck in an in like a price fixing situation or shouldn't say price
[2125.44 → 2130.80] fixing price fixing is illegal it's a different thing if it's like a a fair competition act
[2130.80 → 2136.08] kind of thing then what can they offer other than slashing the price and I think there's a there's some
[2136.08 → 2140.32] good things that could come out of that we could have countries coming up with more uh with more
[2140.32 → 2146.40] interesting and more innovative ways to attract companies, and we could have companies well actually
[2146.72 → 2151.20] injecting some of that private money that quite frankly what do they even need it for
[2151.76 → 2157.44] at a certain point injecting some of that private money back into the citizens that are staffing their
[2157.44 → 2161.68] companies even if they're not willing to pay it to them directly I mean we've all seen the growing
[2161.68 → 2168.48] disparity between the wages of the highest one percent and the average working blue-collar Joe yeah so
[2168.48 → 2176.00] overall I think this is great um yeah I think Ireland wins here I think there are so many other companies
[2176.00 → 2182.32] there that are probably like wow we weren't charged one percent like whoever's over there people in
[2182.32 → 2185.84] charge saying Microsoft is over there what if Microsoft is being charged that full amount and
[2185.84 → 2191.20] now they're just finding out about this I don't think they are but maybe hey maybe they're paying 1.2
[2191.20 → 2196.96] percent 1.2 mind you if everyone ultimately has to come back and back pay at the same rate
[2196.96 → 2201.12] that's when they all move to what's that island jersey that tax haven island over there
[2201.12 → 2206.24] yeah anyway I mean this makes this is really frustrating as someone who actually pays taxes
[2206.24 → 2211.20] who actually feels like they paid for the road that leads to the building that they occupy
[2211.76 → 2218.48] um it is very, very frustrating for me that the bigger you get, the less you get leaned on especially
[2218.48 → 2222.24] because and you look at it from a personal I don't know if your personal taxes work the same way
[2222.24 → 2226.72] but from a personal tax and for normal businesses tax the more you make, the more you pay
[2226.72 → 2232.80] yeah up to a point absolutely the truth I mean the first I think it's 26 or 28 000 a year that you
[2232.80 → 2238.48] make in British Columbia there's no tax so if your very low income there is no income tax and then as
[2238.48 → 2243.60] you go up you get into a higher and higher tax bracket but the way it works is there's no punishment
[2243.60 → 2247.52] for going up into a higher tax bracket because you only pay the higher tax rate on the income you make
[2247.52 → 2252.40] over the last threshold yeah so once I think you're past about a hundred thousand a year
[2252.40 → 2260.96] um it goes up as high as 40 percent personally um and we have a 12 percent federal and provincial
[2260.96 → 2269.12] sales tax total so we actually pay over half plus property tax if you're a landowner um plus bridge
[2269.12 → 2274.56] tolls like I have to pay a toll every time I want to go into Vancouver city yeah well so like just think
[2274.56 → 2280.24] of how many times you can take the root if you like hate yourself yeah, and you want it to like it you
[2280.24 → 2287.52] could pay yourself you could pay yourself half of minimum wage yeah to go around if you look
[2287.52 → 2291.84] depending on where you're going it'll be like only five more minutes and then I'll take it because
[2291.84 → 2296.72] it'll, it'll if there's like a traffic jam you know because Google will tell you but yes it's ridiculous
[2296.72 → 2301.92] with those tax laws just think about how much money your country's going to make when Trump wins and
[2301.92 → 2310.00] everybody decides hey I'm going to go to Canada right as the fix if you know yeah I don't know you know
[2310.00 → 2317.20] what's actually funny is uh Canada's Canada's working on um loosening up the rules for getting
[2317.20 → 2325.28] into the country yeah particularly if you are Canadian educated oh yeah so if you came to Canada as
[2325.28 → 2331.04] a student, and you did like an exchange program or some kind of foreign study thing than what Canada's
[2331.04 → 2336.40] trying to do is instead of educating these bloody people and what people don't really understand
[2336.40 → 2342.32] is that university is very expensive or college as you call it here in the US of a college is very
[2342.32 → 2347.12] very expensive for students but at least in Canada anyway the actual cost to educate those students is
[2347.12 → 2351.60] much, much higher there are heavy government subsidies as it is so basically you're taking
[2351.60 → 2355.76] these international students who do pay more but I'm still actually not quite sure if it covers it
[2355.76 → 2360.24] you're educating them with the Canadian system they're you know getting immersed in Canadian culture
[2360.24 → 2364.80] and then you're basically going okay out you go back to wherever you came from you can't come back
[2364.80 → 2369.28] which makes no sense to me, I mean the people care enough about Canada and Canadians and Canadian
[2369.28 → 2375.20] culture, but they came to study here and then what we're going to kick them out I mean what would
[2375.20 → 2382.40] that what would that mean for people like Dennis like we're taking young single uh educated
[2383.44 → 2389.52] Canadian culturalized people, and we're saying you can't live here I mean those are the ideal the
[2389.52 → 2400.08] ideal immigrants yeah anyway i uh yeah yeah people are all the entire chats like Canadian culture
[2400.08 → 2406.08] in quotes I know we have routine they have maple syrup a little bit we have maple syrup we have maple
[2406.08 → 2414.88] bacon we have maple ice cream okay they're very sorry maple bacon is fantastic that's not culture though
[2414.88 → 2421.44] all right yeah things you eat our culture okay I mean what culture would America have if it wasn't
[2421.44 → 2427.60] for food well america is like well it's not so much the food that's the culture it's the
[2427.60 → 2431.92] amount of if it's like lots of yeah that's right you want to throw stones I'll throw stones how awkward
[2431.92 → 2436.40] you kind of have to defend both a little bit well because you have to go home eventually you're right
[2436.40 → 2442.88] you have to actually go to Canada I can do whatever I please all right so uh next topic coming up is YouTube
[2442.88 → 2446.96] being accused of censoring vloggers and I don't actually where's that hat again yeah I don't
[2446.96 → 2452.08] actually normally do this where I'm like ha ha I'm going to tease the topic before I jump into a bunch
[2452.08 → 2456.56] of sponsor spots but I really want you guys to stay tuned for that discussion because I think it is
[2456.56 → 2462.40] going to be a good one, so our first sponsor of the day is Squarespace you can get 24 7 support via live
[2462.40 → 2468.00] chat in brackets we don't offer telephone support it costs only eight dollars a month you get a free
[2468.00 → 2470.80] domain if you buy Squarespace for a year I'm just going to read the talking points because nick
[2470.80 → 2474.88] keeps yelling at me for ad-libbing what does that mean like he doesn't like when you just
[2475.52 → 2482.16] that's what makes a better live stream right so you know what Squarespace they make like websites
[2482.16 → 2488.00] and stuff, and you go to squarespace.com, and it's like responsive design and like they got features
[2488.00 → 2492.48] man they got features our corporate page is Squarespace is it really god why aren't they paying
[2492.48 → 2496.56] us no yeah are they sponsored they're not oh all right but hey well there you go now you know yeah
[2496.56 → 2502.48] that's right now you know so if their website sucks you know who to blame, and it's not Squarespace
[2502.48 → 2507.36] because Squarespace is actually very easy to use with lots of attractive templates that's right so
[2507.36 → 2513.12] it must be Matt for doing a crappy job yeah uploading the wrong pictures it's like this is supposed to be
[2513.12 → 2517.76] about nerd fusion why are there monkey butts on it oh that's a great idea because we accidentally
[2517.76 → 2524.24] uploaded from the monkey butt folder I definitely put some of my astronomy pictures up there anyway
[2525.04 → 2529.68] everyone can now publish content in Apple news format directly from their Squarespace blog every
[2529.68 → 2534.72] Squarespace site has built-in e-commerce, and you can start a trial with no credit card required at
[2534.72 → 2541.92] squarespace.com with offer code Linus letting you save 10 if you decide to sing up for a paid plan
[2542.96 → 2548.24] speaking of paid plans if you're more into the having people like give you money than the whole
[2548.24 → 2554.00] paying money part of using the things that Linus media group endorses then freshbooks is
[2554.00 → 2559.20] the easy to use invoicing software that helps small businesses look professional I mean it doesn't
[2559.20 → 2564.00] make you professional you can still like you know have your butt hanging out while you're under someone's
[2564.00 → 2568.00] sink fixing their pipes that's fine you don't have to look professional you just well okay you have to
[2568.00 → 2573.52] look professional but only on the invoice okay you can still dress in like you know plaid and wear like
[2573.52 → 2577.44] dirty boots it's kind of unprofessional not to show crack on that job I feel like do you think so
[2577.44 → 2585.20] absolutely really so i I would trust somebody more who's the stereotypical plumber type than like
[2585.20 → 2591.52] someone who's all clean yeah so why comes in like a suit and tie to fix your pipes like what you
[2591.52 → 2596.96] don't want okay well you're going extreme okay well I'm there as an example yeah i just I want the I want
[2596.96 → 2601.84] the person who's been doing it for a long time he just doesn't care about how he looks he just knows
[2601.84 → 2609.84] he's getting the job done I see so you think that in order to in order to be a good plumber you just
[2609.84 → 2616.72] have you've been bent over that long yep so long that your pants are well is moulded to that shape so
[2616.72 → 2621.76] it's always just pulling down your so you're cracked okay so then is that I mean is that a form of
[2621.76 → 2625.84] discrimination I mean you guys have serious anti-discrimination employment laws here in
[2625.84 → 2630.64] Washington I would only hire a plumber that shows I see why Nick doesn't like it when you're at
[2630.64 → 2635.44] the sponsor spot this is fine they're going to talk about that so if it's a female is that sexual
[2635.44 → 2639.92] discrimination if you're saying look if you don't show crack while you're fixing my pipes we're out of
[2639.92 → 2645.04] this yeah we're out of this yeah well you heard it here first if you guys ever get called to the
[2645.04 → 2651.12] nerd fusion office to fix their pipes then you better be ready to show crack um anyway back to fresh
[2651.12 → 2656.64] depending on the kind of speaking of fresh books is the super simple easy to use invoicing tool
[2656.64 → 2661.68] that lets small business owners whether you're a plumber whether you're a dance teacher whether you're
[2661.68 → 2668.08] you teach painting lessons or whatever it is that you do more with less time and be more

[2720.32 → 2725.92] a house painter okay you don't walk away without the check and if is they're like oh I don't have my

[2883.28 → 2891.84] the big one the original article this was posted by um Rama attacks on the forum uh the original
[2891.84 → 2900.40] article that I actually saw was uh sexy Phil's uh sexy Phil's post which had a very, very incendiary
[2900.40 → 2904.16] title something like YouTube is shutting my channel down and I don't know what to do to
[2904.16 → 2908.16] Phil DeFranco oh I didn't know I saw that too um sorry I don't know I don't think anyone calls him
[2908.16 → 2914.96] sexy Phil any more his like old channel name is SSF yeah kind of like Austin Evans's old channel name
[2914.96 → 2921.52] is duncan33303 I think I'm one of the few guys whose channel name is actually my channel name
[2921.52 → 2926.72] because they let you switch it now so if I wanted to rebrand to something not quite so narcissistic
[2926.72 → 2936.96] I could but I won't why would you um so here we go why is YouTube being accused of censoring vloggers
[2936.96 → 2942.00] with the sub headline here is that called a byline nothing has changed remember I don't actually have
[2942.00 → 2948.32] a news background I just run this podcast with the subtitle littler title yeah the littler the like
[2948.32 → 2954.64] gray and not black it's not always gray it's so it's its italicized and the font is smaller
[2954.64 → 2958.72] the worst is when they repeat what you've already read in the title like three or four times
[2959.36 → 2968.64] okay so let's let's stick with the facts to start with the fact is that YouTube is not shutting down
[2969.36 → 2973.92] Phil DeFranco's channel that I mean the guy's well known for having clickbait titles, and you can
[2973.92 → 2980.24] think of that whatever you will, you know if it if it works i actually as long as the video
[2980.24 → 2985.52] is somewhat about that and I guess it's somewhat about how that is not actually what's happening
[2986.24 → 2992.40] I guess like he sort of that's yeah because in the video he specifically says like we're not going
[2992.40 → 2996.56] anywhere the channel is not shutting down we have all these other sources of revenue because we're smart
[2996.56 → 3000.72] and we built up other revenue streams which is smart and that's good it just means that the title
[3000.72 → 3006.56] really isn't anything to do with reality um so YouTube did not shut down the channel and they
[3006.56 → 3014.48] have not as some people have said changed their terms of service okay lets uh let's go ahead and
[3014.48 → 3020.80] pull up the support. Google page here I think that's my screen share yeah there we go uh well this is one
[3020.80 → 3023.68] of the things I love about the touch screen by the way a lot of people ask me why I care about the
[3023.68 → 3029.28] touch screen I actually use it to scroll nicely when I'm uh when I'm streaming I wish I had one of those
[3029.28 → 3036.72] these terms of service have not changed content that is considered inappropriate for advertising
[3037.60 → 3043.84] not for hosting on the YouTube.com website okay sexually suggestive including partial nudity and
[3043.84 → 3047.76] sexual humour violence including display of serious injury and events related to that violent extremism
[3047.76 → 3050.96] inappropriate language including harassment profanity and vulgar language promotion of drugs
[3050.96 → 3054.96] and related substances including selling use and abuse of such items controversial sensitive subjects
[3054.96 → 3058.32] and events including subjects related to war political conflicts natural disasters and
[3058.32 → 3064.40] strategies even if graphical imagery is not shown if any of the above describes any portion
[3064.96 → 3069.68] of your video then the video may not be approved for monetization if monetization is approved
[3069.68 → 3074.32] your video may not be eligible for all available ad formats YouTube reserves the right to not
[3074.32 → 3080.56] monetize a video as well as suspend monetization features on channels that repeatedly submit videos
[3080.56 → 3090.56] violating our policies so they haven't changed that the key difference is in the enforcement of the
[3090.56 → 3098.96] aforementioned rules now some of this stuff makes a fair bit of sense to me some of the videos that
[3098.96 → 3107.20] clearly violate anti-cyber bullying policies some of which had been revised in the last I think four to six
[3107.20 → 3112.72] weeks something along those lines whereas some of them don't make a ton of sense to me although i
[3112.72 → 3118.72] haven't watched the video in question Phil DeFranco did claim that he had a video that was covering a
[3118.72 → 3125.52] news item about something controversial, but that wasn't promoting it in any way and where basically his
[3125.52 → 3131.60] coverage of the news was being considered not advertiser friendly and therefore not eligible for
[3131.60 → 3137.84] monetization potentially that is to say if his only income stream was from YouTube and Google Adsense
[3138.40 → 3147.04] potentially undermining his ability to maintain his channel that makes sense right now these are the
[3147.04 → 3150.72] rest of my notes on this, and then we'll open this one up for a real discussion here and I'm sure
[3150.72 → 3156.16] twitch chat is going to get involved as well so right now videos seem to be being flagged for reasons that
[3156.16 → 3164.08] appear to be unfair and unclear um statements from YouTube suggest that the problem isn't a new policy
[3164.72 → 3171.84] um it's just a long-running conflict between the platform's rules and their execution on those rules
[3173.28 → 3180.96] so don't surprise me all right I mean I think we're gonna tinfoil hat off sorry can I get there
[3180.96 → 3186.08] yeah can we get water thank you guys have like a producer can you like fill it up all the way
[3186.08 → 3191.92] this time I still have water because I haven't been talking thank you am I orange because
[3191.92 → 3201.12] like that's like tech tips is coming green okay I'm green um yeah so i I don't I don't know like as a not
[3201.12 → 3210.88] YouTuber oh here we go it seems to me like YouTube just likes to have YouTube done anything
[3210.88 → 3217.36] right recently right it's where we're like and they seem to do really well when they piss off
[3217.36 → 3223.76] all their content creators you think so they seem to the YouTube views are going way up just look
[3223.76 → 3228.64] at this topic alone right think about how many videos and how many views are stemming from just
[3228.64 → 3234.56] this topic alone here's a question for you do they care because these are non-monetizable views that
[3234.56 → 3240.64] are basically costing you to be monetized costing oh the discussion about this is way more monetizable than the
[3240.88 → 3248.08] what they are demonetized ours can let me put this on they are definitely making more money off of
[3248.08 → 3253.68] doing this than if they hadn't done it because all these videos those are videos that have been seen
[3253.68 → 3258.40] already by the large majority of people that are going to see them yeah and now there's a way more
[3258.40 → 3264.88] videos brand new monetized talking about this now thank you for the few million dollars everybody says
[3264.88 → 3270.56] YouTube and uh they keep going I can tell you that every video from a YouTuber because many in the
[3270.56 → 3274.56] YouTube community the people who care about this within the YouTube community seem to be for the
[3274.56 → 3280.00] most part super mad about it um most of the ones I've seen in fact one I saw was pretty funny where
[3280.00 → 3285.76] the guy went out of his way to break every single one of those guidelines um is still monetized no
[3286.40 → 3290.72] without monetizing it meaning that YouTube is effectively just paying storage and bandwidth
[3290.72 → 3297.28] for something that they don't benefit from and that has a viewer using up valuable session view time
[3297.84 → 3304.00] on not making any money for the platform like that they have a whole sidebar full of related content
[3304.00 → 3308.88] as long as there's one click after on any of those you're good that's right interesting okay good
[3308.88 → 3313.92] content what else you got for me good for YouTube content is king what else you got for me yeah i I have
[3313.92 → 3320.32] nothing no i I definitely think that doing things like this is what keeps YouTube people talking about
[3320.32 → 3325.44] it they want people talking about the platform you know this is definitely tinfoil hat stuff right here
[3325.44 → 3333.12] ridiculous to me where it's like they drama is perfect for YouTube views it just is and if
[3333.12 → 3337.28] they have to manufacture the drama then so be it i I don't get the feeling that they're going out of
[3337.28 → 3342.48] their way to manufacture drama to get views I think they're doing this for other reasons I think this
[3342.48 → 3349.44] is pure hand-handedness I think that basically they got some pressure put on them by advertisers I mean
[3349.44 → 3352.80] at some point they're going to have to make YouTube profitable they're going to have to figure out how to do that
[3352.80 → 3359.36] um i i think at some point well okay I know for a fact that one of the business goals
[3359.36 → 3363.92] within the YouTube business unit is to be profitable whether google actually expects it to happen or not
[3363.92 → 3370.48] or alpha whether alphabet expects it to happen or not I'm not sure, but that is a goal that is
[3370.48 → 3376.00] something that they seem to be working towards with things like YouTube red which does extract more
[3376.00 → 3382.16] money per individual view than advertisement by the way that's interesting because there's YouTube red videos
[3382.80 → 3388.00] that are not demonetized that break those guidelines right somebody has gone through and compiled like
[3388.00 → 3394.00] a list of 30 or 40 YouTube red videos whose titles completely like have rate in them and stuff like
[3394.00 → 3403.92] that interesting yep well awkward okay so, so sorry back to right so my my my personal theory is that
[3403.92 → 3410.40] basically advertisers came to them and said look we'll feel better about advertising on the platform if we
[3410.40 → 3418.16] don't have our ad displayed on you know some video full of profanity that is promoting hate and promoting
[3418.16 → 3425.36] you know cyberbullying or or or has these controversial topics and all this stuff um and basically what i
[3425.36 → 3431.20] think is happening is YouTube is trying to figure out a way to deliver their ad inventory because there's
[3431.20 → 3436.40] always a there's always a finite amount of ad inventory they're figuring out a way to deliver their ad inventory
[3436.40 → 3443.52] in a way that best optimizes their CPMs for both the platform itself and for the content creators who
[3443.52 → 3451.04] are keeping in line with brand friendly values while you know and treating the stuff that is not going
[3451.04 → 3458.16] to be monetizable as sort of collateral damage um and I think that right now because Google is all about
[3458.16 → 3463.36] automated systems it's not like people are manually going through these videos so right now in the first
[3463.36 → 3467.68] iteration of the system they're basically going yeah there's going to be again there's going to be
[3467.68 → 3473.76] some collateral damage we will revise the algorithm over time and my belief is what they're actually
[3473.76 → 3480.00] generating on the back end is not just a black and white system because they made it very clear in the
[3480.00 → 3484.32] system they didn't, or they made it very clear in the announcement or in the guidelines that the video
[3484.32 → 3490.56] might not be eligible for all types of advertising so they might be able to actually have potential
[3490.56 → 3495.52] advertising partners in the future that are okay with that I'm looking a year or two years down the
[3495.52 → 3498.80] road that makes sense where they can fill out a questionnaire, and they can say what are you
[3498.80 → 3504.40] comfortable with yeah yeah and then those advertisers impressions, and you'll check this box yeah that's
[3504.40 → 3509.44] right that makes a lot of sense or if you're willing to have your if you're willing to have your
[3509.44 → 3514.24] advertisement play on some YouTube drama video about two YouTubers who got in a fight or whatever
[3514.24 → 3520.08] that's full of you know people saying hateful things to each other um then hey maybe you pay a little bit
[3520.08 → 3525.44] less I think they want to figure I think YouTube's ultimate goal is to monetize every single video
[3525.44 → 3530.64] on the platform I think just right now they are rolling this out in stages and then what the first
[3530.64 → 3538.40] stage looks like is a very imperfect algorithm for detecting stuff that they know is definitely or
[3538.40 → 3543.60] probably not safe for all the advertisers that they have now, and then they'll work on rolling out
[3543.60 → 3551.28] something more granular in the future and I think that while it is totally crap for people to have
[3551.28 → 3557.60] made YouTube a job to have relied on the benevolence of Google who runs this wonderful
[3557.60 → 3561.68] platform that makes it, so people can quit their jobs and start doing this as a full-time job
[3562.40 → 3567.52] even if they're not business savvy people I think it's super crappy to those people but I think that
[3567.52 → 3572.64] it's also a huge wake-up call because what those people have to understand is even if they don't come from a
[3572.64 → 3578.80] business background they are entrepreneurs, and they're going to have to understand that as great
[3578.80 → 3585.04] as it's been, and we should be appreciative of Google and YouTube for keeping us divided from this as great
[3585.04 → 3595.60] as it is to feel like I can say and do whatever I want and ford or Frito-Lay or PepsiCo or major brands
[3595.60 → 3601.76] like this are going to just display advertising on it, I'm going to make money that is not how it works in the real
[3601.76 → 3610.08] world absolutely not so if you imagined that this was going to keep up forever that brands with like
[3610.08 → 3616.96] corporate values and those can go on either end of the spectrum I mean look at Chick-fil-A
[3616.96 → 3621.68] I mean you can go you can go all the way from like hyper conservative brands all the way to brands that
[3621.68 → 3627.28] are like yeah whatever do whatever bite the heads off of you know chickens on stream or on video for
[3627.28 → 3632.48] all I care we'll endorse the crap out of it um people are just going to have to understand that
[3632.48 → 3639.92] if they expect to get mainstream advertising dollars and those big mainstream CPMs that content just
[3639.92 → 3645.92] doesn't fly and there it's a miracle that it did for this long that's my take on it, I mean do you think
[3646.64 → 3653.12] do you think there's something wrong there with how corporations perceive ads because right now it seems
[3653.12 → 3658.80] that they're like this is now part of the content which is crap yeah right I don't I don't think a
[3658.80 → 3665.84] single viewer out there thinks that the ad is in any way related to the content that I think is wrong
[3665.84 → 3672.00] really oh yes I mean i I mean all you got to do is spend some time on Tumblr do we have to find
[3672.56 → 3680.56] I don't do that right to find people who can get very upset writing letters writing handwritten letters to
[3680.56 → 3688.08] CEOs because they saw an ad for Colgate toothpaste on some YouTube video where someone was swearing
[3688.64 → 3694.88] and the problem is that it only takes one person well, well that person's just wrong no that person
[3694.88 → 3698.48] is wrong that's all there it doesn't take just one person because advertising is all about
[3699.28 → 3705.28] a massive message to lots and lots of people it's just one person gets mad that's fine they don't care
[3705.28 → 3710.48] no but okay so hold on so no i vocal minority because I agree with you that corporations are
[3710.48 → 3715.76] viewing advertising wrong and that that person is viewing advertising wrong, but you also have to
[3715.76 → 3722.32] understand that from a corporation perspective you have to tread very lightly around that stuff because
[3722.32 → 3729.44] one angry person can turn into a thousand or ten thousand angry people very quickly as soon as it
[3729.44 → 3735.52] ends up on national news because some rinky-dink news outlet had nothing else to talk about today
[3735.52 → 3741.84] besides the fact that a Colgate ad played on this video besides the fact that Colgate for that one
[3741.84 → 3747.92] person besides the fact that Colgate is paying money yeah I mean that's the thing anywhere money
[3747.92 → 3752.56] exchange that's not how that works Colgate does not pay that content creator that's not how the system
[3752.56 → 3759.04] works effectively they do yeah yeah no they don't they pay YouTube and then YouTube serves it wherever
[3759.04 → 3765.36] they please that's right because and Colgate has every right to be mad if their money and their ad and
[3765.36 → 3770.96] their brand gets associated with someone else and I don't think they should be mad in this case no
[3770.96 → 3776.64] no they shouldn't but remember I mean, and we've had okay we've had this conversation offline the
[3776.64 → 3783.68] advertising industry is like 30 40 years ago oh yeah absolutely right they are no they are nowhere
[3783.68 → 3790.96] okay they're nowhere near ready for YouTube let alone twitch yeah I mean that's very true obviously
[3790.96 → 3797.04] none of this is surprising but I mean like there there's its just it's I think this is just an
[3797.04 → 3804.56] education thing where YouTube is taking some stance on something without even attempting to educate
[3804.56 → 3810.08] their advertisers that are advertising we don't you and i you and I spend a lot of time educating
[3810.08 → 3815.04] people that come to us right we put a lot of time talking to them about things like this talking to
[3815.04 → 3822.24] lynda.com about why it's better if we screw up your ad read it is better, and it is better totally
[3822.24 → 3826.96] I have more fun yeah and that's what it's all about exactly having more fun personally right
[3826.96 → 3835.20] is it just that YouTube isn't spending enough time educating advertisers into hey welcome to 2016
[3835.20 → 3841.28] in 2016 law so here's the thing it's like you've dealt with big brands with big brands and I'm not
[3841.28 → 3848.40] going to name any names, but we have dealt with brands that come with very big egos I mean when
[3848.40 → 3855.04] you're talking to a hundred-year-old company that has become one of the know fortune 50 companies
[3855.68 → 3862.40] through a long-standing tradition of behaving a certain way and having a certain set of brand values
[3862.40 → 3866.80] yeah when you're talking to them, and you're going yeah yeah, but that's all out the door in the
[3866.80 → 3871.28] last three years don't worry about it yeah can you imagine the kind of pushback you're going to get
[3871.28 → 3876.00] like I mean it depends I'm saying that I'm taking my paycheck and I'm giving it to someone else
[3876.88 → 3881.68] that's simple I'll give it to Malcolm in the middle reruns because that's just the right that's
[3881.68 → 3888.08] just the right amount of edgy oh god did you like that show I love that show it's great but you
[3888.08 → 3892.72] don't like that show it's all right it's all right I mean it's like Dewey's the worst child
[3892.72 → 3898.16] actor on the face of the earth like everybody loves Raymond like area of oh it's better than
[3898.16 → 3904.48] everybody loves Raymond come on well anyway line is what you said about like not black and white but
[3904.48 → 3911.04] having various levels of you know gray between where an advertiser can say I'm okay with this but
[3911.04 → 3916.56] not that I think that makes a lot of sense yeahs like and if they would describe it and explain to it that
[3916.56 → 3920.80] way well they're not but I don't think they're ready to roll it out that well, but people are
[3920.80 → 3924.00] getting really upset because they don't understand what the heck is going on like you said there's
[3924.00 → 3929.36] not enough education going on here yeah, but that's always YouTube's problem like they're always sending
[3929.36 → 3935.76] out like remember when okay this is happening now site yeah yeah I mean so here's the bottom line so
[3935.76 → 3941.84] here's the ultimate bottom line on this was a matter of time and this is a huge wake-up call
[3941.84 → 3948.40] for YouTubers about the fact that they are business owners that they do have to conduct
[3948.40 → 3955.44] themselves professionally if they expect sponsors to give them any money um and fact number
[3955.44 → 3962.16] three is that YouTube is not censoring anyone they are not telling anyone that you can't continue to
[3962.16 → 3969.12] upload your videos to the site I mean they're saying we won't pay you to do if it's effect it's kind of
[3969.12 → 3972.88] it's an effective censorship you're not saying we'll shut you down because if someone's had a
[3972.88 → 3977.12] show where they've done this for the past like three years they have a certain thing that they
[3977.12 → 3981.92] do you know they're they're more rough around the edges yeah and now oh crap I can't make any more
[3981.92 → 3986.08] money this way because nobody's going to want to advertise with me, I mean like you said maybe we all
[3986.08 → 3990.72] have to grow up about it yeah maybe you have to grow up and realize that this is either a hobby or it's
[3990.72 → 3994.72] or you're a businessman, and you're a professional because someone says a curse word it's no longer a
[3994.72 → 4000.80] profession that's true, and you know what I think like sensitive political topic what does that mean
[4000.80 → 4006.64] I think the algorithm is way too heavy-handed right now oh I agree with that i also think
[4006.64 → 4011.44] that they are heading to a place where it will ultimately be something that makes sense to me
[4011.44 → 4017.36] especially if they can have a tiered system where the edgier the content the fewer sponsors are gonna
[4017.36 → 4022.00] are going to uh whitelist it and are going to be okay with it are going to sign on for it and ultimately
[4022.00 → 4028.48] the lower CPNs you might make but that you might still be able to make money um I just think that
[4028.48 → 4033.92] this ultimately is a bit of a wake-up call and that hopefully we're heading somewhere better with
[4033.92 → 4038.48] it and that YouTube has done a crap job of communication and implementation they always do
[4038.48 → 4044.40] but they always do that, and they always over fix and then pull it back that's just a typical thing
[4044.40 → 4050.16] right yes maybe that's a tactic of theirs that's basically what we're looking at here and ultimately
[4050.16 → 4054.88] you know what it isn't the Phil DeFranco of the world, and he said this himself it isn't the Phil
[4054.88 → 4059.28] DeFranco of the world that are going to suffer from this sure it is the up-and-coming guys the guys
[4059.28 → 4066.40] that do not have a thriving merch business or that do not have a thriving direct donation business or that
[4066.40 → 4072.32] do not have any other means of augmenting their income and so ultimately and this is the part that is
[4072.32 → 4079.60] most shitty about it is that it is the least business like that are going to be affected
[4079.60 → 4084.32] the most the people who had the least chance of seeing it coming because quite frankly Linus media
[4084.32 → 4090.40] group could survive if YouTube shut off our AdSense we are set up in such a way that we are ready for
[4090.40 → 4096.80] that because I've seen this coming literally years in advance from the moment I founded Linus media group
[4096.80 → 4102.24] I was trying to figure out how to not be reliant on the benevolence of YouTube even if I was still
[4102.24 → 4107.04] I still needed to use it to reach a large audience I had to find other ways to monetize that audience
[4107.04 → 4112.00] what that also means is I am deeply experienced dealing directly with sponsors and I'm already
[4112.00 → 4118.40] aware of these sensitivities so it is the guys that stumbled into it that don't have the business acumen
[4118.40 → 4123.52] that are ultimately getting crapped on the hardest by this and that sucks, and they really need to fix it
[4123.52 → 4129.76] but ultimately the bottom line is this was coming so don't be that surprised there I mean I think
[4129.76 → 4136.24] everyone's surprised it was so heavy yes because that should probably not have come it's so heavy
[4136.24 → 4144.00] handed it is its way too far yep they definitely I don't know and to use an automated system to
[4144.00 → 4149.20] detect when someone's cursing and just like wait that part is automated is if you say something i
[4149.20 → 4155.44] think right now from what I understand it's mostly tags and yeah yeah and things like that users reporting
[4155.44 → 4160.16] maybe yeah and then users fly yeah yeah that makes sense because as soon as this thing came out
[4160.16 → 4164.88] obviously a bunch of people started flagging videos right oh yeah yeah, and then you get a bunch of
[4164.88 → 4170.24] false flags of the world yeah yeah all the saw but then of course than yeah like I understand they
[4170.24 → 4175.28] want to automate it because like you can't have like a train a room full of people just watching
[4175.28 → 4181.44] videos all day to listen for one swear word sounds like a fun job right that does not have a fun job no
[4181.44 → 4187.92] that's what they use the report feature for and I call it a feature when it's yeah that's something
[4187.92 → 4196.00] different all right so I will finally somewhat weigh in on the situation over at tech syndicate
[4196.64 → 4202.32] um let's go ahead and pop over to Linus's screen so actually the main source I have for this is uh Linus
[4202.32 → 4209.28] tech tips' forum because as part of the whole uh and I'm gonna I need my allegedly sign because
[4209.28 → 4214.08] ultimately I don't we need some more props up in here because there is a lot of conflicting
[4214.08 → 4219.76] information have you been following this at all I have not done you know who they are I learned you
[4219.76 → 4226.00] okay right you can learn okay well whatever anyway the point is you want to explain though yeah they're
[4226.80 → 4231.76] who is tech syndicate okay so they're another YouTube channel uh that makes videos about
[4233.04 → 4239.52] sometimes tech um I'm going to look up because I think I know the guy who runs it used to
[4239.52 → 4245.44] be the tiger direct YouTube guy you know tiger direct I do know a tiger okay so he used to be
[4245.44 → 4251.60] their YouTube personality like I do know who that is way back in the day okay, okay I definitely know who
[4251.60 → 4258.80] that is so basically the drama llama is all over the place um there have been a couple of public
[4258.80 → 4266.64] statements released from what appear to be sort of two warring camps um allegedly I'm just I'm gonna
[4266.64 → 4273.04] fill it with that so basically Logan and pistol appear to be on one side with Wendell and Kane and uh
[4273.68 → 4279.76] shoot I don't remember her name Jennifer with Wendell Kane and Jennifer kind of on the other side and what it
[4279.76 → 4284.64] looks like right now though I haven't actually checked the thread today so I don't know if anything
[4284.64 → 4291.44] if anything new has come out let's just go ahead and have a look here Tuesday uh blah blah blah blah
[4291.44 → 4297.68] blah blah blah wow there are a lot of posts per page on our forum apparently yeah, so there are 10 pages on
[4297.68 → 4301.20] the latest right here we're gonna we're going to experience this together yeah just keep going
[4301.20 → 4308.32] let me just say your SEO for your forums nailed it thank you uh not me it's mostly it's mostly a
[4308.32 → 4319.12] loop thing but um okay basically Wendell came out and said okay we have some problems uh it appears as
[4319.12 → 4325.84] though there's some misappropriation of funds um I am a part owner in the company um I believe he did
[4325.84 → 4332.48] clarify his shares are 30 the company's been increasing in revenue by 125k a year or so for
[4332.48 → 4337.52] the last three years which gives us some idea what at least a bare minimum of the overall company gross
[4337.52 → 4341.92] income is even if that doesn't tell us anything about profitability or how much is being paid to
[4341.92 → 4347.44] employees or whatever else the case may be um patrons were complaining that they weren't getting the
[4347.44 → 4355.04] Patreon rewards they were promised um the and I don't I don't watch the channel so allegedly just based
[4355.04 → 4359.84] on posts I'm seeing on Reddit tech syndicate forum our own forum uh people were saying the content's
[4359.84 → 4365.52] actually getting worse even though patrons are contributing all this money um and Wendell basically
[4365.52 → 4370.48] came out and said look I don't understand where this money is going I'm a shareholder and what is going
[4370.48 → 4380.08] on um so many strong words were exchanged uh particularly by um pistol there's been a lot of
[4380.08 → 4386.64] speculation as to what exactly the role that she plays in all of this is uh Logan has released a
[4386.64 → 4393.44] statement saying it's all basically like down to miscommunication uh Kane has been fired apparently
[4393.44 → 4402.88] or quit depending on who you ask uh Jennifer is definitely gone um and Wendell from uh my understanding
[4402.88 → 4410.00] of it appears to be definitely on the way out claims that Logan owes him for his shares and is
[4410.00 → 4416.64] seeking a minimum of the amount that he figures he owes him just in like unpaid uh services for the
[4416.64 → 4426.64] company and uh yeah let me just see if there's anything anything else new um like the forums
[4426.64 → 4431.68] were shut down, but they're back on yeah so that was a whole controversy so yeah in the
[4431.68 → 4438.80] hullabaloo with uh people posting like public email exchanges public chat exchanges on both sides
[4438.80 → 4446.24] of this conflict oh wow in all of that um Logan says he alleges that the forum was shut down accidentally
[4446.24 → 4451.60] because he let Kane go and was worried that he would sabotage it, but people are posting screenshots of
[4451.60 → 4457.68] Logan threatening to shut down the forum uh if people don't stop criticizing whatever it is they're doing
[4457.68 → 4466.80] or whatever else or being haters um or whatever the case may be and pretty much um pretty much i
[4466.80 → 4474.80] guess the bottom line is that uh it looks like a pretty bad situation over there i I wouldn't
[4474.80 → 4479.36] personally you'll, you'll still see like Wendell on the channel for a while like there's stuff that's been
[4479.36 → 4485.68] recorded weeks ago um that's kind of still getting published, so a video went up with him in it and
[4485.68 → 4490.56] everyone's like oh I guess it's okay yeah, and it's like oh by the way that's not how video works
[4490.56 → 4496.16] unless you're this guy you've got to work way ahead yeah in an industry like this I don't know how you
[4496.16 → 4503.36] guys are so we have videos written that are three weeks from YouTube publication we have videos shot
[4503.36 → 4508.56] that are how long this video is gonna oh yeah this video will be a while all right because there's the
[4508.56 → 4513.44] editing queue there's the vessel time delay window oh right you do the week yeah yeah so by the time you
[4513.44 → 4516.56] can watch it unless you're subscribed to vessel which I doubt very much that you are
[4518.24 → 4522.72] I totally am Linus and everybody should be just for you Linus
[4524.80 → 4531.84] um a lot of people are on vessel just for us, we're very popular on vessel yeah yeah so there basically
[4532.48 → 4536.96] my bottom line on this one is I haven't worked with anyone over there since highlander
[4536.96 → 4543.84] in any capacity so I don't really have any comment other than to summarize everything that I have
[4544.56 → 4553.20] basically read on Reddit texting forum Linus tech tips' forum etc so um so there you go
[4554.48 → 4561.76] I wish them I mean drama's fun it's just drama's fun it just likes when it happens to you right yeah
[4561.76 → 4570.24] you know that's okay we have what I will say is someone posted a rumour who is a who claims to be
[4570.24 → 4580.96] very close to the source um and I would say that their source it was him yeah can we get a zoom in
[4580.96 → 4584.96] on can we get a zoom in on that while I do like ominous music no it's I'm just kidding it's fine uh
[4584.96 → 4592.56] he's about to jump out of the chair so what I will say about this person's source is that either
[4592.56 → 4597.60] they are completely full of crap or this person is completely full of crap, but someone claimed that
[4597.60 → 4602.64] a Linus media group employee will be making the jump over to tech syndicate I can assure you that is not
[4602.64 → 4609.68] happening um and uh yeah it's actually live I can also assure you that would not be very good yeah
[4609.68 → 4615.68] joke's on you, you guys are on your own you can rename it to just tech tips you know or like
[4615.68 → 4620.88] uh yes yeah it'll say the LTT is way better alliteration
[4620.88 → 4628.32] taken tech tips TTT TTT TTT yeah it sounds like it sounds like an extremist group
[4629.20 → 4635.76] what the TTT like I just have oh okay yeah I can see that yeah we might want to really rethink our image
[4635.76 → 4643.12] yeah I don't know if I'm I'll work on the name all right so um I guess I didn't really talk to
[4643.12 → 4647.20] twitch chat much while we were talking about all this stuff yeah what have they been I don't really
[4647.20 → 4653.36] I don't really know like Harambee thing lots of Harambee oh yeah you know what's hilarious i
[4653.36 → 4660.00] again like most of our participation in internet memes I feel like is at least half unintentional
[4660.00 → 4668.32] so my video on the Galaxy S7 yeah um contains gorillas no wait no, no it's what CPU to buy
[4668.32 → 4675.12] yeah yeah what CPU to buy has um has run you randomly put no way it was no I put the gorillas
[4675.12 → 4683.04] in no i my guidance called for gorillas okay so, so anyway that video was written yeah then there was
[4683.04 → 4689.68] like a week no delay hold on yes week plus delay in editing yes then there was a week delay
[4689.68 → 4698.00] to go to YouTube from vessel yeah with um so I had two people who left reviews for the 1700 CPU the
[4698.00 → 4705.12] 6950x extreme edition two people who left reviews that were like these like chest thumping this CPU is
[4705.12 → 4710.40] so great and so am I for using it and so is anyone else who uses it and the other guys like yeah you're
[4710.40 → 4717.12] great and I'm great too you know I only spent this much on my total rate 4 600 which is less than you
[4717.12 → 4722.64] but still awesome I'm still a baller like so we had these gorillas pop in while we highlighted like the
[4722.64 → 4727.20] goofy stuff these guys were saying, and we had these guerilla sound effects so we participated in the
[4727.20 → 4732.16] Harambee meme you totally knew that was a thing completely unintentionally no idea I posted on Twitter
[4732.16 → 4738.08] and I get all these Harambee that is straight up being sitting I had to google it I had no idea i
[4738.08 → 4742.88] basically am not an internet citizen I had two children could you imagine if the gorilla picture
[4742.88 → 4750.16] that you chose accidentally was Harambee well it was Shutterstock, so the odds were like one in a
[4750.16 → 4753.92] thousand just because it would have been all gorillas kind of look the same to me yeah but
[4753.92 → 4758.88] right now if you search gorilla I guarantee most of you know triggered I am so triggered right now
[4758.88 → 4763.28] I'm triggered by you being triggered okay I can't be in a room with someone who's been triggered
[4763.28 → 4768.96] um very triggering so you can't be in a room with yourself it's like a freaking
[4768.96 → 4775.84] paradox it's a box and a box and a box and a box um all right so let's do some of our let's do some
[4775.84 → 4782.48] of our more rapid fire topics our original article here posted by Tim q on the forum is from Anand tech
[4782.48 → 4790.64] the acer predator 21x which confirmed I will be one of the first to receive a review unit of that's one
[4790.64 → 4800.72] big lap that's huge features a k an undisclosed baby lake processor GTX 1080 desktop grade SLI come on
[4801.36 → 4810.32] and a curved gaming display a curved display on a laptop is it a laptop at that point yeah I mean come
[4810.32 → 4815.28] those look like mechanical they are mechanical keys does that look like a laptop that's that
[4815.28 → 4819.92] that's like a desktop that's been put in a trash compact look at these vents yeah look at these
[4819.92 → 4825.60] vents take that on an airplane and see what they said I think the vents are here to look at this
[4825.60 → 4830.88] thing no I'm looking at it now to be clear you do not actually need quite that much ventilation
[4830.88 → 4837.60] we actually have a GTX 1080 SLI video like uh like a laptop coming up on YouTube in I think six days or
[4837.60 → 4843.76] something like that again working ahead um already out on vessel already look at the plugs thank you
[4843.76 → 4850.56] for that um all you're doing is plugging them being mad at me for being on vessel, so thanks a lot for
[4850.56 → 4859.76] that um this thing looks ridiculous yeah I don't I can already tell you what the review will be so I'm
[4859.76 → 4866.40] even spoiling it for the vessel piece indulge us this thing is amazing it's the best gaming experience
[4866.40 → 4873.04] in a laptop you could possibly have, but it's not really a laptop yeah that's what we just
[4874.08 → 4881.12] there you go there's a conclusion done peace line us out yeah as long as it doesn't explode if you
[4881.12 → 4887.36] quick charge it yes it'll be fine um god so acer acknowledges that this laptop is more of a proof of
[4887.36 → 4895.68] concept than any sort of like big seller in retail however acer has become more and more savvy as time has
[4895.68 → 4900.40] gone on about gaming and I think half of it is by accident and I think this could end up being a big
[4900.40 → 4909.68] hit so the draw is that it's just so baller so I gave MSI a ton of crap about the gt80 titan
[4910.24 → 4916.24] okay I made fun of it in my review it was very expensive computer and I told them in person I was like
[4916.24 → 4924.24] this is a concept car right six months down the road i get an email like to dog you were wrong
[4924.80 → 4930.96] it's a huge seller, and you know the gt80 titan right I do the one with the mechanical actual cherry
[4930.96 → 4935.52] MX mechanical oh that one you hated that well maybe not hated I didn't hate if it was really cool
[4937.92 → 4943.20] unique piece of hardware amazing piece of engineering just I wouldn't use it I've never used it
[4943.20 → 4947.04] I know just look on your face in the room when you saw it for the first time I was like oh
[4947.04 → 4952.88] that's not that great what is that I'm not impressed it's just I mean there's a reason that there's this
[4952.88 → 4960.80] whole market now for these external cages for your uh laptop for your no for just graphic cards to plug
[4960.80 → 4968.64] into your laptop because a laptop is meant to be moved at some point yeah spoiler alert the uh the baby lake
[4968.64 → 4974.00] processor that was allegedly on the show floor somewhere isn't a product that's like looks pretty
[4974.00 → 4979.84] cool for that so it's a super mobile product so the last so here are the base
[4979.84 → 4984.80] specifications I didn't cover all of them uh mechanical keyboard with cherry MX switches 21 inches curved
[4984.80 → 4990.80] IPS display with a 2560 by 1080 resolution four integrated speakers with two built-in you're telling
[4990.80 → 4997.28] me they're only doing 1080p on something that big no 20 yeah it's 2560 by 1080 oh so it's wider
[4997.28 → 5005.28] is like 25 or 30 percent more resolution but remember this is a 21 21 inch display 1080p looks not
[5005.28 → 5011.92] bad on a 21-inch display, and it's 21 inches of like ultra-wide display so it's like it'll be okay I think
[5012.56 → 5018.88] five fans and multiple heat pipes and uh here's a here's a shot here's actually a couple different
[5018.88 → 5023.04] pictures of it so here it is here it is open let's get the screen share going here let's just zoom in
[5023.04 → 5030.40] what it has a little fold out the wrist rest yeah so I'm going to ask for one for every one of our video
[5030.40 → 5035.20] editors okay taken yes you're already you're already complaining about the weight you're carrying yeah
[5035.20 → 5041.92] this is like 30 pounds what do you I don't care I want a thing that I can edit with take a desktop
[5042.48 → 5048.00] well that used to do that yeah that's that's actually that's more of a paint about than taking a lot of
[5048.00 → 5053.92] we used acer's uh super slim 23-inch monitor with to carry with our desktop until we broke them when
[5053.92 → 5058.80] we were travelling yeah and like we were thinking of making a video out of like desktop in a suitcase
[5058.80 → 5063.76] yep um I don't think we ever did it no we never did if it's also like literally doing that like next
[5063.76 → 5068.72] week yeah oh I'm sorry it's been done before but not as well as you will yeah whatever he said it's
[5068.72 → 5072.96] been done before doesn't mean I don't want it I need it oh okay so you're making one because you want oh i
[5072.96 → 5078.48] make them because we're going to use it okay, okay not just for video all right, so this is fun carbon
[5078.48 → 5087.52] nanotube storage coming to market in 2018 carbon nanotubes the only thing they can't do is get out
[5087.52 → 5092.48] of the lab which is not my joke I stole that joke that's a that's a good joke it's still a very funny
[5092.48 → 5097.60] joke because it's true they're supposed to be great for everything and yet but we never ever see them as
[5097.60 → 5102.88] long as the Lanzhou has existed I've been talking about how amazing carbon nanotubes are and yet
[5102.88 → 5111.20] I've never seen one well I mean I'm pointing at your logo that has three oh carbon okay well
[5111.20 → 5116.88] okay I thought that's what you were going for no that's not no that is the shape of the hexagon is
[5116.88 → 5122.88] this lattice shape okay I don't know that ed's that like I thought that that's what you were going for
[5122.88 → 5132.80] no, no no, no sorry no all right okay so basically Fujitsu announced that it has licensed lantern's carbon
[5132.80 → 5139.60] nanotube based n ram non-volatile ram which is pretty cool too like ram discs could be much more
[5139.60 → 5145.44] of a thing and will participate in a joint development effort to bring a 256 megabit 15 55
[5145.44 → 5154.32] nanometre product to market in 2018. So 2020. If ever promising characteristics include things like
[5154.32 → 5161.92] unmatchable performance we hope durability and extreme temperature tolerance and uh the attraction to
[5161.92 → 5168.00] this begins with their d ram speed, so competing products like 3d cross point rear re ram and PCM
[5168.00 → 5175.04] suffer from limited endurance thresholds n ram has been tested up to one trillion cycles that is to say
[5175.04 → 5183.60] if they can ever make one cool, and they have said that leading edge products will ship with half the cost
[5183.60 → 5189.28] of d ram and that prices will fall as production once again carbon nanotubes are going to be cheaper
[5189.28 → 5193.44] they're going to be faster they're going to be more reliable yeah, and you might even buy one day
[5194.40 → 5198.08] if you live for long enough it's like that bike company that's like here's a five thousand dollar
[5198.08 → 5206.24] bike it'll be only 500 bucks to make this in five years I'm overly optimistic so SpaceX's rocket blew
[5206.24 → 5212.72] up and destroyed a Facebook satellite oh cool shame dude that was one of the coolest videos of explosions
[5212.72 → 5218.72] that I've seen in a long time I have a rocket does burn it sucks that it happened yeah but like Mr Zuckerberg
[5218.72 → 5224.80] will have to just you see the explosion and then the capsule that holds the actual satellite in like
[5224.80 → 5231.04] it's still intact, and you see it slowly just fall off to the side, and it's still intact hits
[5231.04 → 5239.68] the ground yeah it was oddly satisfying so they were conducting a test firing of their unmanned
[5239.68 → 5245.52] rocket when the blast occurred Thursday morning uh they blew up Facebook's first satellite costing
[5245.52 → 5252.80] around 150 million pounds that's a lot of pounds there are insurance companies they could have given
[5252.80 → 5258.56] that all to Iowa surely you ensure that how much would that insurance cost I mean why would
[5258.56 → 5264.40] you think that someone else's rocket's going to blow up on the launch pad making your rocket fall over I mean
[5264.40 → 5269.36] you've got to ensure rocket fall over insurance people buy insurance for holes in one that's true
[5269.36 → 5273.92] but stuff like there are certain things you can't buy insurance for though like they won't insure against
[5273.92 → 5280.72] earthquakes in uh Vancouver oh but if you pay them enough they would no they won't why surely like
[5280.72 → 5285.76] Lloyds or somebody would I I don't know I know that you can insurance insane things like I've heard of
[5285.76 → 5290.56] of celebrities insuring their hair for example yeah like Mariah Carey's or voice insurer or something
[5290.56 → 5296.56] like that yeah i i can see that happening but i I don't know I don't know if that would even
[5296.56 → 5303.44] occur to me that would be like if I'm going to put my satellite on something that I have no idea if
[5303.44 → 5308.48] this thing is going to do it probably the first thing I do is going for insurance yeah I don't know
[5308.48 → 5315.76] I don't know who you asked for that kind of insurance but yeah hey geico satellite insurance is
[5315.76 → 5321.76] this something come on you can get in on this so the satellite was so okay SpaceX confirmed there
[5321.76 → 5326.40] was an anomaly on the launch pad that resulted in the loss of the rocket and its payload the satellite
[5329.60 → 5335.44] the Facebook satellite was carrying technology to allow them to spot beam wireless internet
[5335.44 → 5341.20] directly to smartphones in sub-Saharan Africa whoa and this information was reported by tech crunch
[5341.20 → 5346.16] what else were they doing with that satellite yeah spot beam means into your brain
[5346.16 → 5351.36] I don't know if I want to know that um this is actually pretty great so the original poster on
[5351.36 → 5356.96] the forum is good bites and the original article here that we're pulling from is ours technical Facebook
[5356.96 → 5365.28] fires human editors' oh yeah algorithm immediately posts fake news yeah wonderful breaking Fox News exposes
[5365.28 → 5374.40] traitor Megyn Kelly kicks her out for backing Hillary I don't know who Megyn Kelly is Fox News yeah she's
[5374.40 → 5379.12] like an anchor or reporter correspondent or something she's been involved in like a feud with trump or
[5379.12 → 5385.92] something like that anyway um, so this is great so earlier this year Facebook denied criticisms that its
[5385.92 → 5392.00] trending feature was surfacing news biased against conservatives the company has fired all its human
[5392.00 → 5397.04] editors replacing them with software replacing them with an algorithm that promotes stories based on
[5397.04 → 5404.96] what Facebook users are talking about wow putting Facebook users in charge of your feed oh man that's
[5404.96 → 5409.92] kind of like they tried to put a positive spin on firing somebody here is that what's going on but
[5409.92 → 5416.88] that's like red look Reddit if you up vote a story then it goes to the front page so within 72 hours
[5416.88 → 5422.80] according to the uh Washington Post the top story trending on Facebook was fake in a post about
[5422.80 → 5427.52] the changes Facebook said the early move to remove human editors was in direct response to the feedback
[5427.52 → 5432.40] they got from the Facebook community earlier this year it's actually your fault this sucks so humans
[5432.40 → 5437.44] will still be involved with trending in a few ways such as confirming that a topic is tied to a current
[5437.44 → 5442.32] news event in the real world that is a direct quote that's important not the fake quote so now they're
[5442.32 → 5448.56] rehiring everybody probably just fire probably not maybe they'll hire one guy do you think they fired
[5448.56 → 5454.24] people over that, or they just moved what did you do fire a robot well no the people before the robot
[5454.24 → 5459.52] the people who programmed the robot because you said that you just said like they fired people to replace
[5459.52 → 5467.84] them like maybe they get shuffled around to I'm not sure design satellites I don't know um okay so the
[5467.84 → 5473.52] rumour is uh this is post was posted by case to female I don't know how to pronounce that I don't
[5473.52 → 5480.64] care um a device info sticker reaffirms 32 gig base storage for the iPhone 7 to which all I have to
[5480.64 → 5489.44] say is it's about time um oh, oh have iPhones been super tiny and yeah base model 16 gigs for a device that
[5489.44 → 5495.36] costs like 800 dollars it's ridiculous yeah that's I know to an android user it's unthinkable that's pretty
[5495.36 → 5500.32] ridiculous like the progressive android phone makers are having 64 gig base models with the
[5500.32 → 5505.76] ones that are still trying to get as many dollars out of you going with 32 I think this one's 64
[5505.76 → 5510.80] though isn't it yeah there you go there's no excuse for a flagship phone having a 16 gig model
[5510.80 → 5517.60] I want to try out an iPhone soon I haven't ever touched an iPhone Brandon did it I think it took him
[5517.60 → 5521.92] about three months to switch back okay that's a long time so you know my theory though is about
[5521.92 → 5528.88] why they're not doing a 16 gig model so have you noticed that you can't buy a 512 megabyte SD card
[5528.88 → 5537.76] any more sure yeah so at a certain point yeah it basically costs the same to make a larger flash
[5537.76 → 5542.08] chip than a smaller flash chip because we're pretty much down to the cot the bill of materials cost at
[5542.08 → 5548.40] that point you're not adding any more dies there are no dies that are cheaper so I think basically it
[5548.40 → 5553.68] is exactly the same price now for apple to do a 32 gig model they could have been saving as little
[5553.68 → 5558.88] as two dollars and I think they were still doing it, and they just didn't care and I think well I think
[5558.88 → 5561.92] part of the agenda even if it was the same price maybe it's even cheaper because that's something
[5561.92 → 5568.40] that happens eventually too what is because there's more demand more volume in manufacturing at a capacity
[5569.20 → 5574.48] I just experienced that with uh thumb drives yeah we ordered a bunch of thumb drives for here and the 16
[5574.48 → 5580.00] gigs were cheaper than the eight that's right yeah that's right so basically I think what might
[5580.00 → 5584.00] have happened because apple also wants to promote iCloud they want people investing in cloud storage
[5584.00 → 5588.96] anyway so I think even at the same cost they might have preferred a 16 gig model because when you're
[5588.96 → 5593.76] apple, and you have the margins and the profits that you do you can play around with well we're really
[5593.76 → 5598.96] investing in cloud business we can throw a couple dollars away even to the detriment of the customer
[5598.96 → 5604.32] directly in order to promote a different business unit or business model um do you do cloud stuff no
[5604.32 → 5610.72] I never back up to the cloud do you, so actually this is a great uh great conversation um unpaid has
[5610.72 → 5616.00] a lot of cool new features coming that might enable you to do some self-cloud type stuff that's cool
[5616.64 → 5620.64] which is pretty cool they also I'm trying to convince them this is not confirmed but I'm trying to
[5620.64 → 5625.92] convince them that they should have without me having to use crash plan or anything like that
[5625.92 → 5632.08] they should have a direct unpaid box to unpaid box uh link that I can do uh like off-site storage
[5632.08 → 5637.36] with so just like an unpaid clone like a one button uh you know and they figure there
[5637.36 → 5642.56] is probably it's possible to do it with no need for like proxy or port forwarding or anything like
[5642.56 → 5646.48] that, but it would have to be a paid service because you would have to at least do handle the port
[5646.48 → 5651.04] forwarding through their uh through their server unless you wanted to configure it yourself anyway it's
[5651.04 → 5655.52] like very much up in the air I'm trying to convince them to do it cool I think it's important I think
[5655.52 → 5660.08] they could get a lot of content creators using their storage if they could allow stuff like that
[5660.08 → 5664.56] lioness I think that I don't think anybody understands what you're even talking about
[5665.12 → 5671.44] these things he does well I do okay but like content creators you know who are these people
[5672.00 → 5678.88] YouTubers twitch streamers you would do you have to pay attention oh Lord yeah you just complain when
[5678.88 → 5683.44] the server doesn't work okay well this would be an easier way for the server to work all the time okay
[5683.44 → 5689.44] see now I get it perfect there we go that's what I was looking for there uh okay last topic for today
[5689.44 → 5697.20] this was posted by Nicholas FD Obama signs the internet over to the United Nations what does that
[5697.20 → 5703.44] even mean yeah yeah I don't know America to hand off internet in under two months it means America will
[5703.44 → 5709.12] be slightly less world police over one fewer thing in what within two months so the department of
[5709.12 → 5714.16] commerce is set to hand off American control of the internet over to international authorities in less
[5714.16 → 5720.48] than two months they will finalize the transaction effective October 1st the move means the internet
[5720.48 → 5724.56] assigned numbers authority will move from U.S. control to a global one and the proposal will
[5724.56 → 5730.16] significantly increase the power of foreign governments over the internet expand ICANN's
[5730.16 → 5735.60] historical core mission by creating a gateway to content regulations and embolden its leadership to act
[5735.60 → 5743.36] without any real accountability senator Ted Cruz said so yeah I don't know what that is not a fan um
[5743.36 → 5750.64] but honestly i I am not savvy enough to know exactly what this means I will say that I'm not that cool
[5750.64 → 5755.04] with America being in control of the internet but I'm also not necessarily I don't necessarily think the
[5755.04 → 5760.08] UN is going to do any better of a job of it so I mean I get that there's Aaron is it you said Aaron
[5760.08 → 5766.08] there's Aaron I think a-r-i-n there's whatever it's one of those things that means a bunch of things
[5766.72 → 5774.32] um that sort of controls who gets what block yeah right I mean I can do they do that I don't remember
[5774.32 → 5780.40] what I think I can is like um uh DNS and like maybe someone else's something I think Aaron is the
[5780.40 → 5786.48] actual IP address is okay whatever it is sorry I'm not an internet this is controlling content as well
[5786.48 → 5790.48] no so it wouldn't be in control of content it would be in control of infrastructure and
[5790.48 → 5796.96] regulating it that makes sense i guess i guess sure as long as somebody's managing it and
[5796.96 → 5804.32] it's not me it's apparently i-a-n-a-n i-n-n not errant so there you go enjoy okay so thank you guys
[5804.32 → 5812.24] you're helpful you're welcome i-a-n-a-n is numbers I can is DNS okay so I was right about one thing yeah
[5812.24 → 5816.80] yeah whoa let's end the show on a positive note thank you everyone for tuning in yeah you'll see
[5816.80 → 5822.48] you again next week same bad time same bad channel thanks to our special guest taken and Matt
[5822.48 → 5828.32] seven is a dusky you can view him over at twitch.tv slash seven us that's right that's right oh
[5828.32 → 5833.52] good that didn't work are we done oh that did work that did work okay, but they can still hear us though
[5834.16 → 5837.92] yeah they can oh I'm sweaty you just do the intro again do you guys have the zircon
[5837.92 → 5844.80] at six it turns off I'm not sweaty at all oh that's what ours turns off at six as well 5 30
[5844.80 → 5851.76] actually what sorry yeah wow you didn't know that I did not know that because and you're in the air
[5851.76 → 5858.56] condition part of the thing it's still a little cool remaining at that point but I can bypass it
[5858.56 → 5859.76] like I've had it on you can
[5867.92 → 5874.80] careful at all
[5883.76 → 5888.08] PRO Proper Moyer
[5888.80 → 5889.76] this is the member Mike
[5891.84 → 5892.80] we've got day
