[0.00 → 11.04] okay welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen where we have one hour and 20 minutes late i
[11.04 → 17.44] believe this may be maybe the latest that we have ever been we are the whole duration of the show
[17.44 → 26.48] late yes that is a thing that happened today and um yep to be perfectly honest with you guys
[26.48 → 36.16] the stream is still not perfect um i cannot run the intro video clip for some inexplicable
[36.16 → 40.88] reason we should just carry one of the chairs, and then you can like to drop it part way through
[40.88 → 48.40] right when you get in frame and then like to sit there and go like yeah we could do it yeah we could we
[48.40 → 54.00] could do that it's okay I'm just I'm not gonna yeah I'm not gonna worry about it uh let's just
[54.00 → 62.16] let's just go ahead and get this show on the freaking road here let's get it let's get it on
[62.16 → 68.80] the road because uh, uh apparently there's an oh yeah i know why there's an echo I know why
[68.80 → 74.48] there's an echo don't worry don't worry you guys we don't worry about it don't worry about it, I still
[74.48 → 79.20] had the I just had the speakers on my laptop because I didn't have my uh my headphones plugged
[79.20 → 84.00] in for a second here if we should be all good now let's go ahead and talk about what topics we're
[84.00 → 94.72] going to be hitting today topic number one is the NVIDIA GeForce GTX titan x again titan x2 if
[94.72 → 98.64] you know we were to take the Final Fantasy approach to this the way they're going with it is they're
[98.64 → 104.08] calling it titan x pascal well we'll, we'll get into that a little bit more later what we both think of
[104.08 → 110.08] that also Facebook wants to use freaking lasers to deliver high speed internet to remote areas
[110.88 → 115.12] I approve of this simply because it involves freaking lasers, but we'll talk more about the
[115.12 → 122.56] rest of it later of course NVIDIA also dropped to 1060 this week because uh apparently releasing
[122.56 → 128.00] gratuitous amounts of graphics cards all at once is a good idea also owner of kick-ass torrents was
[128.00 → 134.08] arrested and is about to be absolutely screwed yes, yes he is all right let's roll the intro
[139.12 → 142.00] it doesn't work no it's so far off
[142.00 → 147.44] do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do and see like you, you start kind of going Mario
[147.44 → 148.80] and then you switch it
[148.80 → 155.12] ministry of supply
[158.88 → 159.52] I fix it
[161.84 → 167.20] so I'm having I'm having I'm running into a weird issue I think it's a video codec related thing where
[167.20 → 169.70] where every time I try to play a video file,
[170.12 → 171.46] our streaming software crashes.
[171.48 → 174.02] Maybe fixity could release a fixity guide
[174.02 → 175.48] on how we can fix the stream.
[175.60 → 179.02] I would love it if fixity had...
[180.08 → 182.06] Like a teardown guide of XSplit?
[182.12 → 184.62] Yeah, like a teardown guide of just streaming in general.
[184.80 → 186.66] Right, because we need all the other things figured out too.
[186.74 → 187.42] At this point...
[187.42 → 188.88] Teardown guide of audio solutions,
[189.36 → 190.36] streaming software,
[190.94 → 192.44] streaming software utilities,
[192.82 → 194.00] audio monitoring,
[194.62 → 195.62] all that kind of stuff.
[195.72 → 196.50] All the things.
[196.50 → 197.42] The lower third works.
[197.52 → 198.18] Pictures work.
[198.34 → 199.26] Videos don't work.
[199.54 → 200.32] So there you go.
[200.44 → 202.08] That's where we're at with that.
[202.48 → 204.76] I feel like I was in the middle of an explanation
[204.76 → 206.98] of why we were so late last time.
[207.14 → 209.54] And I know that we're an hour and 20 minutes late,
[209.60 → 211.06] but I'm going to explain it anyway
[211.06 → 212.86] because there is a valid reason.
[212.96 → 215.26] It was all because I was trying to fix it.
[215.70 → 218.32] So first, I took the stream computer
[218.32 → 220.74] and upgraded it from X79
[220.74 → 224.46] with a two-generation-old top-of-the-line CPU
[224.46 → 225.92] to X99.
[225.92 → 228.24] I used the X99 Deluxe board,
[228.38 → 230.26] which our experience with...
[230.26 → 230.74] Rock solid.
[231.40 → 232.28] Freaking awesome board.
[232.38 → 232.92] It's probably...
[235.40 → 236.46] How many people get that?
[236.56 → 237.60] I hate you right now.
[237.60 → 238.32] How many people get that?
[238.38 → 239.06] Can we straw poll?
[239.22 → 240.02] I hate you.
[240.14 → 240.76] Can we straw poll?
[240.76 → 241.88] You go ahead and straw poll.
[241.92 → 242.64] I'm going to straw poll.
[242.64 → 244.88] In fact, hold on a second.
[245.66 → 250.16] I believe there actually is a Luke screen HDMI now.
[250.22 → 250.70] Oh, what?
[251.12 → 253.76] I was making upgrades, my main man.
[253.80 → 254.76] That sort of makes sense.
[255.02 → 256.56] I was making upgrades.
[256.70 → 257.68] I was doing things.
[257.78 → 259.96] I was trying to make the stream better.
[259.96 → 260.68] Wait, is this set up?
[260.72 → 262.16] Am I going to ruin things by plugging this in?
[262.24 → 262.92] I don't know.
[263.06 → 263.86] Let's find out.
[263.86 → 272.36] So anyway, X99 Deluxe motherboard, the most basic, like, low-speed DDR4 that I could possibly
[272.36 → 272.86] find.
[273.38 → 274.00] Yeah, that's good.
[274.36 → 275.10] That's a good thing.
[275.14 → 276.00] What just happened there?
[276.40 → 277.48] Screen turned off.
[277.60 → 278.18] It's like...
[278.18 → 281.66] X99 Deluxe.
[282.04 → 282.96] What else did I do?
[283.02 → 283.40] Right, right.
[283.48 → 285.40] Changed out the CPU RAM motherboard.
[285.84 → 292.04] New SSD because, get this, as soon as I changed the hardware, I've actually seen this once
[292.04 → 298.14] before, but when I changed out the hardware, every time I booted to the existing Windows
[298.14 → 301.66] install, no USB device could be detected.
[301.82 → 306.18] Unplugging, rep lugging, going into the BIOS, changing AHCI, AHCI, handoff, all that stuff.
[306.48 → 307.68] Nothing did anything.
[307.68 → 309.88] I even pulled it out of this machine, put it in a different machine.
[310.24 → 311.30] No USB devices.
[311.58 → 315.40] And because nothing has PS2 anymore, there's no way to even try to fix it.
[315.60 → 322.00] So I may just keep that drive forever as, like, a trophy of the kind of bullshit that
[322.00 → 323.34] I have to go through sometimes.
[323.72 → 325.16] So I had to reinstall the OS.
[325.30 → 327.48] I mean, meanwhile, it's like 3.15 at this point.
[327.54 → 328.50] Like, I got lots of time.
[328.56 → 329.58] I'm feeling pretty good.
[330.60 → 331.80] So I reinstalled the OS.
[331.98 → 333.68] I get my new capture cards going.
[333.68 → 335.70] And I'm still...
[335.70 → 338.18] My streaming software is still crashing.
[338.72 → 339.68] It's still crashing.
[340.08 → 343.42] So I'm changing out my XLR input to a different one.
[343.50 → 344.84] And it's still crashing.
[345.22 → 346.34] And I'm like, what is going on?
[346.58 → 350.88] Turns out video file, which is why I was late in the first place.
[350.88 → 356.40] And then we had issues with the audio quality on the stream, which is why we were yet another
[356.40 → 357.48] 20 minutes late.
[357.68 → 359.60] So I'm very sorry about all that.
[359.76 → 365.56] Let's find out if it was all worthwhile by switching over to the Luke screen scene.
[368.02 → 369.86] There's nothing there.
[370.92 → 372.76] I wasn't set up at all.
[373.06 → 373.92] Okay, just hold on.
[373.98 → 374.42] Just hold on.
[374.48 → 374.86] Just hold on.
[374.92 → 376.28] I didn't set it up.
[376.40 → 376.96] I didn't set it up.
[377.38 → 378.12] Just wait.
[378.12 → 381.22] He named the scene, and then it was just like, that's enough.
[383.08 → 384.00] Oh my.
[385.98 → 387.58] Try and plugging it back in.
[387.68 → 387.94] Okay.
[388.28 → 388.62] Let's see.
[388.74 → 389.00] Let's see.
[389.08 → 390.38] And also make sure your sound is off.
[390.44 → 392.90] Because otherwise they're going to get all your sound things.
[393.50 → 395.46] Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
[398.04 → 400.30] Oh God.
[400.82 → 401.58] Oh no.
[401.58 → 411.98] Well, you can very clearly see that the yes votes are at 13%.
[411.98 → 414.58] The no votes are at 52%.
[415.26 → 418.58] And the turnip votes are at 35%.
[419.10 → 420.14] Oh, hold on.
[420.18 → 420.90] It was a loose connection.
[422.40 → 423.36] It's a loose connection.
[423.46 → 423.72] Hold on.
[423.74 → 423.94] Hold on.
[423.96 → 424.94] I just got to tighten this up.
[425.78 → 426.22] Hold on.
[426.88 → 428.60] See, it seemed to get better there.
[429.02 → 429.36] Oh.
[429.50 → 429.70] Oh.
[429.70 → 430.42] That's not better.
[430.50 → 430.76] Hold on.
[430.84 → 431.44] I took it out.
[431.50 → 431.90] I took it out.
[432.26 → 432.62] Okay.
[436.16 → 439.18] Can they even still hear us?
[440.54 → 441.20] Oh, no.
[443.70 → 444.54] All right.
[444.70 → 447.50] So, well, you guys get the point.
[447.66 → 449.48] And we're never sharing Luke's screen again.
[449.54 → 449.86] No, no.
[449.92 → 451.44] We will share Luke's screen again someday.
[451.56 → 453.40] I just, I hadn't actually done that.
[454.04 → 455.18] Not this day.
[455.34 → 456.90] But it was not this day.
[456.90 → 459.58] One does not simply.
[461.58 → 462.02] Oh.
[464.26 → 465.66] What are we going to do, my precious?
[466.74 → 469.98] We're going to talk about GTX 1060 as if nothing happened.
[470.04 → 471.14] Yeah, let's do that.
[471.14 → 471.58] All right.
[471.58 → 472.74] The stream is completely fine.
[472.90 → 473.14] All right.
[473.18 → 473.86] We released a video.
[473.86 → 474.32] So, original article here.
[474.36 → 474.66] Hold on.
[474.76 → 474.88] Hold on.
[474.94 → 477.44] I'm going to have to buy my screen work.
[477.46 → 480.66] Our original article is ours, Technical, and not our own review.
[480.66 → 482.68] What the heck?
[483.68 → 484.70] Come on, bro.
[485.92 → 487.36] I made a video about this.
[487.42 → 488.42] Everyone's a critic, yo.
[488.68 → 489.64] Oh, man.
[490.16 → 490.96] Oh, wow.
[491.08 → 493.56] Colton was just, I think he was taking out some angst.
[493.88 → 497.98] Because I was giving him crap about something, like, last Friday.
[497.98 → 504.54] And, you know, I apologized for it after because my management technique was less than stellar on that occasion.
[504.74 → 505.02] Okay.
[505.28 → 512.34] But I think he's going to be trying to get back at, you know, he can't really get back at me because I'm his boss.
[512.52 → 515.16] So, he might just be taking it out on you for the next little bit.
[515.22 → 516.28] I'm technically also his boss.
[516.94 → 519.86] Actually, you know, you couldn't fire him directly.
[520.32 → 523.92] But if you were like, yo, Linus, let's have a heart-to-heart.
[524.16 → 525.90] I think we really need to fire Colton.
[526.60 → 528.04] He's been stealing things.
[528.22 → 529.34] I brought him into this world.
[529.44 → 530.46] I can make him leave this world.
[530.46 → 530.70] Yeah.
[531.00 → 532.32] Maybe indirectly, but.
[532.32 → 535.64] Yeah, I think I would have to take your word over his.
[536.06 → 538.48] Like, if you said Colton stole a bunch of stuff.
[538.72 → 541.44] And Colton's like, yo, go to Luke's house.
[541.54 → 542.46] It's all there.
[542.76 → 544.50] Like, set up around his computer.
[544.94 → 547.82] I'd be like, you know what, Colton?
[547.88 → 548.94] It's probably you who put it there.
[551.32 → 553.84] So, now Colton knows that there's just this thing.
[553.90 → 557.20] And now Luke knows that if he ever wants to steal stuff and blame it on Colton.
[558.34 → 560.14] That's exactly how it's going to go down.
[560.14 → 563.62] And all I have to do is leave it very specifically around my computer.
[563.98 → 566.64] And then I'll be like, look, this is exactly what we talked about would happen.
[566.66 → 568.26] It's exactly what you said would happen.
[568.46 → 570.22] And you can turn that into.
[570.24 → 570.98] You're just so smart.
[571.06 → 571.46] Exactly.
[571.46 → 573.16] You knew it would happen this way.
[573.18 → 578.54] And how can I not believe you when you're so astute as to observe my intelligence being what it is?
[578.98 → 579.64] Of course.
[579.74 → 581.66] Let's talk about GTX 1060.
[581.66 → 582.26] GTX 1060.
[582.26 → 585.64] So, in a nutshell, the Ars Technica headline kind of covers it.
[585.68 → 587.12] Or the byline, I guess it's called.
[587.62 → 592.94] GTX 1060 is faster than 980 for just a little bit more cash than the RX 480.
[593.26 → 600.34] What's missing from that summary is how it compares in terms of speed to the RX 480.
[600.34 → 604.96] So, you can't have a performance comparison to something that's not available anymore.
[605.48 → 614.80] And then a price comparison to some other completely unrelated thing from a completely different company that we don't know how to perform.
[614.98 → 616.12] Give me a second, really quick.
[616.32 → 625.00] Because something that's been kind of weird in a lot of reviews, including my own, I'm going to admit this right now, because it's hard to quantify.
[626.34 → 626.64] Okay.
[626.64 → 629.78] I want to see if you can even buy any of them.
[630.08 → 631.24] GTX 1060s?
[631.54 → 631.94] Yes.
[632.72 → 637.72] So, there is one GTX 1060 currently available on Amazon.
[638.06 → 639.82] And I think it's a mislabelled product.
[640.14 → 640.36] Nope.
[640.76 → 641.12] Nope.
[641.30 → 642.04] That's a 1060.
[642.24 → 644.44] There is one of them available from VGA.
[644.88 → 646.50] So, we'll see how long that lasts.
[647.38 → 652.40] And everything else that you look for when they get up 1060 is mostly 1070s.
[652.40 → 664.60] And looking at the Amazon.com prices for these things, in my video, I said that I didn't think they were going to be near the $249 USD price point.
[664.68 → 667.34] Because of what I saw with the 1070 and the 1080.
[667.54 → 667.72] Right.
[667.72 → 674.78] And I was slammed by certain people because there was an official price list released that had them closer to the $249 price point.
[674.86 → 681.26] But what I said in the video was that I didn't think that the 1060 and the 480 should even necessarily be compared that closely.
[681.58 → 681.80] Right.
[681.86 → 682.76] Because the 480 is $200.
[683.22 → 685.62] And the 1060 is probably going to be around $300.
[685.62 → 694.22] So, looking at Amazon.com, not .ca, there is the VGA GeForce 1060 currently sitting at $339.
[694.84 → 696.00] And there's only one of them.
[696.46 → 697.90] And this posting is from VGA.
[699.58 → 705.80] There is a gigabyte GeForce 1060 G1 Gaming Edition for $346.
[706.44 → 706.74] Okay.
[707.08 → 707.62] There is...
[708.78 → 710.58] Are you looking at .ca or .com?
[710.58 → 710.86] .com.
[710.86 → 711.26] .com.
[711.34 → 711.52] Okay.
[711.70 → 712.38] So, US pricing.
[712.52 → 713.92] Total Amp Edition.
[713.92 → 715.60] I sure wish we could share your screen right now.
[715.62 → 716.22] $245.
[716.28 → 716.96] You could do this.
[717.14 → 717.56] It's really easy.
[717.56 → 717.90] No, no.
[717.94 → 718.30] It's okay.
[719.16 → 726.84] Basically, my point is, the prices for all these things are just like whimsical imaginations of possibility.
[727.44 → 728.88] Like, the...
[728.88 → 729.46] What is it?
[729.50 → 731.54] My brother was trying to look at the 1080 Strip.
[731.86 → 735.28] And right now in Canada, it's like $1,300 or something.
[736.42 → 736.88] Really?
[736.96 → 739.38] It's just like, holy crap.
[739.90 → 740.82] What the hell?
[740.82 → 746.78] Like, these cards are in such low stock that I think what's happening is retailers are just like,
[746.88 → 748.60] well, we're sold out for forever.
[749.00 → 751.02] So, we might as well just crank the price up.
[751.34 → 756.58] You know, it's interesting because that kind of thing didn't use to really happen.
[756.96 → 764.08] I mean, I worked at a retailer for a lot of, wow, I don't know, six years or something like that.
[764.08 → 770.62] And so, I saw the behind the scenes of what actually goes on with a product launch like this.
[770.74 → 775.22] And, you know, the consumer, you know, loves to hate and say, you guys are gouging.
[775.30 → 775.92] You're doing this.
[776.10 → 782.78] And, you know, the reality of it would be that the Canadian dollar had dropped 5% in the last four days or something like that.
[782.78 → 790.60] And, you know, ultimately, we were just losing money on everything that we had sold before we adjusted pricing
[790.60 → 796.80] because we would get paid in, or sorry, we would have to pay in U.S. dollars,
[796.80 → 799.06] but we would get paid by the customer in CAD.
[799.50 → 804.86] So, you had to kind of guess because you're on anywhere from net 30 to net 60 terms.
[804.86 → 814.94] So, in actual fact, normally NCI was pretty darn close to whatever the normal markup was supposed to be
[814.94 → 819.50] once converted from U.S. to Canadian and then with, you know, a few percentage points on top
[819.50 → 822.08] so that you're actually making a little bit of money.
[822.38 → 827.62] And what I'll say about the board partners is that when it comes to the vanilla cards,
[828.12 → 833.92] they might opt not to make as many basic cards as they potentially could.
[833.92 → 834.30] Right.
[834.30 → 839.96] So, VGA could take every single GTX 1080 that comes into the door, every single GPU,
[840.32 → 845.16] and they could put it on their lowest cost card, and they could sell them all at the lower price,
[845.92 → 850.48] or they could, you know, at least supply some of those
[850.48 → 858.30] so that the people who want to deal on something that's not a Super Clock or a KO Edition or an AACS Plus or a Kingpin or whatever else,
[858.62 → 861.56] so those guys can get a card if they're willing to wait a little bit.
[861.56 → 868.82] And then I would put as much of my stock as I can base on what will hit those clock speeds into the ones that I can sell for a higher price.
[869.02 → 869.16] Of course.
[869.26 → 875.20] And that is the way that video card makers generally mark something up,
[875.20 → 881.12] by having a different skew, not by just hiking up the price of a card.
[881.12 → 883.90] There have been exceptions, to be very clear.
[883.90 → 892.14] 8,800 GT went up from the top, like from the very beginning of the supply chain,
[892.32 → 897.52] to my knowledge, and I don't have any confirmation of this, so you guys don't quote me on it,
[897.52 → 902.50] but to my knowledge, Nvidia jacked the price, and the board partners jacked the price.
[902.50 → 903.50] Colton, can I borrow you for a minute?
[904.54 → 909.00] And retailers were somewhat opportunistic on that particular card as well.
[909.06 → 909.94] And the same thing may be happening.
[910.24 → 912.10] Do you mind grabbing my power adapter?
[912.20 → 913.88] My laptop is going to die very, very soon.
[913.96 → 915.02] It's just in the main pocket there.
[915.96 → 916.78] Thank you.
[917.02 → 918.10] I didn't know where you were going with that.
[918.10 → 923.40] Also, I'd like to give you an opportunity to...
[923.40 → 925.38] Can you plug that into the back of the UPS first, though?
[926.08 → 929.64] I feel like it's only fair to give you an opportunity to defend yourself,
[929.72 → 931.00] because we talk a lot of smack.
[931.28 → 933.58] Okay, what am I defending myself on?
[933.62 → 935.14] We talk a lot of smack.
[936.42 → 940.16] In the event that it was your word against Luke's,
[940.44 → 943.90] and he was saying you stole a bunch of stuff from the office,
[943.90 → 950.30] and you pointed out to me that actually all that stuff was on Luke's desk at home.
[951.44 → 953.12] Do you think I should believe you,
[953.72 → 956.06] who I've only known for a little over a year?
[956.26 → 956.66] Definitely.
[956.86 → 957.66] Or should I believe...
[957.66 → 958.60] This guy's a troll.
[959.60 → 960.72] Definitely believe me.
[960.80 → 962.04] But I know you wouldn't, though.
[962.94 → 963.74] That's the thing.
[964.38 → 965.82] I would be so screwed.
[966.86 → 969.94] So I just got to not piss you off to make you want to do that,
[969.98 → 970.74] and we'll be good.
[970.90 → 971.62] Okay, thank you.
[971.66 → 972.68] That actually settled it.
[972.68 → 975.08] So it turns out Luke is, in fact, Colton's boss.
[977.66 → 981.44] Indirectly, because we all acknowledge that Colton has to suck up to him
[981.44 → 982.68] in order to save himself.
[982.88 → 983.78] Okay, thank you, Colton.
[983.86 → 984.10] Nice.
[984.16 → 984.68] You're wonderful.
[984.86 → 985.98] We appreciate you very much.
[986.60 → 988.04] Just, yeah, it closes the door.
[988.54 → 991.12] Okay, so I did some more investigating.
[991.42 → 991.74] Okay.
[992.04 → 993.42] I went on Newegg.com.
[993.68 → 995.80] Not only if you look for GTX 1060,
[995.96 → 999.40] it's literally everything on the first page,
[999.46 → 1000.78] and I think there's...
[1000.78 → 1002.10] Yep, there's only one page.
[1002.10 → 1005.28] Every single item is listed as out of stock,
[1005.82 → 1009.26] but a lot of the prices are actually pretty normal,
[1009.56 → 1010.60] but they're all out of stock.
[1010.80 → 1010.96] Right.
[1011.02 → 1011.86] You can't buy any of them.
[1011.96 → 1014.02] So if you go to RX 480,
[1014.82 → 1015.78] the same thing,
[1015.88 → 1017.70] or they're like computers and stuff,
[1017.92 → 1019.70] or completely unrelated products,
[1019.80 → 1020.62] which is weird.
[1020.62 → 1022.58] Maybe you should work on your algorithm,
[1022.78 → 1023.04] New egg.
[1023.10 → 1025.28] When I literally type in RX 480,
[1025.46 → 1030.14] I'm not talking about a Mazda RX 8 air conditioning,
[1030.32 → 1031.24] AC cooling,
[1031.44 → 1033.16] parallel flow condenser assembly.
[1033.78 → 1035.30] That's not what I'm looking for.
[1035.74 → 1036.18] Anyway,
[1036.18 → 1040.28] one of them has stock of two items,
[1041.04 → 1041.86] and it's...
[1041.86 → 1043.00] Let me find it again.
[1043.18 → 1043.80] Give me one second.
[1045.42 → 1046.08] Where'd it go?
[1047.66 → 1048.14] There.
[1048.34 → 1049.68] It's $409
[1049.68 → 1052.44] for a $200 graphics card.
[1052.44 → 1054.98] What?
[1055.92 → 1056.74] I am...
[1056.74 → 1057.10] So like,
[1057.22 → 1057.60] how?
[1060.00 → 1061.86] I am trying to get us...
[1061.86 → 1063.26] I'm trying to get us an input
[1063.26 → 1064.34] so you can screen share,
[1064.42 → 1066.42] because I'm personally really appreciating this,
[1066.48 → 1066.70] like,
[1067.06 → 1068.54] real-time shopping...
[1068.54 → 1069.52] shopping study.
[1069.72 → 1071.20] But I'm even, like,
[1071.28 → 1072.08] mostly done.
[1072.26 → 1073.36] But my problem is,
[1073.46 → 1075.80] how am I even really supposed to compare these cards?
[1076.62 → 1077.98] Because at this point,
[1078.10 → 1079.48] one of the manufacturers could be like,
[1079.58 → 1080.14] it's $50.
[1081.64 → 1082.12] There.
[1082.12 → 1083.44] Do your price comparisons.
[1083.60 → 1084.08] We win.
[1084.28 → 1085.04] Then you go to the store,
[1085.08 → 1085.42] and it's like,
[1085.56 → 1085.82] nope,
[1085.92 → 1086.78] it's $400.
[1087.38 → 1088.34] I hope they can hear us.
[1088.44 → 1088.80] What?
[1090.42 → 1090.82] Okay.
[1091.74 → 1092.10] Okay.
[1092.40 → 1092.88] Hold on.
[1093.52 → 1093.96] Hold on.
[1094.24 → 1094.94] I got an idea.
[1095.14 → 1095.36] No,
[1095.46 → 1096.54] that's not the right idea.
[1096.96 → 1097.72] Can they hear us?
[1098.12 → 1098.82] I don't know.
[1098.96 → 1099.76] I don't know.
[1100.66 → 1101.20] I don't know.
[1101.20 → 1101.72] No video.
[1102.40 → 1103.14] I don't know.
[1103.56 → 1105.06] Everything is scary right now.
[1105.40 → 1106.50] Everything is scary.
[1107.24 → 1107.90] Video output.
[1108.46 → 1108.82] Um,
[1109.24 → 1109.72] um,
[1110.18 → 1111.12] I don't know.
[1111.12 → 1111.72] We can hear.
[1111.72 → 1112.28] We can,
[1112.28 → 1112.82] they can hear.
[1113.04 → 1114.32] I don't know what I'm looking at.
[1114.76 → 1116.90] I don't know if I've looked it into the right thing.
[1116.92 → 1118.38] Everyone scream along with Linus.
[1118.52 → 1119.66] Even though we can't hear you,
[1119.76 → 1120.68] just do it at home.
[1120.88 → 1121.06] Just,
[1121.18 → 1121.58] ah,
[1121.58 → 1121.72] ah,
[1121.72 → 1122.72] ah,
[1122.72 → 1123.12] ah.
[1123.12 → 1125.22] shut up.
[1125.22 → 1127.92] Why are you being mean to me?
[1127.92 → 1129.52] No,
[1129.52 → 1129.94] it was Colton.
[1130.60 → 1130.96] Oh,
[1131.04 → 1131.40] Colton.
[1131.52 → 1132.40] I wasn't being mean to you.
[1132.40 → 1132.74] Oh,
[1132.84 → 1133.62] you're right.
[1134.88 → 1137.18] I don't know why I didn't realize it was Colton.
[1137.58 → 1137.94] So,
[1138.00 → 1138.96] you're just so smart.
[1139.16 → 1140.48] That's why you ended up figuring it out,
[1140.54 → 1140.72] though.
[1141.38 → 1142.76] Not everything has to come to you immediately,
[1142.76 → 1143.16] because you're,
[1143.24 → 1145.20] you're just dealing with so many things at once.
[1145.78 → 1146.18] Um,
[1146.32 → 1148.02] so I'm on a completely different level.
[1148.12 → 1148.38] Yeah.
[1149.04 → 1149.40] Oh,
[1149.44 → 1150.20] can you plug that in?
[1150.24 → 1151.56] That might have something to do with it.
[1151.64 → 1151.96] Uh,
[1151.96 → 1153.62] the HDMI cable for your laptop.
[1154.00 → 1154.16] Really?
[1154.50 → 1154.70] Yeah,
[1154.70 → 1155.36] I'm trying to,
[1155.48 → 1155.72] that,
[1155.78 → 1156.34] that might be,
[1156.40 → 1159.78] that might be part of the reason why Luke screen capture is not,
[1159.88 → 1160.22] um,
[1160.66 → 1160.94] is,
[1160.94 → 1162.84] I didn't even know we were trying to do Luke screen capture.
[1162.84 → 1163.02] Yeah.
[1163.02 → 1163.22] Yeah.
[1163.22 → 1163.80] I'm trying to,
[1163.80 → 1164.54] I'm trying to get,
[1164.62 → 1165.46] I'm trying to get you,
[1165.52 → 1165.78] uh,
[1165.84 → 1167.28] I'm trying to get you back up and running here.
[1167.28 → 1167.38] Okay.
[1167.38 → 1169.24] So my computer has done the freak-out thing.
[1169.34 → 1170.30] So we're ready to go.
[1170.36 → 1170.66] Yeah.
[1170.74 → 1171.02] Yeah.
[1171.12 → 1171.48] Okay.
[1171.68 → 1172.08] Yeah.
[1172.40 → 1173.42] Everyone's on duplicate.
[1173.94 → 1174.34] Yeah.
[1174.54 → 1175.02] Okay.
[1175.38 → 1175.74] Yeah.
[1175.92 → 1176.36] No.
[1176.54 → 1176.98] Okay.
[1178.42 → 1178.86] Yeah.
[1179.04 → 1179.44] No.
[1179.66 → 1180.10] Okay.
[1182.26 → 1182.74] Yeah.
[1182.82 → 1183.30] Yeah.
[1183.42 → 1183.82] No.
[1184.20 → 1184.64] Okay.
[1185.08 → 1185.44] Yeah.
[1185.64 → 1186.08] No.
[1186.84 → 1187.32] Okay.
[1187.74 → 1192.82] This sounds like a phone conversation with like that guy that just really doesn't care about what's going on the
[1192.82 → 1193.18] other end.
[1193.78 → 1194.18] Yeah.
[1195.62 → 1196.02] No.
[1196.90 → 1197.30] Okay.
[1198.36 → 1199.60] Let's be back now.
[1200.62 → 1201.02] Oh,
[1201.16 → 1201.30] see,
[1201.32 → 1203.34] I think I was plugging to the right thing in the first place.
[1203.52 → 1203.96] Oh,
[1204.04 → 1204.30] dear.
[1204.90 → 1205.70] I think like,
[1205.86 → 1206.78] like I'm,
[1206.82 → 1207.30] I'm done.
[1207.42 → 1208.38] I think I said everything.
[1209.04 → 1209.44] Okay.
[1210.04 → 1210.44] Yeah.
[1210.88 → 1211.28] No.
[1212.42 → 1212.82] Okay.
[1212.90 → 1213.02] Well,
[1213.06 → 1213.56] why don't you talk,
[1213.72 → 1215.94] why don't you talk 10 60 now?
[1216.58 → 1218.68] I was talking 10 60 the whole time.
[1218.80 → 1218.98] Oh,
[1219.10 → 1219.38] okay.
[1219.46 → 1219.78] You're done.
[1219.86 → 1220.30] Anyway,
[1220.44 → 1220.70] it's,
[1220.70 → 1220.86] it's,
[1221.04 → 1221.42] I'll,
[1221.42 → 1222.80] I'll give a brief overview of what I said.
[1222.82 → 1223.36] Okay.
[1223.40 → 1224.10] It's very difficult.
[1224.10 → 1225.46] Did you talk like specs at all?
[1225.46 → 1226.06] Or do we care?
[1226.54 → 1228.74] I was going to finish that part of the conversation before.
[1228.86 → 1229.14] Okay.
[1229.14 → 1232.02] Can I jump in with something that I had wanted to add?
[1232.30 → 1233.58] So it,
[1233.72 → 1236.10] with respect to the pricing conversation.
[1236.10 → 1238.96] So Sapphire actually sent me a NDA.
[1238.96 → 1239.16] Oh,
[1240.18 → 1240.52] Oh yeah.
[1240.56 → 1240.74] Okay.
[1240.74 → 1242.82] The NDA lifted like six hours ago.
[1242.82 → 1243.14] Perfect.
[1243.36 → 1243.66] Sweet.
[1243.78 → 1246.16] So they have a nitro plus RX 480.
[1246.16 → 1251.42] Because we wanted to talk about like how the pricing of these cards might kind of creep together,
[1251.42 → 1253.42] depending on if you compare a low end.
[1254.02 → 1254.98] Or creep apart.
[1255.24 → 1255.96] Or creep apart.
[1256.20 → 1256.52] Or whatever,
[1256.72 → 1259.10] based on like crazy pricing in different areas.
[1259.32 → 1259.72] But yeah,
[1259.80 → 1263.90] my point was that usually in the U S you have the most stable pricing structure.
[1264.02 → 1264.20] Yeah.
[1264.20 → 1266.86] Because that's where they're making their initial pricing,
[1266.86 → 1271.20] but it's just complete lunacy in the U S meaning it's even more crazy.
[1271.34 → 1272.08] So tell me this,
[1272.08 → 1274.04] the four gig RX 480,
[1274.36 → 1275.06] you know,
[1275.14 → 1278.94] whatever nitro X is 220 U S dollars.
[1278.94 → 1279.38] Okay.
[1279.56 → 1279.98] MSRP.
[1279.98 → 1280.44] Yeah.
[1280.56 → 1282.70] The eight gig is 270.
[1283.38 → 1284.46] What would you buy?
[1284.60 → 1287.72] Do you find the cheapest 1060 you can find,
[1287.84 → 1289.72] or do you buy a high-end RX 480?
[1289.72 → 1291.72] Uh,
[1293.72 → 1296.14] from my experience so far,
[1296.20 → 1297.02] it depends.
[1298.88 → 1300.74] Can you actually get them at that price?
[1300.84 → 1302.62] Cause that was what I was just talking about.
[1302.74 → 1302.84] Right.
[1302.84 → 1305.12] Not only is everything sold out in general,
[1305.16 → 1306.60] so you can't even buy it if you wanted to,
[1307.16 → 1310.74] but the prices of them is crazy as well.
[1310.96 → 1311.36] Right.
[1311.82 → 1314.70] So like the pricing that they're sending in the email,
[1314.88 → 1316.26] is that actually real?
[1316.44 → 1318.14] Because right now on New egg,
[1318.14 → 1320.82] the only available 480 is over $400.
[1321.84 → 1322.20] Right.
[1322.90 → 1324.36] So it's,
[1324.36 → 1325.34] it's four,
[1325.50 → 1325.84] uh,
[1325.86 → 1326.36] where is it?
[1326.58 → 1327.10] Maybe one second.
[1327.26 → 1328.08] I keep on losing it.
[1329.18 → 1329.72] Out of stock,
[1329.80 → 1330.22] out of stock,
[1330.32 → 1330.76] out of stock,
[1330.84 → 1331.26] out of stock,
[1331.34 → 1331.84] out of stock.
[1333.30 → 1334.24] Out of stock.
[1335.58 → 1338.38] $409 is the only one that's currently not out of stock.
[1338.54 → 1339.64] It's a vision tech card.
[1340.40 → 1340.76] Okay.
[1341.66 → 1342.94] There are additional pages.
[1343.12 → 1344.52] I haven't looked into the additional pages,
[1344.74 → 1346.26] but I did one entire page of products.
[1346.46 → 1347.54] Decided that was probably enough.
[1348.14 → 1348.76] All right.
[1348.92 → 1349.36] So,
[1349.46 → 1349.80] um,
[1349.86 → 1350.26] I guess,
[1350.40 → 1350.60] so,
[1350.70 → 1351.74] so basically our,
[1351.80 → 1354.06] our usual guidance remains true.
[1354.06 → 1358.82] Then we generally recommend sticking with,
[1358.82 → 1360.14] uh,
[1360.16 → 1360.40] the
[1360.46 → 1364.48] the higher end card versus buying a high end of a lower end GPU.
[1364.62 → 1364.84] Yeah.
[1365.16 → 1365.48] Okay.
[1365.92 → 1366.14] Fine.
[1366.14 → 1366.58] But like,
[1367.36 → 1368.74] if you can even get it,
[1368.86 → 1370.52] let's talk high-end cards.
[1370.76 → 1375.24] Nvidia announces the new GTX Titan X,
[1375.34 → 1377.54] which they're calling Nvidia Titan X.
[1377.64 → 1379.46] Now I could probably go off.
[1379.54 → 1379.68] Oh,
[1379.68 → 1382.66] I was going to have you leave that plugged in so that I can still try things.
[1383.14 → 1383.58] Um,
[1383.58 → 1388.58] I could probably go off on a rant for a good solid 10 minutes.
[1388.72 → 1389.36] However long you want.
[1389.44 → 1391.40] About naming things,
[1391.82 → 1395.80] the same thing that they were already named when they are a completely different product.
[1395.84 → 1396.86] Or saying new.
[1397.18 → 1397.56] Yes.
[1397.62 → 1398.20] Or whatever.
[1398.60 → 1399.26] Like the new,
[1399.48 → 1399.80] you know,
[1399.84 → 1400.00] it's,
[1400.06 → 1400.38] it's like,
[1400.42 → 1405.16] it's like everyone took everything that was wrong with shampoo marketing.
[1405.16 → 1407.04] And you know,
[1407.10 → 1408.74] now with 33% more,
[1409.26 → 1410.88] 33% more than what?
[1411.58 → 1413.42] 33% more of what?
[1414.22 → 1415.64] What am I comparing this to?
[1415.70 → 1417.02] Is it a product from last month?
[1417.10 → 1418.48] Is it a product from four years ago?
[1418.92 → 1419.66] What is their 30?
[1420.50 → 1421.98] How do I understand this?
[1422.12 → 1424.68] One thing that I do understand in terms of that naming,
[1424.78 → 1427.92] the only time that I think it actually made sense was Battlefield 1.
[1429.78 → 1430.26] Really?
[1430.48 → 1431.60] Because they went back.
[1432.94 → 1433.42] Okay.
[1433.42 → 1435.58] So that sort of made sense.
[1436.00 → 1437.32] I'm still not a huge fan of it.
[1438.48 → 1439.72] But this is different.
[1439.96 → 1441.08] This isn't a reboot.
[1441.52 → 1442.40] This is a sequel.
[1443.36 → 1443.58] No,
[1443.62 → 1444.62] I'm not saying it's okay here.
[1444.80 → 1445.10] Okay.
[1445.18 → 1445.44] Okay.
[1445.54 → 1445.72] Yeah.
[1445.96 → 1446.28] Okay.
[1446.28 → 1446.52] Okay.
[1446.56 → 1446.68] No,
[1446.70 → 1446.82] no,
[1446.82 → 1446.86] no,
[1446.86 → 1450.32] we're agreeing that it's not okay here because there are a lot of things that are confusing
[1450.32 → 1450.86] about this.
[1451.08 → 1457.42] It's confusing for retailers because SEO is hard enough when you don't have to,
[1457.54 → 1463.02] basically the only way that I can think of to fix your SEO from old generation Titan X
[1463.02 → 1465.48] versus new generation Titan X is manually.
[1465.90 → 1470.68] Like you will basically have to go into your backend and go,
[1470.68 → 1471.16] okay,
[1471.34 → 1475.22] if Titan X created before X,
[1475.72 → 1479.26] then do not return result before created after X.
[1479.36 → 1479.68] Like that's...
[1479.68 → 1483.02] They should replace their product pages.
[1485.34 → 1487.30] The problem is that the pricing is different.
[1488.08 → 1488.30] A.
[1488.80 → 1492.20] The other problem is that you might be looking it up for a warranty return.
[1493.18 → 1493.56] The other problem...
[1493.56 → 1493.68] No,
[1493.78 → 1496.40] they should replace their product pages and then remake,
[1496.56 → 1497.74] but with the old cards.
[1497.74 → 1499.82] So you can still find it,
[1499.92 → 1502.94] but the SEO linking through Google and everything is still really popular.
[1503.40 → 1505.46] That's actually a smart way to take advantage of this.
[1505.50 → 1506.66] I guarantee no one will do it.
[1507.84 → 1508.04] But...
[1508.04 → 1508.36] And...
[1508.36 → 1511.02] Because you should still have your product page for the old card for warranty reasons
[1511.02 → 1511.78] and everything that you said.
[1511.86 → 1512.42] Like NCI,
[1512.56 → 1512.94] for example,
[1513.02 → 1513.74] I know for a fact,
[1513.80 → 1515.28] there's no mechanism for them to do that.
[1515.68 → 1517.14] Like that is not a thing.
[1517.62 → 1519.44] That won't be a thing that they'll be able to do.
[1520.24 → 1520.58] So,
[1520.68 → 1520.84] okay.
[1520.94 → 1522.16] So it screws over the retailer.
[1522.44 → 1522.68] Okay.
[1522.68 → 1528.96] It screws over the reviewer because it makes it so that instead of me just saying Titan P
[1528.96 → 1531.52] or Titan XP or PX,
[1531.60 → 1533.84] or if we had called it something that had made an ounce of sense,
[1534.00 → 1538.04] I have to say Titan X 2016 edition.
[1538.38 → 1539.30] Like I have to clarify.
[1539.82 → 1541.24] If you gave us Titan XP,
[1541.92 → 1544.62] there could have been all the like little smiley face jokes and stuff.
[1544.70 → 1545.62] And that could have been pretty cool,
[1545.74 → 1546.14] by the way.
[1546.26 → 1547.26] And that would have been...
[1547.26 → 1548.02] That would have been way better.
[1548.16 → 1548.38] Yeah.
[1548.52 → 1548.80] Anyway,
[1548.80 → 1549.10] okay.
[1549.10 → 1551.16] We should just call it the Titan XP from now on.
[1551.30 → 1551.52] I'm down.
[1551.52 → 1552.84] I'm down to do it.
[1553.00 → 1555.10] I will literally call it that throughout the entire review.
[1555.24 → 1556.12] I will do that too.
[1556.36 → 1556.58] Cool.
[1556.62 → 1558.78] We are calling it the Titan XP from now on.
[1558.82 → 1559.60] You heard it here first.
[1559.68 → 1560.26] It is the Titan XP.
[1560.26 → 1561.24] It is the Titan XP.
[1561.68 → 1561.92] Okay.
[1562.08 → 1567.98] The third person that this screws over and the one that gets screwed over the most is the consumer.
[1569.50 → 1575.90] You are basically making it impossible for the consumer to understand from reading reviews,
[1576.04 → 1576.92] Googling reviews,
[1577.20 → 1578.04] comparing pricing,
[1578.52 → 1580.58] what exactly it is they're buying,
[1580.58 → 1589.66] unless they are an extraordinarily savvy consumer who really keeps up with the industry by watching fantastic programming like the WAN show on a weekly basis.
[1590.30 → 1596.66] That is the only way that you will know that one Titan X is different from another more different Titan X.
[1596.66 → 1596.98] Oh,
[1596.98 → 1599.26] someone in the chat even just said,
[1599.46 → 1601.26] win XP with the Titan XP.
[1602.62 → 1603.06] Right?
[1603.20 → 1603.36] Like,
[1603.50 → 1604.36] holy crap.
[1604.44 → 1606.00] Those marketing campaigns write themselves.
[1606.16 → 1607.20] Why did you do this?
[1607.56 → 1608.36] You had such an opportunity.
[1608.36 → 1608.68] I know.
[1608.98 → 1614.56] We used all the XP that we had building amazing GPUs, and we turned out this beast.
[1615.00 → 1616.14] NVIDIA levelled up.
[1616.46 → 1617.14] It's endless.
[1617.44 → 1617.94] There's so many.
[1617.94 → 1618.74] Level up your game.
[1618.98 → 1619.34] Oh,
[1619.62 → 1620.00] it's perfect.
[1620.56 → 1621.38] It's amazing.
[1621.62 → 1622.96] They need to rename this card.
[1623.08 → 1623.44] They do.
[1623.54 → 1625.34] They have to rename this card like right now.
[1625.38 → 1625.64] They do.
[1625.76 → 1626.16] They need to,
[1626.48 → 1626.70] okay,
[1626.82 → 1627.68] here's what they need to do.
[1627.78 → 1628.00] Okay.
[1628.10 → 1628.52] NVIDIA,
[1628.62 → 1629.36] if you guys are watching,
[1629.72 → 1635.26] you take the Titan X 2016 editions that you have now, and you turn them into kind of like,
[1635.36 → 1637.28] like a coin with two tail sides.
[1637.28 → 1639.68] Like anyone who bought one or got a giveaway,
[1639.84 → 1640.74] like right at the beginning.
[1641.50 → 1641.78] Okay.
[1641.86 → 1642.88] They have like this weird,
[1642.96 → 1643.98] it's almost like a misprint.
[1644.08 → 1644.26] Okay.
[1644.28 → 1646.78] So they have like this weird one that like had the wrong name on it.
[1647.34 → 1650.76] You just change all the shrouds to Titan XP moving forward.
[1650.84 → 1650.96] Okay.
[1650.96 → 1651.74] You got to retool it.
[1651.80 → 1652.20] I'm sorry.
[1652.20 → 1653.16] That costs a little bit of money.
[1653.54 → 1654.04] You're NVIDIA.
[1654.10 → 1654.72] You can afford it.
[1655.34 → 1657.74] And the Titan XP is the actual name of the product.
[1657.74 → 1659.48] And everyone's like talking about it.
[1659.72 → 1660.34] It would be awesome.
[1660.82 → 1661.40] You should do it.
[1661.56 → 1662.14] That would be smart.
[1662.14 → 1662.54] You won't,
[1662.66 → 1666.50] but you should because it would be better for absolutely everyone because this is really
[1666.50 → 1669.02] confusing for consumers, and it's totally unfair.
[1669.38 → 1676.20] It's already confusing enough when video card manufacturers take two of the same product
[1676.20 → 1677.72] and call it something different.
[1678.20 → 1681.24] Rebadging is terrible and confusing for consumers.
[1681.76 → 1686.16] Now you're taking it a step further, and now you might have two different products that
[1686.16 → 1687.46] are called the same thing.
[1687.74 → 1693.40] You're basically just saying, I don't really want anyone to understand what it is.
[1694.06 → 1697.78] I want people to just walk into a store and have a salesperson sell them the most expensive
[1697.78 → 1698.68] thing that they can.
[1699.16 → 1700.90] That's the message that I'm getting from this.
[1701.14 → 1701.98] I don't like it.
[1702.20 → 1708.88] And speaking of the most expensive thing that they can, the Titan XP is going to cost 1200
[1708.88 → 1713.36] US dollars when it's available August 2nd directly from NVIDIA.
[1713.36 → 1722.22] And my bridging point back from the 1060 stuff is, okay, you're buying Titan X's August 2nd
[1722.22 → 1723.06] from NVIDIA.
[1723.46 → 1723.78] Sure.
[1724.24 → 1725.72] Down the line when they stop doing that.
[1725.80 → 1726.46] You mean XP's?
[1726.70 → 1727.02] Yeah.
[1727.10 → 1727.26] Sorry.
[1727.32 → 1727.72] XP's.
[1727.72 → 1729.20] I screwed up.
[1729.26 → 1730.40] I called a last generation card.
[1730.46 → 1730.78] My bad.
[1731.68 → 1733.02] I'm still in last year.
[1734.70 → 1736.06] What happens later on?
[1736.26 → 1737.62] Are they going to be $1,600?
[1738.36 → 1740.28] You already price hiked by 200.
[1740.28 → 1744.40] In the 1060 review at the very beginning, I have a chart showing how every one of their
[1744.40 → 1747.14] new GPUs has been price hiked by a hundred bucks.
[1747.28 → 1748.78] This is by 200 bucks.
[1749.14 → 1754.90] Now, this is something that you may not have been paying attention for long enough to know,
[1755.44 → 1763.02] but NVIDIA actually has not, I would say NVIDIA and ANTI slash AMD, because that's how
[1763.02 → 1769.30] far back this goes, have not actually been that unreasonable about the way that they
[1769.30 → 1774.00] have done the pricing of their extreme top tier hardware.
[1774.22 → 1775.50] And I will explain.
[1775.82 → 1777.58] I will explain why I'm saying that.
[1777.58 → 1778.38] I like that VGA logo.
[1778.82 → 1781.08] Because, oh, yeah, that's ancient.
[1781.40 → 1785.66] That's back when they were EVGA.com, and it was always EVGA.com.
[1786.14 → 1787.72] They actually, that was like part of the branding.
[1789.22 → 1790.70] So let me see if I can find.
[1790.70 → 1796.96] So the 6800 Ultra Extreme was basically vaporware.
[1797.68 → 1802.86] And if you're going to build a card that you're basically saying, let me see if I can find
[1802.86 → 1804.44] a reference to pricing here.
[1806.06 → 1806.84] With benchmark.
[1806.98 → 1809.44] If you're building a card that you're basically saying, yeah, it's going to be available from
[1809.44 → 1816.40] our site, only then something, something, something.
[1816.50 → 1819.50] Yeah, you're basically saying like it's pretty much a vaporware card.
[1820.70 → 1821.40] Let me find it.
[1821.56 → 1826.06] You can expect to pay upwards of $600 for a card of this calibre.
[1826.20 → 1829.00] And we were unable to locate a retailer that had them in stock at the moment.
[1829.00 → 1840.42] So 6800 Ultra Extremes went for kind of getting somewhat close to the like, you know, $800, $900 range.
[1840.58 → 1844.56] And the 8800 Ultra was actually a pretty similar story.
[1845.06 → 1846.58] Ultra price at launch.
[1846.64 → 1848.16] Let me just see if I can find it.
[1848.96 → 1849.34] Okay.
[1849.42 → 1852.16] So the 8800 Ultra was priced at $830.
[1852.16 → 1855.88] And that was released back in 2007.
[1856.16 → 1857.84] So let's use an inflation calculator.
[1859.94 → 1860.34] Okay.
[1861.26 → 1862.18] Inflation calculator.
[1862.32 → 1865.02] I'm going to use the Bank of Canada one if that's okay with everyone.
[1865.60 → 1866.16] How do you use?
[1866.38 → 1866.52] Here.
[1866.70 → 1867.48] So I'm going to, we'll go ahead.
[1867.54 → 1868.18] We'll do this live.
[1868.52 → 1872.68] So in 2007, something that cost, what was it?
[1872.72 → 1873.10] 839?
[1873.24 → 1873.56] 839.
[1873.56 → 1873.68] 839.
[1874.24 → 1875.46] Well, I can type a thing.
[1875.70 → 1876.12] Type a.
[1876.26 → 1877.86] 839 would cost.
[1879.08 → 1879.60] Calculate.
[1880.68 → 1881.02] Okay.
[1881.32 → 1887.46] So they weren't being unreasonable before, back when I did the math, based on that Titan X is $1,000.
[1888.02 → 1888.18] Yeah.
[1888.30 → 1893.28] Because, well, I mean, I'm not saying that an $839 card in 2007 wasn't unreasonable.
[1893.28 → 1893.78] It was.
[1893.94 → 1899.98] I'm just saying that we're actually tracking okay, but they've jumped ahead by $200 this time.
[1899.98 → 1904.02] So you're right, and I was right, like, two days ago.
[1904.16 → 1904.40] Okay.
[1904.72 → 1904.86] Yeah.
[1905.54 → 1906.18] How about that?
[1906.30 → 1907.12] We're both right, okay?
[1907.14 → 1907.60] Sure, sure.
[1908.02 → 1921.08] I think the problem that people have is jumping by $100 on XX60 and XX70 and XX80 and jumping by $200 on Titan doesn't feel like an inflation adjustment.
[1921.50 → 1925.72] If they adjusted by little bits every time, it would feel more like inflation adjustments.
[1925.72 → 1932.22] Now, I understand that you don't want really weird pricing numbers on your products, but that's what people are feeling when you do that.
[1932.44 → 1936.76] They're feeling that one chunk jump, and it doesn't feel great.
[1937.86 → 1938.96] Feels bad, man.
[1939.14 → 1939.26] Yeah.
[1939.26 → 1946.28] So you can actually see here that probably the last time they did this then was with the 8800 Ultra, because here's our six.
[1946.38 → 1948.30] I remember these costing more, though.
[1948.80 → 1950.16] 6800 Ultra Extremes.
[1950.32 → 1950.86] They're stupid.
[1950.92 → 1951.92] You basically couldn't buy them.
[1951.92 → 1966.16] But they did a fairly significant jump there, and it looks like they've taken another leap forward in terms of the value of a GPU, like an ultimate gaming experience relative to eggs and milk once again.
[1966.70 → 1973.22] And I think ultimately the person that we have to blame for this, or not person, but the entity that we have to blame for this is AMD.
[1973.22 → 1980.96] You know, I'm not going to, like, crap on AMD, because they're having a hard enough time as it is with the things that are difficult for them, which is apparently everything.
[1982.28 → 1988.54] But if AMD was keeping NVIDIA in check, then at the high end.
[1988.68 → 1989.00] Okay.
[1989.16 → 1993.78] So, you know, to be clear, 480 looks like a very successful product.
[1993.96 → 1994.12] Yeah.
[1994.24 → 2001.70] And AMD did a really, I think it was a smart move, coming in and saying, okay, look, we're not going to go toe-to-toe with NVIDIA this time.
[2001.70 → 2001.92] Yep.
[2002.08 → 2003.06] I saw that straight up in the review.
[2003.18 → 2012.80] We're going to hit, we're going to come from the bottom, while NVIDIA can spend all that money that's associated with building the biggest GPU ever, which they did.
[2013.02 → 2013.26] Yep.
[2013.26 → 2020.12] And they can trickle that technology down, and we're just going to build what we think is the right thing at the right price from the outset.
[2021.00 → 2021.80] Fair strategy.
[2021.88 → 2024.24] I have a video coming, just so people know.
[2024.24 → 2028.82] I'm not going to go, like, too into it, because I want you to watch the video.
[2029.10 → 2039.18] But I have a video coming on the 480 and VR and, like, how well positioned that card actually is in terms of performance even more than price.
[2039.50 → 2044.00] How you can just get this card and be fine for, like, what almost anyone is really going to want.
[2044.18 → 2044.40] Yep.
[2044.40 → 2047.44] And then there will be percentages of people that want more than that.
[2047.52 → 2051.60] But it's like, it is a problem solver, which is exactly what they needed.
[2052.06 → 2063.66] So, I just, I mean, I still, I would have personally preferred to see AMD have a, you know, Fury XP or whatever would go head-to-head with a Titan XP.
[2063.66 → 2070.06] Because that is the kind of thing that keeps pressure on NVIDIA not to do this kind of thing.
[2070.74 → 2078.90] And they just didn't, yeah, they just didn't, they didn't do it.
[2079.24 → 2079.38] Yeah.
[2079.76 → 2084.68] I mean, there's still time for Polaris to go head-to-head with Pascal.
[2085.22 → 2089.58] And so I'm looking forward to that, because that should at least force NVIDIA to react.
[2089.58 → 2093.60] And, yeah, I don't know.
[2093.70 → 2095.64] I guess I'm kind of out of stuff to say about this.
[2095.92 → 2105.50] Okay, there's a new Titan X, 11 teraflops, 12 billion transistors, 3584 CUBA cores, up to 60% faster than previous Titan X.
[2105.76 → 2105.98] Cool.
[2106.94 → 2113.50] People are a little upset that it's GDDR5X instead of HBM2.
[2113.70 → 2113.90] Yep.
[2114.24 → 2116.70] I'm a little upset, but I totally get why they're doing it.
[2116.70 → 2119.22] They're just kind of going, it doesn't matter.
[2119.34 → 2119.96] And they're right.
[2120.04 → 2120.74] It doesn't matter.
[2121.92 → 2123.12] So screw it.
[2123.24 → 2124.32] We're going to make a little bit more margin.
[2124.74 → 2126.54] Wait for HBM2 to mature a little bit.
[2127.56 → 2134.70] Right now it can just be a low-volume part, and we'll just keep that in our scientific computing cards.
[2135.22 → 2136.18] Keep that in the Teslas.
[2136.36 → 2136.60] Fine.
[2137.60 → 2138.34] So I get it.
[2138.34 → 2143.72] I mean, memory overclocking hasn't done anything on a video card in a very, very, very long time.
[2144.14 → 2149.78] And I'm sure that NVIDIA has done all the research that is required to decide if it's worth it or not.
[2149.84 → 2152.80] Because apparently the GPU itself does support HBM2.
[2152.98 → 2155.22] So they just decided to pair it with GDDR5X.
[2155.22 → 2162.02] One thing that I'm frustrated with, which almost no one is going to be able to sympathize with me for,
[2162.42 → 2166.82] is it's being sold on August the 2nd.
[2168.76 → 2171.18] We heard about it the same day you guys did.
[2171.30 → 2172.26] I don't have one.
[2173.28 → 2173.48] I don't.
[2173.92 → 2177.92] How am I supposed to review this before the release date?
[2177.92 → 2180.44] We should, we've been talking about this.
[2180.68 → 2182.60] So we've actually been talking about doing this before.
[2182.82 → 2186.14] We should review the card before we have the card.
[2187.34 → 2187.74] Yeah.
[2187.94 → 2191.38] Because there have been cards where Luke and I have sat down and gone,
[2191.48 → 2193.04] okay, card's coming.
[2193.22 → 2194.18] We haven't been briefed on it.
[2194.22 → 2194.92] We don't have a deck.
[2194.98 → 2195.76] We don't have any specs.
[2195.90 → 2196.58] We have no driver.
[2196.70 → 2197.14] We have no card.
[2197.20 → 2197.64] We have nothing.
[2197.86 → 2201.88] And we basically go, okay, it's going to be like this, and it's going to be like that,
[2202.16 → 2205.44] and it's going to be kind of like this, and here's the conclusion.
[2205.44 → 2208.10] And we should just release our full review of it.
[2208.14 → 2209.58] So we should not sign an NDA.
[2209.92 → 2211.60] We should not accept a review unit.
[2211.74 → 2213.88] And we should release a review the day before.
[2214.10 → 2215.12] Oh my God.
[2215.22 → 2216.00] Without a card.
[2216.36 → 2217.00] That could be fun.
[2217.08 → 2221.54] It would be easier with the XX number card.
[2222.62 → 2223.06] Yeah.
[2223.06 → 2223.74] Than a Titan.
[2224.00 → 2224.84] Yeah, yeah.
[2224.84 → 2225.92] A Titan would be a little difficult.
[2226.02 → 2228.32] Like it's easier when they're taking an existing lineup,
[2228.42 → 2229.82] and they're kind of slotting something in.
[2229.82 → 2230.56] Yeah, yeah.
[2230.60 → 2233.78] Like, okay, it would be pretty easy for us to do that with like a 1080 Ti.
[2233.78 → 2236.76] Yes, 1080 Ti would be pretty easy.
[2237.26 → 2239.56] The 1080 would have been pretty easy.
[2239.84 → 2240.06] Yep.
[2240.44 → 2241.44] Except for in VR.
[2241.80 → 2241.96] Yeah.
[2242.10 → 2247.08] The 1070 would have been pretty easy, and the 1060, like, I knew it before it even happened.
[2247.22 → 2249.18] AMD cards are usually particularly easy,
[2249.28 → 2251.68] especially when they're the same card that we reviewed a year ago.
[2253.64 → 2254.08] Boom.
[2254.38 → 2255.60] 480 would have not.
[2255.74 → 2257.04] We would have not been able to do it.
[2257.14 → 2258.16] I had no idea what was coming.
[2258.22 → 2259.36] I got to give them props.
[2259.60 → 2260.70] They kept that secret.
[2261.04 → 2261.40] They did.
[2261.40 → 2263.24] I did not know what was coming.
[2264.82 → 2268.92] But yeah, like I, unless one shows up on like Monday.
[2270.58 → 2271.62] Oh, I got so sorry.
[2271.68 → 2272.24] Someone asked a question.
[2272.32 → 2273.64] No, I did not ditch my blade.
[2274.06 → 2277.66] I'm working on a review of Gigabyte's Aero 14,
[2278.08 → 2280.86] which is kind of like what I would call,
[2281.00 → 2282.34] okay, don't take this the wrong way,
[2282.42 → 2284.00] because it's still a very expensive computer,
[2284.00 → 2285.72] but I'm going to call it a poor man's blade.
[2286.52 → 2287.12] So it's...
[2287.12 → 2291.44] But that's considering that the blade is like the dude that owns a yacht.
[2291.58 → 2292.92] So it's not really the poor man's blade.
[2292.92 → 2295.28] No, it's a relatively speaking poor man's blade.
[2295.40 → 2296.96] Relative to the dude that owns a yacht.
[2297.00 → 2297.30] Yes.
[2297.60 → 2298.58] Which is like everyone.
[2298.70 → 2299.00] Yes.
[2299.18 → 2299.44] Okay.
[2299.70 → 2301.84] So there are a lot of things I like about it.
[2301.90 → 2303.68] There are a lot of things I don't like as much about it,
[2303.78 → 2305.66] but yeah.
[2306.62 → 2307.02] Okay.
[2307.24 → 2308.82] Let's move on to...
[2308.82 → 2310.60] Actually, we should probably do our sponsor spots.
[2310.68 → 2314.04] I can't believe we just spent like half the show on the first two topics.
[2314.72 → 2317.08] So first up is fixity.
[2317.58 → 2319.46] fixity recently got mad at me,
[2319.52 → 2322.80] and I guess during their sponsor spot is the best time to bring that up.
[2322.86 → 2324.02] They gave me...
[2324.02 → 2325.30] Well, they gave Nick crap,
[2325.42 → 2328.14] and Nick gave me crap because every time...
[2328.14 → 2328.64] That's how it works.
[2328.94 → 2333.16] Every time I pull out an fixity kit for a phone repair
[2333.16 → 2336.88] or for a disassembly vlog or whatever the case may be,
[2337.26 → 2338.36] every time I pull one out,
[2338.58 → 2342.46] I pull out the old Protect tool kit with the 54-bit driver kit,
[2342.98 → 2345.14] and they're just like,
[2346.02 → 2348.34] Dude, what are you doing?
[2349.92 → 2351.72] You're sponsored by fixity,
[2351.88 → 2353.76] and you're using the old kit all the time.
[2353.80 → 2354.52] And the funny thing is,
[2354.74 → 2358.06] is I take flack from the viewers about obvious product placement is obvious.
[2358.40 → 2359.76] fixity doesn't want me to do that.
[2359.84 → 2361.50] They don't want to pay me to use the old product
[2361.50 → 2363.46] that you can't even buy anymore.
[2364.06 → 2365.34] They ain't interested in that.
[2367.04 → 2368.00] So this is cool.
[2368.12 → 2369.04] I don't know if you know this,
[2369.22 → 2371.08] but fixity is actually sending us
[2371.08 → 2375.12] upgraded Protect tool kits with embroidered names on them.
[2375.24 → 2376.50] So you're getting one.
[2377.00 → 2379.04] I'm getting one with my name embroidered on.
[2379.10 → 2380.88] Anyway, the reason that I always had the old kit
[2380.88 → 2382.82] was because I took the 64-bit one home.
[2383.14 → 2385.50] Because here I have a lot more tools at my disposal
[2385.50 → 2386.26] than I do at home.
[2386.78 → 2388.54] And then every time we do an fixity spot,
[2388.54 → 2389.94] I run around trying to find it.
[2390.00 → 2391.10] And then it's missing.
[2391.10 → 2394.04] Yeah, no, I'd only told him like weeks and weeks
[2394.04 → 2395.98] after I had taken it home.
[2396.08 → 2396.20] Yep.
[2396.68 → 2397.12] Anyway.
[2397.38 → 2399.40] Then I'd forget and go run around trying to find it anyway.
[2399.56 → 2401.30] The latest Protect tool kit
[2401.30 → 2403.72] has their new 64-bit driver kit,
[2403.80 → 2406.68] which means that you can have over 4 gigs of RAM.
[2406.68 → 2408.02] It's got...
[2408.02 → 2411.04] Sorry.
[2412.56 → 2413.90] It has more bits.
[2414.24 → 2415.68] It has more durable parts.
[2415.80 → 2417.12] It has a better screwdriver
[2417.12 → 2419.32] that's easier to apply more torque with.
[2420.04 → 2422.12] It's got their ESD-safe tweezers.
[2422.24 → 2423.54] It's got the metal spider.
[2423.68 → 2426.36] It's got suction cups to pull apart displays.
[2426.50 → 2427.56] All kinds of great stuff.
[2427.62 → 2429.48] It's backed by fixity's lifetime warranty.
[2429.48 → 2433.96] And if you use offer code WHEN on fixity's site,
[2434.08 → 2437.50] you can save $5 on a purchase of $10 or more.
[2437.80 → 2439.78] And we should probably get that lower third updated
[2439.78 → 2441.10] because that is not correct.
[2441.20 → 2442.36] That is an old offer code.
[2442.76 → 2445.22] I'm very sorry to fixity and Nick.
[2445.98 → 2448.10] I'm not sorry to Nick, but I'm sorry to fixity.
[2448.22 → 2450.04] Hopefully they don't hate us forever.
[2450.74 → 2455.00] Actually, we may be doing like a sponsored video with them
[2455.00 → 2457.88] sometime soon where we'll be taking something...
[2457.88 → 2458.42] That'll be cool.
[2458.46 → 2460.60] ...taking something apart in a really cool way
[2460.60 → 2462.52] and putting it back together in a really cool way.
[2462.62 → 2464.10] Like for them?
[2464.40 → 2467.20] Like they're like sponsoring us to do something
[2467.20 → 2468.88] that I've wanted to do for a long time,
[2468.88 → 2470.60] but that I've never been able to do
[2470.60 → 2474.06] because it's extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive.
[2474.60 → 2476.86] So they're basically footing the bill for it.
[2476.92 → 2477.88] So cool guys.
[2478.00 → 2479.18] We love those guys that fixity.
[2479.24 → 2479.54] Yay.
[2480.68 → 2485.40] This is interesting that no one sort of briefed me on this
[2485.40 → 2488.60] because I actually have clothing from Ministry of Supply
[2488.60 → 2489.74] that I wore last week.
[2490.22 → 2491.78] All the comments on the video were like,
[2492.10 → 2494.86] wow, you and Nick look so professional this week
[2494.86 → 2497.28] compared to how you guys usually look on the WAN show.
[2497.76 → 2500.76] And I think I screwed up the spot for them.
[2501.18 → 2503.22] So I think we're redoing it again this week,
[2503.30 → 2505.46] but nobody told me, so I don't have the clothes.
[2505.60 → 2508.78] But the good news is I did wear them last week.
[2508.78 → 2510.70] I wore a beautiful button-up shirt
[2510.70 → 2513.36] and I actually was wearing pants on the WAN show for a change.
[2513.76 → 2516.94] Something that is not usually the experience
[2516.94 → 2518.54] that is going on under the table here.
[2518.56 → 2519.82] Yeah, that would have been pretty surprising.
[2519.98 → 2520.96] I'm sad I missed that.
[2521.00 → 2523.16] So Ministry of Supply combines performance fabrics,
[2523.34 → 2524.62] advanced manufacturing techniques,
[2524.72 → 2526.70] and tailored design to make wear-to-work clothes
[2526.70 → 2528.94] that are comfortable and capable.
[2529.34 → 2531.06] They're meant to be worn on the body,
[2531.44 → 2534.00] which is good because...
[2534.00 → 2535.48] They have to look good on the floor too.
[2535.68 → 2536.78] Yeah, they have to...
[2536.78 → 2538.42] Wow.
[2538.42 → 2538.98] Wow.
[2540.34 → 2541.80] They're not going to like this spot either.
[2542.58 → 2543.90] The products keep you cool and dry
[2543.90 → 2545.94] with sweat-wicking fibres, breathable fabrics,
[2546.14 → 2547.94] and NASA-developed phase-change materials
[2547.94 → 2549.40] that help regulate your body temperature.
[2549.62 → 2551.68] And most importantly for our audience,
[2552.02 → 2553.64] everything is easy to care for.
[2554.12 → 2555.56] Throw it in the wash machine.
[2556.00 → 2557.02] Throw it in the dryer.
[2557.08 → 2558.26] That's important for me.
[2558.50 → 2558.74] Woo!
[2559.34 → 2561.04] Wrinkle-free, even out of the bag.
[2561.32 → 2562.48] So it was like all folded up.
[2562.58 → 2565.38] Like Colton handed me a folded collared shirt
[2565.38 → 2566.86] and was like, wear this on the show today.
[2566.86 → 2569.04] And I was like, you have got to be kidding me.
[2569.36 → 2571.82] I'm gonna look like the biggest...
[2571.82 → 2574.52] Like, there was a wedding this weekend,
[2574.70 → 2577.16] and I went and bought a shirt at the mall on Friday.
[2578.00 → 2578.40] Idiot.
[2578.78 → 2580.38] With like creases down my shirt.
[2580.40 → 2581.14] Actually, it was fine.
[2581.38 → 2581.48] Yeah.
[2581.48 → 2583.44] So there's no risk to try.
[2583.58 → 2585.06] There's free shipping and returns
[2585.06 → 2587.24] with a 100-day hassle-free return policy.
[2587.60 → 2591.62] And it is the perfect gift for anyone with a birthday
[2591.62 → 2594.16] or a thing that you might need to give them a gift for.
[2594.24 → 2595.48] My notes still say Father's Day,
[2595.54 → 2596.76] but that is obviously outdated.
[2596.86 → 2599.14] Or if someone you know has to go to a wedding on the weekend
[2599.14 → 2601.30] and it's coming up soon.
[2602.28 → 2603.12] Yes, indeed.
[2603.18 → 2605.12] And you're like, they're not going to figure this out.
[2605.12 → 2607.36] So I'm going to do this for them
[2607.36 → 2610.24] because my name is Yvonne and their name is Linus.
[2610.88 → 2611.82] I'm not going to a wedding.
[2611.92 → 2613.42] I'm actually going to a funeral this weekend.
[2613.62 → 2615.36] And it has to do something with clothing myself.
[2615.36 → 2616.30] Feels bad, right, man?
[2616.42 → 2616.88] It does.
[2617.36 → 2617.74] Sorry about that.
[2617.74 → 2619.20] Actually, I'm going to a funeral this weekend.
[2619.30 → 2619.46] I know.
[2620.34 → 2621.04] I'm sorry.
[2621.62 → 2623.32] I will look presentable at it, though.
[2623.40 → 2624.48] I started making the joke
[2624.48 → 2625.08] and then I was like,
[2625.12 → 2627.24] crap, this is way more applicable than I thought.
[2628.36 → 2628.76] Oops.
[2629.16 → 2629.96] Oh, dang.
[2629.96 → 2630.68] That's okay.
[2631.28 → 2634.72] Facebook wants to deliver high-speed internet everywhere
[2634.72 → 2635.86] via freaking laser beams.
[2635.86 → 2636.82] Laser beams.
[2637.10 → 2638.14] Laser beams.
[2638.38 → 2638.60] Yay.
[2639.36 → 2640.50] I mean, to be clear,
[2640.92 → 2645.12] the idea of internet with lasers
[2645.12 → 2647.88] is actually not that out there.
[2648.20 → 2652.70] In fact, your internet travels over lasers for sure.
[2653.30 → 2653.64] Fibre.
[2654.26 → 2654.54] Fibre.
[2655.28 → 2656.28] At some point.
[2656.56 → 2656.68] At some point.
[2656.68 → 2657.34] Some people are going to be like,
[2657.40 → 2658.14] I don't have fibre.
[2658.46 → 2659.24] At some point.
[2659.24 → 2660.04] At some point.
[2660.46 → 2662.04] If you connect to a website
[2662.04 → 2663.88] that is not, like,
[2664.72 → 2665.12] in your house.
[2665.12 → 2666.06] Your friend hosting it.
[2666.06 → 2667.90] Yeah, your friend hosting it down the street.
[2668.26 → 2668.74] Upstairs.
[2671.00 → 2672.84] It's like, well, actually, Linus,
[2673.00 → 2678.00] I ran an internet cable
[2678.00 → 2679.64] to, like, my neighbour's house
[2679.64 → 2682.30] and then we have a localized website
[2682.30 → 2684.16] for checking out what games we both have
[2684.16 → 2685.42] because Steam is, like,
[2685.72 → 2687.16] there's too much DRM and stuff.
[2687.16 → 2690.54] That could happen, maybe.
[2691.48 → 2694.58] The worst part is someone watching our stream
[2694.58 → 2695.80] has definitely done it.
[2697.08 → 2697.62] It's like,
[2697.68 → 2699.28] Twitch chat's going to explode with, like,
[2699.34 → 2699.86] I did it.
[2700.04 → 2700.92] When I was in university,
[2700.92 → 2704.20] I put my computer in my neighbour's dorm room
[2704.20 → 2706.00] because we liked gaming in there
[2706.00 → 2707.42] because my roommate was a douche canoe.
[2708.38 → 2709.66] But I had the good internet,
[2709.98 → 2712.06] so we ran the internet from my room
[2712.06 → 2714.10] out my window into his window
[2714.10 → 2715.12] and then would game.
[2715.22 → 2717.14] And when it was freezing outside,
[2717.30 → 2718.22] I was, like, next to the window,
[2718.30 → 2719.00] but I liked the cold,
[2719.26 → 2720.36] so we just keep the window open
[2720.36 → 2722.00] so we could keep fast internet speeds.
[2722.22 → 2722.58] Nice.
[2722.74 → 2722.92] Game.
[2722.92 → 2724.78] I like that you've picked up douche canoe
[2724.78 → 2727.80] because I picked up broke dick from you.
[2730.30 → 2731.22] There we go.
[2733.74 → 2734.24] All right.
[2734.38 → 2737.60] So the system uses invisible infrared laser beams
[2737.60 → 2738.68] that switch on and off
[2738.68 → 2740.18] several billion times per second
[2740.18 → 2742.32] to exchange data while consuming minimal energy.
[2742.46 → 2746.86] So basically the same as fibre optic internet,
[2746.98 → 2748.10] except that it goes through the air.
[2748.46 → 2750.18] So Facebook is working on a means of delivering...
[2750.18 → 2752.44] Okay, that is basically the headline.
[2752.60 → 2753.02] Thank you.
[2753.22 → 2754.94] The project has taken a step forward
[2754.94 → 2756.84] after a first test delivered connection speeds
[2756.84 → 2758.48] over two gigabits per second.
[2759.44 → 2760.68] So according to an article penned
[2760.68 → 2763.00] by four members of Facebook's Connectivity Lab,
[2763.16 → 2764.70] published in the scientific journal Optical,
[2765.06 → 2767.10] the plan is to deliver these high-speed internet connections
[2767.10 → 2767.90] using laser beams
[2767.90 → 2770.60] to the most remote possible locations.
[2771.00 → 2774.12] However, high levels of precision are required
[2774.12 → 2775.92] to line up the laser correctly.
[2776.14 → 2777.36] So they have to aim the beam
[2777.36 → 2779.80] with precision equivalent to hitting a dime
[2779.80 → 2781.68] from more than 10 miles away.
[2782.68 → 2786.10] So that's a cool thought experiment.
[2786.34 → 2787.92] The system also needs to support
[2787.92 → 2791.78] temperature differences of up to 90 degrees Celsius.
[2793.44 → 2796.20] See, the hitting the dime from 10 miles away thing,
[2796.34 → 2798.78] the thing that worries me with that is like weather.
[2799.20 → 2799.50] Yeah.
[2800.08 → 2802.54] And other things that just happen.
[2802.60 → 2804.20] And just really anything that could happen.
[2804.44 → 2804.80] Rebel insurrections.
[2804.80 → 2806.80] Continental plate movement.
[2807.00 → 2807.10] Yeah.
[2807.20 → 2808.48] Like that's actually a factor
[2808.48 → 2809.90] at a distance of 10 miles away.
[2810.06 → 2812.30] Like did you see that sinkhole on 200th Street?
[2812.46 → 2812.62] Yeah.
[2813.62 → 2814.26] I have to drive through that.
[2814.26 → 2815.34] Like there's just a sinkhole.
[2816.68 → 2817.64] What the hell, man?
[2817.64 → 2818.00] Okay.
[2818.44 → 2819.46] The middle of a thoroughfare.
[2819.68 → 2820.44] Things just happen.
[2820.60 → 2821.66] The moon moves,
[2821.82 → 2823.86] the waters rise and lower,
[2824.00 → 2825.12] the continental plates shift.
[2825.28 → 2826.88] There are lots of things that affect
[2826.88 → 2828.44] the positioning of things on the planet.
[2828.54 → 2829.50] More than you might realize.
[2829.68 → 2830.18] All right.
[2830.26 → 2832.38] Speaking of the position of things on the planet,
[2832.54 → 2835.12] the Hollywood Reporter is apparently our source for
[2835.12 → 2839.06] US looks to prosecute the owner of kick-ass torrents
[2839.06 → 2840.12] after arresting Poland.
[2840.18 → 2840.30] Yeah.
[2840.30 → 2842.18] That's one of the things that's different about this laptop.
[2842.34 → 2843.30] It doesn't have a touch screen.
[2843.66 → 2845.88] I went to zoom in and reposition it.
[2847.18 → 2847.46] What?
[2848.80 → 2850.48] I do look forward to having the blade back,
[2850.54 → 2851.66] but this is a pretty sick notebook.
[2852.10 → 2853.62] My review is going to be very positive.
[2855.20 → 2855.72] All right.
[2855.72 → 2859.14] So the US is looking to prosecute Artem Wallis,
[2859.68 → 2861.74] alleged owner of kick-ass torrents,
[2861.74 → 2863.06] after his arrest in Poland.
[2863.18 → 2864.96] They've announced that they charged him with conspiracy
[2864.96 → 2866.66] to commit copyright infringement
[2866.66 → 2868.84] and money laundering in connection
[2868.84 → 2871.34] with the operation of kick-ass torrents.
[2872.10 → 2873.04] In a press release,
[2873.18 → 2874.80] the law enforcement calls kick-ass torrents
[2874.80 → 2878.42] the most visited illegal file sharing website
[2878.42 → 2881.52] with 50 million unique monthly visitors.
[2881.80 → 2884.94] It is the 69th most visited website on the internet,
[2884.94 → 2886.76] which is so delicious.
[2887.14 → 2887.66] Oh my goodness.
[2888.02 → 2889.78] And it is allegedly responsible
[2889.78 → 2892.90] for enabling users to distribute films,
[2893.02 → 2894.22] TV shows, and video games
[2894.22 → 2895.70] valued at more than $1 billion.
[2896.06 → 2897.20] That's probably conservative.
[2897.38 → 2897.76] Oh my.
[2897.80 → 2899.96] If you value each discrete download
[2899.96 → 2902.84] as the full cash value of that.
[2902.90 → 2903.76] That's definitely conservative.
[2903.94 → 2904.44] That's how you do it.
[2904.50 → 2905.80] Yeah, it's very, very conservative.
[2906.40 → 2908.76] Apple and Facebook actually helped the US
[2908.76 → 2909.94] in the investigation and arrest.
[2909.94 → 2910.80] This is kind of funny.
[2910.80 → 2913.88] So an Apple email belonging to Valid
[2913.88 → 2915.84] was found in a WHOIS lookup
[2915.84 → 2917.28] conducted by Homeland Security.
[2917.96 → 2920.66] July 31st, 2015 records provided by Apple
[2920.66 → 2923.58] showed that the.com email account
[2923.58 → 2925.50] was used to purchase something on iTunes.
[2926.00 → 2928.12] Logs showed that the same IP was then used
[2928.12 → 2930.54] to access the kick-ass torrents Facebook page.
[2930.68 → 2932.08] So he got caught
[2932.08 → 2934.26] because he bought something legitimately.
[2934.26 → 2938.42] I mean, I guess if I was making...
[2938.42 → 2938.80] Wow.
[2938.90 → 2940.96] How many millions of dollars a month was it
[2940.96 → 2942.24] that they figured it was bringing in?
[2942.30 → 2945.26] One of the other articles that I read was...
[2946.10 → 2947.16] I forget.
[2947.30 → 2948.28] It was like, I don't know,
[2948.32 → 2949.76] $12 million a month or something.
[2949.84 → 2950.16] Oh, wow.
[2950.16 → 2950.34] Obscene.
[2950.44 → 2952.12] Like, the amount of money it was making
[2952.12 → 2953.22] was just ludicrous.
[2953.46 → 2955.74] The guy can afford to buy movies, music, and videos.
[2955.84 → 2959.42] So if he follows the usual pirate logic of
[2959.42 → 2961.46] I only pirate because I can't afford it,
[2961.52 → 2962.76] then hey, maybe it's a good thing
[2962.76 → 2964.02] when he was buying things on iTunes.
[2965.40 → 2967.44] I just think you'd go to your own store, you know?
[2967.90 → 2968.08] Yeah.
[2968.90 → 2972.56] Shop at your own free store for freewares.
[2974.06 → 2974.46] Yeah.
[2976.14 → 2977.52] So there's an update.
[2977.72 → 2979.44] There's a clone site of kick-ass torrent
[2979.44 → 2981.02] somewhere on the web.
[2981.02 → 2983.06] That doesn't surprise me at all.
[2983.28 → 2984.88] There's a change.org petition.
[2985.26 → 2985.54] Yeah.
[2985.78 → 2986.34] That'll work.
[2986.42 → 2987.96] Currently at 14,000 signatures.
[2988.06 → 2988.36] Totally.
[2988.64 → 2989.36] Asking for...
[2989.36 → 2991.06] That's worth taking time out of your day to go sign.
[2991.24 → 2991.88] ...to release him.
[2991.88 → 2994.50] That is probably not going to have an effect.
[2994.60 → 2996.34] It's up to 15,000 supporters now.
[2997.00 → 2997.80] Good job, guys.
[2997.80 → 2998.64] And there's like a bar.
[2999.00 → 3003.22] It's like 9, 4, 7, 8 more needed to reach 25,000.
[3003.62 → 3006.72] As if 25,000 will be any different from 25
[3006.72 → 3008.60] in terms of the impact that'll have.
[3008.60 → 3008.80] Yeah.
[3008.80 → 3010.26] But there you go.
[3011.18 → 3012.36] Oh, this is good.
[3013.16 → 3015.50] Recode.net is our original article here.
[3015.72 → 3021.36] Dollar Shave Club just sold for $1 billion to Unilever.
[3022.66 → 3023.90] $1 billion.
[3024.48 → 3024.90] Wow.
[3025.58 → 3027.48] Good old Mike, who I've never actually met,
[3027.56 → 3030.64] but I feel like I know him because I've been pimping his razors for like...
[3030.64 → 3031.22] For so long.
[3031.22 → 3032.14] ...three years now.
[3032.14 → 3034.26] Good old Mike is a billionaire.
[3035.06 → 3037.08] He is still going to be running the company.
[3038.90 → 3042.36] They were projecting more than $200 million in revenue for 2016.
[3043.04 → 3044.52] Dollar Shave Club isn't profitable,
[3044.78 → 3046.80] but he said at a conference in May
[3046.80 → 3049.48] that the company could get into the black by year's end.
[3050.06 → 3051.74] And Unilever has basically gone,
[3051.82 → 3053.32] okay, that's good enough for us.
[3053.68 → 3054.64] We're doing it.
[3054.64 → 3055.90] Wow.
[3058.22 → 3061.28] So basically, you know, he's like,
[3061.34 → 3063.18] okay, yeah, I'm going to keep running it.
[3063.36 → 3065.38] We had, you know, good synergy,
[3066.00 → 3067.18] you know, talking with each other.
[3067.28 → 3069.54] The economies of scale they can bring in
[3069.54 → 3071.08] will change our business a lot.
[3071.12 → 3071.96] And that's true.
[3072.06 → 3074.16] I mean, I've had people point out
[3074.16 → 3077.18] that Dollar Shave Club's razors can be purchased in bulk,
[3077.18 → 3078.28] not from Dollar Shave Club,
[3078.36 → 3080.36] if you don't want a weekly delivery.
[3080.36 → 3082.20] And the reality of it is,
[3082.20 → 3084.70] is people join Dollar Shave Club
[3084.70 → 3086.70] so it's set it and forget it.
[3086.80 → 3088.94] Not so they can save 22 cents per blade
[3088.94 → 3090.42] or whatever the difference works out to.
[3090.48 → 3091.46] I can't remember how much it was.
[3091.50 → 3092.32] I did look into it.
[3093.32 → 3097.02] So for Dollar Shave Club to be able to potentially,
[3097.18 → 3099.58] I mean, with the resources that Unilever can throw at it,
[3099.96 → 3103.22] to advertise more, to develop products faster,
[3103.34 → 3104.58] develop more unique products,
[3105.30 → 3108.04] it could end up being a good investment for Unilever,
[3108.16 → 3109.68] even though it's not even profitable yet.
[3109.68 → 3110.00] Yeah.
[3110.40 → 3114.96] And even more lucrative for Mike in the long term
[3114.96 → 3118.10] because the company could bring in so much profit.
[3118.46 → 3121.74] So overall, hey, congratulations, you guys.
[3121.90 → 3124.10] And the next bill we send you is going to be double.
[3126.14 → 3127.70] Now that you got big boy dollars.
[3127.88 → 3128.26] That would be nice.
[3128.50 → 3129.62] What I want them to do,
[3130.10 → 3131.52] I would really appreciate this.
[3131.60 → 3133.44] I don't know how they would make this work
[3133.44 → 3134.32] in their model or something,
[3134.60 → 3137.12] but I want someone to make a good trimmer.
[3138.16 → 3138.96] A good trimmer.
[3138.96 → 3139.36] Oh, good luck.
[3139.38 → 3141.32] They all are terrible.
[3141.50 → 3141.90] Good luck.
[3142.32 → 3144.58] I spent a very annoying amount of money
[3144.58 → 3146.32] to just get pissed off to the point
[3146.32 → 3148.32] where I almost threw it like a week ago
[3148.32 → 3151.80] because like it just, it was, it was a hundred dollars.
[3152.40 → 3153.70] I don't like spending money.
[3154.04 → 3154.78] I know you don't.
[3155.04 → 3155.72] I hate it.
[3155.80 → 3156.36] I know you do.
[3156.36 → 3158.50] I sat there in the store for literally like half an hour
[3158.50 → 3160.02] being like, I don't like this.
[3160.12 → 3161.94] And then eventually it was just like, okay,
[3162.08 → 3166.02] because my previous one broke, and it worked somewhat okay.
[3166.22 → 3167.36] So I needed a new one.
[3167.44 → 3167.70] Yeah.
[3167.84 → 3169.70] And I was like, I want it to be good.
[3169.72 → 3171.34] And I have all these complaints about my previous one.
[3171.34 → 3172.50] And this one was supposed to be good.
[3172.50 → 3174.00] And I bought it, and it's worse.
[3175.18 → 3176.28] It's so bad.
[3176.36 → 3178.96] You might notice I have a lot going on right now
[3178.96 → 3181.10] because I don't, I can't return it
[3181.10 → 3182.22] because it's a hygiene product.
[3182.44 → 3182.80] Right.
[3183.02 → 3183.88] That's how they get you.
[3183.96 → 3184.26] Yeah.
[3184.46 → 3185.72] That's absolutely how they get you.
[3185.72 → 3186.60] And it's so bad.
[3186.66 → 3188.24] And I don't want to spend money on another one
[3188.24 → 3189.76] because it's also going to be bad.
[3189.82 → 3191.40] And you can't use a razor for everything.
[3191.54 → 3191.68] No.
[3191.68 → 3192.58] To be very clear.
[3192.72 → 3192.90] No.
[3193.00 → 3194.72] You can use a razor when you want down to the skin.
[3194.84 → 3196.42] You need to use a body trimmer
[3196.42 → 3198.74] if you want to have whatever that is.
[3198.74 → 3198.96] Some amount.
[3199.26 → 3199.50] Yeah.
[3199.60 → 3201.42] And I want razor down here
[3201.42 → 3203.38] and razor like in here a little bit,
[3203.44 → 3204.70] which is what I normally do.
[3204.78 → 3206.74] There's no point when the rest of the beard is this ridiculous.
[3207.58 → 3210.88] But I want to use a beard trimmer for the rest of it.
[3211.20 → 3212.92] And they all are terrible.
[3213.06 → 3215.58] If Dollar Shave Club came out with a beard trimmer,
[3216.66 → 3218.20] it would probably be fine.
[3218.92 → 3219.70] And I would use it.
[3219.92 → 3221.26] It wouldn't have a flashlight
[3221.26 → 3223.70] and whatever other stuff he says in the thing.
[3223.74 → 3224.28] And that's fine.
[3224.44 → 3226.20] I don't even want all the crazy different,
[3226.20 → 3228.82] like the one I have has like millimetre control and stuff.
[3228.90 → 3229.84] That's not why I bought it.
[3229.92 → 3230.54] I don't care.
[3230.56 → 3231.56] I just want it to cut hair.
[3231.82 → 3231.96] Yes.
[3232.08 → 3232.30] Yep.
[3232.78 → 3233.58] Oh my goodness.
[3233.64 → 3235.22] Speaking of just wanting to cut hair,
[3235.42 → 3237.24] Gorilla Glass 5 is coming
[3237.24 → 3239.52] and it's more shockproof than ever.
[3239.62 → 3242.10] The original article here is from theverge.com.
[3242.10 → 3246.86] It is meant to survive epic smartphone drops.
[3247.42 → 3247.74] Dang.
[3248.54 → 3249.64] And then the, oh, this is great.
[3249.74 → 3251.22] Filing this from a cracked phone.
[3251.58 → 3252.70] Good job, Lauren.
[3252.70 → 3256.94] So, yeah, in a nutshell.
[3257.40 → 3258.12] Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3258.12 → 3260.34] It says it'll survive 80% of the time
[3260.34 → 3262.50] when dropped from 1.6 meters.
[3262.62 → 3263.26] That's really high.
[3263.26 → 3265.04] That's pretty freaking good.
[3265.90 → 3266.38] Wow.
[3266.52 → 3267.66] So waist height to shoulder height
[3267.66 → 3269.12] is kind of what they were targeting here.
[3269.60 → 3271.46] They figure two-thirds of smartphone drops
[3271.46 → 3272.56] happen from that height.
[3273.14 → 3274.02] That's probably accurate.
[3274.16 → 3275.14] Internal research done by Corning
[3275.14 → 3277.04] showed that 85% of smartphone owners
[3277.04 → 3277.84] have dropped their phone
[3277.84 → 3279.32] at least once in the past year.
[3279.32 → 3281.24] The survival rate was achieved
[3281.24 → 3282.60] in tests with pieces of glass
[3282.60 → 3284.94] that were 0.6 millimetres thick
[3284.94 → 3286.96] and they make glass as thin as 0.4 millimetres.
[3287.10 → 3289.10] So smartphone OEMs that opt for thinner glass
[3289.10 → 3290.54] may see different results.
[3290.90 → 3294.32] So that's about five and a quarter feet.
[3294.58 → 3295.50] And to be clear,
[3295.58 → 3297.82] it does not account for corner drops.
[3298.12 → 3301.22] The testing was done dropping flat on its face.
[3301.40 → 3304.84] So as phones continue to have smaller and smaller bezels,
[3305.34 → 3307.20] I'm not sure if there's actually much
[3307.20 → 3309.16] that Corning will be able to do to address that.
[3309.30 → 3312.26] But hey, they got to release a new product at some point.
[3312.40 → 3313.48] Gorilla Glass 3 sat there
[3313.48 → 3314.90] as the king of the hill forever.
[3315.42 → 3317.32] And Gorilla Glass 4 is kind of getting long in the tooth.
[3317.42 → 3318.72] So now five.
[3319.58 → 3320.78] With more drop resistance
[3320.78 → 3322.18] in a configuration that
[3322.18 → 3326.34] only Samsung Galaxy S8 Active is likely to use
[3326.34 → 3328.32] because everyone else thinks phones have to be
[3328.32 → 3331.00] like, you know, corset thin.
[3331.06 → 3331.98] I like the active line.
[3331.98 → 3335.18] I'd rather things were like that.
[3335.50 → 3336.10] All right.
[3336.34 → 3338.04] On the subject of kick-ass torrents,
[3338.06 → 3339.90] our original article here is from Techno buffalo.
[3340.12 → 3341.82] Witcher 3 Studio talks piracy,
[3342.10 → 3344.14] says it was an irrelevant factor.
[3344.62 → 3347.46] These guys really do love to be popular, don't they?
[3347.94 → 3348.12] Yeah.
[3348.24 → 3349.52] Because I guarantee you,
[3349.60 → 3351.26] it was a relevant factor.
[3351.84 → 3353.88] But they just love
[3353.88 → 3356.20] taking what all the other game devs are saying
[3356.20 → 3358.20] and being like...
[3359.36 → 3359.96] You know what?
[3360.02 → 3362.84] But that's a positive and smart way to go about it.
[3362.88 → 3363.30] It is.
[3363.36 → 3364.48] They get so much good press.
[3364.54 → 3365.26] I love it too.
[3365.56 → 3366.28] They go with this,
[3366.46 → 3367.80] the privacy factor is irrelevant
[3367.80 → 3370.04] because we can only convince them to do it.
[3370.12 → 3372.28] We totally believe in carrot, not the stick.
[3372.60 → 3373.10] So they're being like,
[3373.18 → 3374.14] we're the nice guys.
[3374.36 → 3374.88] Love us.
[3374.96 → 3376.50] Yeah, love us and give us your money.
[3376.50 → 3378.54] They are doing all the nice guy things.
[3378.80 → 3378.92] Yep.
[3379.06 → 3380.76] They're not saying this stuff and then...
[3380.76 → 3381.90] And then loading up, you know,
[3382.22 → 3383.88] Star dock and whatever.
[3384.10 → 3384.28] Yeah.
[3384.40 → 3385.40] Like eight different levels.
[3385.40 → 3387.48] Oh, games for Windows Live.
[3388.14 → 3388.58] Terrible.
[3388.92 → 3389.10] Yeah.
[3389.32 → 3391.42] So they're doing it all right
[3391.42 → 3393.08] and then saying these things
[3393.08 → 3395.50] and I guess correctly getting credit for it.
[3395.58 → 3396.12] So awesome.
[3396.62 → 3398.88] Also, I think Witcher 3 is the highest rated game
[3398.88 → 3400.08] ever on Metacritic right now.
[3400.08 → 3401.94] Yeah, you sent me a hangout the other day.
[3402.02 → 3402.28] Yeah.
[3402.48 → 3403.16] That's bananas.
[3404.52 → 3405.28] Doing good.
[3406.06 → 3406.54] Hell yeah.
[3406.88 → 3407.34] All right.
[3408.02 → 3411.64] Elon Musk reveals part two of the Master Plan.
[3411.76 → 3413.62] The funny thing about the original Master Plan,
[3413.62 → 3414.76] and he says this,
[3414.76 → 3418.44] in the part two Master Plan,
[3418.82 → 3420.80] is that Tesla's business model,
[3420.92 → 3422.62] for anyone who's ever doubted it
[3422.62 → 3423.84] or told them they were stupid
[3423.84 → 3425.52] or said that they're bad people
[3425.52 → 3428.38] for making only cars that ballers can afford,
[3429.06 → 3430.72] it was always on their site.
[3430.84 → 3431.16] And he's like,
[3431.28 → 3433.78] I wrote this so that people wouldn't criticize
[3433.78 → 3434.86] what we're doing.
[3435.32 → 3436.16] It didn't work.
[3436.16 → 3438.74] Oh well, here I go again.
[3440.22 → 3441.44] Revealing the Master Plan.
[3441.62 → 3442.26] The thing is, though,
[3442.30 → 3443.30] he does say that
[3443.30 → 3445.18] and he says it was nearly useless or whatever.
[3445.58 → 3449.92] But he has had his cheering squad
[3449.92 → 3450.86] who did read it.
[3450.96 → 3451.16] Yes.
[3451.16 → 3452.60] And he has been able to use it
[3452.60 → 3453.62] as a counter-argument.
[3453.84 → 3454.10] Yes.
[3454.10 → 3455.66] So it has served him in a way,
[3455.74 → 3455.98] I think,
[3456.04 → 3457.18] just not nearly as much as he hoped.
[3457.18 → 3458.26] Not as much as he hoped.
[3458.34 → 3458.52] Yeah.
[3458.88 → 3459.90] Every once in a while,
[3460.00 → 3460.62] you kind of go,
[3460.72 → 3461.00] okay,
[3461.24 → 3462.70] I'm going to go out on a limb here
[3462.70 → 3465.42] and I'm going to go full transparency mode
[3465.42 → 3466.72] with my customers
[3466.72 → 3467.48] or my viewers
[3467.48 → 3468.36] or whatever else.
[3468.42 → 3468.78] And you know what?
[3468.78 → 3469.56] Sometimes it works.
[3469.90 → 3472.50] I took a lot of internal flack
[3472.50 → 3475.76] over Honest Answers episode two.
[3476.14 → 3476.26] Two.
[3476.36 → 3477.64] How does LMG make money?
[3477.98 → 3479.54] Where I had people telling me,
[3479.60 → 3479.80] look,
[3480.24 → 3480.66] like,
[3480.86 → 3482.20] why are we talking about this?
[3482.42 → 3483.78] We're just opening up the doors
[3483.78 → 3485.50] for people to criticize us
[3485.50 → 3486.14] for making money.
[3486.22 → 3488.10] Something that people love criticizing us for.
[3488.18 → 3489.18] Oh, yeah.
[3489.56 → 3490.64] I'm sorry that we're a business.
[3490.86 → 3491.64] But not Twitch streamers.
[3491.64 → 3492.46] And I'm sorry that,
[3492.52 → 3493.66] I'm sorry that we make money.
[3493.84 → 3494.78] I'm not sorry at all.
[3494.82 → 3496.12] And that was the point of Honest Answers.
[3496.52 → 3497.72] Here are the ways we do it.
[3497.72 → 3498.98] I want you guys to understand
[3498.98 → 3499.80] how we do it
[3499.80 → 3501.02] so you understand
[3501.02 → 3503.02] what motivates us,
[3503.16 → 3504.30] what drives us.
[3504.38 → 3505.38] And what drives us
[3505.38 → 3507.66] is content for you guys
[3507.66 → 3508.62] because ultimately
[3508.62 → 3510.74] we will make no money
[3510.74 → 3512.44] if we don't have you.
[3512.84 → 3515.18] So we actually do read
[3515.18 → 3517.08] a lot of the comments on our videos.
[3517.34 → 3520.92] I read probably 95% of the comments
[3520.92 → 3522.36] that are posted on one of our videos
[3522.36 → 3523.20] in the first day.
[3523.64 → 3524.60] I claim that I don't,
[3524.66 → 3525.00] but I do.
[3526.96 → 3527.92] And you know what?
[3528.12 → 3528.74] So does Nick.
[3528.96 → 3530.00] And so does Yvonne.
[3530.00 → 3531.28] And so do the editors.
[3531.64 → 3532.64] And so does John.
[3532.78 → 3533.46] So does Dennis.
[3534.20 → 3535.82] We all care.
[3536.04 → 3537.14] We really do care.
[3537.36 → 3538.94] And we are not going to throw away
[3538.94 → 3540.08] our audience
[3540.08 → 3541.98] over NVIDIA
[3541.98 → 3542.78] or Intel
[3542.78 → 3543.50] or Microsoft
[3543.50 → 3545.36] or any gigantic corporation
[3545.36 → 3546.34] that can write us a check
[3546.34 → 3547.36] because a check
[3547.36 → 3548.56] is a one-time thing.
[3548.98 → 3549.50] An audience
[3549.50 → 3550.14] is something
[3550.14 → 3551.12] that we can continue
[3551.12 → 3551.92] to engage with
[3551.92 → 3552.76] and interact with
[3552.76 → 3554.10] and that we can continue
[3554.10 → 3554.82] to show brands,
[3554.92 → 3555.08] hey,
[3555.46 → 3556.74] we've got all these guys
[3556.74 → 3558.46] that we're talking to every day.
[3558.46 → 3560.10] If you want to reach these guys,
[3560.10 → 3561.22] you've got to talk to us
[3561.22 → 3562.36] and you've got to do it regularly.
[3562.90 → 3564.50] So that was why I went,
[3564.60 → 3564.80] okay,
[3564.92 → 3565.40] I'm going to go
[3565.40 → 3566.96] full transparency mode here.
[3567.20 → 3567.94] Sometimes it works
[3567.94 → 3568.54] and honestly,
[3568.74 → 3570.98] that seemed to work really well.
[3571.34 → 3572.80] People seemed to really get
[3572.80 → 3573.94] what I was trying to say
[3573.94 → 3575.30] and they understood
[3575.30 → 3576.64] the point of what I was doing
[3576.64 → 3577.80] and it didn't turn into
[3577.80 → 3579.70] a negativity poo storm.
[3581.10 → 3581.26] Okay,
[3581.32 → 3582.20] so sometimes it doesn't work.
[3582.26 → 3582.78] That was kind of
[3582.78 → 3583.44] where I was going with that.
[3583.44 → 3584.44] Anyway,
[3584.78 → 3585.66] here's the TLDR
[3585.66 → 3586.54] of part two
[3586.54 → 3587.40] of the master plan.
[3588.14 → 3589.94] Create stunning solar roofs
[3589.94 → 3591.36] with seamlessly integrated
[3591.36 → 3592.24] battery storage.
[3593.64 → 3595.64] Expand the electric vehicle
[3595.64 → 3596.28] product line
[3596.28 → 3598.06] to address all major segments.
[3598.18 → 3599.36] Including semi-trucks
[3599.36 → 3600.00] and other trucks.
[3600.14 → 3601.14] I wish there was a minivan
[3601.14 → 3602.46] because I just bought
[3602.46 → 3603.20] a gas minivan.
[3603.82 → 3605.70] Develop a self-driving capability
[3605.70 → 3607.38] that is 10 times safer
[3607.38 → 3608.08] than manual
[3608.08 → 3610.18] via massive fleet learning.
[3611.08 → 3612.02] Enable your car
[3612.02 → 3613.08] to make money for you
[3613.08 → 3614.16] when you aren't using it
[3614.16 → 3615.56] for ride-sharing programs.
[3616.64 → 3617.44] And probably they have
[3617.44 → 3618.26] other creative ideas.
[3618.36 → 3619.38] So once it's able
[3619.38 → 3620.28] to automatically drive,
[3620.36 → 3621.22] not only will you be able
[3621.22 → 3621.94] to summon it,
[3622.58 → 3623.62] but you'll be able to go like,
[3623.80 → 3624.96] hey little buddy car thing,
[3625.02 → 3625.52] I'm at work.
[3625.62 → 3626.90] Go just like drive people around
[3626.90 → 3627.48] and make me money.
[3627.62 → 3627.78] Yep.
[3627.88 → 3628.70] Go back to my house
[3628.70 → 3629.38] where I'm not paying
[3629.38 → 3629.96] for electricity
[3629.96 → 3631.12] because my roof is covered
[3631.12 → 3631.82] in solar power,
[3632.00 → 3632.56] solar cells.
[3633.08 → 3634.16] And then when you're done
[3634.16 → 3634.58] with that,
[3634.68 → 3636.66] go and pick up some dudes
[3636.66 → 3638.40] or recharge at a Tesla station
[3638.40 → 3639.22] because that's also free.
[3639.34 → 3639.50] Yep.
[3639.88 → 3640.22] Well,
[3640.28 → 3641.40] I might not be able to do that.
[3641.46 → 3641.56] Oh,
[3641.58 → 3642.36] I guess it probably could do
[3642.36 → 3642.94] that automatically.
[3643.08 → 3643.18] Yeah,
[3643.22 → 3643.44] well,
[3643.96 → 3645.92] oh man,
[3646.34 → 3646.84] pretty exciting.
[3647.02 → 3647.54] The car will probably
[3647.54 → 3648.18] be able to talk
[3648.18 → 3649.06] to the Tesla station.
[3649.62 → 3650.56] The car will park
[3650.56 → 3651.58] exactly where it needs to
[3651.58 → 3652.08] and then it'll just
[3652.08 → 3652.64] blip.
[3654.18 → 3654.62] Wonderful.
[3655.64 → 3656.02] All right,
[3656.06 → 3657.50] so this is a phone
[3657.50 → 3658.38] that I was actually
[3658.38 → 3659.66] planning to review
[3659.66 → 3660.98] and then I ended up
[3660.98 → 3661.92] sending back
[3661.92 → 3663.66] when I realized
[3663.66 → 3664.46] that I,
[3664.86 → 3667.14] that the $99 price point
[3667.14 → 3668.90] is a little bit deceptive.
[3669.00 → 3669.44] I want to say
[3669.44 → 3670.06] one quick thing
[3670.06 → 3670.94] before we keep going forward.
[3670.94 → 3671.30] Yes.
[3671.40 → 3672.24] I'm sure there's people
[3672.24 → 3673.52] I haven't looked at all,
[3673.66 → 3674.30] but I'm sure there's people
[3674.30 → 3674.88] in the Twitch chat
[3674.88 → 3675.44] going like,
[3675.78 → 3676.88] if it goes and picks up
[3676.88 → 3677.62] people by itself,
[3677.70 → 3678.18] they're just going to
[3678.18 → 3679.24] like trash the car.
[3679.32 → 3679.98] And that's possible.
[3680.12 → 3681.46] It's probably going to be
[3681.46 → 3684.54] an Uber style app thing
[3684.54 → 3685.36] that you have to use
[3685.36 → 3685.98] and your credit card
[3685.98 → 3686.86] will be attached to it
[3686.86 → 3687.94] and they'll have IDs
[3687.94 → 3688.68] attached to it
[3688.68 → 3690.08] and if you screw up the car,
[3690.32 → 3691.28] they'll just wreck you.
[3692.08 → 3692.48] Right.
[3693.08 → 3693.32] So,
[3693.44 → 3694.80] it's probably fine.
[3695.46 → 3695.68] I mean,
[3695.78 → 3697.62] probably stuff will happen.
[3697.84 → 3698.14] Yes.
[3699.18 → 3700.36] Definitely stuff will happen.
[3700.52 → 3700.72] Yeah.
[3701.40 → 3701.80] But,
[3701.96 → 3702.32] it will.
[3702.44 → 3703.18] For the most part,
[3703.40 → 3704.26] maybe it'll be okay.
[3704.64 → 3704.82] Yeah.
[3705.36 → 3706.10] And I mean,
[3706.18 → 3706.42] you could,
[3706.50 → 3707.92] I'm sure that they're going to,
[3708.24 → 3709.52] I'm sure they're going to make it
[3709.52 → 3710.26] kind of smarter
[3710.26 → 3712.36] than we're thinking.
[3712.56 → 3713.00] You know,
[3713.00 → 3713.94] like you could probably have
[3713.94 → 3715.50] like a trusted list of people
[3715.50 → 3715.96] that you're willing
[3715.96 → 3716.92] to share your car with even.
[3717.70 → 3718.08] Oh,
[3718.16 → 3719.06] that would be like
[3719.06 → 3720.86] family and friend rides.
[3720.86 → 3721.56] Like you could have
[3721.56 → 3722.74] probably different tiers.
[3722.74 → 3723.38] This is acting like a tax?
[3723.42 → 3723.58] Yeah.
[3723.58 → 3723.94] Okay.
[3724.04 → 3724.20] Yeah,
[3724.20 → 3724.40] yeah,
[3724.40 → 3724.58] yeah,
[3724.58 → 3724.74] yeah.
[3724.84 → 3725.34] Like you could,
[3725.42 → 3726.28] you could decide
[3726.28 → 3727.78] what level of sharing
[3727.78 → 3728.26] you want to do
[3728.26 → 3729.40] and you could treat it
[3729.40 → 3730.24] like a social network.
[3730.46 → 3730.82] So,
[3730.88 → 3731.24] you could say
[3731.24 → 3732.38] friends of friends are okay.
[3732.66 → 3732.92] Yeah.
[3733.48 → 3733.82] So,
[3733.88 → 3734.38] if you need to borrow
[3734.38 → 3735.28] your buddy's truck
[3735.28 → 3737.22] and he has a Tesla truck
[3737.22 → 3738.28] and you have a Tesla car,
[3738.62 → 3739.74] you can like to send your car
[3739.74 → 3740.74] off to him for the day,
[3741.26 → 3742.38] borrow his truck for the day
[3742.38 → 3743.90] and then switch back later on.
[3743.96 → 3744.28] Absolutely.
[3744.54 → 3744.82] That's cool.
[3745.08 → 3746.08] You don't even have to worry
[3746.08 → 3746.58] about your buddy
[3746.58 → 3747.56] crashing your truck
[3747.56 → 3748.02] because he doesn't know
[3748.02 → 3748.72] how to drive it
[3748.72 → 3750.72] because the Tesla thing
[3750.72 → 3751.72] is going to drive it for it.
[3751.78 → 3751.92] Yep.
[3752.00 → 3752.10] So,
[3752.18 → 3752.60] like there's,
[3752.68 → 3753.38] there are all kinds
[3753.38 → 3753.92] of cool stuff
[3753.92 → 3754.22] and like,
[3754.32 → 3754.54] they're going to have
[3754.54 → 3755.44] to make Tesla trailers.
[3755.64 → 3755.82] Like,
[3755.94 → 3756.66] oh man,
[3756.82 → 3757.44] that's treating it
[3757.44 → 3758.34] like a social network.
[3758.46 → 3759.00] I like that.
[3759.08 → 3759.46] That's smart.
[3759.52 → 3760.72] Like that would be so cool.
[3761.28 → 3761.44] Anyway,
[3761.58 → 3763.98] back to the ZTE MAX Pro.
[3764.60 → 3766.42] It is a $99 phone,
[3766.64 → 3768.12] which absolutely blew me away
[3768.12 → 3770.24] because it has a 1080p IPS display.
[3770.48 → 3773.20] It has a Qualcomm processor.
[3773.60 → 3773.72] So,
[3773.82 → 3774.04] it's not,
[3774.06 → 3775.34] it's not a Snapdragon 820.
[3775.44 → 3776.04] Let's be realistic,
[3776.20 → 3777.00] but it is Qualcomm.
[3777.38 → 3778.48] It's not MediaTek.
[3779.04 → 3780.40] It's got 32 gigs
[3780.40 → 3780.96] of storage,
[3781.12 → 3782.04] 2 gigs of RAM,
[3782.48 → 3784.72] a 3,400 William hour battery.
[3785.56 → 3786.00] Like,
[3786.06 → 3788.50] it's pretty freaking impressive.
[3788.70 → 3789.54] Six inch display.
[3789.96 → 3791.22] It is missing a couple of things.
[3791.34 → 3792.96] It does not have dual-band Wi-Fi.
[3793.38 → 3794.54] 2.4 gigahertz only.
[3794.86 → 3796.06] It does not have NFC.
[3796.14 → 3796.90] There was one other thing
[3796.90 → 3797.66] that really irked me.
[3799.24 → 3799.76] And so,
[3799.82 → 3800.46] I was going to review
[3800.46 → 3801.12] the crap out of this.
[3801.18 → 3801.48] I was like,
[3801.54 → 3802.04] oh my goodness,
[3802.12 → 3802.90] I've got this in my hand.
[3802.98 → 3803.30] I'm like ready.
[3803.38 → 3804.16] And then I realized,
[3804.34 → 3805.14] Metro PCS,
[3805.20 → 3806.08] like I couldn't put my SIM in it.
[3806.08 → 3806.72] It wasn't unlocked.
[3807.08 → 3807.70] And they wouldn't even,
[3808.10 → 3809.24] even ZTE
[3809.24 → 3810.64] wasn't able to unlock it for me.
[3811.22 → 3813.66] Because you have to have it active
[3813.66 → 3815.32] on a Metro PCS plan
[3815.32 → 3816.30] for 90 days
[3816.30 → 3817.56] in order to get
[3817.56 → 3818.82] the $100 rebate.
[3823.82 → 3824.30] Now,
[3824.54 → 3826.14] I'm so excited for Tesla trucks.
[3826.14 → 3831.44] At the prepaid,
[3831.66 → 3831.88] okay,
[3832.04 → 3832.16] yeah,
[3832.24 → 3833.46] and it will remain
[3833.46 → 3834.16] at $99.
[3834.54 → 3835.52] This is not just
[3835.52 → 3836.42] an intro promo.
[3837.16 → 3837.46] So,
[3837.88 → 3838.16] okay,
[3838.50 → 3839.58] very impressive phone.
[3839.98 → 3840.82] If you are looking
[3840.82 → 3841.90] for like a prepaid
[3841.90 → 3842.68] phone carrier
[3842.68 → 3843.56] and you just need
[3843.56 → 3844.40] like a cheap device
[3844.40 → 3846.18] and then you want to like
[3846.18 → 3846.68] port it over
[3846.68 → 3847.66] to a different carrier later,
[3848.04 → 3848.98] have a look at which bands
[3848.98 → 3849.42] it supports.
[3849.54 → 3849.92] Double check,
[3849.98 → 3850.68] make sure it supports
[3850.68 → 3851.50] the bands of the carrier
[3851.50 → 3852.14] of your choice.
[3852.32 → 3854.10] But I would highly recommend it
[3854.10 → 3854.80] based on the price.
[3854.88 → 3855.28] At $99,
[3855.28 → 3857.52] it is like felt good.
[3857.86 → 3858.60] I didn't test out
[3858.60 → 3859.30] the camera much
[3859.30 → 3860.38] so I wouldn't expect
[3860.38 → 3861.26] it to be anything special.
[3861.76 → 3863.26] But it blew me away
[3863.26 → 3864.54] in terms of the rest
[3864.54 → 3865.14] of the functionality
[3865.14 → 3865.68] at $99
[3865.68 → 3868.26] with NFC being a bit
[3868.26 → 3868.76] of a bummer
[3868.76 → 3870.20] and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi
[3870.20 → 3871.32] being like a pretty
[3871.32 → 3871.96] big bummer.
[3873.54 → 3874.90] I had the phone, actually.
[3875.02 → 3875.72] Jake shipped it back
[3875.72 → 3876.16] to them today
[3876.16 → 3876.60] because I was like,
[3876.64 → 3876.74] look,
[3876.78 → 3877.52] I'm not reviewing this.
[3877.58 → 3877.88] I'm sorry.
[3878.02 → 3879.44] I thought it was $99 unlocked.
[3879.78 → 3880.66] That's why I was like
[3880.66 → 3881.70] so excited.
[3882.28 → 3883.06] Now I'm just like
[3883.06 → 3883.92] a little bit excited.
[3884.04 → 3884.56] So I'll cover it
[3884.56 → 3885.14] on WAN Show
[3885.14 → 3885.92] and I will hold up
[3885.92 → 3886.28] the phone
[3886.28 → 3886.96] but I can't
[3886.96 → 3887.86] because Jake's too efficient.
[3890.10 → 3891.04] Way to go, Jake.
[3891.16 → 3892.10] Way to go, Jake.
[3892.72 → 3893.46] You jerk.
[3895.52 → 3896.48] I think that's
[3896.48 → 3897.54] pretty much all
[3897.54 → 3898.42] that I've...
[3898.42 → 3898.94] Oh, actually,
[3899.02 → 3899.70] no, I really want to
[3899.70 → 3900.40] do this.
[3900.40 → 3902.18] It's Arstechnica.co.uk.
[3902.92 → 3904.06] Wearable maker Fitbit
[3904.06 → 3905.36] must face lawsuit
[3905.36 → 3907.12] oversleep tracking claims.
[3908.22 → 3910.18] They are just getting wrecked.
[3910.56 → 3911.02] I mean,
[3911.40 → 3912.34] let's talk about
[3912.34 → 3913.16] fitness trackers
[3913.16 → 3913.86] for a minute here.
[3913.92 → 3914.70] I know Luke has
[3914.70 → 3915.68] a piece planned
[3915.68 → 3916.26] where he's going to be
[3916.26 → 3916.92] comparing a bunch of
[3916.92 → 3917.02] different fitness trackers.
[3917.02 → 3918.32] I don't think I want to say anything.
[3918.52 → 3919.30] Should I say anything
[3919.30 → 3919.78] about it yet?
[3919.78 → 3921.36] No, because I don't know anything.
[3921.60 → 3921.84] Okay.
[3921.96 → 3923.08] And if you don't weigh in,
[3923.40 → 3924.96] then you don't have to
[3924.96 → 3926.32] hold anything back
[3926.32 → 3927.36] and I can just say whatever
[3927.36 → 3928.42] and you can just sit there
[3928.42 → 3929.00] poker face
[3929.00 → 3930.00] and we won't know
[3930.00 → 3930.72] how true or untrue
[3930.72 → 3931.18] any of it is.
[3931.30 → 3932.04] But basically,
[3932.20 → 3932.82] my experience
[3932.82 → 3933.86] with fitness trackers
[3933.86 → 3934.58] is that
[3934.58 → 3935.82] they spit out
[3935.82 → 3936.64] meaningless numbers
[3936.64 → 3938.24] and due to
[3938.24 → 3939.56] battery life constraints,
[3940.06 → 3941.42] are not able
[3941.42 → 3942.32] to actually
[3942.32 → 3943.98] perform the functions
[3943.98 → 3944.80] that they claim
[3944.80 → 3945.30] to perform.
[3945.30 → 3946.42] Things like sleep tracking
[3946.42 → 3947.30] for a device
[3947.30 → 3948.26] that I have to take off
[3948.26 → 3949.64] even once
[3949.64 → 3950.54] or twice a week
[3950.54 → 3951.80] to charge at night
[3951.80 → 3953.62] is just stupid
[3953.62 → 3955.16] because it's not
[3955.16 → 3955.86] actually getting
[3955.86 → 3956.56] the whole picture.
[3957.18 → 3957.96] And I haven't even looked
[3957.96 → 3958.62] at any of my notes
[3958.62 → 3959.16] on this yet.
[3959.24 → 3960.86] So class action lawsuit
[3960.86 → 3961.66] accusing Fitbit
[3961.66 → 3962.46] of misrepresenting
[3962.46 → 3962.86] the ability
[3962.86 → 3963.76] for it to track sleep
[3963.76 → 3964.88] and okay,
[3965.06 → 3966.12] and it can move forward
[3966.12 → 3967.20] says a federal judge.
[3968.44 → 3968.94] San Francisco,
[3969.20 → 3970.16] the San Francisco
[3970.16 → 3970.80] federal lawsuit
[3970.80 → 3971.56] claims Fitbit
[3971.56 → 3972.62] materially misrepresented
[3972.62 → 3973.50] their packaging
[3973.50 → 3974.52] of their Flex product
[3974.52 → 3975.14] to track users
[3975.14 → 3975.38] hours,
[3975.50 → 3975.88] slept times,
[3975.94 → 3976.26] woken up,
[3976.30 → 3977.14] and sleep quality.
[3977.84 → 3978.42] The suit alleges
[3978.42 → 3979.24] false advertising,
[3979.38 → 3980.22] unfair trade practices,
[3980.40 → 3980.66] fraud,
[3980.80 → 3982.02] and other claims.
[3984.18 → 3984.62] Yeah,
[3984.70 → 3985.70] it could still be dismissed,
[3985.90 → 3987.02] but I mean,
[3987.12 → 3988.10] they're at some point,
[3988.90 → 3989.20] you know,
[3989.34 → 3991.60] fitness tracker wearable makers
[3991.60 → 3993.02] who for the most part,
[3993.16 → 3994.22] as far as I can tell,
[3994.34 → 3995.26] are just kind of
[3995.26 → 3996.60] not doing enough R&D
[3996.60 → 3997.60] on all of this stuff.
[3998.50 → 3999.50] We're going to get
[3999.50 → 4000.20] taken to task
[4000.20 → 4000.80] and it looks like
[4000.80 → 4001.94] it's happening now.
[4002.64 → 4003.40] I'm just gonna,
[4003.40 → 4005.38] what I'll say for now
[4005.38 → 4006.42] is that I think
[4006.42 → 4008.34] you're pretty close.
[4010.56 → 4011.72] End of an era.
[4012.18 → 4013.06] Original article
[4013.06 → 4014.24] from CDV News.
[4014.86 → 4016.24] Japan to manufacture
[4016.24 → 4017.80] the last ever
[4017.80 → 4019.78] VCR this summer.
[4020.18 → 4021.68] So if you want a VCR
[4021.68 → 4022.70] brand new,
[4022.92 → 4023.74] now is the time
[4023.74 → 4024.26] to get it.
[4024.36 → 4025.28] I wonder who's going to get
[4025.28 → 4026.74] the last manufactured
[4026.74 → 4027.42] VCR ever.
[4027.42 → 4029.20] Fungi Electric Company
[4029.20 → 4030.46] is the last remaining
[4030.46 → 4031.48] Japanese manufacturer
[4031.48 → 4032.40] of VCR devices.
[4033.02 → 4033.88] They've sold under
[4033.88 → 4034.86] various names
[4034.86 → 4035.62] like Sango
[4035.62 → 4036.34] in North America
[4036.34 → 4037.18] and they've been making
[4037.18 → 4038.16] VHS recorders
[4038.16 → 4039.40] since 1983.
[4040.12 → 4041.32] They've reported sales
[4041.32 → 4043.30] of 750,000
[4043.30 → 4044.14] video recorders
[4044.14 → 4044.54] worldwide
[4044.54 → 4045.64] in 2015
[4045.64 → 4048.08] and this is
[4048.08 → 4049.40] pretty much it.
[4049.58 → 4050.18] There's actually
[4050.18 → 4051.04] a pretty good summary
[4051.04 → 4051.78] of, you know,
[4051.86 → 4052.80] what VHS was
[4052.80 → 4053.34] for those of you
[4053.34 → 4054.18] who are fairly young
[4054.18 → 4055.24] and don't really remember it.
[4055.24 → 4058.04] But going back
[4058.04 → 4059.04] in time,
[4059.24 → 4059.84] Philips and Sony
[4059.84 → 4060.78] presented their first
[4060.78 → 4061.38] reel-to-reel
[4061.38 → 4062.32] videotape recorders
[4062.32 → 4063.48] in the 1960s
[4063.48 → 4064.00] and the first
[4064.00 → 4064.72] home devices
[4064.72 → 4066.24] followed in the 1970s
[4066.24 → 4066.94] and were actually
[4066.94 → 4068.28] showcased at CES.
[4068.90 → 4069.78] Several formats
[4069.78 → 4070.98] sprung up over the years
[4070.98 → 4071.70] to compete in the
[4071.70 → 4072.40] consumer market,
[4072.54 → 4073.30] Sony's Betamax
[4073.30 → 4074.28] and the widely adopted
[4074.28 → 4076.48] VHS developed by JVC.
[4076.88 → 4077.72] It launched officially
[4077.72 → 4078.70] in 1976
[4078.70 → 4079.54] with the first
[4079.54 → 4080.50] compatible recorders
[4080.50 → 4081.22] released in Japan
[4081.22 → 4082.08] before rolling out
[4082.08 → 4082.68] worldwide.
[4083.24 → 4083.88] VHS cassettes
[4083.88 → 4084.64] could record between
[4084.64 → 4085.20] 30 minutes
[4085.20 → 4085.98] and 5 hours
[4085.98 → 4086.76] of video footage
[4086.76 → 4088.10] and over time
[4088.10 → 4089.00] VCR recorders
[4089.00 → 4089.64] were even capable
[4089.64 → 4090.18] of doubling
[4090.18 → 4090.94] this capacity
[4090.94 → 4091.68] recording up to
[4091.68 → 4092.18] 10 hours
[4092.18 → 4093.06] on a single cassette.
[4093.76 → 4094.46] Although considered
[4094.46 → 4095.18] better quality,
[4095.36 → 4096.34] Betamax never managed
[4096.34 → 4097.58] to rival the VHS format
[4097.58 → 4099.38] and actually
[4099.38 → 4100.40] at the end of 2015
[4100.40 → 4101.16] Sony announced
[4101.16 → 4101.94] it would stop selling
[4101.94 → 4102.80] Betamax cassettes
[4102.80 → 4104.10] commercially this year
[4104.10 → 4104.92] as well.
[4105.68 → 4106.52] It's over,
[4106.68 → 4107.48] an end of an era
[4107.48 → 4108.90] and actually
[4108.90 → 4109.42] that leads us
[4109.42 → 4110.24] into yet another topic
[4110.24 → 4111.16] that we really have
[4111.16 → 4111.56] to cover,
[4111.80 → 4112.86] an era that just
[4112.86 → 4113.70] won't end.
[4113.70 → 4116.54] The WRT54GL.
[4116.86 → 4117.42] How many have you
[4117.42 → 4117.70] owned?
[4118.36 → 4119.16] How many have I
[4119.16 → 4119.36] owned?
[4119.46 → 4120.26] I have never
[4120.26 → 4120.66] owned one.
[4120.66 → 4121.34] Or bought
[4121.34 → 4122.52] for someone else.
[4122.70 → 4123.74] I bought one.
[4124.08 → 4124.34] Okay.
[4124.54 → 4125.00] That's it.
[4125.34 → 4126.06] I bought one
[4126.06 → 4126.92] for someone else
[4126.92 → 4128.72] and that's it.
[4131.26 → 4132.08] In terms of
[4132.08 → 4132.60] recommending
[4132.60 → 4133.22] at a store
[4133.22 → 4133.96] that I worked at,
[4134.06 → 4134.78] my number is
[4134.78 → 4135.64] I don't even know.
[4135.72 → 4136.30] Oh, if we want
[4136.30 → 4137.12] to talk about that,
[4137.32 → 4137.98] mine's a lot higher.
[4137.98 → 4138.78] Yeah, probably.
[4138.98 → 4139.42] That's true.
[4139.56 → 4139.70] Yeah.
[4140.40 → 4141.80] But ludicrous amounts
[4141.80 → 4142.84] and I've bought
[4142.84 → 4143.66] for myself
[4143.66 → 4144.74] or like friends
[4144.74 → 4145.32] and family
[4145.32 → 4146.00] I think four.
[4146.62 → 4147.10] So,
[4147.70 → 4149.04] it was released
[4149.04 → 4150.12] in 2005,
[4150.40 → 4151.42] which when we talk
[4151.42 → 4151.94] about in terms
[4151.94 → 4153.08] of technology products
[4153.08 → 4154.44] is ridiculous.
[4154.76 → 4155.02] Yes.
[4155.44 → 4157.20] It's a 54 megabit
[4157.20 → 4157.76] per second router.
[4157.86 → 4158.70] It's wireless G.
[4159.54 → 4159.72] I mean,
[4159.82 → 4160.48] it's not even
[4160.48 → 4161.28] dual-band.
[4162.26 → 4162.46] Like,
[4162.90 → 4163.48] why do people
[4163.48 → 4164.14] still want this?
[4164.34 → 4164.52] Well,
[4164.92 → 4165.96] the open source firmware,
[4166.70 → 4167.42] the reliability,
[4167.96 → 4169.06] make it attractive.
[4169.60 → 4170.18] You can buy
[4170.18 → 4170.84] a new router
[4170.84 → 4171.96] for less money.
[4172.30 → 4172.80] Get the benefit
[4172.80 → 4173.68] of modern standards,
[4173.80 → 4174.32] expansion into
[4174.32 → 4175.30] the 5 gigahertz band
[4175.30 → 4176.00] and data rates
[4176.00 → 4178.14] more than 20 times higher.
[4178.66 → 4178.82] So,
[4178.90 → 4179.54] the 54 GL
[4179.54 → 4180.10] costs around
[4180.10 → 4181.08] 43 bucks US
[4181.08 → 4181.68] on Amazon.
[4181.86 → 4182.72] But despite this,
[4183.08 → 4183.84] people are buying it
[4183.84 → 4184.78] in large enough numbers
[4184.78 → 4185.86] that Links continues
[4185.86 → 4187.04] to earn millions
[4187.04 → 4188.60] of dollars per year.
[4189.92 → 4191.14] This is a great quote.
[4191.60 → 4192.54] Links global product
[4192.54 → 4193.62] manager Vince Lass,
[4193.94 → 4194.96] Vince Reduce,
[4195.04 → 4195.44] excuse me,
[4195.60 → 4196.24] told Ar's,
[4196.82 → 4197.40] to be honest,
[4197.56 → 4198.50] it somewhat baffles
[4198.50 → 4199.14] my mind.
[4200.52 → 4201.44] But we'll keep
[4201.44 → 4201.90] building it
[4201.90 → 4202.52] because people
[4202.52 → 4203.40] keep buying it.
[4205.20 → 4205.72] Wonderful.
[4208.08 → 4209.06] All right.
[4209.20 → 4209.50] So,
[4209.62 → 4210.36] I think that
[4210.36 → 4211.14] pretty much
[4211.14 → 4212.04] wraps it up.
[4212.24 → 4213.00] Thank you
[4213.00 → 4214.26] very much
[4214.26 → 4215.06] for tuning in
[4215.06 → 4215.64] to the WAN show
[4215.64 → 4216.10] this week.
[4216.16 → 4217.02] I'm sorry it was late.
[4217.32 → 4217.92] I think,
[4218.08 → 4219.10] based on how smoothly
[4219.10 → 4220.18] the stream has gone
[4220.18 → 4221.50] since we started it
[4221.50 → 4222.50] and got the audio fixed
[4222.50 → 4223.46] that I'm basically
[4223.46 → 4224.74] not going to touch anything
[4224.74 → 4225.78] and hopefully
[4225.78 → 4226.34] we will be
[4226.34 → 4227.74] good to go next week.
[4227.96 → 4228.50] That strategy
[4228.50 → 4229.40] has definitely
[4229.40 → 4230.02] worked for us
[4230.02 → 4230.58] in the past.
[4230.82 → 4231.44] And it has also
[4231.44 → 4232.20] not worked for us
[4232.20 → 4233.02] at times in the past.
[4233.16 → 4233.30] Ever.
[4233.70 → 4233.98] Ever.
[4234.12 → 4234.78] That was my point.
[4235.14 → 4235.96] Thank you for watching
[4235.96 → 4236.80] and we will see you
[4236.80 → 4237.36] again next week.
[4237.48 → 4238.30] Same bat time,
[4238.52 → 4239.50] same bat channel.
[4239.90 → 4240.34] Bye!
[4241.92 → 4242.88] There's no intro.
[4242.88 → 4245.84] Carrying a couch.
[4247.40 → 4248.50] Linus drops the couch
[4248.50 → 4249.06] and laughs.
[4249.84 → 4251.06] I keep going with it.
[4252.64 → 4253.74] I laugh.
[4254.92 → 4255.78] There's not that big
[4255.78 → 4256.44] of a delay between
[4256.44 → 4257.08] you laughing and
[4257.08 → 4257.62] dropping the couch.
[4258.14 → 4258.90] Yeah, I think it's
[4258.90 → 4259.48] funny immediately.
[4259.80 → 4260.38] I fix it.
[4261.78 → 4262.76] We're sitting on a couch
[4262.76 → 4263.16] together.
[4263.62 → 4264.30] We move a little bit
[4264.30 → 4265.00] on the couch.
[4265.56 → 4266.50] Oh my God,
[4266.60 → 4267.76] we can't make graphics
[4267.76 → 4268.20] apparently.
