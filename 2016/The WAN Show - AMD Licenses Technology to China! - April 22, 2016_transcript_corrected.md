[0.00 → 4.00] All right!
[4.00 → 8.00] Oh, welcome to the WAN Show, guys!
[8.00 → 12.00] It's Friday! I'm broadcasting live from the studio
[12.00 → 16.00] here in lovely Langley, British Columbia. And
[16.00 → 20.00] quite frankly, I'd rather be at home
[20.00 → 24.00] playing games on the HTC Five. I will definitely be
[24.00 → 28.00] spending some time on the show today talking about that. I will definitely
[28.00 → 32.00] acknowledge my unfortunately
[32.00 → 36.00] downgraded but still somewhat sexy co-host here. And I will
[36.00 → 40.00] definitely tell you all the topics that we are going to be
[40.00 → 44.00] covering on the show today after the intro.
[44.00 → 48.00] Hold on, I got this. There may even be music today.
[48.00 → 50.00] We'll see if I fixed it.
[58.00 → 60.00] Hey!
[60.00 → 62.00] Luke.com
[62.00 → 64.00] Luke.com
[64.00 → 66.00] My WAN Show
[66.00 → 76.00] Also, whoa! Some of you guys were asking where Luke is! Luke is in a place doing a thing. The place is called Pax East. And whoever did up the Pax thing here doesn't realize that Pax is Penny
[76.00 → 94.00] Arcade Expo, not a word that starts with a P and has two small letters after it. That's okay. Pax East 2016. So huge thanks to Logitech G and Discord.
[94.00 → 98.00] for powering our Pax East 2016 content. Yes, my friends, for the first time ever,
[98.00 → 102.00] Linus Media Group actually had two away teams
[102.00 → 104.00] at the same time.
[104.00 → 106.00] So Taryn and Brandon
[106.00 → 108.00] were down at NAB in Las Vegas
[108.00 → 110.00] and before they returned, Luke, Burke
[110.00 → 112.00] and Dennis
[112.00 → 114.00] and Dennis
[114.00 → 116.00] and Dennis
[116.00 → 118.00] and Dennis
[118.00 → 120.00] and
[120.00 → 122.00] Taryn
[122.00 → 124.00] and Brandon
[124.00 → 126.00] and
[126.00 → 128.00] they
[128.00 → 130.00] and
[130.00 → 132.00] So we're going to have like an entire
[132.00 → 134.00] week
[134.00 → 136.00] of show coverage for you guys.
[136.00 → 140.00] And in the meantime, I've been back here in the studio with David
[140.00 → 142.00] and
[142.00 → 144.00] Ed
[144.00 → 145.00] and
[145.00 → 147.00] well, I guess that's about it
[147.00 → 149.00] and we've been working on some really cool stuff.
[149.00 → 152.00] So we've got the review of the iPhone SE coming up.
[152.00 → 155.98] We've got a power bank, like battery bank showdown coming up.
[156.08 → 160.86] We've got, this is a video nobody asked for, but I was kind of interested in.
[161.58 → 164.78] And so I decided to make, but I've got a video upcoming on PMI,
[164.92 → 168.78] which is a remote management interface that exists on some motherboards
[168.78 → 172.20] that allows you to log in from anywhere and like power on the server,
[172.34 → 175.86] power down the server, change bio settings, even all kinds of cool stuff like that.
[176.02 → 179.34] So I've been working on some videos, and they've been working on some videos
[179.34 → 181.00] and it's all good stuff.
[181.00 → 182.14] And okay, right.
[182.22 → 185.54] So I will answer those questions that I said I was going to answer.
[186.32 → 187.94] This is my new co-host.
[188.06 → 190.66] Her name is Reich or something.
[190.80 → 191.60] I'm making that up.
[191.64 → 193.72] I know she's an actual character from an actual show.
[193.82 → 194.86] I don't know what it is.
[196.72 → 198.20] I've got people talking about Wake on Land.
[198.44 → 198.80] Yes.
[199.02 → 199.30] Yes.
[199.36 → 200.84] I go through Wake on Land in the video.
[200.94 → 204.02] I actually have some other cool solutions that I guarantee you've never heard of as well.
[205.86 → 206.60] Yes, I know.
[206.90 → 207.22] Yoko.
[207.44 → 208.26] Apparently it's Yoko.
[208.46 → 209.06] I don't know.
[209.16 → 209.62] I'm sorry.
[209.62 → 213.50] You know, for me, it's just, you know, a pillow.
[214.04 → 218.16] I was on Amazon, and I was just browsing toys.
[218.58 → 219.72] Not those kinds of toys.
[220.06 → 224.50] I was browsing toys, and I was just trying to find stuff for Channel Super Fun.
[224.56 → 228.38] So this was around the time leading up to the big move into the new studio.
[228.38 → 232.94] And so I was just like, what the hell is this?
[234.06 → 235.88] It's a waif pillow.
[236.38 → 237.30] You've got to be kidding me.
[237.72 → 240.88] So I ordered it having no idea what I was going to do.
[241.00 → 246.90] Like I was thinking initially I would try and do some kind of prank where I called people down to help me with something.
[246.90 → 253.32] And then like I'd have a hidden camera, and then I'd be like making out with it or something, and I'd get like reaction shots from people.
[253.32 → 257.40] But we ended up coming with the Channel Super Fun where we did the cuddle challenge.
[257.50 → 259.14] I think that ended up being a lot better anyway.
[259.68 → 261.32] I don't know how well that video is doing.
[261.40 → 266.26] You know, honestly, I feel like Channel Super Fun just should do so much better.
[266.26 → 271.52] But like nothing ever really catches on for us on that channel.
[271.62 → 274.18] Like it doesn't go viral or whatever else.
[274.36 → 275.90] I've got people telling me to get another human.
[276.08 → 277.18] The office is like empty.
[277.38 → 279.12] I mean, do you really want me to pull Nick Light in here?
[279.94 → 280.16] Huh?
[280.66 → 281.14] Come on.
[281.22 → 282.34] That'd be like the worst thing ever.
[284.54 → 286.88] So I promised to discuss some.
[286.94 → 292.24] Okay, before I get into that, I will go through some of the top topics for today.
[292.24 → 298.30] Intel to cut 12,000 jobs as PC demand wanes.
[299.74 → 300.34] Ouch.
[302.64 → 309.78] Researchers accidentally discover technology that could lead to batteries that can be charged many more times than current ones.
[310.50 → 314.14] Nerd Sports has launched on Vessel.
[314.32 → 320.72] So this is something that we've had a lot of people asking about, seeking clarification on.
[320.72 → 325.82] And so Nerd Sports is a new series that we developed.
[326.64 → 328.92] It was funded by Vessel.com.
[329.00 → 334.08] So if you guys are familiar with Vessel, it's the early access platform that our videos go up on.
[334.50 → 336.78] Generally speaking, one week before YouTube.
[337.34 → 338.92] But this is different.
[339.44 → 341.12] Nerd Sports is exclusive to Vessel.
[341.28 → 342.42] And it's a series that we developed.
[342.56 → 346.54] We've done five episodes or filmed five episodes so far.
[346.66 → 347.96] Three of which are actually done.
[347.96 → 349.36] One of which is released.
[350.08 → 360.76] Where basically, the Linus Media Group team, we call ourselves the Keyboard Warriors, takes on actual sports teams.
[361.36 → 363.96] So the first sports that we did were...
[364.90 → 367.90] Actually, we filmed it like ages ago at this point.
[368.04 → 369.62] Projects like this take so long.
[369.74 → 374.16] So volleyball, dodgeball, lacrosse, ice hockey, and curling.
[374.16 → 377.08] So the first episode is volleyball.
[377.40 → 377.96] It's awesome.
[378.12 → 386.34] We actually take on the Trinity Western Spartans, who are the top college women's volleyball team in the country as of last year.
[386.56 → 390.12] And it is actually pretty hilarious.
[390.62 → 393.36] I don't think I'm technically supposed to do this.
[393.88 → 396.48] Because there is a trailer and stuff.
[396.48 → 400.24] But I will play just a little bit of it.
[401.30 → 401.84] So where?
[402.04 → 402.50] Videos.
[402.90 → 403.48] Here we go.
[405.44 → 409.48] I'm just going to grab a couple chunks out of it here.
[420.56 → 421.40] If it loads.
[421.40 → 425.38] Of course, everyone's probably hitting it all at the same time now.
[425.44 → 426.14] Thanks, guys.
[428.86 → 429.46] That's weird.
[429.66 → 430.56] See, that's working.
[432.34 → 433.34] Well, we'll be back.
[435.44 → 437.66] So Nerd Sports is available now.
[437.72 → 441.66] It's going to be released weekly for the next four weeks over on vessel.com.
[442.76 → 444.04] What else do we have?
[444.04 → 447.50] Ah, yes.
[447.56 → 449.28] A mosquito-killing billboard.
[449.72 → 451.04] Pretty freaking cool.
[451.84 → 452.02] Okay.
[452.86 → 458.14] So now, with all that aside, I have to take some time to talk about the HTC Five.
[458.28 → 460.40] And I know you guys are thinking,
[461.04 → 461.88] All right.
[462.90 → 464.34] Luke's not here on the show.
[464.34 → 471.06] I don't have to listen to anyone talk about VR for the next hour and a half.
[472.20 → 474.44] But you were wrong.
[475.62 → 477.74] Everything about that was wrong.
[477.84 → 479.18] I'm definitely going to be talking about VR.
[479.32 → 482.50] So the HTC Five arrived yesterday afternoon,
[482.64 → 488.06] at which time I promptly completely abandoned everything else that I had planned for that evening.
[488.60 → 489.52] I got home.
[489.92 → 490.46] I was like,
[490.46 → 491.20] Hi, kids.
[491.32 → 491.92] Bye, kids.
[492.24 → 493.96] And locked myself upstairs.
[493.96 → 495.16] They were allowed in afterwards,
[495.34 → 496.98] but only if they agreed to help me set up the Five.
[497.38 → 499.46] Locked myself upstairs to set up the Five.
[499.62 → 501.16] It takes the most,
[501.16 → 504.44] it's the most agonizing, like, hour ever.
[504.96 → 508.70] Because I kind of thought it would come with, like,
[509.04 → 511.38] floor stands or something for the lighthouse units.
[512.22 → 513.06] It does not.
[513.16 → 514.82] They just expect you to wall mount it.
[514.86 → 515.38] So I was like,
[515.66 → 518.82] Vaughn, are we painting this room soon?
[518.82 → 520.06] Because we'd actually discussed it.
[520.54 → 521.16] And she's like,
[521.32 → 522.64] Yeah, I think, I think so.
[522.76 → 523.84] We had said we were going to.
[523.84 → 524.04] I'm like,
[524.10 → 525.32] Okay, I'm putting a bunch of holes in the wall.
[527.26 → 529.28] So I'm just in there,
[529.36 → 531.04] just, like, drilling random holes in the wall,
[531.10 → 531.66] mounting the lighthouse.
[531.74 → 533.26] It takes about an hour to set up.
[533.30 → 533.66] And you're just like,
[533.68 → 534.82] I just want to play VR games.
[534.86 → 535.80] I just want to play VR games.
[536.62 → 537.72] So then, at that time,
[537.80 → 539.28] I kind of realized,
[539.52 → 539.86] again,
[540.00 → 541.22] that I had served,
[541.26 → 542.68] and that I should have done this at the beginning.
[542.68 → 544.00] But I realized,
[544.12 → 544.30] oh,
[544.40 → 546.72] I don't have any VR games downloaded.
[546.88 → 547.58] So I had to,
[547.58 → 550.56] I had to go buy some VR games right away.
[550.76 → 557.36] And then I had to go ahead and wait for those to download while I finished the setup.
[557.36 → 566.74] And then I spent about two hours straight for the first time playing a single player experience in,
[566.74 → 569.68] I don't even know.
[569.68 → 576.30] Like, I can't even begin to imagine how long it's been since I've,
[576.32 → 577.92] since I've done that in a single player game.
[577.98 → 579.00] Like, I'll drop in,
[579.04 → 579.36] and like,
[579.38 → 581.06] I was playing Team Fortress 2 with,
[581.06 → 582.56] with Luke, actually,
[582.66 → 583.22] the other night.
[583.34 → 585.36] He was streaming on his Twitch channel and stuff.
[585.80 → 586.26] But like,
[586.30 → 587.46] just playing single player games,
[587.70 → 588.92] it's been a long time.
[589.02 → 591.28] But I was playing Space Pirate Trainer.
[592.40 → 595.14] It is freaking cool.
[595.30 → 597.10] You've got like a shield and a blaster,
[597.10 → 599.06] and you can like switch out your shield and your blaster.
[599.68 → 600.04] Um,
[600.64 → 602.72] it is unbelievably fun.
[603.06 → 603.28] Um,
[603.30 → 603.80] I had,
[603.88 → 604.84] I had a lot of people say,
[604.90 → 605.06] yeah,
[605.12 → 605.78] enjoy your,
[606.06 → 607.58] enjoy your headache after 30 minutes.
[607.76 → 608.22] You know what?
[608.82 → 609.62] Two hours,
[609.76 → 611.00] almost uninterrupted.
[611.08 → 611.28] Uh,
[611.28 → 612.68] my wife was playing for a little bit.
[612.76 → 613.30] Two hours,
[613.52 → 614.68] almost uninterrupted.
[615.00 → 617.08] And I was feeling good.
[617.26 → 617.70] Like,
[617.74 → 620.70] I was 100% fine at the end of that.
[620.78 → 621.32] It was,
[621.46 → 623.16] it was freaking awesome.
[623.34 → 625.44] I can't wait to go home and play with it more.
[625.76 → 626.04] Um,
[626.56 → 628.50] there are still issues.
[628.50 → 628.82] Like,
[628.88 → 630.78] the setup process is not perfect.
[631.10 → 634.28] I ran into a couple of issues while I was setting it up.
[634.40 → 634.60] Um,
[634.60 → 636.22] number one was,
[636.28 → 637.54] I ended up with the bug,
[637.64 → 639.04] where you can end up standing like,
[639.10 → 640.76] six to ten feet below the floor,
[640.90 → 642.14] for the entire like,
[642.46 → 644.44] introductory video segment.
[644.44 → 645.86] And I was just like,
[645.92 → 646.18] okay,
[646.32 → 646.50] well,
[646.64 → 647.62] this is really frustrating.
[647.84 → 648.14] Like,
[648.20 → 648.52] is it,
[648.60 → 650.08] is everything supposed to be up there?
[650.72 → 652.58] Am I supposed to be down here?
[652.58 → 653.54] Cause there was like a weird,
[653.54 → 654.80] like golf cart next to me.
[654.92 → 660.50] But what I was actually standing in was like a little room that's supposed to lift the golf cart up.
[660.50 → 662.40] Like it's supposed to seem like the golf cart emerges from there,
[662.44 → 663.42] but I was just stuck down there.
[663.42 → 665.82] And I didn't come up when the golf cart went up either.
[666.14 → 668.10] So it was just sort of confusing.
[668.82 → 669.18] Um,
[670.08 → 671.00] and then,
[671.14 → 674.24] the other issue I had was my,
[674.32 → 675.88] my motion controllers,
[676.06 → 676.24] my,
[676.32 → 681.74] my handheld motion controllers just weren't picking up until I uninstalled and reinstalled the software.
[681.74 → 682.08] And like,
[682.12 → 682.22] there,
[682.28 → 683.64] there were some issues with the setup,
[683.78 → 685.22] but once it's going,
[685.96 → 686.32] man,
[686.38 → 687.26] it's fun.
[687.52 → 691.92] Like the resolution does bother me.
[691.92 → 694.54] Like you take off the goggles, and you see the preview window on the screen.
[694.60 → 694.96] You're just like,
[695.06 → 695.56] oh man,
[695.60 → 696.80] what if it looked like that?
[697.98 → 704.08] But not to the point where the gameplay isn't immersive, and the gameplay isn't ludicrously enjoyable.
[704.28 → 704.98] So it was,
[705.12 → 705.38] um,
[706.02 → 707.06] I tell you guys,
[707.14 → 708.18] it was an absolute,
[708.56 → 710.44] it was an absolute blast.
[710.44 → 710.92] I,
[710.98 → 712.36] I had a lot of fun with it last night.
[713.48 → 714.22] I will,
[714.36 → 717.14] I suppose I will get on with the show now.
[717.42 → 717.78] Um,
[717.78 → 718.16] let's,
[718.20 → 718.40] uh,
[718.40 → 719.62] jump into our first topic here.
[719.68 → 723.22] So the original article is from a non-tech.com,
[723.22 → 723.88] uh,
[723.88 → 726.18] and Intel is slashing.
[726.30 → 726.44] Oh,
[726.56 → 726.74] right.
[726.78 → 728.76] This was posted originally on the forum by,
[728.84 → 728.94] oh,
[729.04 → 729.38] no one.
[729.78 → 738.40] So Intel is slashing a huge number of jobs over the rest of 2016 and even leading into 2017.
[738.40 → 738.92] Um,
[738.92 → 739.90] um,
[739.90 → 742.74] about 11% of the total workforce,
[742.98 → 744.66] 12,000 people.
[745.04 → 745.44] Um,
[745.64 → 747.38] CEO Brian Kasich says,
[747.38 → 749.80] Intel has been known as a PC company.
[749.80 → 757.04] It's time to make this transition and push the company all the way over to supplying chips for things like smartphones,
[757.04 → 759.04] cloud computing,
[759.04 → 759.06] sensors,
[759.06 → 760.06] and other devices,
[760.06 → 760.46] uh,
[760.46 → 763.86] getting heavily into internet of things and mobile products.
[764.50 → 764.96] Um,
[764.96 → 766.26] I mean,
[766.26 → 769.94] he's not saying that CPUs,
[769.94 → 770.46] as you know,
[770.46 → 771.62] them are going away.
[772.28 → 782.46] They're just diversifying their portfolio and focusing their R and D very clearly on those other possible revenue streams.
[782.46 → 784.14] To be clear,
[784.14 → 784.78] also,
[784.78 → 788.62] 60% of the revenue does still come from PC CPUs,
[788.78 → 798.10] but most of the layoffs are expected to occur inside the PC business to allow them to focus on these other categories.
[798.10 → 799.62] I really,
[799.62 → 812.10] I really hope that they know something that AMD doesn't know about the possibility for improving CPU performance over the next few years here,
[812.10 → 812.66] because we've,
[812.74 → 818.90] we really have seen them de-emphasize the CPU long before there were mass layoffs associated with it like this,
[818.90 → 819.88] where they're kind of going,
[819.98 → 820.14] okay,
[820.30 → 820.50] yep,
[820.60 → 821.46] more power efficiency.
[821.90 → 822.26] Um,
[822.26 → 823.74] we're putting more GPU on it.
[823.86 → 828.56] We are not really doing a lot in terms of the overall horsepower of it,
[828.62 → 829.30] keeping the
[829.38 → 838.64] the computing experience of the desktop user relatively stagnant while the mobile users are getting real tangible benefits out of each,
[838.98 → 839.30] uh,
[839.34 → 840.26] coming generation,
[840.46 → 840.88] like the
[840.88 → 841.74] the better connectivity,
[841.74 → 845.56] I would say even benefits notebook users more than desktop users,
[845.56 → 848.84] because desktop users can throw an add-in card in their system,
[849.56 → 849.84] say,
[849.90 → 850.44] for example,
[850.56 → 851.58] whereas laptop users,
[851.78 → 853.34] these battery life improvements,
[853.56 → 854.86] these connectivity improvements,
[855.26 → 855.42] you know,
[855.44 → 858.22] things like Thunderbolt 3 make a huge difference.
[858.30 → 858.46] I mean,
[858.50 → 862.38] you can only have so many ports on something like a laptop,
[863.14 → 863.54] um,
[863.82 → 864.96] something like Apple's MacBook.
[865.28 → 866.46] You can only have one port.
[867.02 → 867.18] Yay.
[868.38 → 869.38] Whereas on a desktop,
[870.06 → 870.20] you,
[870.52 → 870.76] well,
[870.76 → 875.44] you don't really need a single port that has such high speeds and can handle,
[875.44 → 876.10] you know,
[876.10 → 881.70] LAN and sound and USB and HDMI and DisplayPort all out of this one connection,
[881.70 → 883.88] because you could just plug all those things in.
[884.62 → 885.98] It's not really that big of a deal.
[886.44 → 886.74] Um,
[887.84 → 888.92] where was I going with this?
[888.92 → 889.42] right,
[889.42 → 889.76] so we've,
[889.76 → 889.78] so we've,
[889.78 → 889.80] so we've,
[889.80 → 889.82] so we've,
[889.82 → 889.84] so we've,
[889.84 → 889.92] so we've,
[889.92 → 890.26] so we've,
[890.26 → 893.34] so we've seen this de-emphasis coming,
[893.60 → 894.96] but it's frustrating,
[895.10 → 897.10] because when you look at,
[897.10 → 900.58] when you look at Intel's CPUs,
[900.58 → 901.28] um,
[901.28 → 901.78] on the
[901.78 → 901.84] on the
[901.84 → 902.86] on the mainstream side,
[902.86 → 905.96] like on the LGA 11.5X side of things,
[905.96 → 908.64] there is room,
[908.76 → 910.14] like actual physical,
[910.58 → 912.94] there is physical room for them to,
[913.16 → 915.80] even if they can't increase clock speeds dramatically,
[915.80 → 920.18] and even if they can't increase IPC,
[920.38 → 920.60] that's,
[920.64 → 921.04] that's the
[921.16 → 922.94] that's the performance per clock dramatically,
[923.02 → 924.58] they could be putting more cores on them,
[924.68 → 928.22] if they opted to give us a pure CPU rather than an APU,
[928.26 → 931.94] something with CPU and graphics built into it at the same time.
[932.08 → 933.40] They just don't.
[933.52 → 935.80] They reserve that for the high-end platform,
[936.08 → 936.84] the enthusiast,
[936.92 → 937.90] and the server platform,
[938.60 → 939.02] and,
[939.08 → 939.44] uh,
[940.70 → 942.82] that's pretty much all she wrote on that.
[943.46 → 943.84] Now,
[944.10 → 945.36] this is really weird,
[945.80 → 946.80] and I am
[946.80 → 950.48] going to have to find out what it is regarding,
[950.64 → 952.48] by having Nick find out what it's regarding.
[953.26 → 953.52] Uh,
[953.52 → 953.72] sorry,
[953.80 → 954.38] just one moment.
[955.64 → 956.86] Can you take this for me,
[956.90 → 957.12] please?
[957.82 → 958.58] Thank you.
[959.22 → 962.04] And I'm going to move into my next topic here.
[964.48 → 964.80] Uh,
[964.82 → 964.96] well,
[965.00 → 965.30] actually,
[965.40 → 965.50] well,
[965.52 → 965.78] hold on,
[965.82 → 967.12] I guess I could give a little bit,
[967.22 → 968.38] a little bit more clarification.
[968.68 → 971.22] So this is the largest set of layoffs in 10 years,
[971.30 → 972.42] since 2006,
[972.62 → 974.88] when they let 10,500 people go,
[974.88 → 975.74] uh,
[975.74 → 977.86] profit margins in Q1 were lower than expected,
[977.86 → 979.62] with a net income of $2 billion,
[980.30 → 982.14] so on a revenue of $13.7 billion.
[983.10 → 983.54] Um,
[984.34 → 986.86] yeah,
[987.10 → 987.48] they're,
[988.32 → 988.82] I don't know.
[989.16 → 989.32] I,
[989.42 → 990.70] I hope for their sake,
[990.76 → 992.12] they know something AMD doesn't know,
[992.18 → 992.56] because,
[992.98 → 996.08] if they're planning to let a lot of people go on the desktop CPU side,
[996.08 → 999.10] if AMD really does see a resurgence with Zen,
[999.54 → 1001.20] get some more revenue coming in,
[1001.38 → 1001.78] um,
[1001.94 → 1004.04] potentially allowing them to pick up some of that talent,
[1004.54 → 1008.80] there could be a big opportunity for us to have competition again,
[1009.08 → 1009.84] due to Intel,
[1010.06 → 1010.76] not accidentally,
[1011.00 → 1015.78] but making a conscious decision to take their foot off of the pedal on the
[1015.80 → 1016.02] uh,
[1016.02 → 1017.44] on the desktop CPU side of things.
[1018.12 → 1018.60] Uh,
[1018.60 → 1018.92] all good?
[1019.88 → 1020.12] Yeah,
[1020.24 → 1022.00] just because of the...
[1022.00 → 1022.56] okay,
[1022.74 → 1023.02] okay,
[1023.22 → 1023.52] okay,
[1023.56 → 1023.72] cool.
[1026.06 → 1026.80] All right.
[1028.02 → 1028.50] So,
[1028.72 → 1031.16] let's move into Intel announcing,
[1031.34 → 1031.46] oh,
[1031.52 → 1031.66] no,
[1031.76 → 1031.90] yeah,
[1031.94 → 1032.28] we already,
[1032.40 → 1033.04] we already got that.
[1033.28 → 1033.56] Oh,
[1033.62 → 1034.56] let's move into this one.
[1034.60 → 1035.24] This one's fun.
[1035.62 → 1035.94] So,
[1036.12 → 1039.48] original article here was off of PC perspective,
[1041.28 → 1044.10] and basically,
[1044.44 → 1046.08] it's amazing how this happens,
[1046.08 → 1051.82] but researchers accidentally discovered nanowire-based technology that could lead to
[1051.82 → 1055.60] batteries that can be charged hundreds of thousands of times.
[1056.16 → 1056.50] So,
[1056.82 → 1059.60] you guys are probably familiar with the way that,
[1060.14 → 1061.22] almost as though,
[1061.92 → 1063.00] by planning,
[1063.50 → 1063.90] um,
[1064.06 → 1073.12] phones become obsolete thanks to their batteries just going through the maximum number of charge and discharge cycles until they die.
[1073.12 → 1073.32] Like,
[1073.42 → 1073.64] there's,
[1074.00 → 1080.42] lithium-ion batteries are inherently not stable over many charge and discharge cycles.
[1080.42 → 1081.38] Well,
[1081.90 → 1082.54] here we go.
[1083.60 → 1085.70] Accidental discovery nanowires,
[1085.84 → 1088.68] which are several thousand times thinner than a human hair.
[1089.30 → 1090.58] Extremely conductive,
[1091.06 → 1095.94] and have a large surface area to support storage and transfer of electrons.
[1097.52 → 1097.74] Uh,
[1097.74 → 1098.62] Lanai's team,
[1098.72 → 1099.92] so this is Maya Lanai,
[1100.30 → 1102.64] fixed the issue where these,
[1102.70 → 1107.76] these tiny wires are fragile and don't hold up well to repeated discharging and recharging.
[1107.76 → 1115.08] They fixed this by coating a gold nanowire in a manganese dioxide shell and then placing it in a
[1115.08 → 1119.46] in a gel that's like plexiglass to improve its reliability.
[1119.94 → 1120.22] Again,
[1120.62 → 1122.60] totally by accident.
[1122.60 → 1123.42] So,
[1123.42 → 1132.10] Maya was apparently playing around and coated the whole thing with a very thin gel layer and started to cycle it and discovered that by using this gel,
[1132.76 → 1139.36] she could cycle it hundreds of thousands of times without losing any capacity or any power output.
[1139.36 → 1139.62] So,
[1139.80 → 1145.28] this was tested more than 200,000 times over a three-month span,
[1145.52 → 1148.14] and they are reporting the findings now.
[1148.46 → 1152.18] I would love to see this technology in my new smartphone,
[1152.72 → 1153.72] and I share,
[1154.08 → 1154.32] um,
[1154.32 → 1157.14] I believe it was written by Ryan Shroud over at PC Per,
[1157.22 → 1157.54] but it could,
[1157.62 → 1158.72] it could have been one of their other writers,
[1159.12 → 1165.54] but I share their concern about this technology ultimately being patented and ending up in a warehouse somewhere,
[1165.54 → 1167.06] never to be seen again,
[1167.06 → 1169.88] because it is a good thing for phone manufacturers,
[1170.76 → 1171.92] bottom line wise,
[1172.06 → 1177.84] for the phone to effectively not be usable anywhere from three to six years after it was originally manufactured.
[1178.32 → 1179.78] Would they want the battery to last forever?
[1180.30 → 1181.20] I don't know.
[1183.12 → 1183.56] Um,
[1183.66 → 1184.20] I think they have.
[1184.58 → 1185.00] Okay,
[1185.58 → 1186.14] so,
[1186.28 → 1188.08] moving along to our next topic,
[1188.28 → 1195.52] AMD is set to receive 293 million in fresh cash from a deal with the chip,
[1195.54 → 1196.56] Chinese government.
[1197.58 → 1198.08] This,
[1198.22 → 1198.78] of course,
[1198.94 → 1202.52] raises any number of questions.
[1203.10 → 1203.30] Um,
[1203.84 → 1204.50] I mean,
[1204.56 → 1205.30] this comes on,
[1205.38 → 1207.48] on the heels of the Chinese,
[1207.68 → 1207.84] the
[1208.16 → 1208.32] so,
[1208.64 → 1209.58] okay,
[1209.86 → 1211.82] it's kind of complicated,
[1211.96 → 1213.66] because the Chinese government,
[1213.66 → 1221.66] and then companies in China are intertwined in a way that you wouldn't necessarily expect,
[1221.66 → 1222.88] if you come from,
[1222.88 → 1223.24] like,
[1223.32 → 1223.50] a
[1223.50 → 1226.06] a more Western or more capitalist society.
[1226.20 → 1226.34] I mean,
[1226.46 → 1226.66] yeah,
[1226.72 → 1229.76] the Chinese claim that capitalism is alive and well,
[1229.88 → 1230.04] but,
[1230.64 → 1237.46] the reality of it is that state funds make a lot of the businesses that run in China possible.
[1238.02 → 1238.30] So,
[1238.82 → 1239.74] in here,
[1239.82 → 1242.32] the original article is actually from Guru 3D.
[1242.40 → 1244.38] I'm just going to go ahead and pull that up.
[1244.38 → 1245.10] So,
[1245.30 → 1246.50] in the Guru 3D article,
[1246.64 → 1256.42] they say the Chinese government has attempted to make CPUs and develop their own CPU architecture many times before.
[1257.12 → 1257.48] Um,
[1257.48 → 1261.38] they want their own hardware and software for government funded institutions,
[1261.38 → 1264.76] but they have not yet succeeded,
[1264.92 → 1268.64] and it looks like AMD is going to be the beneficiary.
[1268.80 → 1268.90] So,
[1268.98 → 1271.56] AMD has made it clear in their strategy,
[1271.68 → 1272.52] in their marketing strategy,
[1272.52 → 1276.90] that they're ready to customize modular CPU and SOC,
[1277.02 → 1278.30] or system-on-chip designs,
[1278.70 → 1280.08] by the client's specs.
[1280.18 → 1280.46] So,
[1280.56 → 1288.32] similar to what they would have done with Sony and Microsoft for the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.
[1288.32 → 1289.28] So,
[1289.40 → 1291.66] the deal was mentioned in their last quarterly results,
[1292.02 → 1292.54] and,
[1292.90 → 1294.32] basically,
[1295.12 → 1303.84] the deal would involve AMD licensing its x86 processor technology,
[1304.10 → 1306.76] and the IP related to designing an SOC,
[1306.86 → 1307.88] like memory controllers,
[1308.42 → 1309.22] input-output,
[1309.44 → 1309.96] and caching,
[1310.36 → 1313.30] but possibly not their GPU technology.
[1314.00 → 1314.30] Um,
[1314.30 → 1315.94] the architecture has not been confirmed,
[1315.94 → 1318.22] but Forbes is claiming that it must be Men,
[1318.22 → 1321.50] as their previous server CPUs hadn't had much,
[1321.72 → 1322.12] if any,
[1322.12 → 1322.64] success.
[1322.92 → 1323.50] It's actually been,
[1323.56 → 1325.52] it's been a while since Option has,
[1325.60 → 1325.90] uh,
[1326.20 → 1327.36] has been much of a big deal.
[1327.52 → 1328.04] This is,
[1328.34 → 1329.20] this is,
[1329.34 → 1330.40] this is very,
[1330.80 → 1331.78] this is very,
[1331.86 → 1332.60] very interesting.
[1332.84 → 1333.06] I mean,
[1333.14 → 1334.04] AMD is,
[1335.22 → 1338.70] you could see it as AMD getting in bed with China.
[1338.96 → 1339.30] Uh,
[1339.30 → 1340.96] you could also see it as
[1340.96 → 1343.90] China eventually giving in,
[1343.90 → 1344.68] and using,
[1344.68 → 1345.62] uh,
[1345.62 → 1347.94] using American technology in order to,
[1348.24 → 1348.54] well,
[1348.64 → 1351.72] catch up to what the Americans were able to do with respect to,
[1351.72 → 1352.36] um,
[1352.86 → 1355.18] uh,
[1355.18 → 1356.70] with respect to super computing.
[1356.70 → 1357.06] And,
[1357.18 → 1357.36] I mean,
[1357.42 → 1357.82] I see,
[1357.90 → 1361.50] I don't even know if this is going to be used in a super computing context,
[1361.50 → 1362.62] to be very clear,
[1362.62 → 1370.12] because all we really know is that the deal would involve licensing x86 processor technology,
[1370.38 → 1377.96] and IP related to building x86 architecture chips and SOCS.
[1379.12 → 1379.44] So,
[1379.98 → 1382.78] I've got people saying AMD is American since when?
[1382.94 → 1383.12] Okay,
[1383.38 → 1383.54] so,
[1383.68 → 1384.44] so there is,
[1385.10 → 1385.20] they,
[1385.56 → 1389.28] a significant amount of their company is owned by overseas investment.
[1389.44 → 1390.22] That is true,
[1390.22 → 1394.66] but they are American in the sense that their headquarters is in America,
[1394.94 → 1395.42] I guess.
[1396.34 → 1396.76] Um,
[1397.80 → 1398.30] yeah,
[1398.64 → 1399.74] I guess.
[1400.42 → 1400.54] Do,
[1400.62 → 1400.72] do,
[1400.72 → 1400.90] do.
[1402.10 → 1402.62] Um,
[1403.50 → 1407.80] this is interesting.
[1408.04 → 1408.28] So,
[1408.46 → 1409.04] I actually,
[1409.18 → 1409.96] I don't have a
[1409.96 → 1412.36] I don't have a source link for this or anything like that,
[1412.46 → 1417.08] but AMD will not be seeding Fire Pro,
[1417.72 → 1418.08] or sorry,
[1418.26 → 1418.36] it's,
[1418.76 → 1419.08] dang it,
[1419.12 → 1419.40] Colton,
[1419.40 → 1420.46] uh,
[1420.46 → 1426.58] so they will not be seeding their upcoming Dual Hawaii card.
[1427.88 → 1428.24] Uh,
[1428.24 → 1430.32] I forget what they're even calling it.
[1430.44 → 1432.74] I think it's like Radeon Duo Pro,
[1432.88 → 1433.50] or Pro Duo,
[1433.64 → 1434.20] there we go.
[1434.56 → 1434.76] So,
[1434.84 → 1439.66] the Radeon Pro Duo will not be seeded to conventional gaming press.
[1440.26 → 1440.58] Uh,
[1440.58 → 1443.28] I'll go ahead and share you guys on the
[1443.34 → 1443.68] uh,
[1444.12 → 1449.38] sort of the announcement for their super computing performance to VR.
[1449.38 → 1449.82] Um,
[1449.82 → 1449.88] so,
[1449.88 → 1454.84] what I was pretty much told is that this,
[1454.84 → 1456.80] this product,
[1456.80 → 1459.54] and I can't say anything about it for a couple of reasons.
[1459.98 → 1460.26] Uh,
[1460.26 → 1460.90] number one,
[1461.02 → 1464.96] if I want to get a deck about it prior to the embargo,
[1464.96 → 1467.02] so I can prepare any content that I have,
[1467.56 → 1467.94] uh,
[1467.94 → 1470.36] that I will be able to release without an actual card,
[1470.36 → 1471.22] um,
[1471.22 → 1473.12] I do have to agree to the NDA.
[1473.36 → 1473.98] And number two,
[1474.46 → 1476.90] because I haven't received any of the deck materials yet,
[1477.00 → 1477.22] so,
[1477.54 → 1480.34] all I know is going off of rumours.
[1480.54 → 1480.76] So,
[1480.82 → 1482.82] it's supposed to be Dual Hawaii chips,
[1483.32 → 1483.68] um,
[1483.68 → 1486.44] it sounds like it's going to be Dual 4 gig.
[1487.12 → 1487.56] Um,
[1487.88 → 1488.48] it'll be,
[1488.60 → 1488.98] it'll be,
[1489.10 → 1489.28] uh,
[1489.48 → 1489.78] it's,
[1489.84 → 1489.98] oh,
[1490.06 → 1490.28] okay,
[1490.34 → 1491.40] this is off of AMD's site.
[1491.54 → 1491.80] So,
[1492.36 → 1496.92] anticipated selling price of $1,500 US.
[1496.92 → 1498.28] And,
[1498.28 → 1499.84] basically,
[1500.28 → 1503.58] the reasoning that was given to me was,
[1504.02 → 1505.16] well,
[1505.56 → 1507.02] it's not really,
[1508.18 → 1508.36] uh,
[1508.36 → 1508.56] sorry,
[1508.64 → 1509.78] did I say Dual Hawaii?
[1510.06 → 1510.40] Sorry,
[1510.56 → 1511.08] Dual Fiji.
[1511.26 → 1511.64] Dual Fiji.
[1511.76 → 1511.84] So,
[1511.96 → 1513.62] it's effectively two,
[1514.12 → 1514.56] um,
[1515.60 → 1516.28] it's effectively,
[1516.28 → 1516.62] like,
[1516.74 → 1518.78] two R9,
[1520.86 → 1525.48] like,
[1525.48 → 1526.90] R9 Fury,
[1527.14 → 1528.12] slash Fury X,
[1528.22 → 1529.26] kind of class GPUs.
[1529.28 → 1529.54] That's,
[1529.58 → 1530.38] that's what we can,
[1530.44 → 1532.50] that's what we can glean from the details we have so far.
[1532.82 → 1533.14] Sorry,
[1533.22 → 1534.62] I can't believe I said Dual Hawaii's.
[1534.62 → 1535.40] I've been running around,
[1535.50 → 1535.86] trying to,
[1535.90 → 1538.12] trying to get our internet back up and running over here.
[1538.74 → 1539.18] Um,
[1542.04 → 1542.56] and,
[1542.68 → 1543.00] sorry,
[1543.12 → 1544.46] I'm struggling a little bit,
[1544.52 → 1546.32] because I'm not sure
[1546.32 → 1549.38] how much of what they told me
[1549.38 → 1551.92] is stuff that is on this page I'm looking at,
[1551.94 → 1552.82] and how much of it
[1552.82 → 1553.90] is
[1553.90 → 1555.28] stuff that's going to be
[1555.28 → 1555.90] in the deck
[1555.90 → 1557.10] that's going to be NDA'd.
[1557.20 → 1557.36] So,
[1557.54 → 1558.30] so this is good.
[1559.96 → 1561.98] It offers a complete solution
[1561.98 → 1563.34] aimed at all aspects
[1563.34 → 1565.64] of the VR developer lifestyle.
[1567.10 → 1568.78] Developing content more rapidly
[1568.78 → 1570.26] for killer VR experiences
[1570.26 → 1570.96] while at work,
[1571.12 → 1572.32] and playing the latest
[1572.32 → 1573.54] DirectX 12 experiences
[1573.54 → 1574.74] at maximum fidelity
[1574.74 → 1575.90] while off work.
[1576.24 → 1576.66] So,
[1576.72 → 1577.46] it's no secret
[1577.46 → 1579.12] that dual GPU support
[1579.12 → 1580.92] on recent generation games
[1580.92 → 1583.26] has not been
[1583.26 → 1586.40] what it was
[1586.40 → 1587.20] even before.
[1587.48 → 1587.50] And,
[1587.58 → 1588.10] by the way,
[1588.14 → 1588.30] guys,
[1588.34 → 1589.08] we are live.
[1589.84 → 1590.24] Um,
[1590.74 → 1591.74] something about time zones,
[1591.82 → 1592.66] not time zones.
[1592.66 → 1593.36] It is,
[1593.36 → 1594.20] it is 537
[1594.20 → 1595.28] and we are live.
[1595.80 → 1596.18] Um,
[1596.62 → 1599.20] so,
[1599.54 → 1599.88] even,
[1600.14 → 1601.24] even a year,
[1601.36 → 1601.86] two years,
[1601.92 → 1602.80] or even three years ago,
[1602.88 → 1603.82] dual GPU support
[1603.82 → 1604.48] wasn't perfect.
[1604.48 → 1605.12] A lot of the time
[1605.12 → 1606.00] it required patches
[1606.00 → 1606.78] from NVIDIA
[1606.78 → 1608.52] or AMD
[1608.52 → 1609.96] or previously ATI
[1609.96 → 1611.48] in order to function.
[1611.96 → 1612.10] Uh,
[1612.10 → 1612.32] but,
[1612.56 → 1614.04] it's actually gotten worse
[1614.04 → 1614.88] and worse
[1614.88 → 1615.82] and worse
[1615.82 → 1618.46] as time has gone on.
[1618.52 → 1618.82] In fact,
[1618.92 → 1619.66] some games
[1619.66 → 1620.50] over the last little while,
[1620.58 → 1621.32] even games
[1621.32 → 1621.88] that have been,
[1622.28 → 1622.64] you know,
[1622.90 → 1623.30] you know,
[1623.34 → 1624.28] the ones where there's like
[1624.28 → 1625.10] the NVIDIA logo
[1625.10 → 1626.10] or the AMD logo
[1626.10 → 1627.16] that pops up
[1627.16 → 1627.60] at the beginning
[1627.60 → 1627.86] with,
[1627.94 → 1628.04] you know,
[1628.10 → 1629.14] Game Works technology
[1629.14 → 1629.72] or whatever else
[1629.72 → 1630.68] that just flat out
[1630.68 → 1631.32] the developers going,
[1631.42 → 1631.56] yep,
[1631.62 → 1631.76] yep,
[1631.82 → 1632.34] SLI,
[1632.98 → 1633.24] uh,
[1633.24 → 1633.70] Crossfire,
[1633.70 → 1634.62] forget it,
[1635.04 → 1635.58] forget it,
[1635.72 → 1636.22] we're just,
[1636.46 → 1636.64] yeah,
[1636.76 → 1637.58] it just doesn't matter.
[1637.70 → 1637.84] It's,
[1637.88 → 1638.92] it's too small
[1638.92 → 1640.18] of a portion of customers.
[1640.38 → 1640.54] So,
[1641.20 → 1642.50] for that reason,
[1642.78 → 1643.50] the Pro Duo
[1643.50 → 1645.62] was not realistically
[1645.62 → 1646.92] going to get
[1646.92 → 1648.26] very good reviews
[1648.26 → 1649.32] from the gaming press
[1649.32 → 1650.06] because it frankly
[1650.06 → 1650.76] just doesn't make
[1650.76 → 1651.34] a ton of sense
[1651.34 → 1652.16] as a gaming card.
[1652.58 → 1653.38] It's only got
[1653.38 → 1654.06] four gigs
[1654.06 → 1656.02] of effective video memory
[1656.02 → 1656.58] because it's
[1656.58 → 1657.76] four gigs per GPU.
[1657.90 → 1658.86] That doesn't add up
[1658.86 → 1659.58] to eight gigs.
[1659.82 → 1661.04] That means four gigs.
[1661.64 → 1661.96] Um,
[1662.82 → 1663.68] it's too,
[1664.60 → 1665.66] presumably fairly
[1665.66 → 1667.10] power-hungry chips
[1667.10 → 1668.62] that perform
[1668.62 → 1669.94] okay,
[1670.38 → 1671.56] but not well enough
[1671.56 → 1672.68] to charge $1,500
[1672.68 → 1674.04] for two of them.
[1674.40 → 1674.82] And,
[1674.90 → 1675.02] like,
[1675.04 → 1676.16] we've run into this before,
[1676.20 → 1676.74] but typically
[1676.74 → 1678.00] the dual GPU solution
[1678.00 → 1678.70] has been closer
[1678.70 → 1680.30] to the $1,000 range
[1680.30 → 1680.98] and not so close
[1680.98 → 1682.42] to the $1,500 range
[1682.42 → 1683.52] where you can't
[1683.52 → 1684.38] just kind of go,
[1684.86 → 1685.26] okay,
[1685.48 → 1685.70] you know,
[1685.76 → 1686.20] like here,
[1686.30 → 1687.28] this is a fun experiment.
[1687.40 → 1688.42] Let's just fire up
[1688.42 → 1688.98] New egg,
[1689.56 → 1691.62] shop AMD Radeon Fury X.
[1691.62 → 1692.06] Uh,
[1692.06 → 1693.48] no,
[1693.68 → 1694.78] Newegg.com is fine.
[1695.64 → 1695.78] Oh,
[1695.84 → 1696.14] I don't,
[1696.24 → 1696.56] wow,
[1696.90 → 1697.18] wow,
[1697.26 → 1698.80] the world's most boring sale.
[1699.84 → 1699.96] What?
[1700.60 → 1701.66] Monitors and printers.
[1702.38 → 1703.06] Unless you're shopping
[1703.06 → 1703.58] for a monitor
[1703.58 → 1703.98] or a printer,
[1704.26 → 1704.78] in which case,
[1705.26 → 1706.22] what just happened
[1706.22 → 1707.18] to my search result?
[1709.08 → 1709.56] Oh,
[1710.22 → 1711.26] New egg.
[1712.26 → 1712.74] Anyway,
[1713.00 → 1713.32] oh,
[1713.42 → 1713.66] okay,
[1713.66 → 1713.94] okay,
[1714.06 → 1714.28] so,
[1714.64 → 1715.54] about $629.
[1715.96 → 1716.14] So,
[1716.70 → 1717.34] you're paying
[1717.34 → 1718.78] this huge premium
[1718.78 → 1720.12] to have a card
[1720.12 → 1721.42] that does save you
[1721.42 → 1722.46] on PCI Express.
[1722.54 → 1722.84] Apparently,
[1722.96 → 1724.18] 295X2 launched
[1724.18 → 1724.60] at $1,500.
[1724.96 → 1725.10] Yeah,
[1725.40 → 1726.10] that's a good point,
[1726.32 → 1727.30] but how many units
[1727.30 → 1728.78] did 295X2 sell?
[1730.32 → 1730.58] Like,
[1730.92 → 1731.64] this is a
[1731.66 → 1732.58] this is a
[1732.62 → 1733.78] this is a dinosaur.
[1733.98 → 1734.86] The Radeon Pro Duo
[1734.86 → 1735.84] in a gaming sense
[1735.84 → 1736.54] is a dinosaur
[1736.54 → 1737.66] because you can get
[1737.66 → 1738.72] two Fury X's
[1738.72 → 1740.66] for $1,300
[1740.66 → 1742.54] after taxes
[1742.54 → 1743.14] kind of thing.
[1743.82 → 1744.14] So,
[1744.32 → 1745.30] unless you desperately
[1745.30 → 1746.54] need those two slots,
[1747.60 → 1748.88] what are you even,
[1749.02 → 1749.86] what are you even doing?
[1750.00 → 1750.28] And,
[1750.38 → 1750.90] if you desperately
[1750.90 → 1751.98] need those two slots,
[1752.60 → 1753.12] why don't you just
[1753.12 → 1753.76] water cool,
[1753.96 → 1754.86] water cool a couple
[1754.86 → 1756.64] of Fury X's?
[1756.94 → 1757.20] I mean,
[1757.24 → 1758.04] that actually pays
[1758.04 → 1759.06] for your water blocks
[1759.06 → 1760.30] right there.
[1760.84 → 1761.24] So,
[1761.56 → 1764.84] yeah,
[1765.00 → 1766.34] it's going to be power hungry,
[1766.60 → 1767.28] it's going to be
[1767.28 → 1768.34] super expensive.
[1768.80 → 1769.20] So,
[1769.48 → 1769.88] basically,
[1770.14 → 1770.68] they're kind of going,
[1770.76 → 1770.96] okay,
[1771.04 → 1771.22] yeah,
[1771.22 → 1772.08] it's for developers.
[1773.10 → 1773.46] And I,
[1773.66 → 1774.74] I don't really,
[1774.84 → 1775.20] I don't really,
[1775.32 → 1776.28] I guess what I don't
[1776.28 → 1777.32] really get at this point,
[1777.58 → 1778.40] I understand why
[1778.40 → 1779.10] they're not ceding it
[1779.10 → 1779.54] to reviewers
[1779.54 → 1780.64] because it wouldn't
[1780.64 → 1781.28] have gotten a positive
[1781.28 → 1782.06] review from us.
[1782.30 → 1783.16] It wouldn't have gotten
[1783.16 → 1783.86] a positive review
[1783.86 → 1784.72] from probably anyone.
[1784.82 → 1785.24] They'd say,
[1785.72 → 1785.96] you know,
[1786.02 → 1786.82] it's always that
[1786.82 → 1787.80] sugar-coated conclusion,
[1787.92 → 1788.06] right?
[1788.56 → 1789.94] This is the ultimate
[1789.94 → 1790.92] graphics card
[1790.92 → 1793.48] for AMD enthusiasts
[1793.48 → 1795.82] who want
[1795.82 → 1797.78] the highest performance
[1797.78 → 1799.74] single AMD card.
[1799.74 → 1801.36] so you go like,
[1801.48 → 1801.92] you go like,
[1802.00 → 1804.82] this sliver of this
[1804.82 → 1806.16] slice of the available
[1806.16 → 1806.96] market of people
[1806.96 → 1807.48] who are interested
[1807.48 → 1808.32] in graphics cards
[1808.32 → 1809.94] and that is pretty much
[1809.94 → 1811.32] all that is left
[1811.32 → 1812.30] for someone who,
[1812.86 → 1813.94] for gaming purposes,
[1813.94 → 1814.58] might be interested
[1814.58 → 1815.36] in a Radeon Pro Duo.
[1815.36 → 1816.38] I'll be interested
[1816.38 → 1817.94] to see what they
[1817.94 → 1818.66] can come up with
[1818.66 → 1820.30] in terms of value
[1820.30 → 1822.20] adds for the Pro Duo
[1822.20 → 1823.16] that would make it
[1823.16 → 1824.04] make sense for developers,
[1824.30 → 1825.88] but I just have
[1825.88 → 1827.48] a hard time imagining
[1827.48 → 1828.44] what would make it
[1828.44 → 1829.32] better for developers
[1829.32 → 1830.48] than just picking up
[1830.48 → 1831.28] a couple of Furies
[1831.28 → 1832.62] or a couple of Fury XS.
[1834.16 → 1835.88] Alpha 17x in the chat,
[1836.00 → 1837.42] this is a perfect,
[1837.46 → 1838.26] this is a perfect point.
[1838.36 → 1838.98] I'm a developer.
[1839.48 → 1840.76] I use what the end user
[1840.76 → 1841.38] would be using
[1841.38 → 1842.50] so I know what the crap
[1842.50 → 1843.34] I'm something
[1843.34 → 1844.42] Twitch chat moves too fast.
[1844.42 → 1846.92] I mean, that is a really,
[1847.10 → 1848.34] really great point.
[1850.00 → 1850.94] And depending on
[1850.94 → 1851.84] what kind of development
[1851.84 → 1852.30] you're doing,
[1852.40 → 1853.18] like if you're working
[1853.18 → 1854.74] on digital assets,
[1855.08 → 1856.00] you might be interested
[1856.00 → 1857.36] in something like a Fire Pro
[1857.36 → 1859.00] or something like a Squadron card,
[1859.38 → 1860.32] but in those cases,
[1860.32 → 1862.02] you'd want a lot more
[1862.02 → 1865.00] than four gigs of VRAM per GPU.
[1865.72 → 1868.32] So I still don't understand
[1868.32 → 1870.84] why they're even releasing this card.
[1870.92 → 1871.70] That's the question.
[1871.96 → 1873.10] I understand why they
[1873.10 → 1874.32] don't want people to review it.
[1874.78 → 1875.94] I don't understand
[1875.94 → 1877.42] why they even kept it
[1877.42 → 1877.84] in development
[1877.84 → 1878.66] after all this time
[1878.66 → 1879.40] because it's like,
[1879.44 → 1880.08] it's no secret
[1880.08 → 1881.54] that VR and DirectX 12
[1881.54 → 1882.20] is where we're headed
[1882.20 → 1883.94] and dual GPU,
[1884.68 → 1885.78] something of a dinosaur
[1885.78 → 1886.36] at this point.
[1886.46 → 1886.60] I mean,
[1886.68 → 1888.52] NVIDIA didn't even bother.
[1889.46 → 1889.94] Do you think,
[1890.00 → 1891.00] do you think NVIDIA
[1891.00 → 1892.02] couldn't have built
[1892.02 → 1894.72] a dual 980 card?
[1895.40 → 1896.08] Come on.
[1897.02 → 1898.04] They totally could have done it.
[1898.10 → 1898.92] You think they couldn't have built
[1898.92 → 1900.12] a dual 980 card
[1900.12 → 1901.04] with eight gigs of RAM
[1901.04 → 1901.70] per GPU?
[1902.20 → 1902.38] Like,
[1902.74 → 1903.40] that.
[1904.12 → 1905.88] They managed to build an MXM.
[1906.24 → 1907.10] They managed to put
[1907.10 → 1908.34] a 980 in a laptop.
[1909.02 → 1910.54] The power efficiency was there.
[1910.80 → 1912.58] The thermal output was there.
[1912.92 → 1913.58] They were just like,
[1914.40 → 1914.66] eh,
[1915.06 → 1916.34] why bother?
[1916.34 → 1916.54] I mean,
[1916.60 → 1918.46] Titan Z was such a flop.
[1918.84 → 1919.06] I mean,
[1919.10 → 1920.78] the price that presumably
[1920.78 → 1921.94] it had to be
[1921.94 → 1923.36] in order to build it
[1923.36 → 1924.28] because they had,
[1924.34 → 1925.32] they had lots of time
[1925.32 → 1926.32] to drop the price on it
[1926.32 → 1926.70] and just go,
[1926.82 → 1926.96] okay,
[1927.02 → 1927.14] yeah,
[1927.14 → 1928.40] we'll just take less margin on it
[1928.40 → 1930.02] and sell some more units.
[1930.68 → 1931.04] Like,
[1931.08 → 1932.12] the price it must have cost
[1932.12 → 1932.54] to make it
[1932.54 → 1933.44] just made it
[1933.44 → 1934.44] untenable.
[1934.44 → 1935.90] So,
[1936.48 → 1938.82] yeah,
[1939.06 → 1939.32] I mean,
[1939.38 → 1939.84] to me,
[1939.94 → 1940.82] this is kind of like
[1940.82 → 1941.78] the final
[1941.78 → 1943.60] swan song
[1943.60 → 1945.62] for dual GPUs
[1945.62 → 1946.58] on one card
[1946.58 → 1947.50] outside,
[1947.76 → 1948.52] outside,
[1948.56 → 1948.74] you know,
[1948.86 → 1949.38] professional,
[1949.62 → 1949.80] like,
[1949.90 → 1950.42] scientific,
[1951.00 → 1951.42] like,
[1951.50 → 1952.18] high-performance
[1952.18 → 1953.36] computing-based cards
[1953.36 → 1954.04] that you might expect
[1954.04 → 1954.84] to find in a
[1955.06 → 1955.44] in a
[1955.48 → 1955.64] like,
[1955.68 → 1957.56] a huge server farm
[1957.56 → 1957.92] somewhere.
[1957.92 → 1958.38] So,
[1959.58 → 1960.70] hopefully,
[1961.18 → 1962.40] Polaris is the answer
[1962.40 → 1963.26] and,
[1963.30 → 1964.46] and we can all
[1964.46 → 1965.86] look forward to that.
[1965.96 → 1966.10] Hey,
[1966.18 → 1966.50] Brandon,
[1966.70 → 1967.96] can you help me
[1967.96 → 1968.24] with something
[1968.24 → 1968.72] for a minute
[1968.72 → 1969.06] very,
[1969.14 → 1969.58] very quickly
[1969.58 → 1970.60] by running?
[1972.64 → 1973.36] Thank you.
[1974.28 → 1975.48] Can you find out
[1975.48 → 1976.44] what this is
[1976.44 → 1976.98] and direct it
[1976.98 → 1977.88] to the appropriate place?
[1977.94 → 1978.50] It may be something
[1978.50 → 1979.10] quite important.
[1980.00 → 1980.88] All right.
[1983.18 → 1983.66] So,
[1983.72 → 1984.30] this is a cool
[1984.30 → 1985.12] piece of technology.
[1985.26 → 1986.08] The original poster
[1986.08 → 1986.74] here is
[1986.74 → 1987.76] Ah Ming.
[1987.92 → 1989.04] And the original article
[1989.04 → 1989.90] here is from The Verge.
[1990.32 → 1990.78] This
[1990.78 → 1992.38] is a cool way
[1992.38 → 1993.76] to use technology.
[1994.30 → 1995.04] This is a
[1995.04 → 1995.58] mosquito
[1995.58 → 1996.86] killer
[1996.86 → 1998.30] billboard
[1998.30 → 2000.30] that is
[2000.30 → 2001.06] targeting
[2001.06 → 2001.94] mosquitoes
[2001.94 → 2002.50] carrying
[2002.50 → 2003.94] the Zika virus
[2003.94 → 2004.56] in Brazil.
[2005.02 → 2005.24] Now,
[2005.32 → 2006.38] if you have been,
[2006.50 → 2007.10] if you've been
[2007.10 → 2007.70] watching
[2007.70 → 2009.56] the development
[2009.56 → 2010.26] of Zika
[2010.26 → 2010.98] in the news,
[2011.18 → 2012.18] you're probably
[2012.18 → 2013.14] aware
[2013.14 → 2013.82] that it is
[2013.82 → 2015.12] a huge concern,
[2015.70 → 2017.04] not necessarily
[2017.04 → 2019.00] for perfectly
[2019.00 → 2020.20] healthy people,
[2020.42 → 2021.28] but especially
[2021.28 → 2022.22] if you're pregnant,
[2022.88 → 2023.22] Zika
[2023.22 → 2023.96] could be
[2023.96 → 2024.92] a major problem
[2024.92 → 2025.96] because it can cause,
[2026.26 → 2027.08] I believe it's,
[2027.30 → 2028.98] it's either macro
[2028.98 → 2029.36] or micro.
[2029.48 → 2029.90] I'm going to go
[2029.90 → 2031.02] with microcephaly,
[2031.14 → 2031.78] which is a condition
[2031.78 → 2032.68] where your brain,
[2033.10 → 2033.70] depending on whether
[2033.70 → 2034.56] it's macro or micro,
[2034.76 → 2035.56] I think it's micro,
[2035.82 → 2037.00] where your head
[2037.00 → 2038.32] is tiny,
[2038.38 → 2038.88] which causes
[2038.88 → 2040.18] all kinds
[2040.18 → 2040.76] of developmental
[2040.76 → 2041.50] problems.
[2042.14 → 2042.80] So what the
[2042.90 → 2043.38] what the bill,
[2043.56 → 2044.18] so Zika
[2044.18 → 2045.56] hasn't,
[2045.82 → 2047.06] has been a problem
[2047.06 → 2050.36] in warmer climate areas,
[2050.48 → 2051.04] jungle areas,
[2051.04 → 2051.62] because it's spread
[2051.62 → 2052.24] by mosquitoes.
[2052.36 → 2052.74] It's actually
[2052.74 → 2053.62] transmitted sexually
[2053.62 → 2054.06] as well,
[2054.18 → 2055.06] but it has been
[2055.06 → 2056.60] a huge problem
[2056.60 → 2057.92] in Brazil.
[2058.50 → 2060.70] So this technology
[2060.70 → 2063.24] is apparently
[2063.24 → 2065.50] using this,
[2065.50 → 2067.82] like carbon dioxide
[2067.82 → 2069.70] and lactic acid solution
[2069.70 → 2070.92] to mimic
[2070.92 → 2072.10] human breathing
[2072.10 → 2072.96] and sweat
[2072.96 → 2074.40] and then
[2074.40 → 2075.68] zapping
[2075.68 → 2076.78] the bugs,
[2077.10 → 2077.60] killing them.
[2078.58 → 2079.56] So it can
[2079.56 → 2080.48] actually lure
[2080.48 → 2081.78] insects within a radius
[2081.78 → 2082.26] of up to
[2082.26 → 2083.26] two and a half
[2083.26 → 2083.70] kilometres.
[2083.86 → 2084.30] This is something
[2084.30 → 2085.08] I've always wondered
[2085.08 → 2085.38] about.
[2085.72 → 2086.06] Like,
[2086.78 → 2087.56] how do mosquitoes
[2087.56 → 2088.16] find us?
[2088.26 → 2088.80] So there you go.
[2088.88 → 2089.82] Apparently it's by smell.
[2090.04 → 2090.24] Now,
[2090.40 → 2090.90] to be clear,
[2091.00 → 2091.88] always wondered about
[2091.88 → 2093.12] doesn't mean like
[2093.12 → 2094.10] it was a burning desire
[2094.10 → 2094.68] because I could have
[2094.68 → 2095.32] just googled it.
[2095.50 → 2096.26] It's just something
[2096.26 → 2097.46] that kind of like,
[2097.64 → 2097.90] I'd be like,
[2097.96 → 2098.18] oh,
[2098.68 → 2099.98] how do they find me?
[2100.66 → 2101.60] So it can lure
[2101.60 → 2102.66] insects within a radius
[2102.66 → 2103.38] of two and a half
[2103.38 → 2103.86] kilometres
[2103.86 → 2104.66] and
[2104.66 → 2110.66] let's see
[2110.66 → 2113.30] and
[2113.30 → 2114.94] kill them.
[2115.18 → 2115.38] But
[2115.38 → 2117.32] there are some
[2117.32 → 2118.32] concerns that have
[2118.32 → 2118.78] been raised.
[2118.96 → 2119.50] So two of these
[2119.50 → 2120.18] billboards have been
[2120.18 → 2121.32] installed in Rio de Janeiro
[2121.32 → 2122.46] and
[2122.46 → 2123.82] they're using
[2123.82 → 2124.94] technical specifications
[2124.94 → 2125.80] that have actually
[2125.80 → 2126.70] published for free
[2126.70 → 2127.16] online.
[2127.90 → 2128.60] But Chris Jackson,
[2128.72 → 2129.22] Jackson,
[2129.40 → 2129.84] Jackson,
[2130.34 → 2130.74] Jackson,
[2130.86 → 2131.70] a pest control expert
[2131.70 → 2132.28] at the University
[2132.28 → 2133.00] of Southampton
[2133.00 → 2134.20] told the BBC
[2134.20 → 2135.14] that the billboard
[2135.14 → 2136.44] could inadvertently
[2136.44 → 2137.48] cause
[2137.48 → 2139.08] more people to be
[2139.08 → 2139.74] bitten depending
[2139.74 → 2140.54] on where it is
[2140.54 → 2141.04] placed.
[2141.80 → 2142.90] And just give me
[2142.90 → 2143.34] one second.
[2143.58 → 2143.90] Brandon,
[2144.00 → 2144.48] who did you give
[2144.48 → 2145.22] that phone to?
[2145.98 → 2146.34] Okay,
[2146.52 → 2147.28] can you bring him
[2147.28 → 2147.78] back here?
[2149.20 → 2149.98] Thank you.
[2156.06 → 2157.10] So I've actually
[2157.10 → 2158.40] got a pretty cool
[2158.40 → 2159.42] graphic for
[2159.42 → 2160.48] how it works here.
[2160.52 → 2161.04] I'm just going to go
[2161.04 → 2161.74] ahead and pull this
[2161.74 → 2162.40] up on the screen.
[2163.84 → 2165.40] So a device
[2165.40 → 2166.70] spreads in the air
[2166.70 → 2167.48] in a solution
[2167.48 → 2168.62] containing the
[2168.62 → 2170.46] lactic acid and CO2.
[2172.18 → 2172.70] Okay.
[2173.38 → 2174.26] So it spreads in the air
[2174.26 → 2174.82] this solution.
[2175.28 → 2175.72] The combination
[2175.72 → 2176.86] of the two substances
[2176.86 → 2178.24] attracts mosquitoes
[2178.24 → 2179.14] at this claim
[2179.14 → 2179.78] a distance of up
[2179.78 → 2180.42] to four kilometres.
[2181.16 → 2181.94] Fluorescent lights
[2181.94 → 2183.14] enhance this attraction
[2183.14 → 2184.34] facilitating the
[2184.34 → 2185.14] approximation,
[2185.78 → 2186.70] I think they mean
[2186.70 → 2187.76] approach of the mosquito.
[2188.38 → 2189.44] And then as
[2189.44 → 2191.96] the Andes flies
[2191.96 → 2193.00] on average
[2193.00 → 2194.00] four feet
[2194.00 → 2194.88] above the ground,
[2195.34 → 2196.28] the catch mechanism
[2196.28 → 2197.66] was designed
[2197.66 → 2198.36] to be there.
[2198.48 → 2199.08] It draws the mosquito
[2199.08 → 2199.80] into the panel
[2199.80 → 2201.40] and after being stuck
[2201.40 → 2202.22] the mosquito dies
[2202.22 → 2202.74] dehydrated.
[2202.84 → 2203.70] So it doesn't
[2203.70 → 2204.46] zap them
[2204.46 → 2205.00] in the sense
[2205.00 → 2205.34] that it,
[2205.58 → 2207.32] like those awesome
[2207.32 → 2208.76] paddle bug zapper
[2208.76 → 2209.26] things,
[2209.86 → 2212.12] but it does
[2212.12 → 2212.70] kill them
[2212.70 → 2213.26] eventually,
[2213.56 → 2214.10] which I guess
[2214.10 → 2215.64] is all we can
[2215.64 → 2216.66] really ask.
[2217.98 → 2218.74] Hey, Brandon,
[2218.82 → 2219.36] where is he?
[2220.14 → 2220.58] Okay.
[2221.26 → 2221.70] Did you tell him
[2221.70 → 2222.20] to move quickly?
[2224.80 → 2225.98] I can't hold on.
[2226.08 → 2226.56] I'm streaming
[2226.56 → 2227.34] from that phone.
[2227.66 → 2228.46] I'm dropping frames.
[2228.58 → 2229.14] He needs to get
[2229.14 → 2229.92] over here right away.
[2230.52 → 2231.18] Thank you.
[2231.32 → 2231.64] Sorry.
[2233.70 → 2236.74] All right.
[2236.92 → 2238.00] So this was
[2238.00 → 2238.98] originally posted
[2238.98 → 2242.70] by Yam Yuki
[2242.70 → 2243.64] Sensei.
[2244.64 → 2246.00] And this is
[2246.00 → 2246.58] pretty much
[2246.58 → 2248.16] the worst news
[2248.16 → 2249.16] ever.
[2251.66 → 2252.74] Le Eco,
[2253.46 → 2255.00] who formerly
[2255.00 → 2255.84] went by the name
[2255.84 → 2256.88] of Le TV,
[2257.24 → 2257.88] Le TV,
[2258.46 → 2259.40] revealed their
[2259.40 → 2260.88] Le 2 range
[2260.88 → 2261.58] of smartphones,
[2262.12 → 2263.32] none of which
[2263.32 → 2265.76] have a 3.5mm jack.
[2266.32 → 2266.98] So instead,
[2267.20 → 2267.90] the phone supports
[2267.90 → 2269.16] USB Type-C digital
[2269.16 → 2269.86] headphones through
[2269.86 → 2270.66] the charging port.
[2271.06 → 2272.02] They also launched
[2272.02 → 2273.70] a USB-C earphone skew
[2273.70 → 2275.78] and a USB-C headphone
[2275.78 → 2277.52] skew to accompany it.
[2277.74 → 2278.62] So let's have a look
[2278.62 → 2279.60] at the original article
[2279.60 → 2281.00] over on Android
[2281.00 → 2281.46] Authority,
[2281.60 → 2283.18] which I would love
[2283.18 → 2284.16] to click on,
[2284.16 → 2285.62] but Google Talks
[2285.62 → 2286.14] is being
[2286.14 → 2287.18] such a deep
[2287.18 → 2287.52] right now
[2287.52 → 2287.94] and making it
[2287.94 → 2288.28] hard for me
[2288.28 → 2288.74] to click stuff.
[2289.20 → 2289.74] There we go.
[2290.66 → 2291.70] So after all
[2291.70 → 2292.36] the rumours
[2292.36 → 2294.10] about Apple
[2294.10 → 2295.08] launching a phone
[2295.08 → 2296.50] with no headphone jack,
[2297.10 → 2298.16] it turns out
[2298.16 → 2300.40] that an Android
[2300.40 → 2301.02] phone maker
[2301.02 → 2302.08] is going to be
[2302.08 → 2302.94] the first one.
[2304.00 → 2304.68] I really,
[2304.80 → 2305.66] I get a kick
[2305.66 → 2306.02] out of,
[2306.22 → 2307.26] what are they,
[2307.42 → 2307.82] why?
[2308.82 → 2309.30] Why?
[2309.48 → 2310.58] What is the point?
[2310.58 → 2311.66] Like,
[2313.88 → 2314.66] I get that
[2314.66 → 2315.20] they're kind of going,
[2315.34 → 2315.76] oh yeah,
[2315.88 → 2316.04] well,
[2316.12 → 2316.30] you know,
[2316.36 → 2316.66] we're going to
[2316.66 → 2317.70] build this ecosystem
[2317.70 → 2319.48] with like earphones
[2319.48 → 2320.02] and headphones
[2320.02 → 2320.64] that work with it,
[2320.68 → 2321.12] but it's like
[2321.12 → 2322.34] such a hassle.
[2323.00 → 2323.22] Like,
[2323.26 → 2323.52] what if,
[2323.62 → 2323.96] I don't know,
[2324.02 → 2324.72] say for example,
[2324.72 → 2325.86] you were sitting down
[2325.86 → 2326.96] to stream the WAN show
[2326.96 → 2327.56] and you wanted to
[2327.56 → 2328.46] quickly plug your
[2328.46 → 2329.94] headphones that you
[2329.94 → 2330.82] normally use with
[2330.82 → 2331.44] your phone
[2331.44 → 2332.38] into your streaming
[2332.38 → 2333.32] computer so you can
[2333.32 → 2334.18] check audio levels.
[2334.30 → 2334.36] It's,
[2334.48 → 2335.28] oh right,
[2335.46 → 2335.70] oh,
[2336.28 → 2336.82] bummer,
[2336.94 → 2338.20] it's USB Type-C.
[2338.32 → 2338.70] I guess
[2338.70 → 2340.32] it's just not going
[2340.32 → 2340.98] to work with anything
[2340.98 → 2341.72] and it's one thing
[2341.72 → 2342.74] if you were to release
[2342.74 → 2344.02] like some kind
[2344.02 → 2345.06] of a killer pair
[2345.06 → 2345.64] of headphones
[2345.64 → 2347.04] that rounds out
[2347.04 → 2347.72] the ecosystem
[2347.72 → 2348.50] and makes it
[2348.50 → 2349.64] make a ton of sense,
[2351.02 → 2354.36] but that's not,
[2355.08 → 2355.76] yeah,
[2355.86 → 2358.02] that's not going to help
[2358.02 → 2359.00] if you're just some
[2359.00 → 2361.12] random Android maker
[2361.12 → 2363.20] and your headphones
[2363.20 → 2364.28] and earphones,
[2364.60 → 2364.98] to be clear,
[2365.02 → 2365.62] I haven't heard them,
[2366.28 → 2367.90] but are probably terrible.
[2368.42 → 2369.46] Like probably just,
[2369.46 → 2371.06] just awful.
[2374.02 → 2374.96] Let's go ahead
[2374.96 → 2376.58] and see if we can find
[2376.58 → 2377.90] any pictures of the device.
[2378.06 → 2378.48] That would be,
[2378.60 → 2379.54] that would be super cool.
[2379.60 → 2380.58] I'm going to see if Pocket now
[2380.58 → 2382.14] has pictures up on their site,
[2383.20 → 2384.84] but yeah,
[2384.96 → 2385.20] I mean,
[2385.24 → 2386.50] there's really not much else
[2386.50 → 2386.88] to say.
[2386.98 → 2387.52] It's not,
[2387.62 → 2388.86] it's not a product
[2388.86 → 2389.64] that I would be,
[2389.96 → 2391.14] that I would be especially
[2391.14 → 2392.20] interested in
[2392.20 → 2393.44] one way or the other
[2393.44 → 2394.64] and unfortunately
[2394.64 → 2395.84] the Pocket now article
[2395.84 → 2397.14] is not loading
[2397.14 → 2397.98] for me at the moment,
[2397.98 → 2402.10] but yeah.
[2403.48 → 2404.48] Speaking of products
[2404.48 → 2405.26] that I'm not
[2405.26 → 2406.44] particularly interested in,
[2406.48 → 2407.46] this was originally posted
[2407.46 → 2409.14] by lots of unexplainable
[2409.14 → 2410.20] lag on the forum
[2410.20 → 2411.78] and the original article
[2411.78 → 2412.74] here is from
[2412.74 → 2414.12] macrumors.com,
[2414.32 → 2416.48] but Apple has updated,
[2417.38 → 2418.54] not the MacBook Air,
[2419.18 → 2420.14] not the product
[2420.14 → 2420.98] we were actually
[2420.98 → 2422.64] hoping that they would update,
[2422.78 → 2423.06] you know,
[2423.42 → 2424.76] one that has
[2424.76 → 2426.08] enough thinness,
[2426.08 → 2426.96] but maybe not quite
[2426.96 → 2427.86] as much thinness,
[2428.00 → 2428.68] but you know,
[2428.74 → 2429.86] good battery life,
[2430.00 → 2431.08] but maybe not as good
[2431.08 → 2431.56] battery life,
[2431.58 → 2432.58] but actually has ports
[2432.58 → 2432.84] on it.
[2432.84 → 2433.00] No,
[2433.42 → 2433.62] no,
[2433.68 → 2434.72] they didn't give the MacBook Air
[2434.72 → 2435.40] a retina display,
[2435.52 → 2436.74] so it really does look like
[2436.74 → 2437.54] the MacBook Air
[2437.54 → 2438.08] is a
[2438.08 → 2438.68] is a
[2438.68 → 2440.16] is a foregone conclusion
[2440.16 → 2440.70] at this point.
[2440.76 → 2441.28] I think it's a
[2441.28 → 2442.12] it's a done deal,
[2442.16 → 2442.66] it's gone.
[2442.88 → 2443.94] They have updated
[2443.94 → 2445.22] the 12-inch MacBook,
[2445.22 → 2446.22] MacBook Air.
[2446.22 → 2446.64] So now,
[2447.00 → 2449.90] it has Skylike CPU options,
[2450.34 → 2451.78] a longer battery life,
[2452.06 → 2453.94] and a rose gold option.
[2454.88 → 2455.12] So,
[2455.28 → 2456.48] 6th generation Skylike
[2456.48 → 2457.94] dual-core Core M processors
[2457.94 → 2459.26] up to 1.3 gigahertz,
[2459.46 → 2460.84] HD graphics 515,
[2460.96 → 2462.64] delivering 25% faster performance
[2462.64 → 2463.84] for all the games
[2463.84 → 2464.72] that you will presumably
[2464.72 → 2466.36] be playing on your MacBook,
[2466.86 → 2468.72] faster PCI Express-based storage,
[2468.80 → 2468.94] okay,
[2469.02 → 2470.08] I can't complain about that,
[2470.48 → 2471.32] an additional hour
[2471.32 → 2472.12] of battery life,
[2472.12 → 2475.22] faster 1866 megahertz memory.
[2476.14 → 2476.52] Oh,
[2476.64 → 2477.02] wow.
[2477.36 → 2477.66] Oh,
[2477.90 → 2478.50] and available
[2478.50 → 2479.60] of rose gold.
[2480.34 → 2480.58] Oh,
[2480.60 → 2481.76] in addition to the existing
[2481.76 → 2482.24] gold, silver,
[2482.30 → 2483.16] and space gray colours,
[2483.48 → 2484.36] unfortunately,
[2485.56 → 2485.98] Apple,
[2486.24 → 2487.22] in its infinite wisdom,
[2487.68 → 2488.74] did not feel
[2488.74 → 2489.66] it was necessary
[2489.66 → 2491.82] to add
[2491.82 → 2493.78] any ports to it.
[2495.50 → 2496.10] So,
[2496.92 → 2497.74] while I wasn't
[2497.74 → 2498.82] going to buy one anyway,
[2499.08 → 2500.78] I find that frustrating
[2500.78 → 2501.78] just because
[2501.78 → 2503.48] for the sake
[2503.48 → 2504.20] of the people
[2504.20 → 2505.24] buying this product,
[2505.76 → 2506.50] it would be,
[2506.50 → 2507.22] it would be
[2507.22 → 2508.32] considerate of Apple
[2508.32 → 2509.20] to,
[2509.36 → 2510.10] you know,
[2510.22 → 2511.34] care about them enough
[2511.34 → 2512.04] to give them
[2512.04 → 2512.94] some ports to use,
[2512.98 → 2513.18] you know,
[2513.22 → 2513.42] man?
[2513.64 → 2513.94] I just,
[2514.22 → 2515.06] I feel bad
[2515.06 → 2516.28] for the Apple people,
[2516.48 → 2517.72] Apple people buying this.
[2522.30 → 2522.78] Yeah.
[2523.98 → 2524.94] All right.
[2525.94 → 2526.74] Uh-oh.
[2527.46 → 2529.34] More car scandals.
[2529.34 → 2530.94] The OP here is
[2530.94 → 2532.30] Unlock 21.
[2533.02 → 2533.64] I'm going to see
[2533.64 → 2534.98] if refreshing Google Docs
[2534.98 → 2535.36] helps here.
[2535.46 → 2536.22] This is driving me crazy.
[2536.34 → 2537.20] It's doing that weird thing
[2537.20 → 2538.02] where there's like
[2538.02 → 2538.86] the line you're trying
[2538.86 → 2539.36] to click on
[2539.36 → 2540.18] and you put your mouse there
[2540.18 → 2540.94] and it clicks like
[2540.94 → 2541.72] an inch higher
[2541.72 → 2542.44] or something like that.
[2542.54 → 2542.88] Let's see if,
[2543.04 → 2543.18] yeah,
[2543.24 → 2543.66] there we go.
[2544.20 → 2545.04] Reloading the page helps.
[2545.04 → 2545.26] So,
[2545.40 → 2546.58] Euronews.com
[2546.58 → 2547.74] has the original article
[2547.74 → 2550.02] about Mitsubishi Motors
[2550.02 → 2551.02] faking
[2551.02 → 2554.04] their fuel economy tests.
[2554.22 → 2555.44] They actually got rated.
[2556.66 → 2556.94] Like,
[2557.52 → 2558.46] go figure.
[2559.26 → 2559.76] Rated.
[2560.42 → 2560.80] So,
[2560.86 → 2562.06] their shares plunged
[2562.06 → 2562.70] on Thursday
[2562.70 → 2563.88] following an admission
[2563.88 → 2565.26] that they faked
[2565.26 → 2566.22] fuel economy data
[2566.22 → 2567.36] on cars sold in Japan.
[2567.82 → 2568.74] They ended up losing
[2568.74 → 2570.08] 3.2 billion
[2570.08 → 2571.10] in market value
[2571.10 → 2571.82] over a mere
[2571.82 → 2572.76] three days.
[2573.18 → 2573.86] They apologized
[2573.86 → 2574.72] on Wednesday
[2574.72 → 2576.16] saying they will make
[2576.16 → 2577.44] a sincere effort
[2577.44 → 2578.50] to make amends
[2578.50 → 2579.34] to car owners
[2579.34 → 2580.58] and
[2580.58 → 2582.62] the transport minister
[2582.62 → 2583.16] of Japan
[2583.16 → 2584.00] wants Mitsubishi
[2584.00 → 2585.00] to look at the possibility
[2585.00 → 2586.46] of buying back the cars.
[2587.14 → 2587.84] That could be
[2587.84 → 2589.28] even more costly
[2589.28 → 2590.44] than what Volkswagen
[2590.44 → 2591.08] went through.
[2592.98 → 2593.54] Wow.
[2594.32 → 2595.38] Mitsubishi will also
[2595.38 → 2596.32] have to pay subsidies
[2596.32 → 2597.32] granted to consumers
[2597.32 → 2598.14] if data shows
[2598.14 → 2599.32] its cars do not meet
[2599.32 → 2600.16] the necessary fuel
[2600.16 → 2601.10] economy standards.
[2602.34 → 2602.74] I mean,
[2602.74 → 2603.94] I don't know.
[2604.54 → 2605.14] I don't know
[2605.14 → 2605.80] what the takeaway
[2605.80 → 2606.54] here is.
[2606.66 → 2607.48] Part of the takeaway
[2607.48 → 2609.58] is these companies
[2609.58 → 2610.56] are bad
[2610.56 → 2611.44] and they did
[2611.44 → 2612.36] terrible things
[2612.36 → 2612.60] and,
[2613.32 → 2613.52] you know,
[2613.64 → 2614.06] I don't know
[2614.06 → 2614.46] if that makes
[2614.46 → 2615.14] them bad people.
[2615.28 → 2616.02] Sometimes good people
[2616.02 → 2616.78] do bad things,
[2616.92 → 2618.28] but faking fuel
[2618.28 → 2619.68] economy ratings
[2619.68 → 2622.16] is pretty bad.
[2623.20 → 2623.68] I mean,
[2623.92 → 2624.44] you're lying
[2624.44 → 2625.20] to your customers.
[2625.74 → 2626.26] You're lying
[2626.26 → 2627.00] to your government.
[2627.68 → 2628.68] You are polluting
[2628.68 → 2629.32] the economy.
[2629.54 → 2630.44] Polluting the economy.
[2630.44 → 2631.12] You're polluting
[2631.12 → 2632.46] the environment
[2632.46 → 2633.44] more than you
[2633.44 → 2634.94] said you were.
[2635.18 → 2635.22] Like,
[2635.32 → 2636.68] these targets
[2636.68 → 2637.68] exist for a reason.
[2637.80 → 2638.34] We're trying to
[2638.34 → 2638.92] reduce our
[2638.92 → 2639.94] ecological impact.
[2641.82 → 2643.12] But with that said,
[2643.52 → 2644.26] it also raises
[2644.26 → 2645.28] questions about
[2645.28 → 2645.66] the
[2646.22 → 2649.18] about whether
[2649.18 → 2650.60] introducing
[2650.60 → 2652.18] laws
[2652.18 → 2652.84] governing
[2652.84 → 2653.82] how much,
[2653.96 → 2654.64] you know,
[2654.70 → 2655.28] CO2
[2655.28 → 2655.88] or how much,
[2656.00 → 2656.10] how,
[2656.44 → 2657.44] governing the emissions
[2657.44 → 2658.20] that cars can output,
[2658.66 → 2659.22] whether that's
[2659.22 → 2660.40] actually the solution
[2660.40 → 2662.08] or if you have
[2662.08 → 2663.08] to do something else.
[2663.16 → 2663.38] I mean,
[2663.40 → 2663.88] I've argued
[2663.88 → 2664.64] for a long time
[2664.64 → 2665.58] that here in Vancouver,
[2666.18 → 2666.72] public transit
[2666.72 → 2668.30] is basically unusable.
[2668.80 → 2669.96] If you have a job,
[2670.16 → 2670.74] public transit
[2670.74 → 2672.68] is pretty difficult
[2672.68 → 2673.18] to use.
[2673.30 → 2674.52] Vancouver is such
[2674.52 → 2675.70] a suburban
[2675.70 → 2677.44] sprawl.
[2677.86 → 2678.14] It just,
[2678.14 → 2679.28] it just spreads
[2679.28 → 2679.68] in all,
[2679.76 → 2680.60] in all directions
[2680.60 → 2681.82] rather than building up
[2681.82 → 2682.86] like many other cities
[2682.86 → 2683.20] have.
[2683.20 → 2685.14] and our infrastructure
[2685.14 → 2686.74] is just awful
[2686.74 → 2687.96] outside the
[2688.04 → 2689.12] of the urban core
[2689.12 → 2690.26] to the point where
[2690.26 → 2691.10] something that is
[2691.10 → 2692.18] a half an hour drive
[2692.18 → 2693.80] could easily take
[2693.80 → 2694.08] two,
[2694.20 → 2694.98] two and a half hours
[2694.98 → 2695.50] on a bus.
[2696.12 → 2697.28] And if you value
[2697.28 → 2698.04] your time
[2698.04 → 2700.04] at all,
[2700.12 → 2700.64] like you could even
[2700.64 → 2702.16] just work another job
[2702.16 → 2703.38] in the four hours
[2703.38 → 2703.86] of commuting
[2703.86 → 2704.88] that you save per day
[2704.88 → 2706.24] in order to
[2706.24 → 2707.02] have a car
[2707.02 → 2707.94] and not just
[2707.94 → 2709.18] sit around on the bus.
[2709.18 → 2713.06] So rather than
[2713.06 → 2713.66] just kind of tell
[2713.66 → 2714.04] companies,
[2714.16 → 2714.24] hey,
[2714.28 → 2714.84] you have to have
[2714.84 → 2715.54] lower emissions,
[2716.20 → 2716.42] you know,
[2716.50 → 2717.64] maybe making changes
[2717.64 → 2718.36] that make it easier
[2718.36 → 2719.36] for people to use
[2719.36 → 2721.08] mass transit
[2721.08 → 2722.72] would be a better solution.
[2722.80 → 2723.14] But of course
[2723.14 → 2723.80] that's very easy
[2723.80 → 2725.16] for me to sit here
[2725.16 → 2725.52] and say,
[2725.58 → 2725.84] I mean,
[2725.88 → 2726.48] I don't actually
[2726.48 → 2727.42] have to run the country,
[2727.42 → 2728.06] thank goodness.
[2730.46 → 2731.50] All right.
[2732.20 → 2732.48] Huh,
[2732.62 → 2733.48] more bad news
[2733.48 → 2734.60] posted by Phoenix
[2734.60 → 2736.14] Arising on the forum
[2736.14 → 2737.30] and the original article
[2737.30 → 2738.00] here is from
[2738.00 → 2739.38] CNN Money.
[2740.40 → 2741.56] Microsoft's profits
[2741.56 → 2744.86] fall by 25%.
[2744.86 → 2749.20] Not an insignificant amount.
[2749.72 → 2750.24] Sort of,
[2750.24 → 2751.52] sort of lousy quarter,
[2751.68 → 2752.96] but not all of this
[2752.96 → 2754.24] is necessarily
[2754.24 → 2755.70] entirely their fault.
[2755.82 → 2756.96] So Q1 2015,
[2757.72 → 2759.60] $5 billion profit.
[2760.18 → 2761.10] Q1 2016,
[2761.50 → 2763.22] $3.8 billion.
[2763.74 → 2764.60] But part of the reason
[2764.60 → 2765.68] that it fell 25%
[2765.68 → 2766.36] was due to a higher
[2766.36 → 2767.42] than expected tax rate
[2767.42 → 2768.46] and a strong US dollar.
[2769.00 → 2769.36] Okay.
[2769.90 → 2771.16] Sales are down
[2771.16 → 2772.98] from 21.7
[2772.98 → 2774.52] to 20.5 billion.
[2775.66 → 2777.20] Sales for consumer versions
[2777.20 → 2778.06] grew 15%.
[2778.06 → 2778.82] Enterprise version
[2778.82 → 2779.80] declined 11%
[2779.80 → 2780.50] for Windows.
[2780.76 → 2781.30] Although this,
[2781.52 → 2781.94] I don't know,
[2782.08 → 2782.82] could have something
[2782.82 → 2783.36] to do with
[2783.36 → 2784.12] that we got
[2784.12 → 2785.20] a consumer version
[2785.20 → 2785.60] of Windows
[2785.60 → 2786.48] that was not
[2786.48 → 2786.92] accompanied
[2786.92 → 2787.98] by a server version.
[2787.98 → 2790.70] server 2016 is nowhere
[2790.70 → 2791.50] to be found yet.
[2791.72 → 2792.12] If anything,
[2792.26 → 2793.00] it's probably
[2793.00 → 2794.48] kind of happy
[2794.48 → 2796.80] that enterprise sales
[2796.80 → 2797.86] only declined a little bit.
[2798.08 → 2799.08] I personally would be
[2799.08 → 2799.88] trying to put off
[2799.88 → 2800.98] a server purchase
[2800.98 → 2802.04] until server 2016
[2802.04 → 2802.66] shows up
[2802.66 → 2803.82] if I had any say
[2803.82 → 2804.20] in the matter
[2804.20 → 2804.72] at this point.
[2805.56 → 2806.82] Office 365,
[2807.54 → 2808.62] consumer base,
[2809.22 → 2811.34] reached 12.4 million
[2811.34 → 2813.02] in Q1 2015
[2813.02 → 2814.98] and grew to 22.2 million
[2814.98 → 2815.62] in 2016.
[2815.62 → 2816.22] I will say
[2816.22 → 2817.12] I contributed to that.
[2817.50 → 2818.66] I love Office 365.
[2819.82 → 2820.76] Azure is up.
[2821.82 → 2822.86] Xbox is up.
[2823.36 → 2824.00] So basically,
[2824.64 → 2825.46] yeah,
[2825.64 → 2827.22] OS is not growing
[2827.22 → 2828.18] the way they would like
[2828.18 → 2829.38] and they were taxed
[2829.38 → 2830.18] higher than they thought.
[2830.36 → 2830.74] I'm glad they're
[2830.74 → 2831.58] at least paying taxes.
[2832.68 → 2833.44] So, you know,
[2833.54 → 2834.24] good guy Microsoft,
[2834.48 → 2834.82] I guess.
[2838.82 → 2839.56] Yeah, anyway.
[2843.32 → 2844.46] What else we got?
[2845.62 → 2848.26] This is interesting.
[2848.68 → 2849.68] So original post here
[2849.68 → 2850.82] is from Engadget.
[2851.42 → 2852.66] The Canadian province
[2852.66 → 2853.48] of Quebec
[2853.48 → 2854.40] contemplates
[2854.40 → 2855.28] mandating
[2855.28 → 2857.56] home EV charging stations.
[2858.24 → 2859.04] Expects a decision
[2859.04 → 2859.62] by the start
[2859.62 → 2860.18] of this summer.
[2861.98 → 2863.46] I don't really understand
[2863.46 → 2864.16] what they're hoping
[2864.16 → 2865.32] to accomplish by that.
[2865.32 → 2867.82] I mean,
[2867.86 → 2869.48] I can see
[2869.48 → 2871.32] how investing
[2871.32 → 2872.90] in infrastructure
[2872.90 → 2874.68] throughout the province,
[2874.80 → 2875.88] like public infrastructure,
[2875.88 → 2876.90] could help the adoption
[2876.90 → 2877.36] of an EV.
[2877.86 → 2878.74] Because in my mind,
[2878.82 → 2879.44] like as someone
[2879.44 → 2880.64] considering purchasing
[2880.64 → 2881.38] an electric vehicle,
[2881.38 → 2882.30] I would love
[2882.30 → 2883.98] to buy an electric vehicle.
[2884.12 → 2885.08] It's just not really
[2885.08 → 2885.76] in my price range
[2885.76 → 2886.32] right now.
[2886.32 → 2887.04] But as someone
[2887.04 → 2887.90] considering it,
[2888.30 → 2889.10] after I've spent
[2889.10 → 2890.70] the $25,000 to $30,000
[2890.70 → 2891.60] on an EV,
[2892.32 → 2892.64] you know,
[2893.44 → 2894.30] hundreds more
[2894.30 → 2894.88] or even,
[2895.04 → 2895.24] you know,
[2895.28 → 2896.54] low thousands more
[2896.54 → 2897.86] for the charging station
[2897.86 → 2898.90] is not the end
[2898.90 → 2899.22] of the world.
[2899.30 → 2899.40] I mean,
[2899.42 → 2899.92] you think about it
[2899.92 → 2900.40] like a phone.
[2900.50 → 2901.16] Like if you walk in
[2901.16 → 2902.38] and you buy a $500 phone,
[2902.44 → 2903.20] are you that concerned
[2903.20 → 2904.40] about the $30 charger
[2904.40 → 2905.44] at the same time?
[2905.44 → 2906.22] Like I consider it
[2906.22 → 2907.02] part of the purchase,
[2907.14 → 2908.42] part of the decision
[2908.42 → 2909.24] that someone buying
[2909.24 → 2909.94] that vehicle
[2909.94 → 2910.86] would have to make.
[2910.86 → 2915.02] So this really,
[2916.36 → 2919.16] and my decision
[2919.16 → 2920.30] as far as what
[2920.30 → 2920.74] the government
[2920.74 → 2921.40] can do to help
[2921.40 → 2922.40] would have more
[2922.40 → 2923.02] to do with
[2923.02 → 2924.74] mandating businesses
[2924.74 → 2926.92] or installing
[2926.92 → 2927.80] these charging stations
[2927.80 → 2929.10] in public places
[2929.10 → 2930.02] than to do with
[2930.02 → 2930.58] whether
[2930.58 → 2931.66] I have to buy
[2931.66 → 2932.36] a charging station
[2932.36 → 2933.40] to put in my garage.
[2933.94 → 2935.40] So this again
[2935.40 → 2936.24] smacks of
[2936.24 → 2936.90] the government
[2936.90 → 2937.68] thinking that
[2937.68 → 2939.02] just introducing
[2939.02 → 2939.70] a regulation
[2939.70 → 2941.04] is going to
[2941.04 → 2941.60] somehow
[2941.60 → 2943.16] address
[2943.16 → 2944.30] some kind of problem
[2944.30 → 2944.92] and change
[2944.92 → 2945.82] consumer behaviour
[2945.82 → 2946.90] at no cost
[2946.90 → 2947.38] to themselves
[2947.38 → 2948.04] because basically
[2948.04 → 2949.12] they're just making
[2949.12 → 2950.82] builders
[2950.82 → 2952.18] stomach it
[2952.18 → 2952.96] and they're making
[2952.96 → 2953.44] consumers
[2953.44 → 2954.36] who don't necessarily
[2954.36 → 2955.06] want one
[2955.06 → 2955.90] and aren't ready for one
[2955.90 → 2956.54] and could have easily
[2956.54 → 2957.70] waited another five years
[2957.70 → 2958.46] when they were ready
[2958.46 → 2959.02] for a new car
[2959.02 → 2959.58] and bought one then
[2959.58 → 2960.16] when it's cheaper
[2960.16 → 2961.24] and they're making them
[2961.24 → 2961.76] foot the bill
[2961.76 → 2962.76] instead of just investing
[2962.76 → 2963.42] in the infrastructure
[2963.42 → 2964.20] themselves.
[2966.80 → 2967.20] Sorry?
[2967.38 → 2968.16] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2968.16 → 2972.62] Speaking of investing,
[2973.66 → 2974.64] you know who
[2974.64 → 2975.70] invested in
[2975.70 → 2976.60] our trip
[2976.60 → 2977.98] to PAX East?
[2978.68 → 2980.02] Yes, my friends,
[2980.54 → 2981.60] our friends
[2981.60 → 2982.60] from, oh,
[2983.84 → 2984.76] that, uh,
[2984.76 → 2986.18] oh, my lower third
[2986.18 → 2986.76] is gone.
[2987.50 → 2988.52] Hopefully I can find
[2988.52 → 2989.28] my lower third.
[2989.80 → 2990.76] Come on,
[2990.82 → 2991.74] lower third.
[2992.78 → 2993.12] Woo!
[2993.98 → 2995.04] Let's see what path
[2995.04 → 2995.84] it's supposed to be in.
[2995.84 → 2996.84] Of course,
[2997.36 → 2998.20] of course,
[2998.30 → 2999.02] mousing over it
[2999.02 → 2999.62] didn't help
[2999.62 → 3001.98] and, of course,
[3002.34 → 3003.58] I do understand
[3003.58 → 3004.52] why that's not working
[3004.52 → 3005.24] and there is
[3005.24 → 3006.20] basically nothing
[3006.20 → 3006.90] I can do about it
[3006.90 → 3007.28] right now.
[3007.68 → 3008.08] So,
[3008.44 → 3009.54] our sponsors were
[3009.54 → 3010.50] Logitech G
[3010.50 → 3011.66] and Discord.
[3012.32 → 3013.12] So, Logitech G,
[3013.18 → 3014.28] you're probably familiar with.
[3014.34 → 3015.12] You can check out
[3015.12 → 3016.44] their new G900
[3016.44 → 3017.58] wireless gaming mouse
[3017.58 → 3018.78] over at
[3018.78 → 3020.04] Amazon.com.
[3020.10 → 3020.70] I will link that
[3020.70 → 3021.36] in the Twitch chat.
[3021.36 → 3022.14] This is the one
[3022.14 → 3023.22] that Luke went
[3023.22 → 3024.02] all the way
[3024.02 → 3024.84] to Switzerland
[3024.84 → 3026.20] to check out
[3026.20 → 3027.58] and basically
[3027.58 → 3028.68] see
[3028.68 → 3029.86] how it is
[3029.86 → 3030.64] that Logitech
[3030.64 → 3031.62] validated it
[3031.62 → 3032.78] to run
[3032.78 → 3033.92] as
[3033.92 → 3035.36] effortlessly
[3035.36 → 3036.68] and as
[3036.68 → 3037.16] stably
[3037.16 → 3038.28] as a wired mouse
[3038.28 → 3039.02] even though
[3039.02 → 3039.90] it doesn't have
[3039.90 → 3040.44] a wire.
[3040.76 → 3041.46] Pretty freaking
[3041.46 → 3042.22] cool little piece
[3042.22 → 3042.90] of technology.
[3044.60 → 3045.46] They're also
[3045.46 → 3046.14] showing off
[3046.14 → 3046.82] what they're calling
[3046.82 → 3047.86] the Great Wall
[3047.86 → 3049.26] of Logitech Gs
[3049.26 → 3049.74] using their
[3049.74 → 3050.80] G810 keyboards.
[3051.36 → 3051.96] So, they created
[3051.96 → 3053.14] original 8-bit content
[3053.14 → 3053.96] to show on the wall
[3053.96 → 3054.46] through the use
[3054.46 → 3055.40] of their keyboards' LEDs.
[3055.68 → 3056.14] You can actually
[3056.14 → 3057.66] find a short clip.
[3058.42 → 3058.98] Here, I'll
[3058.98 → 3060.66] try and fire this up
[3060.66 → 3061.34] for you guys here.
[3061.44 → 3062.02] Yep, there you go.
[3062.42 → 3063.64] So, this is on
[3063.64 → 3064.42] Nvidia's Twitter.
[3065.18 → 3066.38] Pretty freaking cool.
[3066.46 → 3067.62] It's hard to even tell
[3067.62 → 3068.64] that that's not
[3068.64 → 3069.56] a proper display
[3069.56 → 3070.06] from here.
[3071.04 → 3071.72] Like, look at it.
[3071.82 → 3072.58] They're all keyboards.
[3074.24 → 3075.18] That is awesome.
[3075.54 → 3076.72] Which, like pretty much
[3076.72 → 3077.50] everything in my life
[3077.50 → 3077.78] right now,
[3077.84 → 3078.40] reminds me of
[3078.40 → 3079.16] the HTC Five.
[3079.16 → 3080.02] There's a really cool
[3080.02 → 3081.24] minigame from Valve
[3081.24 → 3082.22] that has you use
[3082.22 → 3082.76] the controller
[3082.76 → 3083.40] as a ship.
[3083.48 → 3084.20] Kind of like an old
[3084.20 → 3085.34] arcade style,
[3085.54 → 3086.46] you know,
[3087.48 → 3088.22] up-scrolling
[3088.22 → 3090.38] like spaceship
[3090.38 → 3091.18] shooter game.
[3091.46 → 3092.40] Except, the controller
[3092.40 → 3092.80] is the ship
[3092.80 → 3093.30] so you can like
[3093.30 → 3093.90] move around
[3093.90 → 3094.70] in 3D space
[3094.70 → 3095.12] and like
[3095.12 → 3096.06] fire at bad guys.
[3096.22 → 3097.44] It's freaking,
[3097.90 → 3099.00] freaking sick.
[3101.62 → 3103.24] So, if you're
[3103.24 → 3104.04] watching this on YouTube,
[3104.20 → 3104.54] there should be
[3104.54 → 3105.24] a full video,
[3105.30 → 3105.66] by the way,
[3105.74 → 3106.32] linked in the video
[3106.32 → 3106.68] description
[3106.68 → 3107.12] so you can
[3107.12 → 3107.74] check that out.
[3108.68 → 3109.66] Also sponsoring
[3109.66 → 3110.36] our trip to the show
[3110.36 → 3111.00] and this is a
[3111.00 → 3111.94] brand-new sponsor
[3111.94 → 3113.00] is Discord.
[3113.54 → 3114.48] It's the all-in-one
[3114.48 → 3115.62] voice and text chat
[3115.62 → 3116.54] for gamers.
[3116.78 → 3117.64] It's free, secure,
[3117.74 → 3118.34] and works on both
[3118.34 → 3119.54] desktop and your phone.
[3120.02 → 3120.94] They are promising
[3120.94 → 3122.12] to never make you
[3122.12 → 3123.00] pay to use it.
[3123.48 → 3124.08] They plan to
[3124.08 → 3125.12] monetize in the future
[3125.12 → 3126.38] with optional cosmetics
[3126.38 → 3127.02] like themes,
[3127.14 → 3127.58] sticker packs,
[3127.66 → 3128.30] and sound packs.
[3128.36 → 3129.22] So, similar to like
[3129.22 → 3130.56] what someone like
[3130.56 → 3132.06] a Swift Key was doing
[3132.06 → 3132.68] where they actually
[3132.68 → 3133.52] switched from a paid
[3133.52 → 3134.34] model to a free
[3134.34 → 3134.66] model.
[3135.26 → 3135.90] They're encrypting
[3135.90 → 3138.86] server-to-client
[3138.86 → 3139.68] communications to
[3139.68 → 3140.48] keep your IP
[3140.48 → 3141.20] address safe.
[3141.30 → 3141.86] That sounds pretty
[3141.86 → 3142.10] cool.
[3142.38 → 3142.82] And they have
[3142.82 → 3143.46] built-in DDoS
[3143.46 → 3144.02] protection with
[3144.02 → 3144.84] automatic server
[3144.84 → 3145.36] failover.
[3145.98 → 3146.90] They promise
[3146.90 → 3148.44] minimal CPU usage
[3148.44 → 3149.08] and it's optimized
[3149.08 → 3149.64] so your game's
[3149.64 → 3150.40] performance doesn't
[3150.40 → 3150.96] tank when you use
[3150.96 → 3151.10] it.
[3151.42 → 3152.02] They claim it
[3152.02 → 3153.16] takes 10 seconds
[3153.16 → 3154.28] to set up and
[3154.28 → 3154.82] doesn't require
[3154.82 → 3155.72] drivers or any
[3155.72 → 3156.80] weird setup configs.
[3156.84 → 3157.30] So, if you guys
[3157.30 → 3158.10] want to try it out,
[3158.38 → 3159.24] I've got a link over
[3159.24 → 3159.76] here that I'm going
[3159.76 → 3160.28] to post in the
[3160.28 → 3160.92] Twitch chat or if
[3160.92 → 3161.46] you're watching this
[3161.46 → 3162.62] on YouTube, then
[3162.62 → 3163.46] you can go ahead
[3163.46 → 3165.24] and you can check
[3165.24 → 3165.74] that out at the
[3165.74 → 3166.32] link in the video
[3166.32 → 3166.76] description.
[3167.34 → 3168.38] But it looks pretty
[3168.38 → 3169.12] freaking good.
[3169.20 → 3170.00] I know that Nick
[3170.00 → 3171.18] and Colton actually
[3171.18 → 3171.96] did their conference
[3171.96 → 3172.72] call with Discord
[3172.72 → 3174.24] about this deal
[3174.24 → 3175.00] on Discord.
[3175.40 → 3177.22] So, yeah, I mean,
[3177.36 → 3178.04] what else would you
[3178.04 → 3178.26] use?
[3178.76 → 3179.68] It's like, you know,
[3179.78 → 3180.80] hey, do you want to,
[3180.84 → 3181.54] I don't know, use
[3181.54 → 3182.20] the telephone?
[3182.38 → 3182.82] Be like, what?
[3183.12 → 3183.56] Telephone?
[3183.78 → 3184.68] Ancient technology?
[3185.38 → 3186.32] What else we got
[3186.32 → 3186.64] here?
[3187.42 → 3188.20] Other sponsor,
[3188.44 → 3189.68] lynda.com.
[3189.68 → 3191.34] If you somehow
[3191.34 → 3192.96] are not familiar
[3192.96 → 3194.56] with lynda.com
[3194.56 → 3195.58] by this point,
[3195.90 → 3196.52] then I will tell
[3196.52 → 3197.12] you about it.
[3197.48 → 3198.48] lynda.com is used
[3198.48 → 3199.56] by millions of
[3199.56 → 3200.32] people around the
[3200.32 → 3200.56] world.
[3200.70 → 3201.14] They have more
[3201.14 → 3202.80] than 3,000 courses
[3202.80 → 3203.46] available and they
[3203.46 → 3204.56] are taught by
[3204.56 → 3205.56] experts in the
[3205.56 → 3206.38] topics of things
[3206.38 → 3207.40] like web development,
[3207.88 → 3208.34] photography,
[3208.72 → 3209.56] visual design,
[3210.02 → 3210.60] video editing,
[3211.02 → 3211.42] business,
[3211.88 → 3212.62] productivity
[3212.62 → 3213.88] application use.
[3214.34 → 3215.06] Pretty much
[3215.06 → 3216.14] whatever you
[3216.14 → 3216.68] could want,
[3216.76 → 3216.88] you know,
[3216.88 → 3217.26] Excel,
[3217.48 → 3217.78] WordPress,
[3217.78 → 3218.40] Photoshop,
[3218.56 → 3218.92] whatever you
[3218.92 → 3219.48] could want
[3219.48 → 3220.44] to kickstart
[3220.44 → 3221.04] your hobby
[3221.04 → 3222.58] or your career.
[3222.90 → 3223.64] They have new
[3223.64 → 3224.24] courses that are
[3224.24 → 3225.34] added every week
[3225.34 → 3225.84] and they've got
[3225.84 → 3226.72] a lot of new
[3226.72 → 3227.32] tools that they've
[3227.32 → 3228.58] added since we
[3228.58 → 3229.34] have been,
[3229.74 → 3230.44] since we've been
[3230.44 → 3231.04] doing these pods
[3231.04 → 3231.72] for them actually,
[3232.20 → 3232.76] now that I think
[3232.76 → 3233.12] about it.
[3233.16 → 3233.74] Things like being
[3233.74 → 3234.56] able to download
[3234.56 → 3235.84] the videos and
[3235.84 → 3236.46] view them on the
[3236.46 → 3237.06] bus when you
[3237.06 → 3237.68] don't necessarily
[3237.68 → 3238.24] want to eat up
[3238.24 → 3238.98] your data connection
[3238.98 → 3240.08] on iOS and
[3240.08 → 3240.60] Android.
[3241.00 → 3241.60] The ability
[3241.60 → 3243.44] to skim along
[3243.44 → 3244.28] a transcript
[3244.28 → 3245.18] of the course
[3245.18 → 3246.18] and then just
[3246.18 → 3247.12] click to a point
[3247.12 → 3247.66] on the script
[3247.66 → 3248.24] and then have
[3248.24 → 3248.90] the video pick
[3248.90 → 3249.80] up at that spot.
[3250.26 → 3250.92] The ability
[3250.92 → 3251.42] to create
[3251.42 → 3251.94] playlists so
[3251.94 → 3252.46] you can learn
[3252.46 → 3253.14] alongside your
[3253.14 → 3253.62] friends and
[3253.62 → 3254.26] follow a
[3254.26 → 3255.12] curriculum together
[3255.12 → 3255.78] and they're
[3255.78 → 3256.40] offering a
[3256.40 → 3257.00] 10-day free
[3257.00 → 3257.46] trial which
[3257.46 → 3257.84] gives you
[3257.84 → 3258.38] access to
[3258.38 → 3259.26] every course
[3259.26 → 3260.60] on lynda.com
[3260.60 → 3261.68] for 10 days,
[3262.08 → 3262.68] all you can
[3262.68 → 3262.92] eat,
[3263.30 → 3263.82] with plans
[3263.82 → 3264.58] starting after
[3264.58 → 3265.16] that at only
[3265.16 → 3266.32] 25 bucks a
[3266.32 → 3266.68] month.
[3266.88 → 3267.80] So check
[3267.80 → 3269.78] it out.
[3273.68 → 3274.24] Alright,
[3274.50 → 3274.82] what else
[3274.82 → 3275.44] we got here?
[3275.44 → 3275.88] We've actually
[3275.88 → 3276.56] got a fair
[3276.56 → 3277.30] number of
[3277.30 → 3278.24] topics.
[3278.38 → 3278.74] Microsoft
[3278.74 → 3280.10] has finally
[3280.10 → 3281.06] ended production
[3281.06 → 3281.36] of the
[3281.36 → 3282.30] Xbox 360.
[3283.56 → 3284.28] So there
[3284.28 → 3284.86] you have it.
[3285.62 → 3286.14] Originally
[3286.14 → 3286.80] posted on
[3286.80 → 3287.30] Kodak.
[3288.08 → 3288.42] If you
[3288.42 → 3288.78] wanted to
[3288.78 → 3289.08] buy an
[3289.08 → 3290.00] Xbox 360,
[3290.66 → 3292.50] before today
[3292.50 → 3292.94] was the
[3292.94 → 3293.34] time.
[3293.80 → 3294.02] Well,
[3294.06 → 3294.22] there will
[3294.22 → 3294.68] probably still
[3294.68 → 3295.00] be some
[3295.00 → 3295.42] on shelves,
[3295.58 → 3296.76] but 10
[3296.76 → 3297.74] and a half
[3297.74 → 3298.26] years.
[3299.30 → 3300.52] 10 and a
[3300.52 → 3301.34] half years
[3301.34 → 3301.68] ago,
[3302.06 → 3303.06] the Xbox
[3303.06 → 3304.10] 360 launched
[3304.10 → 3304.68] and we
[3304.68 → 3305.84] are finally,
[3306.08 → 3307.32] finally rid
[3307.32 → 3307.64] of it.
[3308.60 → 3309.04] Microsoft's
[3309.04 → 3309.66] Phil Spencer
[3309.66 → 3310.24] wrote a few
[3310.24 → 3310.96] paragraphs about
[3310.96 → 3311.64] its success,
[3312.24 → 3313.72] saying,
[3313.84 → 3314.56] Xbox 360
[3314.56 → 3315.28] means a lot
[3315.28 → 3315.66] to everyone
[3315.66 → 3316.14] in Microsoft
[3316.14 → 3316.54] and while
[3316.54 → 3316.96] we've had an
[3316.96 → 3317.50] amazing run,
[3317.82 → 3318.38] the realities
[3318.38 → 3319.22] of manufacturing
[3319.22 → 3319.72] a product
[3319.72 → 3320.64] over a decade
[3320.64 → 3321.42] old are
[3321.42 → 3321.86] starting to
[3321.86 → 3322.30] creep up on
[3322.30 → 3322.54] us,
[3322.66 → 3323.30] which is why
[3323.30 → 3323.62] we've made
[3323.62 → 3324.00] the decision
[3324.00 → 3324.54] to stop
[3324.54 → 3325.12] manufacturing
[3325.12 → 3325.68] new Xbox
[3325.68 → 3326.70] 360 consoles.
[3327.20 → 3327.54] We will
[3327.54 → 3328.04] continue to
[3328.04 → 3328.64] sell existing
[3328.64 → 3329.90] inventory with
[3329.90 → 3330.32] availability
[3330.32 → 3330.96] varying by
[3330.96 → 3331.28] country.
[3331.38 → 3332.26] Xbox Live
[3332.26 → 3332.96] will remain
[3332.96 → 3333.38] active,
[3333.72 → 3334.10] as will
[3334.10 → 3334.48] the Xbox
[3334.48 → 3335.08] 360's
[3335.08 → 3335.56] various stores
[3335.56 → 3335.98] and online
[3335.98 → 3336.58] services,
[3337.34 → 3338.58] and the
[3338.58 → 3339.32] Xbox One
[3339.32 → 3339.74] is actually
[3339.74 → 3340.06] adding
[3340.06 → 3341.02] support for
[3341.02 → 3341.50] backwards
[3341.50 → 3342.72] compatibility
[3342.72 → 3343.40] support for
[3343.40 → 3343.98] some 360
[3343.98 → 3344.40] games.
[3345.60 → 3346.10] So there
[3346.10 → 3346.56] you have
[3346.56 → 3346.80] it.
[3347.58 → 3348.18] There you
[3348.18 → 3348.64] have it.
[3349.50 → 3349.98] The Xbox
[3349.98 → 3350.88] 360 is
[3350.88 → 3351.72] finally no
[3351.72 → 3351.94] more.
[3352.00 → 3352.34] I'm actually
[3352.34 → 3352.88] probably going
[3352.88 → 3353.30] to pick up a
[3353.30 → 3353.72] handful of
[3353.72 → 3354.44] Xbox 360
[3354.44 → 3355.04] controllers
[3355.04 → 3357.64] before getting
[3357.64 → 3359.04] peripherals for
[3359.04 → 3360.04] dying console
[3360.04 → 3360.94] madness happens.
[3361.06 → 3361.36] I want to
[3361.36 → 3361.70] get a couple
[3361.70 → 3362.04] that are in
[3362.04 → 3362.54] good condition
[3362.54 → 3362.98] because it's
[3362.98 → 3363.42] still my
[3363.42 → 3364.08] favourite controller.
[3364.28 → 3364.60] I really
[3364.60 → 3364.98] don't like
[3364.98 → 3365.30] the shape
[3365.30 → 3365.50] of the
[3365.50 → 3366.02] Dual Shock
[3366.02 → 3366.68] and I
[3366.68 → 3367.20] really do
[3367.20 → 3367.70] prefer it
[3367.70 → 3367.94] to the
[3367.94 → 3368.74] Xbox One
[3368.74 → 3369.28] controller.
[3370.96 → 3371.54] There you
[3371.54 → 3371.84] go.
[3375.74 → 3376.28] Let's see,
[3376.36 → 3376.62] what else
[3376.62 → 3377.10] we got?
[3380.22 → 3380.82] Oh, this
[3380.82 → 3381.26] is interesting.
[3381.66 → 3382.52] Original article
[3382.52 → 3383.44] here is from
[3383.44 → 3384.70] anontech.com.
[3385.20 → 3386.02] WD is
[3386.02 → 3386.72] introducing
[3386.72 → 3388.82] WD Gold
[3388.82 → 3389.50] hard drives.
[3389.58 → 3389.82] They have
[3389.82 → 3390.26] added yet
[3390.26 → 3390.84] another colour.
[3390.84 → 3391.32] It's available
[3391.32 → 3392.02] in capacities
[3392.02 → 3393.22] from 4 to
[3393.22 → 3394.04] 6 to
[3394.04 → 3394.86] 8 terabytes
[3394.86 → 3396.42] and effectively
[3396.42 → 3397.32] pretty much
[3397.32 → 3399.26] replaces the
[3399.26 → 3400.44] SE lineup.
[3401.48 → 3401.82] Where's my
[3401.82 → 3402.28] C nut?
[3402.40 → 3403.50] Oh, that's
[3403.50 → 3403.98] funny.
[3404.18 → 3404.66] I served.
[3405.12 → 3405.58] And pretty
[3405.58 → 3406.20] much replaces
[3406.20 → 3407.00] their existing
[3407.00 → 3407.82] SE lineup,
[3407.98 → 3408.44] which was
[3408.44 → 3409.18] kind of like
[3409.18 → 3411.06] a high
[3411.06 → 3411.62] capacity
[3411.62 → 3412.48] enterprise,
[3413.08 → 3413.72] but not as
[3413.72 → 3414.48] expensive as
[3414.48 → 3415.14] RE, not
[3415.14 → 3415.58] quite as
[3415.58 → 3417.14] high performance
[3417.14 → 3417.90] as RE.
[3419.82 → 3420.38] So basically
[3420.38 → 3421.26] the colour
[3421.26 → 3421.98] branding is
[3421.98 → 3422.82] almost complete.
[3422.88 → 3423.26] I'm surprised
[3423.26 → 3423.60] they called
[3423.60 → 3423.98] it is gold.
[3424.06 → 3424.30] I would have
[3424.30 → 3424.54] thought they
[3424.54 → 3424.84] would save
[3424.84 → 3425.38] gold for
[3425.38 → 3426.90] RE, but
[3426.90 → 3427.20] maybe they're
[3427.20 → 3427.44] going to call
[3427.44 → 3428.20] that platinum
[3428.20 → 3428.68] or something.
[3428.92 → 3429.46] I don't know.
[3429.70 → 3430.12] It's tuned
[3430.12 → 3430.84] similarly to
[3430.84 → 3431.48] WD Red
[3431.48 → 3432.74] drives, rated
[3432.74 → 3434.06] for 24-7 use
[3434.06 → 3434.50] and workloads
[3434.50 → 3434.86] of up to
[3434.86 → 3435.98] 550 terabytes
[3435.98 → 3436.74] a year with
[3436.74 → 3437.72] a five-year
[3437.72 → 3438.56] warranty.
[3440.42 → 3440.90] Cool.
[3440.90 → 3443.00] Ah, this
[3443.00 → 3443.60] is just
[3443.60 → 3443.94] kind of
[3443.94 → 3444.20] funny.
[3444.32 → 3444.52] This is
[3444.52 → 3445.00] originally,
[3445.30 → 3446.16] original post
[3446.16 → 3446.74] here is
[3446.74 → 3447.92] over on
[3447.92 → 3449.04] cbc.ca.
[3449.66 → 3450.66] Rust players
[3450.66 → 3451.44] outraged
[3451.44 → 3452.26] after half
[3452.26 → 3452.58] of them
[3452.58 → 3452.84] given
[3452.84 → 3453.64] female
[3453.64 → 3455.02] avatars
[3455.02 → 3458.04] in some
[3458.04 → 3458.52] kind of
[3458.52 → 3459.22] attempt to
[3459.22 → 3459.86] appease
[3459.86 → 3461.02] Saws,
[3461.08 → 3461.62] I suppose.
[3462.86 → 3463.22] Now,
[3463.40 → 3464.10] this wouldn't
[3464.10 → 3464.52] be that
[3464.52 → 3464.94] big of an
[3464.94 → 3466.94] issue if
[3466.94 → 3468.40] they hadn't
[3468.40 → 3469.08] been changed
[3469.08 → 3470.92] without the
[3470.92 → 3471.40] players even
[3471.40 → 3472.12] being notified
[3472.12 → 3473.60] and permanently.
[3475.06 → 3475.82] So your
[3475.82 → 3477.08] player just
[3477.08 → 3478.32] boom.
[3479.64 → 3480.18] They've implemented
[3480.18 → 3480.84] a feature that
[3480.84 → 3481.58] randomly makes
[3481.58 → 3481.96] your character
[3481.96 → 3482.34] a man or
[3482.34 → 3482.58] a woman.
[3483.06 → 3483.64] They actually
[3483.64 → 3484.58] randomize
[3484.58 → 3485.38] features for
[3485.38 → 3485.96] your permanent
[3485.96 → 3486.64] character like
[3486.64 → 3487.18] skin colour,
[3487.38 → 3487.80] limb length,
[3487.92 → 3488.28] and even
[3488.28 → 3489.06] penis size.
[3489.72 → 3490.26] So developers
[3490.26 → 3490.94] Gary Neumann
[3490.94 → 3491.38] and Taylor
[3491.38 → 3492.62] Reynolds expected
[3492.62 → 3493.40] this backlash
[3493.40 → 3494.36] and addressed
[3494.36 → 3494.88] it on their
[3494.88 → 3495.72] community dev
[3495.72 → 3496.08] log.
[3496.34 → 3496.54] This is
[3496.54 → 3496.78] great.
[3497.62 → 3498.18] We understand
[3498.18 → 3498.84] this is a
[3498.84 → 3499.42] sore subject
[3499.42 → 3499.90] for a lot
[3499.90 → 3500.30] of people.
[3500.72 → 3501.12] We understand
[3501.12 → 3501.62] that you may
[3501.62 → 3502.18] now be a
[3502.18 → 3502.68] gender that
[3502.68 → 3503.04] you don't
[3503.04 → 3503.86] identify with
[3503.86 → 3504.48] in real life.
[3504.86 → 3505.24] We understand
[3505.24 → 3505.78] this causes
[3505.78 → 3506.38] you distress
[3506.38 → 3506.98] and makes
[3506.98 → 3507.44] you not want
[3507.44 → 3507.68] to play
[3507.68 → 3508.02] the game
[3508.02 → 3508.36] anymore.
[3509.14 → 3509.54] Technically,
[3509.70 → 3510.14] nothing has
[3510.14 → 3510.92] changed since
[3510.92 → 3511.26] half the
[3511.26 → 3511.90] population was
[3511.90 → 3512.44] already living
[3512.44 → 3512.84] with those
[3512.84 → 3513.22] feelings.
[3513.72 → 3514.02] The only
[3514.02 → 3514.50] difference is
[3514.50 → 3514.80] that whether
[3514.80 → 3515.18] you feel
[3515.18 → 3515.52] like this
[3515.52 → 3515.78] is now
[3515.78 → 3516.32] decided by
[3516.32 → 3516.72] your Steam
[3516.72 → 3517.36] ID instead
[3517.36 → 3517.64] of your
[3517.64 → 3518.00] real-life
[3518.00 → 3518.30] gender.
[3519.12 → 3519.44] This is
[3519.44 → 3519.84] really just
[3519.84 → 3520.34] the first
[3520.34 → 3521.10] pass of an
[3521.10 → 3522.04] ongoing rework
[3522.04 → 3522.40] of the
[3522.40 → 3522.94] player model.
[3523.42 → 3523.64] I'll
[3523.64 → 3524.20] continue to
[3524.20 → 3525.04] add variations
[3525.04 → 3525.62] over the
[3525.62 → 3526.22] coming weeks
[3526.22 → 3526.90] which means
[3526.90 → 3527.36] you're probably
[3527.36 → 3527.96] not stuck
[3527.96 → 3528.26] with your
[3528.26 → 3528.70] new face
[3528.70 → 3529.02] forever.
[3529.68 → 3530.14] We've got
[3530.14 → 3530.80] a decent
[3530.80 → 3531.30] synced
[3531.30 → 3531.76] workflow
[3531.76 → 3532.30] between the
[3532.30 → 3532.86] assets I
[3532.86 → 3533.24] make in
[3533.24 → 3533.60] Brush
[3533.60 → 3533.86] and the
[3533.86 → 3534.34] assets you'll
[3534.34 → 3534.64] see in
[3534.64 → 3535.08] game now
[3535.08 → 3535.60] so it opens
[3535.60 → 3535.96] up a lot
[3535.96 → 3536.26] of scope
[3536.26 → 3536.68] to easily
[3536.68 → 3537.04] add or
[3537.04 → 3537.26] change
[3537.26 → 3537.70] features
[3537.70 → 3538.64] without a
[3538.64 → 3539.50] great deal
[3539.50 → 3540.34] of technical
[3540.34 → 3540.96] faffing
[3540.96 → 3541.58] in between.
[3544.22 → 3544.86] What?
[3548.96 → 3549.76] So we
[3549.76 → 3550.28] heard that
[3550.28 → 3550.70] lots of
[3550.70 → 3551.14] people,
[3551.72 → 3552.16] you know,
[3552.34 → 3553.24] don't identify
[3553.24 → 3554.94] with gender
[3554.94 → 3555.96] X or Y
[3555.96 → 3556.84] or some
[3556.84 → 3557.30] combination
[3557.30 → 3557.60] of the
[3557.60 → 3557.88] two
[3557.88 → 3560.42] and that
[3560.42 → 3560.88] makes them
[3560.88 → 3561.40] unhappy.
[3562.44 → 3562.84] So we
[3562.84 → 3563.98] thought as
[3563.98 → 3564.36] a game
[3564.36 → 3566.28] developer we
[3566.28 → 3566.88] would take
[3566.88 → 3567.62] our customers
[3567.62 → 3568.92] and we
[3568.92 → 3569.26] would have
[3569.26 → 3569.82] them experience
[3569.82 → 3571.02] that on
[3571.02 → 3571.64] some scale
[3571.64 → 3576.34] because we
[3576.34 → 3578.40] something,
[3578.40 → 3579.30] um,
[3580.30 → 3582.26] okay.
[3582.26 → 3587.58] we've got
[3587.58 → 3588.54] more details
[3588.54 → 3589.12] about the
[3589.12 → 3590.80] PlayStation 4K
[3590.80 → 3591.14] which,
[3591.72 → 3592.20] um,
[3592.46 → 3592.92] we don't
[3592.92 → 3593.28] know if
[3593.28 → 3593.70] it's the
[3593.70 → 3594.18] confirmed
[3594.18 → 3594.72] name.
[3594.98 → 3595.28] I don't
[3595.28 → 3595.60] know if
[3595.60 → 3595.94] we talked
[3595.94 → 3596.36] about some
[3596.36 → 3596.62] of this
[3596.62 → 3597.24] stuff last
[3597.24 → 3597.56] week.
[3597.66 → 3598.18] I believe
[3598.18 → 3598.74] we actually
[3598.74 → 3599.00] did,
[3599.08 → 3599.36] but we've
[3599.36 → 3599.64] got a
[3599.64 → 3600.12] handy-dandy
[3600.12 → 3600.64] little chart
[3600.64 → 3601.06] this time,
[3601.16 → 3601.46] so I can
[3601.46 → 3601.86] go ahead and
[3601.86 → 3602.36] fire that up
[3602.36 → 3602.90] for you guys.
[3602.90 → 3605.22] so eight
[3605.22 → 3606.00] Jaguar cores,
[3606.30 → 3606.60] eight more
[3606.60 → 3607.38] Jaguar cores,
[3607.48 → 3607.70] well no,
[3607.78 → 3608.32] exactly the
[3608.32 → 3608.88] same number
[3608.88 → 3609.14] of eight
[3609.14 → 3609.72] Jaguar cores,
[3609.80 → 3610.02] in fact,
[3610.12 → 3610.96] same architecture
[3610.96 → 3611.40] but higher
[3611.40 → 3612.02] clock speed,
[3612.24 → 3612.54] okay,
[3612.70 → 3613.22] GCN,
[3613.60 → 3614.44] better GCN,
[3614.78 → 3615.06] okay,
[3615.80 → 3616.10] uh,
[3616.10 → 3616.90] higher clocked,
[3616.90 → 3618.02] um,
[3618.44 → 3619.06] more compute
[3619.06 → 3619.48] units,
[3619.84 → 3620.28] um,
[3620.28 → 3620.76] memory,
[3621.00 → 3621.40] looks like
[3621.40 → 3621.72] it's got a
[3621.72 → 3622.50] bandwidth increase
[3622.50 → 3623.80] but is actually
[3623.80 → 3624.40] still the same
[3624.40 → 3624.90] eight gigs,
[3625.50 → 3626.56] so there you
[3626.56 → 3626.86] go.
[3627.78 → 3628.26] Um,
[3628.78 → 3629.62] yep.
[3630.82 → 3631.46] This is cool.
[3631.84 → 3632.30] So this was
[3632.30 → 3632.94] originally posted
[3632.94 → 3634.18] by Strider721
[3634.18 → 3634.74] on the forum.
[3634.82 → 3635.12] The original
[3635.12 → 3635.70] article here
[3635.70 → 3636.02] is from
[3636.02 → 3636.94] The Verge.
[3637.70 → 3638.28] Counter-Strike
[3638.28 → 3639.12] hacked to run
[3639.12 → 3639.78] on Android
[3639.78 → 3640.30] phones.
[3640.76 → 3641.48] This is
[3641.48 → 3641.88] cool.
[3643.60 → 3644.92] Bloop-Dee-doop-dee-bloop-dee-bloop.
[3645.82 → 3646.24] Now to be
[3646.24 → 3646.42] clear,
[3646.52 → 3647.04] this is not
[3647.04 → 3647.70] CSGO.
[3647.92 → 3648.24] This is
[3648.24 → 3648.62] Counter-Strike
[3648.62 → 3649.40] 1.6.
[3650.28 → 3651.20] But how cool
[3651.20 → 3651.52] is that,
[3651.60 → 3651.78] right?
[3652.50 → 3653.00] Look at this.
[3655.14 → 3655.74] Love it.
[3658.18 → 3658.90] Oh, man.
[3661.02 → 3661.68] So let's get
[3661.68 → 3662.38] some details here.
[3662.46 → 3662.80] So this is
[3662.80 → 3663.20] the work
[3663.20 → 3664.00] of, uh,
[3664.00 → 3664.44] programmer,
[3664.78 → 3665.24] oh, sorry,
[3665.32 → 3665.52] hold on,
[3665.56 → 3666.04] gotta close that.
[3666.64 → 3667.80] Label Omar,
[3667.92 → 3668.50] who's experienced
[3668.50 → 3668.92] in making
[3668.92 → 3669.86] old PC games
[3669.86 → 3670.56] run on Android.
[3670.88 → 3671.48] He's created
[3671.48 → 3672.40] touchscreen controls
[3672.40 → 3673.06] for the game.
[3673.30 → 3673.78] So to get it
[3673.78 → 3674.12] to work on
[3674.12 → 3674.52] your Android
[3674.52 → 3674.82] device,
[3674.90 → 3675.38] you download
[3675.38 → 3676.32] the Sash,
[3676.46 → 3677.08] Cash,
[3677.64 → 3678.66] it's X-A-S-H,
[3678.74 → 3679.40] 3D software,
[3679.40 → 3680.40] have the games
[3680.40 → 3680.62] on your
[3680.62 → 3681.06] Steam account
[3681.06 → 3681.42] to copy
[3681.42 → 3681.80] the files
[3681.80 → 3682.16] across,
[3682.28 → 3682.76] and the port
[3682.76 → 3684.24] does apparently
[3684.24 → 3685.20] support peripherals,
[3685.28 → 3686.30] which is pretty
[3686.30 → 3686.58] cool,
[3686.64 → 3687.20] because with an
[3687.20 → 3687.82] on-the-go cable,
[3687.86 → 3688.34] I have actually
[3688.34 → 3688.90] tested this,
[3688.94 → 3690.04] with an OTG cable,
[3690.26 → 3690.72] and a phone that
[3690.72 → 3691.52] supports OTG,
[3691.76 → 3692.82] and just a normal
[3692.82 → 3693.44] USB hub,
[3693.50 → 3694.08] you can plug in
[3694.08 → 3694.68] pretty much whatever
[3694.68 → 3695.32] you could possibly
[3695.32 → 3695.54] want.
[3695.60 → 3696.46] Powered USB hub,
[3696.50 → 3697.06] otherwise you are
[3697.06 → 3698.54] definitely going to
[3698.54 → 3699.24] have issues running
[3699.24 → 3699.86] like, you know,
[3700.58 → 3701.10] large,
[3701.18 → 3701.94] 104 key,
[3702.04 → 3702.18] like,
[3702.26 → 3702.90] RGB backlit
[3702.90 → 3703.34] keyboards.
[3703.34 → 3705.20] So I think that
[3705.20 → 3705.86] pretty much does it
[3705.86 → 3706.60] for the WAN show.
[3706.80 → 3708.56] Thank you to all
[3708.56 → 3710.08] of you who went
[3710.08 → 3711.62] ahead and stuck
[3711.62 → 3712.28] with me through
[3712.28 → 3712.90] the technical
[3712.90 → 3713.82] difficulties on the
[3713.82 → 3714.36] show today.
[3714.52 → 3715.54] Really do appreciate
[3715.54 → 3715.96] it.
[3716.22 → 3717.36] I will see you guys
[3717.36 → 3718.46] next week,
[3718.80 → 3719.80] same bat time,
[3720.28 → 3722.46] same bat channel.
[3722.66 → 3722.98] Actually,
[3723.12 → 3723.94] will I see you guys
[3723.94 → 3724.38] next week?
[3724.50 → 3725.60] I may be travelling
[3725.60 → 3726.18] next week.
[3727.02 → 3728.10] We have a lot of,
[3728.26 → 3729.22] like, a lot of the
[3729.22 → 3729.90] team is travelling
[3729.90 → 3730.70] a lot.
[3730.70 → 3731.12] No, I,
[3731.26 → 3731.94] wait, what?
[3734.32 → 3734.64] Yeah,
[3734.98 → 3735.88] Brandon's, like,
[3735.92 → 3736.70] gone forever.
[3737.74 → 3738.82] Yeah, Linus and Ed
[3738.82 → 3740.22] are in San Francisco
[3740.22 → 3741.82] until, yes,
[3741.92 → 3742.40] next Friday.
[3742.50 → 3743.24] So I'll see if I'm
[3743.24 → 3743.94] removing in, or I'll
[3743.94 → 3744.60] see if I'm not,
[3744.70 → 3745.78] but if I don't,
[3745.86 → 3746.38] Luke will be hosting
[3746.38 → 3746.82] the show because
[3746.82 → 3747.70] he'll be back by then.
[3748.62 → 3749.28] This is the problem
[3749.28 → 3749.60] with, like,
[3749.62 → 3750.24] you tell people,
[3750.72 → 3751.56] take your vacation
[3751.56 → 3752.66] and then no one does
[3752.66 → 3753.86] it, and then you tell
[3753.86 → 3754.28] people, look,
[3754.32 → 3754.74] you're not going to be
[3754.74 → 3755.32] able to take it in
[3755.32 → 3756.38] Q4 because it's busy
[3756.38 → 3757.10] and then everyone
[3757.10 → 3758.06] just takes off.
[3758.14 → 3758.36] Mind you,
[3758.42 → 3759.10] most of this is work
[3759.10 → 3759.28] stuff.
[3759.38 → 3760.16] Actually, only Brandon's
[3760.16 → 3760.76] taking vacation
[3760.76 → 3761.22] because he's not
[3761.22 → 3761.64] a team player.
[3762.76 → 3763.52] You heard me.
[3764.16 → 3764.48] Wow.
[3765.38 → 3765.74] Horrible.
[3766.04 → 3766.48] All right,
[3766.54 → 3767.06] see you guys.
