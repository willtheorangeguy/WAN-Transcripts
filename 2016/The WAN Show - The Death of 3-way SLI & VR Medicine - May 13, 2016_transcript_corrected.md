[0.00 → 4.16] I love how the waters are completely melted.
[4.44 → 4.72] Hello!
[5.34 → 9.06] Oh, we're, uh, now we're, now we're encoding frames.
[9.18 → 9.68] There we go.
[9.70 → 12.96] Yeah, welcome to the, the, the hot show.
[13.16 → 13.72] Pool show.
[13.98 → 15.54] Yeah, everything's really wet.
[15.56 → 21.68] Melted ice and condensation show, the WAN show, live-streaming to you here from beautiful.
[21.68 → 23.62] The melted ice and condensation show.
[23.66 → 27.48] Yeah, well, that condensation can, um, melt.
[27.48 → 32.24] If, if WAN show ever lands on the April Fools, we should just change what the show is about
[32.24 → 34.26] and be super hardcore about whatever it is.
[34.30 → 35.96] Yeah, it could be like the chicken show.
[36.38 → 38.74] Like, all the latest news about chickens.
[38.74 → 39.12] Chickens.
[39.42 → 41.98] Chickens, chicken farming, chicken breeding.
[42.32 → 43.86] Is chicken breeding chicken farming?
[44.86 → 45.32] Whoa.
[46.42 → 50.22] Because you, like, you, like, sow chickens, and then you harvest chickens.
[50.46 → 51.04] What's, what's, what's.
[51.04 → 51.76] Effectively, it is.
[51.76 → 53.08] Well, it's animal husbandry.
[53.30 → 53.56] Yeah.
[54.26 → 54.50] Yeah.
[55.00 → 55.52] That's right.
[55.52 → 58.10] Welcome to the animal husbandry and farming show.
[58.14 → 61.28] We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today, including, uh.
[61.28 → 62.78] NVIDIA's GTX 1000.
[63.00 → 64.14] I didn't know if you were ready for that one.
[64.28 → 65.28] You took that from me.
[65.30 → 65.90] Sorry, bro.
[65.90 → 70.98] Also, some bad news about the GTX 1080 with respect to SLI.
[71.16 → 75.72] If you're super hardcore into having, like, lots of graphics cards.
[75.96 → 76.28] Yes.
[76.48 → 77.90] Or not that bad news.
[78.10 → 79.58] But we'll talk about that later.
[79.74 → 79.94] Yeah.
[79.94 → 86.02] Oxford study finds that virtual reality can help treat severe paranoia, which is sweet.
[86.68 → 92.40] And the Hyperloop one shows us how fast we could get from here to there.
[92.56 → 92.84] Kinda.
[93.46 → 95.16] More at 11.
[95.90 → 96.90] Also known as now.
[97.86 → 98.26] We'll see.
[99.08 → 99.40] Is.
[99.40 → 106.64] Oh, I am so sweaty.
[110.64 → 113.38] Just sitting here, everything about me is damp.
[113.96 → 115.06] I look like I did the worst.
[115.82 → 117.34] Unless you look under my arms.
[118.02 → 118.84] Then it's a mess.
[120.84 → 121.82] Oh, the camera.
[122.36 → 122.62] Yep.
[122.78 → 124.06] I'm going to under the...
[124.06 → 130.06] All right.
[130.80 → 132.96] So, NVIDIA's 1000 series.
[133.16 → 137.76] Oh, I was just going to say, it has been a freaking week.
[137.96 → 138.22] Yep.
[138.52 → 143.84] He went to the unveiling of the GTX 1080 and 1070.
[144.00 → 145.76] Why did they call it the 1080?
[146.10 → 146.40] Yeah.
[147.00 → 149.02] Do they enjoy creating confusion?
[149.02 → 152.60] And, like, the whole time I was like, okay, no one's confused yet,
[152.60 → 156.02] but I've only talked to, like, reviewers and, like, tech heads.
[156.22 → 159.40] And then I talked to Taken, and he was like, wait,
[159.46 → 162.02] does that mean it's a 1080 card or a 4K card?
[162.10 → 163.46] Can it play 4K games?
[163.52 → 165.24] And I'm like, oh, damn it.
[165.28 → 167.06] And people are going to walk into a store.
[167.06 → 167.42] Totally.
[167.68 → 168.00] Okay?
[168.14 → 170.84] And you're going to have a big box sales rep, and they're going to say,
[170.98 → 172.72] I want to buy a 1080.
[173.28 → 177.40] And they're going to be like, LG, Samsung, Asus.
[177.40 → 179.40] Totally.
[179.40 → 183.80] And the customer's going to be like, Samsung's a good brand.
[183.88 → 185.20] I'll have a 1080 Samsung.
[185.48 → 185.68] Yep.
[186.12 → 190.04] And that's going to be bad because that's not going to be what they meant to buy,
[190.10 → 191.28] and it's going to be a big problem.
[194.22 → 194.58] Oh.
[194.92 → 195.26] Wow.
[195.36 → 196.42] I think that was one of the monkeys.
[196.44 → 197.18] That's a monkey.
[197.18 → 201.02] So for those of you doubting that we are actually in a jungle,
[201.36 → 206.04] that sound effect could not possibly have been prerecorded
[206.04 → 207.86] and added into the stream after the fact.
[207.98 → 211.52] And we've got a doubter that we're even live right now.
[212.38 → 213.52] Yeah, we've got...
[213.52 → 214.34] Hold on.
[214.50 → 214.88] Hold on.
[214.92 → 216.48] Let me scroll back up for a second.
[217.14 → 217.88] Chat's going a little too fast.
[217.88 → 218.64] Jester61?
[219.88 → 220.52] Come on.
[220.52 → 222.52] You are the real jester.
[222.66 → 223.12] We are live.
[223.22 → 224.24] Oh, my goodness.
[224.40 → 224.80] We are live.
[224.86 → 225.46] No one...
[225.46 → 226.12] No one...
[226.12 → 228.08] We get this all the time.
[228.14 → 229.30] Oh, you guys aren't live.
[229.36 → 229.62] All right.
[229.66 → 231.08] Well, we're going to tell you live...
[231.08 → 231.70] Like every show.
[231.74 → 232.96] ...about the GTX 1080.
[233.14 → 233.70] So let me just...
[233.70 → 233.84] Yes.
[233.84 → 235.26] Original poster here is...
[235.26 → 236.40] Oh, apparently no one.
[236.46 → 239.06] So I'm going to pull up the original article here from Nantes.
[239.12 → 239.86] Get this on the screen.
[240.26 → 241.50] Luke was there, though.
[241.66 → 243.40] He doesn't need an article from Nantes.
[243.50 → 246.80] Walk us through what you experienced.
[247.80 → 250.16] So one thing that I want to address immediately,
[250.60 → 251.72] because I think this is really important,
[251.88 → 254.18] is because it sounds awesome.
[254.32 → 255.38] The performance sounds great.
[255.38 → 257.62] People aren't benchmarking it yet.
[258.82 → 261.50] You'll maybe hear about that later.
[261.88 → 262.54] Super ambiguous.
[262.84 → 264.06] No real details' thing.
[264.38 → 267.88] But yeah, no user benchmarks have happened yet.
[268.88 → 272.44] But they did claim two times the performance of a Titan X
[272.44 → 275.86] and three times the efficiency of a Titan X power efficiency.
[277.12 → 279.22] That did have a little caveat there.
[279.44 → 280.82] That was VR specifically,
[281.12 → 282.56] and we'll get more into it later.
[282.56 → 284.30] There's like a software thing that they're doing
[284.30 → 286.24] that's allowing them to get more performance in VR.
[286.62 → 287.94] Which is still interesting to me.
[288.04 → 288.64] That's fascinating.
[288.64 → 290.84] As someone who definitely has a Five in the mail.
[290.92 → 291.14] Yes.
[291.20 → 292.06] Not in the mail yet,
[292.20 → 293.44] but soon to be in the mail.
[293.56 → 297.58] And talking to some of the NVIDIA guys after the event,
[297.58 → 299.86] Jayce Two Cents and I were like,
[299.98 → 303.58] yo, you didn't talk about DX11 or 12 at all.
[303.76 → 304.98] Because honestly, in their press event,
[305.04 → 306.64] I didn't see enough people complaining about this.
[306.72 → 309.80] They didn't mention those performance metrics once.
[310.24 → 311.94] So we asked them what was going on there,
[311.94 → 317.18] and they said it should be 25, 20, 15% faster
[317.18 → 322.24] than two 980s or a 980 Ti or a Titan X.
[322.30 → 323.14] Which makes sense.
[323.20 → 324.54] Because, I mean, if you look at the specs,
[324.64 → 326.30] it's like, yeah, it's got a lot more clock speed.
[326.80 → 329.24] Yeah, it's on a new process node.
[329.38 → 330.16] 16 nanometre.
[330.28 → 333.18] But they are pulling the same thing
[333.18 → 335.62] that they've now done for three generations,
[335.84 → 336.86] including this one,
[337.20 → 341.66] where they released their second from the top tier chip,
[341.66 → 344.64] which traditionally would have been,
[344.72 → 347.52] like if you go all the way back to the 400 series,
[347.76 → 350.58] that traditionally would have been a 460.
[351.18 → 354.48] Okay, like the equivalent die size chip.
[355.04 → 357.34] So they're releasing that as a high end,
[357.40 → 358.68] and then they're going to follow it up,
[358.88 → 361.46] presumably, with, I can never keep track of there.
[361.46 → 361.96] GP100.
[362.24 → 363.66] Yeah, with a GP100.
[363.66 → 365.26] So the GP104.
[365.40 → 369.38] Yes, so the 1080 and the 1070 are GP104s,
[369.38 → 372.68] and the presumably Titan whatever.
[373.04 → 374.12] Titan Y?
[374.36 → 375.18] Titan Yellow.
[375.48 → 376.40] Titan Mexico?
[376.80 → 378.16] Titan Mexico edition.
[378.34 → 378.98] I don't know.
[379.24 → 380.24] Because it's hot.
[380.52 → 381.82] Oh, stop!
[382.54 → 383.92] So whatever that is,
[384.04 → 385.12] and the 1080 Ti,
[385.50 → 387.20] and whatever else possibly,
[387.58 → 389.04] will be the GP100.
[389.26 → 391.18] By the way, I finally figured it out.
[391.82 → 392.56] Because I was like,
[393.28 → 395.66] they always have these letters in the code names.
[396.00 → 396.32] Okay.
[396.32 → 401.20] It's GeForce Kepler numbers.
[401.32 → 402.44] Oh my god!
[402.56 → 404.42] GeForce Maxwell numbers.
[404.92 → 407.26] That's why the, uh,
[407.32 → 407.88] that's why the
[407.88 → 411.62] that's why the P100 isn't GP100.
[411.88 → 413.92] Because it's just Pascal 100.
[414.42 → 416.20] It is not the gamer skew.
[417.66 → 420.66] Oh my god, that makes so much sense.
[420.66 → 422.16] That was what finally clued me into it.
[422.26 → 423.04] So that's why this is...
[423.04 → 423.82] Did you figure that out or did you read that somewhere?
[423.82 → 425.04] No, I was just thinking about it.
[425.04 → 426.94] I was like, okay, so it's called GP104.
[427.02 → 429.14] Now I get to remember another stupid...
[429.14 → 430.18] I don't, I don't know if...
[430.18 → 430.88] So that's GF.
[431.16 → 431.56] Fermi.
[431.64 → 432.38] GeForce Fermi.
[432.40 → 432.90] I got you.
[433.06 → 433.20] Yeah.
[433.36 → 434.56] But finally makes sense.
[434.56 → 435.38] It all lines up.
[435.40 → 435.96] I am an idiot.
[436.06 → 436.24] Anyway.
[436.36 → 437.78] The chat's probably telling us we're dumb.
[437.86 → 438.42] I know.
[438.88 → 439.78] Here it comes.
[440.06 → 441.14] It's always with the time.
[441.82 → 443.40] Always with the time delay.
[443.40 → 445.38] All right.
[445.42 → 446.60] What else you got from the event there?
[446.68 → 446.86] Okay.
[446.96 → 449.24] So there were four major features.
[449.42 → 450.74] So you guys know most of the specs.
[450.88 → 452.82] It was 8GB GDDR5X.
[452.82 → 453.24] Which faster?
[453.36 → 454.42] I clocked it over 2GB.
[455.42 → 457.58] And that was on the 1080.
[457.80 → 463.60] And then it was 8GB still, but GDDR5, which is probably completely fine.
[463.68 → 463.88] Nope.
[463.88 → 464.58] Wait, no.
[464.68 → 465.72] It's not GDDR5X?
[465.96 → 466.72] Oh, 1070.
[466.98 → 471.36] 1070 is just 8GB of GDDR5, but that's probably completely fine.
[471.68 → 474.22] We'll get benchmarks of that at some point.
[474.90 → 476.26] I don't know when.
[476.40 → 476.70] Sorry.
[477.28 → 477.76] Sorry.
[477.86 → 479.50] I had some paperwork caught in my throat there.
[479.72 → 480.20] Oh.
[480.50 → 480.80] Oh.
[480.96 → 481.22] Oh.
[481.40 → 481.58] Oh.
[482.00 → 482.60] Sly.
[483.60 → 490.88] But one quote that they have is that the GTX 1080, and presumably 1070, is built to make
[490.88 → 495.10] the most of today's multi-monitor setups, curved screens, and head-mounted displays.
[495.10 → 497.52] And that's, like, a thing.
[497.62 → 501.62] The reason why they brought that up was simultaneous multi-projection, which is something that they've
[501.62 → 505.90] been working on, where they can, and they've had stuff like this in the past, but this is
[505.90 → 507.36] much more.
[507.70 → 512.96] So they're making it so that they can render more than one, like, viewing angle at once.
[513.62 → 515.66] So basically, if you have a multi-monitor setup.
[515.86 → 516.10] Oh.
[517.06 → 518.04] Yeah, this is super cool.
[518.34 → 519.20] You're going to like this a lot.
[519.26 → 522.34] If you have a multi-monitor setup, and I explained this in the software video a little
[522.34 → 523.72] bit, but I'm going to go into it more here.
[523.72 → 528.36] If you have a multi-monitor setup, usually with your displays curved on the side, because
[528.36 → 530.10] you'd have them angled in towards you.
[530.18 → 531.56] You mean more like angled on the side.
[531.56 → 532.08] Angled on the side.
[532.08 → 533.48] Because curved displays are a different thing.
[533.50 → 535.38] And curved displays also have this problem, though.
[535.40 → 535.62] Yes.
[535.72 → 536.28] That's true.
[536.46 → 536.66] Yeah.
[537.12 → 537.64] Yeah, that's true.
[537.66 → 538.62] Just slightly differently.
[538.66 → 541.96] Especially, like, I mean, maybe not most of the ones that are out there now, but, like,
[542.00 → 544.92] remember that prototype that Alienware showed off?
[544.98 → 545.98] That super curved one?
[546.00 → 550.48] That would definitely suffer from distortion of the rendering at the edges.
[550.48 → 555.68] And sometimes even just having a crazy widescreen, like playing in 21 by 9 at all, will have these
[555.68 → 556.00] problems.
[556.12 → 557.24] It's not as big of a deal.
[557.36 → 561.38] I didn't really cover this much in the individual video, because it's kind of a use case scenario,
[561.44 → 564.58] depending on what game you play and stuff, if they support that resolution.
[565.18 → 567.32] A lot of times they don't, so it stretches it.
[567.32 → 573.74] And to stretch it, you have these warping problems where the scale is screwed up on a lot of the
[573.74 → 574.48] objects on the sides.
[574.70 → 580.64] Yeah, so, like, the cockpit, like, the bars for the window of the cockpit are, like, this
[580.64 → 582.28] thick on the side.
[582.36 → 582.38] They're massive.
[582.38 → 583.72] They take up almost the entire screen.
[583.72 → 584.04] Yeah.
[584.26 → 584.52] Yeah.
[584.80 → 587.32] And you play Rocket League and everything on the sides is warped out.
[587.36 → 589.42] And this happens when you have multiple displays as well.
[589.42 → 594.08] And it's even worse, because you angle them in, and then things, like, break as they go
[594.08 → 597.96] across the screens, because the angle that you have them on doesn't look right and stuff.
[598.16 → 598.36] Right.
[599.12 → 602.84] Simultaneous multi-projection should theoretically fix all of these things.
[603.32 → 606.32] I don't know how, and I'm sure we'll figure it out eventually.
[606.56 → 606.76] Yeah.
[607.02 → 614.50] But they can figure out the angle of your screens, and they can solve that problem and line everything
[614.50 → 614.98] up for you.
[614.98 → 619.68] So if you're looking at something, even across angled screens, it will be flat.
[619.94 → 620.90] That is incredible.
[621.22 → 626.12] And they fix the there's no more skew, there's no more warping going on, they fix all that
[626.12 → 626.44] kind of stuff.
[626.50 → 627.34] The scale's fixed.
[627.56 → 629.10] I should have put an asterisk on that.
[629.18 → 629.88] That's incredible.
[630.04 → 631.18] Wow, that's incredible.
[632.10 → 633.00] Tell me more.
[633.62 → 635.46] If it works, we need to test it.
[635.52 → 638.64] If it works, if, does it require game dev support?
[638.78 → 639.90] Do we even know this yet?
[640.12 → 641.14] Can we talk about this yet?
[641.14 → 642.98] I don't know if we know that yet.
[643.10 → 643.46] Okay.
[643.66 → 644.60] What else we got?
[644.98 → 646.14] Um, then, then...
[646.14 → 647.88] Let's talk about the one you're stoked on.
[648.98 → 649.24] Angel?
[649.46 → 649.76] Yeah.
[649.90 → 651.80] Okay, so Angel's really cool.
[652.24 → 655.12] Um, I don't know if we have the games that are supported for it right now.
[655.34 → 657.30] This one does need dev support.
[657.54 → 659.26] I don't see a game list here.
[659.44 → 661.78] I did mention the entire game list in my video.
[662.14 → 663.44] One of them is like The Division.
[664.18 → 665.50] Um, wow.
[665.72 → 667.16] I'm not going to remember the other ones right now.
[667.20 → 667.80] One of them is The Division.
[667.80 → 668.86] I'll try and pull it up.
[668.90 → 669.94] Just talk about the feature for now.
[670.02 → 670.30] I'll...
[670.30 → 670.80] I got this.
[670.80 → 675.96] What Angel is, is essentially an incredibly badass screenshot software.
[676.10 → 679.18] Which, when he told me about it, I was like, okay.
[679.18 → 684.92] Yeah, I had to asterisk that with like, trust me, it's interesting in the video as well.
[685.18 → 686.66] Because like, no, it's actually really cool.
[687.06 → 688.14] It can screenshot things.
[688.22 → 689.92] I don't remember the exact resolution.
[690.10 → 693.66] But it's up to, up to 32 times your monitor's resolution.
[693.86 → 697.00] And then there's another resolution number, which is like whatever one you hit first.
[697.00 → 701.16] But it's like 65,000 by 32,000 or something ridiculous.
[701.38 → 702.18] I don't remember what it is.
[702.18 → 705.22] So they showed it off with this ginormous canvas.
[705.50 → 707.84] About 15 by 3 meters.
[708.00 → 708.94] Created using Angel.
[709.04 → 712.84] That has a 2 gigapixel capture from The Witcher 3.
[713.40 → 714.44] Now, to be clear.
[715.08 → 722.02] None of this is going to make your game that you're playing run at that kind of resolution.
[722.14 → 722.40] No.
[722.52 → 724.50] That is not how it works.
[724.50 → 730.34] But in much the same way that Dynamic Super Resolution, which they launched with the 980,
[730.80 → 733.22] can take more samples.
[733.42 → 739.80] Like it can kind of go, okay, what if we were rendering the game at four times the resolution?
[740.52 → 743.40] Because you're basically running a render of the scene.
[743.60 → 743.84] Yes.
[743.96 → 749.84] And then instead of just having it go from your view, it's rendering everything.
[749.84 → 756.96] So the camera will actually, what you do in order to perform an Angel screenshot isn't just press print screen.
[757.30 → 760.04] They wanted to say this a million times during the show.
[760.24 → 760.38] Yeah.
[760.44 → 761.72] They're like, no more print screen button.
[762.14 → 764.06] Although hopefully you can bind it or something.
[764.64 → 765.58] Because that would be cool.
[765.76 → 767.08] But it like pauses the game.
[767.40 → 768.30] You get a free cam.
[768.30 → 772.40] So say you have like, say I'm like punching you and my head's down here.
[772.66 → 776.68] You could change the camera so that instead of like being out here, and it's a fighting game,
[776.68 → 778.32] the camera's now looking up at me.
[778.70 → 780.78] An angle that you would never be able to get traditionally.
[781.34 → 785.84] It would then move the once you tell it to take the screenshot, it would then move the camera around
[785.84 → 788.22] and make sure that it gets everything from every different angle.
[788.22 → 795.74] And one situation that they showed with the Witcher is they took a screenshot like really far out of what I believe was a castle going off of memory.
[796.04 → 796.14] Yeah.
[796.22 → 797.50] And then they were like, okay.
[797.72 → 802.90] But because of the insane resolution, you can zoom all the way in through this window
[802.90 → 805.86] and then look at a book and see the printing on the book.
[807.10 → 808.50] Which is super cool.
[808.60 → 808.94] Really cool.
[809.10 → 812.98] And this allows you to do things like, there's really not that many notes,
[812.98 → 819.38] but there's something called EXR, which for camera people means that it has like amazingly good colour information.
[819.52 → 821.78] It's basically like taking a, a raw photo.
[822.04 → 822.32] Right.
[822.46 → 826.06] So you could essentially like to change the lighting in the scenes.
[826.22 → 826.36] Right.
[826.42 → 830.30] You can make it basically be day, even if the photo was taken like at night.
[831.02 → 833.78] And you can do a lot of really cool things in terms of cropping.
[833.90 → 836.20] You can even take 360-degree photos.
[837.08 → 840.66] So if you want to like, one thing that I thought of would have been really cool,
[840.66 → 843.18] you have to enable it, the game developer has to enable it.
[843.24 → 844.00] So this wouldn't be possible.
[844.00 → 844.98] So I've got that list.
[845.24 → 847.06] Witcher 3 was used to show it off.
[847.16 → 850.78] Other games that have announced Angel support include The Division, The Witness, Lawbreakers,
[851.14 → 855.06] Paragon, No Man's Sky, Unreal Tournament, and Abduction.
[856.12 → 857.28] So there you go.
[858.16 → 862.66] There's, at the event, someone asked if it would work with Shadow play.
[862.84 → 866.16] So you could go back into a Shadow play recording and then run Angel.
[866.68 → 868.90] And they said that they would not comment on it yet.
[868.90 → 871.00] That doesn't seem like it should work.
[871.00 → 871.84] That doesn't seem possible.
[872.94 → 874.64] That really doesn't seem like it should work.
[874.78 → 875.10] No.
[875.34 → 880.74] Because I thought the way Shadow play is working is it's basically just an H.264 encoding of...
[880.74 → 886.08] I was surprised that the guy seemed enthusiastic when he said that they can't comment on it yet.
[886.08 → 887.56] So I'm not really sure how that works.
[887.62 → 889.46] I would have thought the answer would have been no, you idiot.
[889.62 → 889.96] No. Yes.
[890.22 → 890.90] Like, because...
[890.90 → 892.34] But who knows?
[892.44 → 893.54] Maybe they're changing Shadow play.
[893.54 → 897.84] And maybe NVIDIA hasn't been entirely transparent about how Shadow play works.
[898.06 → 898.24] Yeah.
[898.72 → 900.00] So, I don't know.
[900.14 → 902.22] That seems pretty freaking cool to me.
[902.22 → 904.12] It would be very cool if you could go, like, wow, that was cool.
[904.18 → 906.46] Let me go back and, like, make sure I have a really cool render of that.
[906.68 → 908.54] Because something I would have really liked is...
[909.12 → 911.04] I'm going to talk about Classic WoW again.
[911.38 → 915.44] When Nostrils went down, there was all those, like, people gatherings and all that kind of stuff.
[915.44 → 919.16] They released something called Nostrils Memories, I believe it's called.
[919.28 → 919.36] Yeah.
[919.58 → 922.94] Where you can go back in and, like, be there again.
[923.38 → 925.16] It would be super cool if ANL existed.
[925.44 → 928.86] So you could get, like, crazy angles, like, way above where everyone was.
[928.90 → 929.32] Right.
[929.34 → 930.88] And have fascinating views.
[931.06 → 932.08] It's not built into the game.
[932.26 → 933.18] So it will not work.
[933.36 → 938.34] But that's the first thing I thought of was if this was enabled way back when it definitely didn't exist.
[939.10 → 942.38] It would have been super cool to have this kind of screenshots.
[942.60 → 943.60] Something that you could relive.
[943.60 → 945.96] And you could take a 360-degree photo with ANL.
[945.96 → 950.80] This is going to make people so hungry for, like, 16K monitors.
[951.14 → 951.40] Beautiful games.
[951.40 → 955.00] And, like, 8 to 10 times more powerful GPUs.
[955.06 → 961.30] Because, honestly, going back and playing games that you haven't played since you were running, you know, like...
[961.30 → 964.24] You know, even going back and playing something like Far Cry 1.
[964.66 → 969.30] Which you might have run the first time on, like, a, you know, 6600 GT or something like that.
[969.30 → 976.88] But it is amazing how much more is left in those games when you run them on more powerful hardware.
[977.00 → 978.64] And you really crank up all the details.
[978.82 → 980.48] Especially the engines that scale well.
[980.60 → 983.76] This is not increasing the resolution of the game.
[983.98 → 984.22] No.
[984.34 → 985.82] Not what you're actually running.
[986.00 → 986.20] Yes.
[986.20 → 988.68] It's just taking a very high resolution screenshot.
[988.68 → 993.46] So it's what it would look like if you could do that.
[993.56 → 993.70] Yeah.
[994.04 → 997.50] So, like, one really cool thing, too, is you can take these photos.
[997.84 → 1000.32] And then there's an app for your phone now.
[1000.72 → 1002.70] NVIDIA VR Viewer, I believe it's called.
[1002.90 → 1005.58] And you can send the ANL screenshot to that app.
[1006.08 → 1008.86] And then view it in, like, a Google Cardboard or something.
[1009.08 → 1010.76] They gave everyone at the event Google Cardboards.
[1010.76 → 1011.02] Very cool.
[1011.02 → 1012.58] So that we would be able to do that.
[1012.72 → 1016.32] Obviously, haven't been able to yet because we don't have it.
[1016.76 → 1018.70] But that will be very cool once you're able to.
[1018.86 → 1020.42] So there's some more VR features.
[1020.74 → 1030.28] Path Traced Audio, which is, you know, for regular two-dimensional gaming, also applicable.
[1030.52 → 1033.76] But for VR is particularly important.
[1034.22 → 1036.28] And, like, needs to be pinpoint accurate.
[1036.54 → 1038.58] So that's very cool that they're working on that.
[1038.58 → 1039.34] One thing that I might...
[1039.34 → 1040.62] I don't have a lot to say about this.
[1040.62 → 1041.74] There's Path Traced Audio.
[1041.98 → 1046.44] It should massively increase the precision of you being able to figure out where things are based on sound.
[1046.64 → 1047.38] Which is super cool.
[1047.58 → 1050.14] Like, you should be able to tell if something's in another room.
[1050.50 → 1050.66] Yeah.
[1050.76 → 1052.06] Or if it's behind something.
[1052.06 → 1052.90] Or if it's behind something.
[1052.90 → 1055.28] Or if it goes from being behind something to being not behind something.
[1055.30 → 1056.02] Yes, exactly.
[1056.16 → 1065.96] Something that, like, all the 3D audio solutions that exist today, quite frankly, just are not good enough at, from my experience.
[1065.96 → 1066.54] And apparently...
[1066.54 → 1067.28] I've heard...
[1067.28 → 1068.34] This is completely hearsay.
[1068.34 → 1083.64] But I've heard that one of the main guys that they have working on this used to work with, like, the U.S. military on, like, sound stuff in terms of, like, taking the reverberation of sounds in order to find snipers and tanks and stuff within cities from, like, super far away.
[1083.94 → 1084.74] So, like...
[1084.74 → 1086.44] Well, I'm glad he's working on something important now.
[1086.44 → 1090.26] Yeah, well, I'm assuming he figured that stuff out.
[1091.12 → 1093.28] But, like, so he's probably pretty good.
[1093.34 → 1093.82] I don't know.
[1094.66 → 1095.72] So that should be cool.
[1095.92 → 1098.24] And one thing that I'm super excited for is...
[1098.24 → 1101.22] I know it sounds really lame visually, but it would actually be a lot of fun to do.
[1101.48 → 1102.44] Is if they release...
[1102.44 → 1108.32] Like, if Disney releases, like, a small tech demo where you get to do the training droid fight...
[1109.50 → 1109.80] Hmm.
[1110.26 → 1111.28] So if it, like...
[1111.28 → 1117.72] If you go to put your helmet on, and then it becomes black, and then you just hear where the training droid is, and it takes shots, and you have to try to block them.
[1117.72 → 1118.70] That would be crazy.
[1118.74 → 1119.74] That would be so much fun!
[1119.80 → 1123.52] It sounds so stupid visually, because you literally put a headset on in order to see blackness.
[1123.64 → 1123.86] Yeah.
[1123.86 → 1125.40] But, like, it would be really fun.
[1125.74 → 1126.82] That would be really fun.
[1126.90 → 1127.14] Yeah.
[1127.38 → 1127.90] I don't know.
[1128.14 → 1134.44] Speaking of really fun, this was originally posted by ALN118.
[1134.54 → 1138.20] The original article here is from Overclock3D.net.
[1138.34 → 1141.24] Let's go ahead and pull this baby up.
[1142.14 → 1148.26] So a member of the VGA tech support team has confirmed that the 1080 will be limited...
[1148.26 → 1151.20] And assuming the rest of the lineup...
[1151.20 → 1153.16] Will be limited to two-way SLI.
[1153.16 → 1153.60] Hmm.
[1153.76 → 1161.10] And they said that we can confirm that 1080 cards only support up to two-way SLI, and anything above this will not work, no matter the SLI bridge.
[1161.20 → 1164.44] Just to explain that last point, there's a new SLI bridge.
[1164.90 → 1166.02] Can you use an old one?
[1166.60 → 1167.36] Theoretically, no.
[1167.96 → 1168.48] I've heard.
[1168.76 → 1169.88] I don't know.
[1170.08 → 1170.98] No one really knows.
[1171.36 → 1176.72] I even contacted them, seeing if we could get another card to test SLI, because it's supposed to be new and improved and stuff.
[1176.92 → 1177.08] Yeah.
[1177.08 → 1178.04] And they're like, no.
[1178.38 → 1179.54] No one's getting that yet.
[1179.96 → 1183.04] They will be eventually, but they're like, well, we want to keep...
[1183.04 → 1186.50] Fair ground, so you guys can't be the only one with SLI tests.
[1187.50 → 1187.94] Yeah.
[1190.24 → 1192.54] And I was told in that I would need the new SLI bridge.
[1192.64 → 1194.56] So yeah, I think you have to use the new SLI bridge.
[1194.68 → 1194.80] Okay.
[1194.88 → 1196.42] It hasn't been, like, outright confirmed.
[1196.76 → 1197.12] Interesting.
[1197.12 → 1200.68] The SLI bridge has been with us for, like, 10 years, I think.
[1200.90 → 1201.30] Yes.
[1201.50 → 1201.58] And...
[1201.58 → 1203.58] It goes all the way back to a...
[1203.58 → 1206.20] 6,000 series.
[1206.32 → 1206.82] That's an old...
[1206.82 → 1208.36] Holy crap!
[1208.72 → 1211.12] And something that I did notice was if you look...
[1211.66 → 1214.68] You might be able to pull this up right now, maybe not.
[1214.68 → 1217.30] If you look at my coverage of the...
[1217.30 → 1219.14] When we're having the talk with all of us in the room...
[1219.14 → 1219.64] Yeah.
[1219.64 → 1222.60] I have some B-roll of a system that was built by BS Mods.
[1222.66 → 1223.08] They're awesome.
[1223.18 → 1223.74] Check them out.
[1224.56 → 1227.54] And it has two cards in it in SLI.
[1227.98 → 1229.80] Not three, not four, only two.
[1229.98 → 1231.96] And it has the new SLI bridge on it.
[1232.08 → 1232.24] Yeah.
[1232.24 → 1233.14] And it's big.
[1233.14 → 1237.14] And that matters because I was checking out my sample card.
[1237.34 → 1238.82] Because when I first read this, I was like, what?
[1238.96 → 1240.10] Mine had two fingers on it.
[1240.60 → 1241.20] And it does.
[1241.28 → 1241.92] I double-checked.
[1241.92 → 1243.50] It has two SLI fingers on it.
[1244.30 → 1245.88] But the SLI bridge was big.
[1246.06 → 1248.66] So I think what they're really doing is just teaming the SLI lanes.
[1248.68 → 1251.04] Yeah, because they even said it's double the...
[1251.04 → 1252.42] Really?
[1252.42 → 1254.34] So they're just teaming the SLI lanes.
[1254.46 → 1255.44] Like, I'm pretty sure.
[1255.52 → 1256.20] It's not confirmed.
[1256.56 → 1257.92] But, like, that...
[1257.92 → 1259.18] The bridge is big.
[1259.30 → 1261.38] Meaning it's probably taking up both of them.
[1261.38 → 1263.36] And there are two fingers on my card.
[1263.44 → 1265.12] I don't have it here, but, like, I guarantee you.
[1265.12 → 1268.70] Do you think they're going to let us just put on two old bridges?
[1269.04 → 1271.48] Or do you think they did something stupid like...
[1271.48 → 1275.62] Like, cross the paths internally on the bridge, so people can't do that easily?
[1275.62 → 1281.34] I'm assuming there is some type of internal logic that teams them together.
[1281.76 → 1282.14] Okay.
[1282.92 → 1283.28] Which...
[1283.28 → 1285.40] But then does that mean you have to buy it separately?
[1285.56 → 1285.84] Probably.
[1286.26 → 1287.00] I mean...
[1287.00 → 1289.68] I don't know if motherboard manufacturers are going to include that.
[1290.34 → 1290.72] Oh, man.
[1290.72 → 1292.16] Especially at different spacings, right?
[1292.26 → 1292.68] I mean, that's the thing.
[1292.76 → 1294.34] I love progress as much as anyone.
[1294.52 → 1300.42] But when you have such a staple as the SLI bridge...
[1300.42 → 1303.82] Like, I have, like, multiple bins of SLI bridges.
[1303.90 → 1305.88] And you have your favourite ones in different colours.
[1305.88 → 1309.04] Like, I got my old DFI LAN party one with the black PCB.
[1309.38 → 1310.84] Like, huh.
[1311.08 → 1312.88] And one thing that was interesting was...
[1312.88 → 1322.58] I expected before I went to the event that in our, like, goodie bag, which had the April Fool's energy drink and, like, the Cliff Bar and stuff, which is actually kind of funny...
[1322.58 → 1326.06] They were going to be giving us an SLI bridge.
[1326.20 → 1326.42] Right.
[1326.42 → 1330.58] But the reason why I thought that was because on the like, press sign-up page...
[1330.58 → 1330.70] Right.
[1330.70 → 1336.12] ...there was a question asking us what our favourite motherboard spacing for two-way SLI was.
[1337.58 → 1338.28] And then no.
[1338.94 → 1339.72] And then no.
[1339.86 → 1340.04] Oh.
[1340.04 → 1345.74] So I'm wondering if they were polling everyone that went to the event to figure out which spacings they should have more available.
[1348.38 → 1351.92] I hope this isn't something that you have to buy from NVIDIA.com or something.
[1352.06 → 1353.02] Yeah, that would suck.
[1353.18 → 1353.60] I'm not...
[1353.60 → 1356.46] Okay, personally, I'm not super worried that we're now limited to two.
[1356.98 → 1357.22] Yeah.
[1357.22 → 1359.72] Because three and four is pretty dumb anyway.
[1359.72 → 1361.50] We've talked about it time and time again.
[1361.62 → 1363.76] Three and four is not good.
[1363.76 → 1370.02] And even if the FPS number is higher, like, people who send me their system config, and they're like,
[1370.08 → 1373.42] Yeah, I'm getting three because I'm a super BA dude.
[1373.44 → 1374.44] You end up getting a lot of...
[1374.44 → 1377.26] I'm like, no, actually, you just get stuttering, and it's just...
[1377.26 → 1377.28] Yeah.
[1377.32 → 1380.22] And compatibility issues, and it's just bad.
[1380.36 → 1382.06] Go back and watch the compensator.
[1382.18 → 1383.32] That had four...
[1383.32 → 1384.12] Four cards, yeah.
[1384.22 → 1385.36] Four 980...
[1385.36 → 1387.02] Four tight Nexus, I think.
[1387.46 → 1388.14] I think so, yeah.
[1388.20 → 1388.30] Yeah.
[1388.30 → 1391.00] Four tight Nexus and, like, it was unplayable in anything.
[1391.44 → 1391.64] Yeah.
[1391.64 → 1394.26] Because so much stuttering and, like, just...
[1394.26 → 1397.24] It was gross to play anything on that machine.
[1397.60 → 1402.92] And I'm hoping that if they're limited to two now, they will just focus on two.
[1403.06 → 1407.20] And that would completely explain the limitation to two as well.
[1407.64 → 1409.06] If it's just two old bridges.
[1409.12 → 1409.28] Yeah.
[1409.40 → 1410.24] Because you couldn't...
[1410.24 → 1410.38] Yeah.
[1410.50 → 1411.22] Okay, okay.
[1411.36 → 1412.94] Okay, I think you cracked the code.
[1413.10 → 1413.54] I think so.
[1413.60 → 1417.38] Speaking of cracking the code, if you were thinking to yourself,
[1417.38 → 1422.48] gee, I sure wish I could launch a new career as a code cracker.
[1423.26 → 1427.92] I actually don't know that Lynda.com has code cracking courses, but...
[1427.92 → 1429.88] But you could learn programming.
[1430.28 → 1430.48] Yes.
[1430.48 → 1433.46] Which could maybe lead you into that kind of field.
[1433.52 → 1436.56] I wasn't even going to try and bring it into something they actually teach.
[1436.68 → 1437.46] We did it, though.
[1437.46 → 1438.20] But we did it.
[1438.40 → 1438.84] We did it.
[1439.02 → 1441.68] So they've got web development, photography, visual design...
[1441.68 → 1442.32] They teach you Excel.
[1442.42 → 1442.68] Business.
[1442.72 → 1444.36] That's where you can store your cracked codes.
[1444.56 → 1447.34] Training software, like, Photoshop.
[1447.54 → 1454.36] Word is where you could, like, write documentation for other people in terms of, like, how you crack the code.
[1454.36 → 1458.06] So all the courses are taught by industry experts with new courses added every week.
[1458.10 → 1463.20] And whether you're setting new financial goals for yourself, finding work-life balance, investing in a new hobby,
[1463.36 → 1467.70] or you just want to ask your boss for a raise, Lynda.com could be your path to it.
[1467.74 → 1472.66] They've got tons of great features, like being able to browse along with the course transcript
[1472.66 → 1475.76] and just click anywhere on the text and stick to that point in the video.
[1475.92 → 1477.40] I've used that many times, actually.
[1477.52 → 1483.22] The ability to download to your iOS or Android app and watch offline when you're on a bus, say, for example.
[1483.22 → 1485.04] Time that would have been otherwise wasted.
[1485.48 → 1487.50] And plans start at only $25 a month.
[1487.58 → 1492.10] So all you've got to do to get a 10-day free trial is head over to Lynda.com slash Sancho,
[1492.24 → 1494.76] which we will have linked in the video description.
[1495.68 → 1496.08] Description.
[1497.38 → 1497.82] Description.
[1498.34 → 1500.80] Our next sponsor is Tunnel Bear.
[1500.92 → 1502.22] The bears that tunnel.
[1502.38 → 1503.38] Boy, do they ever.
[1503.72 → 1507.44] Tunnel Bear is the easy-to-use VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[1507.44 → 1512.54] It lets you tunnel through up to 20 different countries for your Internet access.
[1512.54 → 1513.24] That's not up to you.
[1513.30 → 1514.46] Just do one of them at a time.
[1514.54 → 1516.06] So any of 20 different countries.
[1516.58 → 1520.46] And that means that you can use online services and browse the Internet as though you're there.
[1520.76 → 1521.52] So they make it easy.
[1521.62 → 1525.08] There's no DNS configuration, port forwarding, or any other nonsense like that.
[1525.14 → 1529.94] You download the app, which is available for the PC, Mac, iOS, Android.
[1530.04 → 1531.34] They've even got a Chrome extension.
[1531.34 → 1536.80] And then you just go, I want to be from, oh gee, I don't know, the United States.
[1536.92 → 1542.38] Because I love, you know, U.S. web services, say for example.
[1542.72 → 1547.88] And boom, your connection gets encrypted, and your public IP switches to an American one.
[1548.16 → 1550.58] That allows you to watch stuff like Comedy Central, I think.
[1550.68 → 1551.40] That's right.
[1551.40 → 1565.24] And you can try out Tunnel Bear for free to find out if it's right for you with 500 megabytes of data and no credit card required by heading over to tunnelbear.com slash when, where you can also save 10% on your paid unlimited Tunnel Bear subscription.
[1566.24 → 1573.66] Speaking of unlimited, we don't have unlimited time in the day.
[1574.04 → 1574.74] What are we talking about?
[1575.36 → 1576.10] Fresh books.
[1576.30 → 1576.66] Fresh books.
[1576.66 → 1577.92] Yeah, fresh books.
[1578.16 → 1578.36] Yeah.
[1578.50 → 1583.64] Because you don't have unlimited time to monetize your whatever he was talking about, let's just do them both.
[1584.20 → 1591.88] Fresh books lets you stay organized, save time, and make more money by focusing your effort on your own business.
[1591.88 → 1592.12] Coo-cracking.
[1592.44 → 1597.34] Whether it's plumbing, whether it's, you know, making arts and crafty type thing and selling them.
[1597.34 → 1600.22] Whether it's, you know, I don't know, house painting.
[1600.40 → 1602.52] Whether it's small IT service.
[1602.80 → 1603.22] Whether it's...
[1603.22 → 1603.82] Grooming dogs.
[1604.08 → 1605.56] You know whether it's dog grooming.
[1605.56 → 1617.92] Fresh books is a cloud tool that lets you track your expenses, keep track of your invoices for your clients, email invoices to your clients, get paid directly through fresh books, and basically make your life easier.
[1618.06 → 1629.68] If you're not the kind of person who finishes a long day of teaching dance lessons in your garage and sits, wants to sit down in front of the computer and do some accounting.
[1629.68 → 1631.90] Yeah, that sounds kind of like...
[1631.90 → 1635.02] Which is not a thing that most small business owners are really that into.
[1635.12 → 1641.58] Because let's face it, if you were a small business owner who was into accounting, you would start up a business as an accountant, wouldn't you?
[1641.64 → 1643.18] That actually makes a ton of sense.
[1643.36 → 1644.06] Makes a ton of sense.
[1644.08 → 1644.54] You know what?
[1644.58 → 1647.76] After a long day of doing accounting, you probably don't want to do your own accounting.
[1649.24 → 1650.72] Isn't that such a thing, though?
[1650.80 → 1653.34] That actually might be quite legitimate.
[1653.34 → 1653.74] Yeah.
[1654.28 → 1656.18] You know, it's hilarious, though.
[1656.78 → 1660.44] Okay, the mechanic driving the beater is less offensive.
[1661.16 → 1661.84] But like...
[1661.84 → 1662.52] Or less...
[1662.52 → 1662.84] Not...
[1662.84 → 1664.08] Is more offensive, rather.
[1664.44 → 1668.38] But like, would you let a dentist work on your teeth that had terrible teeth?
[1669.18 → 1669.54] Oh.
[1670.26 → 1672.42] But they can't even work on their own teeth anyway.
[1672.64 → 1675.26] They could be a great dentist, but have a bad dentist.
[1675.26 → 1678.62] There was that Russian surgeon that operated on himself in Antarctica.
[1679.50 → 1681.22] Like, removed his appendix or something.
[1681.80 → 1683.20] I think that's the exception.
[1683.64 → 1684.46] Not the rule.
[1685.12 → 1685.60] Okay.
[1685.86 → 1686.30] Maybe.
[1688.18 → 1689.32] That guy's crazy.
[1689.84 → 1693.26] Speaking of exceptions and not the rule...
[1694.48 → 1696.16] I'm just going to fire this up.
[1696.44 → 1702.36] Most of our content is available to everyone on YouTube.
[1702.36 → 1707.56] Some of it, like Nerd Sports, is only available on Vessel.
[1707.78 → 1711.32] And Episode 4, Hockey, is out.
[1711.40 → 1718.88] Now, I can't tell you guys how to, you know, sort of manage your subscriptions to services.
[1719.26 → 1726.20] But what I can say is Vessel offers a one-week free trial that gives you early access up to a week to a ton of content creators.
[1726.20 → 1727.70] Not just all of our channels.
[1727.70 → 1733.02] And if you were to start your one-week trial now, you would be able to check out...
[1733.02 → 1735.48] I'm just going to screen share with you guys here.
[1735.54 → 1738.60] I'm going to try not to have it go to forever.
[1738.76 → 1739.00] No!
[1739.08 → 1739.52] Wait!
[1740.80 → 1744.92] Would allow you to check out all four of the episodes that are already up on Vessel.
[1744.92 → 1753.84] And it would allow you to have a subscription still when the fifth and final of our first portion of the series comes out very shortly.
[1754.26 → 1755.64] So here's some teaser footage.
[1755.74 → 1759.48] That's the team we played against, which was super terrifying, by the way.
[1759.66 → 1761.80] In case you guys were, like, wondering about that.
[1762.24 → 1766.48] And this is sort of more along the lines of what you can expect from us.
[1766.48 → 1775.56] I'm sorry the bitrate's really low.
[1775.70 → 1780.80] The connection here at the hotel in Mexico is not exactly that great.
[1780.88 → 1781.66] And we are streaming.
[1781.94 → 1782.80] So we're actually...
[1782.80 → 1785.42] It's actually kind of a miracle that that loaded it all.
[1785.78 → 1786.78] So you can check it out.
[1786.84 → 1789.28] The link's going to be in the video description over on YouTube.
[1789.52 → 1790.72] But it's vessel.com.
[1790.78 → 1791.92] It's not exactly complicated.
[1791.92 → 1793.56] All right.
[1793.68 → 1795.80] So let's move on to some of our...
[1795.80 → 1796.72] Well, I posted in the chat, too.
[1796.82 → 1798.34] Some of our additional topics here.
[1800.16 → 1802.26] But I guess for the YouTube viewers, it'll be down below.
[1802.92 → 1804.00] Here we go.
[1804.22 → 1806.32] This is freaking cool.
[1807.04 → 1809.36] So the original here is from Gimme.
[1809.56 → 1814.14] I'm just going to fire this up here and start up my battery bank again.
[1814.22 → 1817.72] I think I'm triggering either overheating or overcurrent protection.
[1818.06 → 1820.72] Trying to keep my laptop juiced up here.
[1820.72 → 1823.06] So this is a very early test.
[1823.20 → 1826.06] It's called a propulsion open air test or POST.
[1826.56 → 1835.42] It does use electromagnets to propel a sled at 115 miles per gallon, apparently, considering Colton wrote it.
[1835.48 → 1844.52] But it's actually 115 miles per hour or 185 kilometres per hour, which is pretty damn impressive, along a test track running 1,500 feet long.
[1844.64 → 1848.68] So this isn't actually to test, like, how fast it can go.
[1848.68 → 1853.98] This is more of like a stepping stone theory kind of deal.
[1854.14 → 1860.64] So they're going to add on to it and add on to it and add on to it and add on to it and grow and prove the theory as they grow.
[1860.82 → 1863.24] This is just kind of an early stage thing.
[1863.38 → 1864.52] So I know people would be like,
[1864.52 → 1870.18] I thought they were claiming it would go much faster than that, like 700 miles per hour.
[1870.30 → 1870.90] And you're right.
[1871.92 → 1872.36] They were.
[1872.44 → 1873.22] What voice is that?
[1873.36 → 1874.06] I don't know.
[1874.50 → 1875.16] That was awful.
[1875.32 → 1875.78] I don't know.
[1875.78 → 1878.82] And hopefully they will grow up to that point.
[1879.42 → 1881.12] But this is, yeah, this is an early on thing.
[1881.26 → 1882.04] It's open air.
[1882.14 → 1883.36] It's supposed to be in a vacuum tube.
[1883.48 → 1888.16] Like one of the main points of this whole thing is that it's in a vacuum tube.
[1888.32 → 1889.92] They don't have that part going quite yet.
[1890.00 → 1891.30] So, yeah, it's fine.
[1891.54 → 1895.42] They're just testing like the sand shark sled and all that kind of stuff.
[1895.42 → 1896.84] Okay, battery's critical.
[1897.50 → 1898.82] Oh my goodness.
[1900.04 → 1902.54] Oh, this is going to be awkward.
[1902.70 → 1905.50] Okay, do you want to give them some more specs on that?
[1905.62 → 1906.46] Okay, yeah.
[1906.60 → 1909.48] So it's about 10 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada.
[1911.74 → 1913.60] Claiming a bunch of stuff that we've already heard about.
[1913.72 → 1916.72] Apparently the experiment, when the capsule is created,
[1917.22 → 1921.00] will be using a compressor to create a stronger vacuum ahead of the vehicle
[1921.00 → 1924.02] to cut down the air resistance, all this kind of stuff we already knew.
[1924.02 → 1927.26] Even the test system will include a passenger and cargo compartment
[1927.26 → 1928.94] and batteries to power the system
[1928.94 → 1934.24] and contain a levitation device to lift the capsule off the guardrails,
[1934.38 → 1937.42] which will probably be air bursts or something along those lines.
[1937.58 → 1938.50] Air bursts or magnets.
[1940.00 → 1942.16] But I believe last time I heard it was air bursts.
[1942.68 → 1943.92] So that should be pretty cool.
[1944.28 → 1949.06] We have a picture here, which I will try to bring up.
[1949.18 → 1952.70] Although I'm using Linus' laptop, I'm not sure how things are set up.
[1952.70 → 1955.70] So, I'm going to go...
[1955.70 → 1956.24] News item.
[1958.58 → 1959.28] Already did that.
[1959.58 → 1960.30] Oh, okay.
[1960.46 → 1961.08] Okay, so...
[1961.08 → 1962.66] No worries, there you go.
[1962.70 → 1967.78] So there's the sled, which is obviously not going to carry huge amounts of cargo
[1967.78 → 1970.76] or people or literally anything.
[1971.22 → 1973.24] Kind of looks like a little cute spider thing.
[1973.24 → 1977.68] But yeah, like I said, they're going to grow on that and move from there.
[1977.88 → 1980.84] So this is cool, but it might not have been what you expected,
[1981.02 → 1982.72] but it is still very cool.
[1982.92 → 1986.02] Their video for it is like massively overproduced, which is kind of fun.
[1986.24 → 1987.40] But, you know, whatever.
[1987.62 → 1988.14] All right.
[1988.38 → 1990.22] Amazon Direct Video Service.
[1990.56 → 1993.92] So this was originally posted by Sam A.L. on the forum.
[1994.04 → 1996.00] The original article here is from The Verge.
[1996.00 → 2000.04] Let me just go ahead and bring up that news item here.
[2000.24 → 2004.72] Amazon challenges YouTube by offering uploaders a cut of the ads.
[2004.98 → 2008.20] Which I don't think is right at all.
[2008.64 → 2012.68] That is a very sensationalist and honestly a little bit misleading headline
[2012.68 → 2019.06] because speaking as a YouTuber, I'm just going to throw this out there.
[2020.20 → 2025.56] I'm pretty sure that checks show up monthly from YouTube
[2025.56 → 2030.44] where they give us a cut of, and I think it's to do with the ads on the videos.
[2030.62 → 2031.12] Maybe the ads.
[2031.24 → 2034.06] I mean, if it's not to do with the ads on the videos, I'm sorry, Kaiser.
[2034.66 → 2036.86] I'm just going to disable them from now on
[2036.86 → 2039.90] because apparently it's just coming from magic.
[2039.90 → 2044.40] So let's go through Colton's notes on this thing,
[2044.48 → 2045.60] see if we can demystify this.
[2045.96 → 2049.88] We'll let video creators share content and receive a cut of the revenue.
[2050.14 → 2050.34] Okay.
[2050.90 → 2053.50] Offering creators a variety of ways to earn money,
[2053.58 → 2056.64] including royalties through streaming to Prime members.
[2057.18 → 2058.00] That's cool.
[2058.30 → 2063.62] Because right now YouTube does not have a subscription service
[2063.62 → 2067.82] that gives YouTubers a cut of the royalties for the monthly.
[2067.92 → 2068.26] Oh, wait.
[2068.34 → 2068.96] Hold on a second.
[2069.34 → 2069.72] Huh.
[2069.90 → 2071.46] YouTube Rouge?
[2071.68 → 2072.18] Is it Rouge?
[2072.20 → 2074.28] Rouge Red Tube?
[2074.48 → 2075.00] Is that it?
[2075.12 → 2075.28] Oh.
[2075.72 → 2076.40] Oh, my.
[2076.46 → 2077.00] No, no.
[2077.06 → 2077.72] Don't go there.
[2077.82 → 2078.04] Oh, my.
[2078.04 → 2079.16] Unless you want to.
[2079.64 → 2080.32] Oh, my.
[2080.36 → 2081.34] And you're overage.
[2081.86 → 2082.30] Interesting.
[2082.82 → 2083.24] Uh-huh.
[2083.34 → 2083.62] Sorry.
[2084.02 → 2085.48] But with that said, with that said,
[2085.70 → 2089.34] I mean, if we had Amazon Prime subscribers in our audience
[2089.34 → 2093.46] and we were to do some kind of YouTube Red series or something,
[2093.46 → 2097.24] which we don't have in the works at all, by the way.
[2097.74 → 2100.06] Seriously, we have nothing going on with YouTube Red.
[2100.06 → 2103.32] They wouldn't be able to access it unless they had YouTube Red as well.
[2103.40 → 2103.78] That's right.
[2103.88 → 2106.92] So if we were to say, okay, yeah, it'll be on Prime, and it'll be on YouTube Red,
[2106.98 → 2108.38] all of a sudden we're giving people choices.
[2108.38 → 2112.56] And if they already have Prime anyway because they shop at Amazon all the time,
[2112.74 → 2114.04] then that's cool.
[2114.78 → 2117.16] So the revenue sharing will be through rentals, purchases, subscriptions,
[2117.44 → 2118.54] and ad impressions.
[2118.54 → 2121.04] So it sounds like it could be free to use.
[2121.10 → 2123.76] You probably won't need a Prime membership.
[2123.92 → 2128.70] And Amazon definitely has the video serving horses to make something like this happen.
[2128.78 → 2129.58] So that's pretty cool.
[2131.06 → 2134.34] I don't know at all.
[2134.34 → 2137.12] But just reading this and looking at what Amazon's doing,
[2137.42 → 2142.96] I'm getting the vibe that they're not targeting people like us.
[2143.28 → 2143.68] Right.
[2143.84 → 2148.04] I think they're targeting more of a Vimeo crowd than a YouTube crowd.
[2148.22 → 2151.96] Because looking at the pictures that they're using as their samples and stuff,
[2152.06 → 2156.42] it's not like super fun, we did weird thing.
[2156.52 → 2158.32] I don't know what stuff is super popular on YouTube.
[2159.18 → 2160.38] Kids stuff.
[2160.54 → 2160.98] React.
[2161.24 → 2162.04] React things.
[2162.18 → 2163.14] Are we allowed to say React?
[2163.14 → 2163.54] It doesn't seem like that at all.
[2163.70 → 2164.22] I don't know.
[2164.34 → 2166.70] It doesn't seem like any of that at all.
[2166.76 → 2170.04] It seems like little user-created shows.
[2170.76 → 2174.06] So if Rocket Jump made longer episodes.
[2174.68 → 2178.44] So more like podcasts or like...
[2178.44 → 2179.38] Maybe podcasts?
[2179.64 → 2180.32] That would make sense.
[2180.34 → 2181.42] Or like...
[2181.42 → 2181.98] So maybe this.
[2182.30 → 2183.20] Episodic content.
[2183.30 → 2184.04] Episodic content.
[2184.40 → 2186.80] Or like shows or like very, very...
[2186.80 → 2188.80] Like higher production value.
[2188.92 → 2190.00] Oh, that's not good.
[2190.46 → 2191.74] Is that battery dying as well?
[2191.80 → 2192.34] I think so.
[2192.34 → 2194.58] Oh, that could be bad.
[2194.64 → 2198.00] We might be an audio only cast for a little bit here.
[2198.64 → 2200.04] While I summon...
[2200.04 → 2202.46] While I summon Brandon to bring us another battery.
[2202.46 → 2203.54] Anyway, I'm going to keep talking.
[2203.90 → 2206.16] It seems like, yeah, higher production quality.
[2206.16 → 2207.86] Not really like...
[2207.86 → 2212.08] Reviews or like short kind of contained videos.
[2212.24 → 2215.94] It seems like they're still leaving that market up to YouTube.
[2217.08 → 2217.72] So...
[2217.72 → 2218.62] Hi, pardon.
[2219.18 → 2219.52] Hello.
[2219.52 → 2219.60] Hello.
[2220.90 → 2221.52] It's okay.
[2221.86 → 2222.36] It's all good.
[2222.36 → 2224.06] We call Benet.
[2224.66 → 2225.66] Uh...
[2225.66 → 2226.08] Ooh.
[2226.40 → 2226.98] Um...
[2226.98 → 2228.66] So...
[2228.66 → 2228.88] Yeah.
[2229.06 → 2231.16] I think they're still leaving that kind of stuff up to YouTube.
[2231.54 → 2233.36] I think it's going to be...
[2233.36 → 2233.58] Yeah.
[2233.72 → 2234.92] More high production quality.
[2235.14 → 2235.44] Like...
[2235.44 → 2236.32] Like...
[2236.32 → 2237.12] Short movies.
[2237.94 → 2240.20] Is basically what I kind of think they're going for.
[2240.90 → 2241.38] Anyway.
[2242.12 → 2242.74] Moving on.
[2242.74 → 2246.68] An Oxford study finds that virtual reality can help treat severe paranoia.
[2246.90 → 2248.56] If you just like share...
[2248.56 → 2248.94] Okay.
[2249.10 → 2249.24] Yeah.
[2249.32 → 2249.98] That kind of works.
[2250.52 → 2250.84] Hold on.
[2250.86 → 2251.10] Hold on.
[2251.12 → 2251.68] I got this.
[2252.26 → 2252.52] Okay.
[2252.96 → 2253.30] Okay.
[2253.30 → 2253.36] Okay.
[2253.86 → 2254.72] We're back.
[2255.08 → 2255.40] Nice.
[2255.44 → 2255.82] We're back.
[2255.88 → 2256.60] We're back in action.
[2257.26 → 2257.54] Um...
[2257.54 → 2257.76] No.
[2257.84 → 2258.30] Never mind.
[2258.40 → 2258.68] Never mind.
[2258.76 → 2259.56] Brandon says he can't.
[2261.24 → 2263.06] I'm just telling him we're switching to the webcam.
[2263.66 → 2264.12] There we go.
[2264.18 → 2265.10] We're improvising.
[2265.64 → 2267.18] We're improvising in Mexico.
[2267.88 → 2268.30] All right.
[2268.48 → 2268.96] So...
[2268.96 → 2270.86] So an Oxford study finds...
[2270.86 → 2272.52] Going to put the mic on top of the computer.
[2272.74 → 2275.58] That's in the water.
[2276.10 → 2277.50] It's WAN showtime again, kids.
[2278.22 → 2278.54] Uh...
[2278.54 → 2280.02] It's also like right in front of your face.
[2280.90 → 2281.22] All right.
[2281.32 → 2281.66] That'll work.
[2281.66 → 2282.58] The first time I put it there.
[2282.74 → 2283.02] Okay.
[2283.52 → 2284.44] So, um...
[2284.44 → 2285.36] What else we got for...
[2285.36 → 2286.32] For topics here?
[2287.66 → 2288.02] Anyway.
[2288.02 → 2288.86] Uh...
[2288.86 → 2289.18] Sorry.
[2289.54 → 2292.18] Oxford study finds virtual reality can help treat...
[2292.18 → 2292.38] So...
[2292.38 → 2292.80] Oh, wow.
[2292.86 → 2293.44] I don't know where to look now.
[2293.44 → 2296.32] Posted by Insanely Secret D on the forum, by the way.
[2296.60 → 2297.40] Insanely Secret D.
[2297.46 → 2298.56] That's a fantastic name.
[2298.66 → 2299.34] The Secret D.
[2299.34 → 2299.74] Anyway.
[2299.86 → 2302.72] VR can help treat severe paranoia by allowing...
[2302.72 → 2304.44] People to face situations that they fear.
[2304.74 → 2306.44] Now, severe paranoia is like...
[2306.44 → 2307.16] Oh, you have to fix that one.
[2307.16 → 2307.68] I'm working on it.
[2307.68 → 2307.96] Um...
[2307.96 → 2310.50] Is like 1 to 2% of the population.
[2311.04 → 2311.40] Um...
[2311.40 → 2313.02] So that's actually pretty significant.
[2313.02 → 2314.66] If you go into total number of people.
[2315.06 → 2316.08] And it is, uh...
[2316.08 → 2317.70] Like a mental health issue.
[2317.78 → 2319.38] And severe paranoia is like not cool.
[2319.58 → 2319.92] Anyway.
[2320.00 → 2321.08] How they do it...
[2321.08 → 2324.00] Is they have people face their fears in VR.
[2324.14 → 2324.72] So one...
[2324.72 → 2325.78] They already did a trial.
[2325.92 → 2329.20] One group was encouraged to use normal defensive behaviours.
[2329.20 → 2339.08] And another group was told to hold a long stare or stand toe-to-toe with the avatars that encompass their fears.
[2339.44 → 2339.74] I guess.
[2339.74 → 2341.48] And super cool.
[2341.80 → 2349.44] Over 50% of the patients no longer had severe paranoia at the end of their testing day.
[2350.30 → 2351.06] One day?
[2351.42 → 2351.94] Day.
[2352.10 → 2352.74] One day.
[2353.44 → 2355.18] It says singular day.
[2355.30 → 2356.06] I don't know if like...
[2356.06 → 2357.94] I haven't read super deeply into the article.
[2358.06 → 2359.02] I don't know if it was a whole...
[2359.02 → 2359.72] That's incredible.
[2360.20 → 2361.46] But it does singularly say a day.
[2361.46 → 2362.24] If it does at all.
[2362.64 → 2363.82] If it does anything at all.
[2363.88 → 2366.10] Even if you need like regular...
[2366.10 → 2366.96] Regular therapy.
[2367.14 → 2367.54] Who cares?
[2367.54 → 2367.90] Let's say for example.
[2368.08 → 2369.02] Like VR therapy.
[2369.42 → 2369.60] Yeah.
[2370.16 → 2371.02] I would...
[2371.02 → 2373.62] I am so excited about stuff like that.
[2373.72 → 2373.84] I mean...
[2373.84 → 2374.10] Totally.
[2374.38 → 2376.82] Using technology for gaming is great.
[2377.50 → 2380.42] I am super down for using it for gaming.
[2380.74 → 2382.20] Why am I looking at that camera still?
[2382.30 → 2382.90] The camera's here.
[2382.90 → 2382.98] Yeah.
[2383.80 → 2385.82] I'm super down for using it for gaming.
[2385.82 → 2386.02] Yep, Jay.
[2386.02 → 2387.58] But using it for...
[2387.58 → 2391.02] Using it for making people's actual RL live.
[2391.46 → 2391.88] Lives better.
[2392.06 → 2393.66] That is the real deal.
[2394.74 → 2395.96] Speaking of real deal.
[2396.06 → 2397.78] This was originally posted by Ono tech.
[2397.80 → 2398.00] Okay.
[2398.18 → 2399.32] One thing I want to drop in.
[2399.44 → 2403.34] Over 50% of the patients no longer had severe paranoia at the end of the day.
[2403.54 → 2404.88] That were...
[2404.88 → 2406.00] I believe...
[2406.00 → 2409.04] Lowering their defences and standing toe to toe.
[2409.52 → 2411.88] And the ones that used their defences...
[2411.88 → 2415.32] 20% of that group no longer had severe paranoia at the end of the day.
[2415.44 → 2417.66] So you still have to conquer your fear.
[2417.86 → 2418.08] Yeah.
[2418.24 → 2419.36] You still have to like...
[2419.36 → 2420.26] But you can go in...
[2420.26 → 2420.98] Look it in the eye.
[2420.98 → 2421.98] Knowing...
[2421.98 → 2422.62] That it's not real.
[2422.68 → 2423.32] That it's not real.
[2423.38 → 2425.58] And you're in VR and you know that personally.
[2426.04 → 2426.62] And it's...
[2426.62 → 2428.26] That must make it so much easier.
[2428.54 → 2433.26] Considering 50% of them were able to overcome their severe paranoia in a day.
[2433.64 → 2435.52] It must have been easier for them to do so.
[2435.66 → 2438.30] So let's launch into some rapid fire topics here.
[2438.98 → 2442.02] Civilization 6 has been announced, and it looks freaking awesome.
[2442.24 → 2444.16] Oh, I was going to do the Micron one.
[2444.32 → 2445.28] But sure, that's fine.
[2445.30 → 2445.98] I had to do that.
[2445.98 → 2447.30] Where is that even?
[2447.56 → 2448.30] Civilization 6?
[2448.76 → 2449.86] It's probably down a little bit.
[2449.86 → 2450.08] Civilization...
[2450.08 → 2451.48] There's like no details on it at all.
[2451.78 → 2454.96] They're making it so that when you build your city, it expanses a little bit.
[2455.06 → 2456.22] Wow, I'm still looking at the wrong camera.
[2456.54 → 2457.36] It expanses.
[2457.58 → 2457.78] Expanses?
[2457.78 → 2459.98] So you don't just have like a singular location.
[2460.44 → 2461.38] And you have districts.
[2461.66 → 2467.04] So you have liked your industrial district and like your food growth district and your culture
[2467.04 → 2468.22] district and all that kind of stuff.
[2468.48 → 2472.16] Then people can attack districts individually when they come to fight you.
[2472.52 → 2477.78] And it makes it so that like I believe, if I remember correctly, there's more intergrade
[2477.78 → 2478.52] between cities.
[2478.52 → 2482.42] So if you have one city that's in the mountains, it can be like totally industry focused.
[2482.60 → 2484.62] Then you have one that's like along a nice river.
[2484.62 → 2488.38] It could be like totally growth and food focused, and they can interchange with each other.
[2488.52 → 2493.06] The problem that might introduce, say someone comes and wipes out your growth city.
[2493.60 → 2495.70] Then your industry city is stuck with no food.
[2496.00 → 2496.24] Right.
[2497.00 → 2500.16] So they're trying to make it so that each game is more...
[2500.16 → 2501.20] So rush the great wall.
[2501.56 → 2502.22] And what's that?
[2502.36 → 2503.12] Colossus, I think.
[2503.24 → 2503.60] Yeah.
[2503.74 → 2503.94] Yeah.
[2504.06 → 2504.26] Yeah.
[2504.36 → 2504.76] Basically.
[2505.10 → 2505.36] So that'll probably...
[2505.36 → 2506.66] Rush great wall of Colossus.
[2507.42 → 2508.64] Still a good strategy.
[2509.06 → 2509.46] Probably.
[2510.28 → 2512.78] Four or five iterations of the game later.
[2514.62 → 2517.36] But yeah, they're trying to make it so that each game is more unique.
[2517.82 → 2522.00] So basically where your city is placed will more greatly influence how that city will
[2522.00 → 2522.62] naturally grow.
[2522.62 → 2523.92] That is a struggle for Civ.
[2524.08 → 2524.70] Yeah, it is.
[2524.78 → 2525.84] So they're working on that a lot.
[2526.10 → 2529.92] They're also working on, I think they call it advanced multiplayer.
[2530.32 → 2532.76] We're getting so much crap for our crappy camera quality.
[2532.84 → 2533.30] You know what?
[2533.34 → 2534.88] We are streaming to you from Mexico.
[2535.24 → 2536.58] So, sorry.
[2536.84 → 2537.26] Go ahead.
[2537.36 → 2537.96] I'm surprised it's even working.
[2538.08 → 2538.36] Yeah.
[2538.36 → 2540.38] It's a miracle it's working at all.
[2541.08 → 2541.48] Anyway.
[2541.48 → 2542.56] Look at the wrong camera again.
[2542.62 → 2543.82] I think it's called advanced multiplayer.
[2543.92 → 2544.74] We have no notes on this.
[2545.06 → 2550.24] It's supposed to make scenarios that are easier to be completed within a single play session
[2550.24 → 2550.74] with friends.
[2551.56 → 2552.00] Oh.
[2552.66 → 2555.10] Which is also a huge thing that they need to come over.
[2555.30 → 2555.54] Yeah.
[2555.62 → 2559.50] Because the long play, like have everyone come over for a whole day and do it, is still
[2559.50 → 2559.80] cool.
[2559.94 → 2560.64] Risk is fun.
[2561.08 → 2564.22] But being able to have a smaller contained experience is also very cool.
[2564.22 → 2568.82] Because there's people who have time to play Civ and then there's people with jobs and families,
[2568.94 → 2569.46] quite frankly.
[2569.82 → 2573.72] I haven't been able to do a full play Civ game with friends in a very long time.
[2573.74 → 2573.90] Yeah.
[2574.20 → 2575.72] And that's like one of my favourite things to do.
[2576.52 → 2577.84] So, yeah.
[2577.84 → 2582.46] Nvidia launches GTX 1080 with Micron GDDR5X.
[2583.02 → 2590.38] And Micron has officially ramped up full scale production of GDDR5X, which shouldn't come
[2590.38 → 2595.82] as any surprise, given that there are cards launching that have it.
[2597.44 → 2598.30] This is interesting.
[2598.48 → 2598.88] This was posted.
[2598.96 → 2600.22] Oh, that was posted by Ono tech.
[2600.48 → 2602.84] Next one here is posted by Captain Gas.
[2603.30 → 2604.82] And this is fascinating.
[2605.04 → 2611.38] PayPal to pull payment protection for crowdfunding sites on June 25th.
[2611.38 → 2615.80] They're basically saying, look, if you haven't seen all the news articles, if you haven't
[2615.80 → 2620.76] been burned already, if you haven't seen the episode of South Park, if you haven't seen
[2620.76 → 2626.38] Luke's Neptune Pine video, we're sorry, but we don't feel bad for you anymore.
[2626.78 → 2630.92] When you give them your money, understand that you are giving them your money.
[2631.10 → 2633.42] Can we talk about how amazing this title image is for a moment?
[2633.42 → 2634.48] What?
[2634.82 → 2640.78] It's just like someone took a not great picture of the side of someone's phone that had a
[2640.78 → 2641.72] PayPal logo on it.
[2642.04 → 2642.34] Yeah.
[2642.34 → 2644.02] And they're just like, that's good enough.
[2645.26 → 2645.70] Honestly?
[2645.96 → 2646.24] What?
[2646.68 → 2647.70] It kind of is.
[2647.96 → 2648.88] But like, what?
[2649.76 → 2651.26] How did you even think of that?
[2651.30 → 2652.34] Like, it's just on a table.
[2653.64 → 2654.92] I want...
[2654.92 → 2655.86] It works.
[2656.00 → 2657.38] You know what I bet it is?
[2657.38 → 2659.46] Because no one would be taking...
[2659.46 → 2665.04] Like, no one would be doing, like, phone device photography with another phone camera.
[2665.14 → 2667.22] And you're like, look how crap this looks.
[2667.78 → 2668.70] You know what I bet it is?
[2668.74 → 2672.46] I bet it is actually, like, a crop...
[2672.46 → 2674.34] Of a video that they've made or something?
[2674.46 → 2679.02] Of a photo they took for a phone for a review that happened to have a PayPal logo.
[2679.02 → 2681.02] And why they would even...
[2681.58 → 2682.94] Like, why that would be...
[2682.94 → 2685.82] Why they wouldn't just put a PayPal logo at the top of the page?
[2685.86 → 2686.04] Yeah.
[2686.14 → 2686.74] I don't know.
[2686.74 → 2690.50] I don't know if PayPal has, like, logos for people to use for that kind of stuff.
[2690.52 → 2691.18] But here you go.
[2691.38 → 2694.72] Kickstarter notes about 9% of their projects never deliver.
[2695.28 → 2698.18] And that is not accounting for the ones that deliver garbage.
[2698.40 → 2698.78] Sorry, Dad.
[2698.86 → 2700.38] You'll get your hammer eventually.
[2700.64 → 2700.84] Yeah.
[2701.66 → 2707.42] And if the campaign just goes bust or doesn't deliver, you can no longer dispute the charge.
[2707.48 → 2710.12] So in a statement made to Engadget from PayPal, they said,
[2710.22 → 2712.86] In Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, United States, and certain other countries,
[2712.86 → 2717.62] we have excluded payments made to crowdfunding campaigns from our buyer protection program.
[2717.62 → 2718.76] I think this is fine.
[2719.76 → 2721.94] I don't think PayPal can be expected to do that.
[2723.34 → 2724.28] To be completely honest.
[2724.28 → 2724.72] What do you think?
[2725.42 → 2725.76] No.
[2725.76 → 2733.44] I think it's completely reasonable, especially given that you're not exactly getting, you know, blind sided by this anymore.
[2733.76 → 2733.88] Yeah.
[2733.88 → 2737.44] All right.
[2737.50 → 2739.46] I've got actually, okay, there's a couple more big ones.
[2739.60 → 2740.56] The city of Zug.
[2740.78 → 2741.06] Zug?
[2741.36 → 2742.02] Oh, Lord.
[2742.06 → 2742.42] It's Swiss.
[2742.50 → 2743.14] So who knows?
[2743.52 → 2745.56] This was posted by Data on the forum.
[2746.20 → 2751.60] City of Zug is the first government to accept Bitcoin.
[2753.18 → 2754.80] Dun, dun, dun.
[2755.52 → 2759.44] This legitimizes Bitcoin in, well, I don't know.
[2760.44 → 2763.68] Swiss, Swiss, it's Swiss, Swiss, Swiss, Swiss, Swiss bank.
[2764.44 → 2764.98] What are you doing?
[2765.62 → 2767.40] Oh, you want me to translate the page?
[2767.46 → 2767.82] There you go.
[2767.84 → 2768.06] Oh, yes.
[2768.34 → 2769.40] I guess I should have done that.
[2769.76 → 2772.40] City will worldwide to Bitcoin pioneer.
[2772.50 → 2773.06] Oh, boy.
[2774.28 → 2776.28] You made nothing better.
[2776.90 → 2780.32] You officially did not help at all.
[2781.22 → 2785.20] Let the record show that you were not helpful.
[2785.20 → 2786.70] We definitely knew it said that.
[2788.70 → 2790.02] That was great.
[2790.44 → 2792.08] I'm going to change scenes here eventually.
[2792.22 → 2792.46] All right.
[2792.50 → 2793.54] Let's get my notes up here.
[2793.54 → 2798.40] So the Swiss town is billing itself as a hub for the digital currency industry.
[2798.60 → 2801.58] Will accept Bitcoin for some payments starting this summer.
[2802.14 → 2804.36] So the town council in Zug approved.
[2804.54 → 2807.94] Every time I say it wrong, I'm going to be buried alive here.
[2807.96 → 2808.16] Shout out.
[2808.16 → 2808.80] It's already made.
[2808.98 → 2815.24] Approved plans to accept payments of up to 200 Swiss francs for the municipal registration fees starting July 1st.
[2815.58 → 2816.40] Part of an experiment.
[2816.74 → 2819.94] And many in Zug tout the town's reputation as part of Crypto Valley.
[2819.94 → 2820.68] Probably Zug.
[2821.30 → 2826.60] Approximately 15 companies linked to the digital currency business in Crypto Valley.
[2826.98 → 2827.72] Very, very cool.
[2827.72 → 2829.98] This article doesn't show an umlaut over it.
[2830.04 → 2832.76] So, like, I would expect that and then it to be Zug.
[2833.26 → 2836.90] But because of that, now I'm like, ah, I don't know.
[2836.90 → 2837.78] I don't know what to tell you.
[2838.10 → 2838.54] All right.
[2838.60 → 2840.14] This was posted by Mule.
[2840.62 → 2843.52] And this is freaking awesome.
[2844.68 → 2848.16] Microsoft has announced, the original article here is from Ars Technica.
[2848.16 → 2866.48] Microsoft has announced removal, removal of some of the particularly stupid restrictions that they've placed on universal Windows apps, particularly games that people were complaining about.
[2866.56 → 2870.38] Things like that you couldn't run native full screen.
[2870.56 → 2873.34] You had to run borderless window mode.
[2873.34 → 2879.62] Things like this, and this is the one that we're specifically talking about here that we've got from our article here.
[2880.62 → 2882.06] Requiring V-Sync.
[2883.32 → 2883.84] Why?
[2884.12 → 2886.98] I don't want that V-Sync lag.
[2887.32 → 2889.40] Please do not make me have it.
[2889.50 → 2890.26] It's super annoying.
[2890.46 → 2892.74] Because it's bad and terrible.
[2893.30 → 2896.96] So gamers will have better control over performance and picture quality trade-offs.
[2896.96 → 2897.04] Yes.
[2897.62 → 2905.08] The latest update is that you'll now be able to decide whether to have V-Sync enabled.
[2905.30 → 2909.20] And you'll be able to use G-Sync and Free Sync as well.
[2909.30 → 2910.16] Which is perfect.
[2910.20 → 2911.34] Because that would be so frustrating.
[2911.90 → 2913.52] Owning, like, I don't own one yet.
[2913.62 → 2915.26] I hope to eventually get one.
[2915.70 → 2918.78] But owning a G-Sync screen or a Free Sync screen.
[2919.38 → 2922.36] And just not being able to use it.
[2922.42 → 2923.30] Because it's better.
[2923.48 → 2923.78] Yeah.
[2923.78 → 2927.60] It really, really, truly is objectively better.
[2928.14 → 2929.64] Speaking of objectively better.
[2930.46 → 2931.90] The WAN show normally.
[2932.54 → 2936.78] So we're sorry about this that we've got going on here.
[2937.02 → 2938.88] But I think that's pretty much it for the show.
[2938.96 → 2940.12] We'll see you guys again next week.
[2940.30 → 2941.10] Same bat time.
[2941.28 → 2942.12] Same bat channel.
[2942.22 → 2943.60] Totally different bat location.
[2945.32 → 2946.50] No after party today.
[2946.62 → 2948.04] Yeah, no after party.
[2948.32 → 2950.54] Well, there will be an after party, but you guys aren't invited.
[2951.54 → 2951.94] Mexico!
[2953.78 → 2954.66] Alright.
[2975.00 → 2981.46] You guys gotta let it go.
[2981.46 → 2982.08] You guys got so many people.
