[0.00 --> 7.60]  All right guys, welcome to the WAN show. It's gonna be a great show for you guys today.
[7.60 --> 13.24]  We are mostly set up except there are definitely at least two things that I
[13.24 --> 19.68]  forgot. I didn't log into Twitch to monitor Twitch chat and I only have one
[19.68 --> 24.12]  computer to do that on so I'm gonna be like trying to figure out...
[24.12 --> 25.80]  Are you browsing the dock on that computer?
[25.80 --> 32.26]  Yeah, yeah, I'm also using this for the dock. There's like the mount for our pop filter is completely in the way of the
[32.26 --> 35.80]  keyboard and the touchpad but it's okay. I can work around that. We have a very
[35.80 --> 39.32]  special special WAN show for you guys today. We've got a lot of great topics as
[39.32 --> 42.12]  usual. What are our topics?
[42.12 --> 48.24]  Well first Palmer Luckey, founder of Oculus, getting sued for stuff. Talk about that more later.
[48.24 --> 52.48]  And then Intel is rebuilding itself, rebuilding the pillars of its foundation.
[52.48 --> 53.48]  Shut up Twitch.
[53.48 --> 59.08]  The WC is not one of them. Yeah, there's some other good stuff. California wants to ban encrypted
[59.08 --> 65.42]  smartphones and the US military apparently wants to build cyborgs by combining humans
[65.42 --> 69.48]  with computers. Which the last time I checked is...
[69.48 --> 71.48]  Literally the definition of building a cyborg.
[71.48 --> 77.48]  Pretty much yes, how that actually works. So we're gonna roll the intro while I figure out a couple of things
[77.48 --> 79.48]  quietly behind the scenes here and uh...
[79.48 --> 81.08]  Booyah!
[81.08 --> 83.08]  Booyah!
[83.08 --> 83.82]  Booyah!
[83.82 --> 84.38]  And dernière thing we did find outxaoc out混one alongside the humans that have
[84.38 --> 85.66]  maintained Señor of all hope.
[85.70 --> 87.04]  Booyah!
[87.04 --> 87.54]  Booyah!
[87.54 --> 88.14]  And that's it!
[88.14 --> 96.32]  All right, we have some sponsors including Freshbooks!
[96.32 --> 108.32]  All right, we have some sponsors including FreshBooks, Linda, and...
[108.32 --> 109.32]  What?
[109.32 --> 111.32]  Comic Bento.
[111.32 --> 113.32]  Comic Bento?
[113.32 --> 115.32]  What is Comic Bento?
[115.32 --> 117.32]  Well, we're not gonna spoil it for you.
[117.32 --> 119.32]  Well, we'll tell you more about that later on.
[119.32 --> 120.32]  Yes.
[120.32 --> 131.04]  Sorry, I have freshly last-passed the crap out of a lot of my accounts, not to mention
[131.04 --> 132.84]  all the two-factor authentication.
[132.84 --> 138.24]  So it is very slow and very difficult for me to get into any of my accounts right now,
[138.24 --> 140.66]  and I'm not streaming from the usual computer.
[140.66 --> 143.32]  So all of this is making everything take much longer than I'd like.
[143.32 --> 145.32]  Do you want to jump into our first topic here?
[145.32 --> 147.50]  Do you want the first topic to be the first one on the thing?
[147.50 --> 148.50]  I don't care.
[148.50 --> 153.46]  Well, the first topic is the US military aims to create cyborgs by connecting humans
[153.46 --> 156.46]  to computers, which we made a joke about a little bit early on.
[156.46 --> 161.26]  If you're connecting now, the joke was that's literally the definition of building cyborgs,
[161.26 --> 163.34]  so like, we get it, bro.
[163.34 --> 167.06]  Anyways, I haven't read this one at all, but unsurprisingly, it's DARPA.
[167.06 --> 168.06]  It's DARPA.
[168.06 --> 169.42]  They do crazy stuff.
[169.42 --> 172.98]  If you look in, like, if you look at old military movies and they're like, whoa, we're trying
[172.98 --> 174.62]  this, like, crazy revolutionary thing.
[174.62 --> 177.50]  We're gonna do some crazy bull crap, which probably won't work.
[177.50 --> 178.50]  It was probably DARPA.
[178.50 --> 179.46]  I don't know.
[179.46 --> 185.26]  They're the ones that have that, like, crazy robotic dog thing that carries stuff around
[185.26 --> 188.96]  that people kick every single time it's in videos so that they can, like, it corrects
[188.96 --> 189.96]  itself.
[189.96 --> 190.96]  Have you seen that?
[190.96 --> 191.96]  It is really cool.
[191.96 --> 192.96]  It is cool.
[192.96 --> 193.96]  I'm not saying it's not cool.
[193.96 --> 194.96]  I mean, it's...
[194.96 --> 197.42]  It's pretty, it's like, pretty the bomb.
[197.42 --> 198.42]  Yeah.
[198.42 --> 199.42]  Like, pretty cool.
[199.42 --> 201.72]  It's pretty sweet, because you can, like, people walk up to it and drop kick it really
[201.72 --> 206.42]  hard, and it corrects itself, even on ice, and then is able to keep walking, and it can
[206.42 --> 207.92]  carry a very large amount of weight.
[207.92 --> 208.92]  I don't remember what it's called.
[208.92 --> 209.92]  It's called something.
[209.92 --> 211.42]  But, anyways.
[211.42 --> 217.98]  Yeah, so pretty much, uh, they want to develop high bandwidth implantable neural interfaces
[217.98 --> 221.42]  to open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics.
[221.42 --> 229.36]  Obviously, I can think of a lot of really beneficial uses for this that are not necessarily blowing
[229.36 --> 230.42]  up other dudes.
[230.42 --> 236.78]  Um, but, I mean, with that, like, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna rag on the US military
[236.78 --> 240.96]  too hard either right now, because frankly, a lot of stuff that is developed by the US
[240.96 --> 244.18]  military for US military purposes does eventually...
[244.18 --> 245.18]  It trickles down.
[245.18 --> 248.66]  Does eventually end up getting used for something that's a little bit nicer.
[248.66 --> 249.66]  Um...
[249.66 --> 250.66]  Or a form of it will...
[250.66 --> 251.66]  Yeah.
[251.66 --> 256.36]  Um, it's not a new research topic by any stretch of the imagination, but most of the projects
[256.36 --> 260.36]  have been hampered by slow, uh, limited control.
[260.36 --> 266.36]  So, NESD Manager for DARPA says, today's brain computer interface systems are like two supercomputers
[266.36 --> 269.60]  trying to talk to each other using an old 300 baud modem.
[269.60 --> 275.32]  Which is actually kind of, kind of a clever way of, uh, clever way of putting that.
[275.32 --> 281.12]  I mean, computers are fast, and the human brain is amazing, but right now, the interfaces
[281.12 --> 284.72]  we have between them, I mean, the best we can do at the moment is a keyboard and mouse,
[284.72 --> 288.60]  which if you wanna be, if you wanted to break that down into, like, data rate...
[288.60 --> 291.60]  Really, really, really, really, really slow.
[291.60 --> 293.60]  Like, painfully, painfully slow.
[293.60 --> 297.84]  So, the aim then is to connect individual neurons and establish much finer control with
[297.84 --> 300.84]  less noise so that you can speed up the communication.
[300.84 --> 301.84]  This will require...
[301.84 --> 302.84]  Mm-hmm.
[302.84 --> 304.84]  ...breakthroughs in the following.
[304.84 --> 310.60]  Neuroscience, synthetic biology, low-power electronics, photonics, medical device engineering
[310.60 --> 313.60]  and packaging, and all that is according to the agency.
[313.60 --> 314.60]  No big deal!
[314.60 --> 315.60]  Yeah, so...
[315.60 --> 316.60]  Whatever!
[316.60 --> 319.60]  So it's like, I might as well say that I'm planning to build a flying fish...
[319.60 --> 320.60]  We can figure it out by Friday!
[320.60 --> 323.60]  ...which will require advancements in aerodynamics...
[323.60 --> 324.60]  It is Friday.
[324.60 --> 330.60]  ...you know, Oxijo fish, uh, interface material ptosis, and...
[330.60 --> 332.60]  That's a word.
[332.60 --> 333.60]  I wish them luck.
[333.60 --> 334.60]  Basically, well...
[334.60 --> 337.60]  It's DARPA, so if someone's gonna be like, we're gonna do this thing, it's gonna require
[337.60 --> 339.60]  all this crazy crap, they're the right people to say that.
[339.60 --> 340.60]  I dunno.
[340.60 --> 341.60]  Yeah, I suppose, I suppose.
[341.60 --> 342.60]  Just being honest.
[342.60 --> 344.60]  That's, that's pretty true.
[344.60 --> 345.60]  Oh, oh, oh!
[345.60 --> 348.60]  That's basically the beginning of Black Ops 3!
[348.60 --> 349.60]  Heh.
[349.60 --> 350.60]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[350.60 --> 353.60]  Some people keep on saying, Free Geek, yes, we are here.
[353.60 --> 354.60]  Yes, we are!
[354.60 --> 357.60]  If people didn't see the tweet that we sent out, we are currently at Free Geek.
[357.60 --> 358.60]  Yes, we are!
[358.60 --> 361.60]  Actually, like, we're right at the receiving bay.
[361.60 --> 364.60]  Yeah, no, there's like, there's like some cool stuff going down here.
[364.60 --> 365.60]  I'm actually...
[365.60 --> 366.60]  Don't we do like, pivot?
[366.60 --> 367.60]  No, I'm gonna hope this works.
[367.60 --> 368.60]  Wish me luck.
[368.60 --> 369.60]  What is it?
[369.60 --> 371.60]  I'm turning on the bison cam.
[371.60 --> 372.60]  Okay.
[372.60 --> 374.60]  Yes, the bison cam is here.
[374.60 --> 375.60]  Why did you turn that on?
[375.60 --> 376.60]  I turned on the bison cam.
[376.60 --> 377.60]  Oh.
[377.60 --> 379.60]  Hey, look, it's, look, it's Brandon standing on a thing.
[381.60 --> 382.60]  Hi, Brandon!
[382.60 --> 383.60]  Hi, Brandon!
[383.60 --> 384.60]  What?
[384.60 --> 385.60]  Good job, Brandon!
[385.60 --> 388.60]  Oh, there goes everything!
[388.60 --> 389.60]  Oh, wow.
[389.60 --> 390.60]  No, we're, we're still good.
[390.60 --> 391.60]  No, no, it's okay.
[391.60 --> 392.60]  We're still good.
[392.60 --> 393.60]  We're still good.
[393.60 --> 394.60]  Stay the course.
[394.60 --> 395.60]  Stay the course.
[395.60 --> 396.60]  Hi, Burkle.
[396.60 --> 397.60]  Hi, Dennis.
[397.60 --> 398.60]  Hi, Ed.
[398.60 --> 399.60]  Hi, Yvonne.
[399.60 --> 400.60]  Hi, John.
[400.60 --> 401.60]  Hi, Taren.
[401.60 --> 404.60]  I can't see you guys because Dennis is in the way.
[404.60 --> 406.60]  I'm taking the photo parts!
[406.60 --> 407.60]  Um, so, yeah.
[407.60 --> 408.60]  Okay.
[408.60 --> 409.60]  We're gonna destroy everything!
[409.60 --> 410.60]  We're back.
[410.60 --> 411.60]  We're back.
[411.60 --> 414.60]  I didn't destroy everything, only the things you created.
[414.60 --> 417.60]  It's funny because it's true.
[417.60 --> 419.60]  So, uh, so there-
[419.60 --> 420.60]  Whoa, whoa!
[420.60 --> 421.60]  Oh, no!
[421.60 --> 422.60]  Nope, we might be okay.
[422.60 --> 423.60]  I think I got it.
[423.60 --> 424.60]  We might be okay.
[424.60 --> 425.60]  Come on, baby, pull together.
[425.60 --> 426.60]  Yeah!
[426.60 --> 427.60]  Woo!
[427.60 --> 428.60]  Okay.
[428.60 --> 429.60]  Uh, excellent work.
[429.60 --> 430.60]  I'll keep working on this.
[430.60 --> 431.60]  You, you host the show.
[431.60 --> 432.60]  That's fine.
[432.60 --> 433.60]  No, no, I won't touch it again, I promise.
[433.60 --> 437.60]  No, it's, it's the- this cable shouldn't be wrapped around the way it is.
[437.60 --> 438.60]  Don't make that face!
[438.60 --> 440.60]  It worries me so much.
[440.60 --> 442.60]  Okay, it's supposed to go this way.
[442.60 --> 443.60]  That's fine.
[443.60 --> 444.60]  Oh, my goodness.
[444.60 --> 445.60]  I got it!
[445.60 --> 446.60]  Everything is so fragile!
[446.60 --> 448.60]  Everything is awesome!
[448.60 --> 452.60]  Alright, so basically, we spent the day at Free Geek, uh, volunteering.
[452.60 --> 458.60]  Uh, well, actually, I- okay, technically, our people who I pay, which includes me, are
[458.60 --> 459.60]  we volunteers-
[459.60 --> 460.60]  Yes, because the company-
[460.60 --> 461.60]  If we're paid to be here.
[461.60 --> 463.60]  The company is- well, we're not paid by them.
[463.60 --> 464.60]  Mmm, right.
[464.60 --> 466.60]  The company is volunteering the company's time.
[466.60 --> 471.60]  So the Linus Media Group company, uh, volunteered the time of almost all of its employees, except
[471.60 --> 472.60]  for Colton and Nick, who-
[472.60 --> 473.60]  The business team!
[473.60 --> 474.60]  Yeah, the business team.
[474.60 --> 475.60]  They're just about money.
[475.60 --> 476.60]  Yeah, they're just about money.
[476.60 --> 477.60]  Yeah, that's right.
[477.60 --> 480.60]  Uh, no, seriously, though, Nick was traveling for a family thing.
[480.60 --> 482.60]  And Colton was actually preparing this show.
[482.60 --> 484.60]  Yeah, so, so he kinda had important work to do.
[484.60 --> 489.60]  So everyone's here, we worked on dismantling computers, we worked on refurbishing computers,
[489.60 --> 494.60]  uh, we worked on tearing down old stuff that's not worth dismantling or refurbishing.
[494.60 --> 497.60]  We didn't get to work on some cool things, just honestly, because I think we didn't have
[497.60 --> 498.60]  enough time.
[498.60 --> 502.60]  Uh, but there was, like, testing RAM, uh, wiping hard drives with D-Band, and then installing
[502.60 --> 503.60]  free open source stuff on them.
[503.60 --> 505.60]  Right now they're doing Ubuntu, hopefully a minute later.
[505.60 --> 508.60]  Uh, the laptop area was pretty crazy.
[508.60 --> 511.60]  This is a very, very cool operation they've got going on here.
[511.60 --> 512.60]  I think it's fantastic.
[512.60 --> 515.60]  We've actually got not one, but two videos coming up.
[515.60 --> 519.60]  So we're gonna have one where we show you guys around FreeGeek, and the point of that
[519.60 --> 524.60]  video is not necessarily, FreeGeek Vancouver, FreeGeek Vancouver, FreeGeek Vancouver!
[524.60 --> 525.60]  It's not, it's not that.
[525.60 --> 530.60]  It's more just to talk about these kinds of operations, how cool they are, and point out
[530.60 --> 532.60]  that you may have something similar in your area.
[532.60 --> 533.60]  Yeah.
[533.60 --> 539.60]  And it, uh, it might be worth, it might straight up be, like, from a dollars and cents, like,
[539.60 --> 545.60]  Nick and Colton would understand it perspective, it might be worth spending some time volunteering,
[545.60 --> 547.60]  because this is something cool we didn't know about FreeGeek.
[547.60 --> 552.60]  They will actually give anyone who volunteers here for, I think it's 20, 24 hours or 48 hours?
[552.60 --> 558.60]  24 hours, you get either a computer, which is estimated value somewhere around $50, or a
[558.60 --> 560.60]  $50 store credit.
[560.60 --> 561.60]  Yep.
[561.60 --> 563.60]  And after you volunteer for, I think, 12 hours?
[563.60 --> 564.60]  They give you 40.
[564.60 --> 565.60]  Like another 12 hours?
[565.60 --> 566.60]  Is it another 12 hours or just 12 hours in general?
[566.60 --> 567.60]  I don't know.
[567.60 --> 572.60]  You get a 40% discount in the store other than on laptops, which is a 20% discount.
[572.60 --> 576.60]  And that makes the already really cheap stuff that they sell actually ridiculously dirt cheap.
[576.60 --> 577.60]  Yeah, totally true.
[577.60 --> 578.60]  Hi, can I help you?
[578.60 --> 579.60]  Can I help you, Taren?
[579.60 --> 580.60]  Hi.
[580.60 --> 583.60]  Not disruptive at all.
[583.60 --> 585.60]  That boy ain't right.
[585.60 --> 587.60]  Anyways, yeah, so like, it's actually pretty sick.
[587.60 --> 602.60]  And one thing that I observed too, is if I could have came here when I was a kid, if I knew that these places existed, I would have been able to accelerate the learning of building computers and what goes into a computer and how to diagnose things so much.
[602.60 --> 608.60]  The experience that you guys can, sorry guys, there's, the game's not really that high.
[608.60 --> 611.60]  The issue is that those guys are that loud.
[611.60 --> 613.60]  So, yeah, anyway.
[613.60 --> 615.60]  What was I going to say?
[615.60 --> 621.60]  Right, yeah, I think that even, okay, even for me, I learned multiple things today.
[621.60 --> 625.60]  I learned more than one new thing about computers.
[625.60 --> 630.60]  For me particularly, the most enlightening part was working on some really old stuff.
[630.60 --> 635.60]  So, I tore apart an old quad socket Intel Pentium Pro computer.
[635.60 --> 636.60]  So cool.
[636.60 --> 637.60]  That was so cool.
[637.60 --> 639.60]  It had like 14 expansion slots.
[639.60 --> 648.60]  It was like, if you guys have seen a Mountain Mods case, like those double wide super big tower cases, it came in one of those.
[648.60 --> 649.60]  Yeah.
[649.60 --> 652.60]  But like, obviously all steel and beige and old and all that kind of stuff.
[652.60 --> 654.60]  Like, I was like, I was tearing this thing apart.
[654.60 --> 655.60]  I was going, holy crap.
[655.60 --> 657.60]  Modular power supplies.
[657.60 --> 660.60]  Not a new thing at all.
[660.60 --> 668.60]  Those computers had these ginormous, like we're talking a 120 millimeter fan on the back, doesn't even take up the whole back of the power supply.
[668.60 --> 671.60]  Ginormous, redundant, modular power supplies.
[671.60 --> 673.60]  And I was like, what?
[673.60 --> 674.60]  So cool.
[674.60 --> 680.60]  And this thing is so old that it had a Y2K compliancy sticker on the back.
[680.60 --> 684.60]  There was also one, my favorite one was the other one that said Y2K.
[684.60 --> 686.60]  Not a risk or like a.
[686.60 --> 687.60]  Y2K vulnerable.
[687.60 --> 688.60]  Yeah.
[688.60 --> 689.60]  Y2K vulnerable system.
[689.60 --> 690.60]  Y2K vulnerable system.
[690.60 --> 694.60]  So guys, we have two videos coming up.
[694.60 --> 700.60]  The first one, the video is just a tour of FreeGeek and what they do here and all the different stations they have.
[700.60 --> 701.60]  Should be really fun.
[701.60 --> 710.60]  And then the second one is just kind of like a moving vlog style look at what our crew did while we were volunteering here today.
[710.60 --> 713.60]  Being hopefully mostly helpful with the exception of Taren.
[713.60 --> 716.60]  And should just be kind of a fun little video.
[716.60 --> 717.60]  So make sure you don't miss it.
[717.60 --> 719.60]  I'm wondering why they're all at one station right now.
[719.60 --> 720.60]  I'm not sure.
[720.60 --> 722.60]  I think they're winding down.
[722.60 --> 724.60]  I think they're heading out pretty quick anyway.
[724.60 --> 726.60]  But alright, let's move on.
[726.60 --> 728.60]  Shall we move on to our next Wancho topic here?
[728.60 --> 729.60]  Yes.
[729.60 --> 730.60]  Yes.
[730.60 --> 733.60]  This is kind of, this is kind of a, this is a thing.
[733.60 --> 736.60]  California wants to ban encrypted smartphones.
[736.60 --> 739.60]  The idea isn't like, oh terrorism.
[739.60 --> 745.60]  We need to ban the encryptions because the terrorists will encrypt the ideas for the bombs.
[745.60 --> 748.60]  No, it's apparently for a human trafficking thing.
[748.60 --> 750.60]  Did you like my?
[750.60 --> 751.60]  Yes, I did.
[751.60 --> 752.60]  I quite liked it.
[752.60 --> 753.60]  It was apparently for human trafficking.
[753.60 --> 760.60]  So the idea is that a, a, a smartphone manufacturer that is trying to sell stuff in California would be able to,
[760.60 --> 769.60]  would have to set in the ability for a device to be decrypted and unlocked by its manufacturer or by its operating system provider.
[769.60 --> 773.60]  So iOS or Android, whatever.
[773.60 --> 774.60]  Yeah.
[774.60 --> 775.60]  Yeah, I mean, you know what?
[775.60 --> 787.60]  There's a lot of, the encryption argument is not as simple and not as cut and dried as a lot of people would make it out to be.
[787.60 --> 795.60]  With that said, I cannot get behind legislative movements that would make encryption illegal.
[795.60 --> 816.60]  Um, I do understand the argument that, you know, the, the, the purchase and sale of human people, something, an industry that is very much alive and well, you know, as much as, as much as we'd all love to pretend that, you know, the, um, the issue with black slavery in the United States was the end of it.
[816.60 --> 822.60]  Uh, it was not by any stretch of the imagination, the end, it was a travesty then it's a travesty now.
[822.60 --> 827.60]  Um, and it's absolutely disgusting in any, in any shape or form.
[827.60 --> 845.60]  Um, and to look, and to look at it and go, you know, well, the fact that there's these encrypted communications and these encrypted devices that these people are utilizing to circumvent the law and keep these people from, you know,
[845.60 --> 850.60]  from, from regaining their freedom is disgusting.
[850.60 --> 864.44]  But, um, again, I really don't think the answer is to outlaw encryption and to put, and to put the decryption of said device in the hands of the manufacturer where quite frankly, what is the regulation?
[864.60 --> 865.84]  Yeah, basically not.
[865.96 --> 873.68]  I like the, the idea of sacrificing liberty for other things is maybe something that's a little bit too advanced for our show and we probably shouldn't even be talking about that.
[873.68 --> 876.68]  But, yeah, I don't know.
[877.68 --> 878.68]  So, um...
[878.68 --> 881.68]  Yeah, I was expecting those comments were gonna come up.
[881.68 --> 884.68]  Yeah, okay, I, I said, I said black.
[884.68 --> 890.68]  The same way that I will say white or brown because it's short, it's a single syllable.
[890.68 --> 894.68]  It has nothing to do with political correctness or non-political correctness.
[894.68 --> 896.68]  It's out of convenience.
[896.68 --> 903.68]  Samsung has taken to, has been taken to court by a Dutch consumer watchdog over failing to update its phones.
[903.68 --> 904.68]  Oof!
[904.68 --> 906.68]  There's an official statement from Samsung.
[906.68 --> 908.68]  It's pretty long, so give me a sec.
[908.68 --> 915.68]  At Samsung, we understand that our success depends on customer, our consumers' trust in us and the products and services that we provide.
[915.68 --> 925.68]  That is why we have made a number of commitments in recent months to better inform consumers about the status of security issues and the measures we are taking to address those issues.
[925.68 --> 933.68]  Data security is a top priority and we work hard every day to ensure that the devices we sell and the information contained on those devices is safeguarded.
[933.68 --> 934.68]  So...
[934.68 --> 935.68]  So what?
[935.68 --> 936.68]  I don't think they said anything.
[936.68 --> 937.68]  What?
[937.68 --> 939.68]  It's a really long blurb.
[939.68 --> 940.68]  They said nothing.
[940.68 --> 942.68]  They committed nothing.
[942.68 --> 948.68]  All they said is, data security is a top priority and we work hard every day.
[948.68 --> 951.68]  We try really hard.
[951.68 --> 953.68]  Hopefully that's good enough.
[953.68 --> 954.68]  Yay!
[954.68 --> 955.68]  Well, it isn't.
[955.68 --> 956.68]  Nope.
[956.68 --> 957.68]  Just throwing that out there.
[957.68 --> 958.68]  And also...
[958.68 --> 961.68]  Remember that whole statistic that we covered on the WAN show not that long ago?
[961.68 --> 962.68]  Yeah.
[962.68 --> 964.68]  Where it's like, wow, Android phones suck for security.
[964.68 --> 965.68]  Yep.
[965.68 --> 966.68]  They're like, actually the bomb.
[966.68 --> 968.68]  Like, they explode in your face.
[968.68 --> 969.68]  No, they don't.
[969.68 --> 970.68]  They don't explode in your face.
[970.68 --> 971.68]  Nope.
[971.68 --> 974.68]  But they figuratively explode in your pants.
[974.68 --> 977.68]  Which is a different explosion that's...
[977.68 --> 980.68]  I don't think Twitch actually allows us to...
[980.68 --> 981.68]  They have security problems.
[981.68 --> 982.68]  They have security problems.
[982.68 --> 989.68]  So, basically, all I have to really say about this article is good on you.
[989.68 --> 1000.68]  I would like to see every consumer watchdog organization run around and start nailing these cell phone companies for not providing updates for their phones.
[1000.68 --> 1014.68]  Because, quite frankly, even on flagship class devices, we're talking devices with a bomb cost somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 40% of the price that the consumer is actually paying for it.
[1014.68 --> 1018.68]  Where they're literally bringing in hundreds of dollars of profit per device.
[1018.68 --> 1019.68]  Even on flagship devices.
[1019.68 --> 1025.68]  It is rare to see an Android smartphone maker support it for longer than about a year.
[1025.68 --> 1026.68]  If you are...
[1026.68 --> 1027.68]  A year to two years.
[1027.68 --> 1028.68]  If you're lucky.
[1028.68 --> 1030.68]  Past the EOL date.
[1030.68 --> 1035.68]  And then that's a huge problem because, you know, what if you don't buy it immediately on launch?
[1035.68 --> 1036.68]  Yeah, that's...
[1036.68 --> 1037.68]  That's...
[1037.68 --> 1038.68]  It's...
[1038.68 --> 1039.68]  Yes.
[1039.68 --> 1041.68]  Because a lot of the time, it actually...
[1041.68 --> 1043.68]  The support seems to have more to do with the launch date.
[1043.68 --> 1044.68]  Yeah.
[1044.68 --> 1047.68]  That is a very good point than to do with the EOL date.
[1047.68 --> 1048.68]  Whereas the way...
[1048.68 --> 1050.68]  And I know I always pointed Apple as...
[1050.68 --> 1052.68]  And they're not a perfect shining example.
[1052.68 --> 1057.68]  In fact, I watched a great, just fantastic video on YouTube by...
[1057.68 --> 1058.68]  Oh, I wish...
[1058.68 --> 1059.68]  Hold on, one second, one second.
[1059.68 --> 1062.68]  If you guys are just gonna hang around and chat, please do it over there.
[1062.68 --> 1064.68]  It's probably too loud for the Twitch chat.
[1064.68 --> 1065.68]  Wait, why are you...
[1065.68 --> 1066.68]  I know.
[1066.68 --> 1067.68]  Oh, they're working.
[1067.68 --> 1068.68]  Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[1068.68 --> 1069.68]  Not everyone was.
[1069.68 --> 1070.68]  I wasn't addressing everyone.
[1070.68 --> 1075.68]  So I watched this great video by a guy who works in, like in an Apple repair...
[1075.68 --> 1076.68]  Like Apple products repair shop.
[1076.68 --> 1078.68]  He's got this microscope and he kind of...
[1078.68 --> 1080.68]  He kind of walks you through.
[1080.68 --> 1083.68]  It's about an hour long video, but I sat and watched damn near the whole thing.
[1083.68 --> 1084.68]  Which is very unusual for me.
[1084.68 --> 1086.68]  And he walks you through this...
[1086.68 --> 1088.68]  You watched like 30% of my Oculus video.
[1088.68 --> 1090.68]  Yeah, I will finish it.
[1090.68 --> 1092.68]  I don't watch much YouTube.
[1092.68 --> 1093.68]  Sorry.
[1093.68 --> 1099.68]  Anyway, he does a motherboard repair on a MacBook while spending the entire time talking about
[1099.68 --> 1104.68]  the way that Apple has made and continues to make difficult the lives of the people who
[1104.68 --> 1105.68]  repair and refurbish their products.
[1105.68 --> 1106.68]  Oh, I've seen this.
[1106.68 --> 1107.68]  I watched a whole thing too.
[1107.68 --> 1108.68]  Yeah, it was excellent, wasn't it?
[1108.68 --> 1109.68]  Yeah, it was.
[1109.68 --> 1110.68]  Yeah.
[1110.68 --> 1114.68]  And he basically goes, well, they could provide me with this fantastic diagram that tells me
[1114.68 --> 1118.68]  exactly what all these components are and what they do and how I can repair them, but
[1118.68 --> 1119.68]  they don't.
[1119.68 --> 1122.68]  They give it to the Apple store who uses it to do nothing.
[1122.68 --> 1128.68]  Who uses it to just plug into a console and say, replace.
[1128.68 --> 1140.68]  Whereas, he's like, I could take that information and I could solder a new wire over your precious black clean PCB that you don't want a bunch of wires running around on and I could fix that computer.
[1140.68 --> 1143.68]  And he brought up some really interesting points, things that I didn't realize.
[1143.68 --> 1146.68]  Like for example, and you can pardon my ignorance here, please.
[1146.68 --> 1153.68]  I didn't know that the iPhone 5S, if you replace the phone button, or the phone button, the home button, well, that is kind of the only button on an iPhone.
[1153.68 --> 1154.68]  Yeah, yeah.
[1154.68 --> 1157.68]  If you replace the home button on it, touch ID goes away.
[1157.68 --> 1159.68]  I did not know that.
[1159.68 --> 1163.68]  The home button is one of the most common things that needs to be repaired on an iPhone.
[1163.68 --> 1165.68]  The bloody things break all the time.
[1165.68 --> 1174.68]  And it's like, only Apple, if they repair your home button, can keep touch ID functionality working.
[1174.68 --> 1176.68]  And I was like, really?
[1176.68 --> 1177.68]  Why?
[1177.68 --> 1180.68]  Because the encryption is on a chip in the phone.
[1180.68 --> 1188.68]  There is no reason, there is nothing that is anything to do with that button that would make it so you couldn't do that.
[1188.68 --> 1191.68]  And so, okay, so coming back to my point.
[1191.68 --> 1199.68]  The point is not that Apple is some kind of shining example for, you know, being pro-consumer and consumer rights.
[1199.68 --> 1203.68]  And there's a lot of arguments being made that they intentionally slow down their phones.
[1203.68 --> 1210.68]  Something I don't necessarily actually buy, because something a lot of people don't really consider in all of that,
[1210.68 --> 1216.68]  is that there's a lot more to faster phones than just a faster processor and more RAM.
[1216.68 --> 1222.68]  There's the fact that storage, mobile storage, has improved by leaps and bounds over the last-
[1222.68 --> 1224.68]  And baby drives in their new phones.
[1224.68 --> 1227.68]  That's right. By leaps and bounds over the last few generations.
[1227.68 --> 1228.68]  So what?
[1228.68 --> 1232.68]  Do you want Apple to just not build in any new functionality that takes advantage of the new phones?
[1232.68 --> 1234.68]  No, I don't necessarily expect that.
[1234.68 --> 1242.68]  But compared to Apple, and the Android ecosystem is just a complete mess.
[1242.68 --> 1248.68]  With some phones coming out with a given Android operating system that might not even be the most recent one,
[1248.68 --> 1252.68]  and then never ever even being updated.
[1252.68 --> 1253.68]  So...
[1253.68 --> 1255.68]  I've had phones like that.
[1255.68 --> 1259.68]  Yeah, so I've got a couple of more notes on this.
[1259.68 --> 1263.68]  So it's the consummendenbond, whatever.
[1263.68 --> 1268.68]  Okay, I'm sure that's a Dutch word that I just butchered just now.
[1268.68 --> 1272.68]  So it's a non-profit that looks after the interests of consumers in the Netherlands.
[1272.68 --> 1276.68]  So they're taking Samsung to court over failure to provide updates in a timely manner.
[1276.68 --> 1280.68]  They reached out to Samsung on December the 2nd, and in absence of a proper response,
[1280.68 --> 1283.68]  they issued injunctive relief proceedings against Samsung.
[1283.68 --> 1290.68]  So they say that 82% of Samsung phones it checked were not updated within two years of their introduction.
[1290.68 --> 1293.68]  Yeah, not surprising.
[1293.68 --> 1296.68]  Samsung's a huge part of that Android ecosystem,
[1296.68 --> 1300.68]  and probably a huge part of that percentage that we found of unsecured phones.
[1300.68 --> 1305.68]  A lot of people that I talk to think that it's an Apple or a Galaxy.
[1305.68 --> 1306.68]  Actually.
[1306.68 --> 1307.68]  Like, if you...
[1307.68 --> 1312.68]  When we were at CES, a lot of people were saying Apple or Samsung, yeah.
[1312.68 --> 1313.68]  Yeah.
[1313.68 --> 1314.68]  Yep.
[1314.68 --> 1315.68]  Do you have a Samsung?
[1315.68 --> 1316.68]  Yeah, yeah.
[1316.68 --> 1319.68]  When I was at a booth for a battery that would heat up,
[1319.68 --> 1321.68]  I don't even know if it ended up being in one of our top fives.
[1321.68 --> 1322.68]  Was it like a hand warmer?
[1322.68 --> 1323.68]  Yeah.
[1323.68 --> 1324.68]  Like, I was like, do you have a Samsung?
[1324.68 --> 1325.68]  I was like, no.
[1325.68 --> 1328.68]  And then I pull up my phone, he's like, oh, you have a Samsung?
[1328.68 --> 1329.68]  I'm like, no, it's a Sony.
[1329.68 --> 1330.68]  And that's...
[1330.68 --> 1331.68]  He's like, but it's a Samsung.
[1331.68 --> 1332.68]  I'm like, no.
[1332.68 --> 1333.68]  And that's...
[1333.68 --> 1341.68]  That's not like, oh, you're an idiot because you don't realize that, you know, an Android phone doesn't have to be a Samsung.
[1341.68 --> 1346.68]  The reality of it is, is that's probably all that most normal consumers have really seen.
[1346.68 --> 1351.68]  I mean, Samsung owns a huge chunk of the Android market.
[1351.68 --> 1352.68]  So, yeah.
[1352.68 --> 1362.68]  Basically, what the Dutch watchdog is asking is for Samsung to support every device it sells for two years, regardless of how old it is.
[1362.68 --> 1364.68]  Very, very interesting.
[1364.68 --> 1369.68]  So that would mean they would have to support starting at the EOL date rather than the introduction date.
[1369.68 --> 1370.68]  Yep.
[1370.68 --> 1376.68]  And it would mean that they can't just provide, like, one or two updates on a flagship.
[1376.68 --> 1379.68]  If you guys are going to release a model, then you better actually support it.
[1379.68 --> 1382.68]  Something that could be a big problem for Samsung, because we've seen this.
[1382.68 --> 1392.68]  They take that, you know, throw the pot of spaghetti at the wall and then figure out which noodles stick and kind of, you know, support that, those ones approach.
[1392.68 --> 1396.68]  And that's not going to fly if you have to actually properly support your devices.
[1396.68 --> 1403.68]  You're going to have to actually, oh, I don't know, figure out what people want and build that instead of just building, you know.
[1403.68 --> 1406.68]  Do you remember that weird phone that they did for old people?
[1406.68 --> 1410.68]  The, like, the Galaxy, um, ah, the Galaxy, it was like...
[1410.68 --> 1412.68]  Didn't have the custom operating system and stuff?
[1412.68 --> 1413.68]  No, it was really large.
[1413.68 --> 1417.68]  It was huge and it was like right around the time they introduced easy mode.
[1417.68 --> 1418.68]  Yeah, easy mode.
[1418.68 --> 1419.68]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[1419.68 --> 1420.68]  And it had, like, a 720p screen.
[1420.68 --> 1421.68]  I can't remember what it was.
[1421.68 --> 1422.68]  That's a program, I should have said.
[1422.68 --> 1426.68]  Yeah, I'm sure that Twitch chat is telling me all about it right now.
[1426.68 --> 1429.68]  But it was just, it was just, like, hilarious.
[1429.68 --> 1432.68]  And they were like, yeah, it's like the smartphone for people who don't see very well.
[1432.68 --> 1433.68]  I'm like, really?
[1433.68 --> 1435.68]  How many of those are you going to sell?
[1435.68 --> 1440.68]  Like, did you actually survey, like, senior citizens and ask them if they want this?
[1440.68 --> 1442.68]  Because I'm willing to bet they don't.
[1442.68 --> 1444.68]  I'm willing to bet they don't want it.
[1444.68 --> 1446.68]  Don't improve your glasses.
[1446.68 --> 1448.68]  Buy a special smartphone.
[1448.68 --> 1449.68]  The Galaxy Mega, that's the one.
[1449.68 --> 1451.68]  Thank you to, uh, I can't read your name.
[1451.68 --> 1454.68]  It's in lime green and it's on a white background, so...
[1454.68 --> 1455.68]  The Galaxy Mega is a weird dog.
[1455.68 --> 1456.68]  Yeah, the Galaxy...
[1456.68 --> 1457.68]  It's like a small tablet.
[1457.68 --> 1459.68]  Barely a small tablet.
[1459.68 --> 1463.68]  I think it was like a six and a half inch device or something ridiculous like that.
[1465.68 --> 1466.68]  All right.
[1467.68 --> 1469.68]  This next one is interesting.
[1469.68 --> 1472.68]  So, uh, the Apple II Widow.
[1472.68 --> 1477.68]  And this isn't exactly how they said it at all, but this is the title, I guess.
[1477.68 --> 1478.68]  Apple II Widow.
[1478.68 --> 1479.68]  Want your dead husband's password?
[1479.68 --> 1480.68]  Get a court order.
[1480.68 --> 1486.68]  Um, a Canadian widow is locked in a battle with Apple over her dead husband's password for their iPad.
[1487.68 --> 1490.68]  Um, she is stated saying, where is it?
[1490.68 --> 1491.68]  She just wants...
[1491.68 --> 1496.68]  She used to play games on it or something, and now she can't, which sounds a little weird
[1496.68 --> 1498.68]  because she would have probably needed the password for that.
[1498.68 --> 1499.68]  Um...
[1499.68 --> 1500.68]  I don't know.
[1500.68 --> 1501.68]  Well, yes and no.
[1501.68 --> 1509.68]  I mean, like, again, like, we take for granted as tech-savvy people that you want to figure out how to do things yourself.
[1509.68 --> 1511.68]  Not everyone's like that.
[1511.68 --> 1513.68]  Some people would just be like, hey, hubby, unlock this for me.
[1513.68 --> 1514.68]  I'm gonna do a thing.
[1515.68 --> 1516.68]  Or like, who knows?
[1516.68 --> 1522.68]  Like, maybe, like, I'm just guessing, but I'm just, I'm coming up with plausible reasons why she might not care.
[1522.68 --> 1523.68]  Maybe she's not that mobile.
[1523.68 --> 1525.68]  Maybe he brought it to her every time.
[1527.68 --> 1528.68]  Right?
[1528.68 --> 1531.68]  Like, there's a lot of reasons why, you know, and people take care of each other.
[1531.68 --> 1536.68]  Like, you know, my wife doesn't really know how to turn on our entertainment system.
[1536.68 --> 1538.68]  It's really complicated.
[1538.68 --> 1542.68]  She says it's complicated, which is, of course, a load of nonsense, but, um...
[1542.68 --> 1543.68]  And it doesn't work all the time.
[1543.68 --> 1545.68]  Okay, it doesn't necessarily work all the time.
[1545.68 --> 1548.68]  That is a valid observation about our entertainment setup.
[1548.68 --> 1549.68]  That is.
[1549.68 --> 1550.68]  It's funny, because the more...
[1550.68 --> 1552.68]  It's probably a valid observation about, like, everything that they have at their house.
[1552.68 --> 1553.68]  But that's a perfect example.
[1553.68 --> 1563.68]  You gotta remember, for some people, unlocking an iPad is about as foreign as, you know, firing up a receiver and selecting the right input for the friggin' Wii U or whatever.
[1563.68 --> 1564.68]  Is it a technological system?
[1564.68 --> 1569.68]  Well, Linus has probably changed it seven times in the last four months, so who knows what's going on right now.
[1569.68 --> 1571.68]  Am I wrong?
[1571.68 --> 1573.68]  Look at the servers.
[1573.68 --> 1576.68]  I knew he was heading for the server.
[1576.68 --> 1578.68]  I knew he was gonna go after the server.
[1578.68 --> 1579.68]  You know what?
[1579.68 --> 1580.68]  That's it.
[1580.68 --> 1581.68]  I quit.
[1581.68 --> 1582.68]  Nope.
[1582.68 --> 1583.68]  That's cool.
[1583.68 --> 1585.68]  So, I'm not really too sure about this.
[1585.68 --> 1587.68]  Personally, I think there's some issues there.
[1587.68 --> 1590.68]  Like, some people will stay together even if their relationship isn't good.
[1590.68 --> 1592.68]  And there could be private information on that iPad.
[1592.68 --> 1600.68]  So, I don't actually really support the idea of just randomly getting access to all of the things for the person that used to be your spouse.
[1600.68 --> 1604.68]  That's actually kind of a little odd, in my opinion.
[1604.68 --> 1615.68]  Even in Apple's terms and services, Apple T&Cs, it says, agree that your account is non-transferable and that any rights to your Apple ID or content within your account terminate upon your death.
[1615.68 --> 1623.68]  Upon receiving a copy of your death certificate, your account may be terminated and all content within your account deleted.
[1623.68 --> 1626.68]  I actually kind of agree with that.
[1626.68 --> 1635.68]  Because, while, yes, she might have been immobile and her husband may have brought her her things and let her play the games on the tablet, there could also be another story.
[1635.68 --> 1638.68]  And I know I probably sound like an asshole for saying that maybe she shouldn't get access to it.
[1638.68 --> 1640.68]  Yep, I agree with that. I came back at just the right moment.
[1640.68 --> 1641.68]  You're an asshole.
[1641.68 --> 1642.68]  Wow.
[1642.68 --> 1644.68]  I'm back, though.
[1644.68 --> 1645.68]  You're so rude.
[1645.68 --> 1646.68]  I'm back.
[1646.68 --> 1648.68]  Maybe I enjoy-
[1648.68 --> 1652.68]  Is that one of NEC's professional LCDs? Like an older one?
[1652.68 --> 1653.68]  Look how thick it is.
[1653.68 --> 1654.68]  Look how thick it is.
[1654.68 --> 1655.68]  Sorry, sorry, I'll let you finish your story.
[1655.68 --> 1656.68]  All of these are like that.
[1656.68 --> 1658.68]  Maybe it's just really old.
[1658.68 --> 1660.68]  Okay, go ahead.
[1660.68 --> 1661.68]  Probably going with that one.
[1661.68 --> 1662.68]  I was mostly done.
[1662.68 --> 1667.68]  What I was saying was in Apple's T&Cs, if you die, your account is closed.
[1667.68 --> 1668.68]  Yep.
[1668.68 --> 1669.68]  Your account isn't given to someone, it is closed.
[1669.68 --> 1671.68]  And I actually totally agree with that.
[1671.68 --> 1676.68]  While there is the possibility where it's like, oh, honey, here, play games on the iPad.
[1676.68 --> 1680.68]  I'm sorry that you are having a not perfect day.
[1680.68 --> 1682.68]  It could also be something nefarious.
[1682.68 --> 1683.68]  I mean-
[1683.68 --> 1685.68]  Not every couple is doing super great when one of them passes away.
[1685.68 --> 1686.68]  And that's true.
[1686.68 --> 1690.68]  But I mean, the other thing that I kind of object to here is that with Apple devices, if
[1690.68 --> 1692.68]  they're locked to an Apple ID, you can't even reset it.
[1692.68 --> 1695.68]  So we're talking about a physical device that gets bricked by-
[1695.68 --> 1696.68]  That's a little annoying.
[1696.68 --> 1700.68]  Yeah, we're talking a physical device that is effectively bricked because someone passes
[1700.68 --> 1701.68]  away.
[1701.68 --> 1702.68]  Apple should help them reset it.
[1702.68 --> 1703.68]  I would think they should be able to do that.
[1703.68 --> 1705.68]  All the data should be wiped and Apple should help them reset it.
[1705.68 --> 1707.68]  Because she should be able to play the games on the iPad.
[1707.68 --> 1709.68]  Apple believes in privacy and encryption.
[1709.68 --> 1710.68]  Totally get that.
[1710.68 --> 1711.68]  Totally respect that.
[1711.68 --> 1717.68]  But that doesn't mean that hardware should just be rendered worthless by someone passing
[1717.68 --> 1718.68]  away.
[1718.68 --> 1719.68]  So, yeah.
[1719.68 --> 1721.68]  They're in a freaking storage room, basically.
[1721.68 --> 1722.68]  Yeah.
[1722.68 --> 1723.68]  Yeah, pretty much.
[1723.68 --> 1724.68]  No, it's really cool.
[1724.68 --> 1728.68]  We have videos coming about what exactly it is we're doing here and they are going
[1728.68 --> 1729.68]  to be worthwhile.
[1729.68 --> 1731.68]  Speaking of Apple, you know what?
[1731.68 --> 1734.68]  I was actually going to say we should burn through our topics and then I was going to
[1734.68 --> 1739.68]  say we should take turns going and finding cool stuff to talk about in the warehouse here.
[1739.68 --> 1742.68]  Yeah, so that was what I thought of while I was standing over there.
[1742.68 --> 1743.68]  Cool.
[1743.68 --> 1744.68]  So let's move right along.
[1744.68 --> 1745.68]  Thank you.
[1745.68 --> 1747.68]  I had a thought that was good.
[1747.68 --> 1748.68]  I felt pretty good.
[1748.68 --> 1750.68]  Wow, we have a lot of topics this week.
[1750.68 --> 1751.68]  Good job, Colton.
[1751.68 --> 1753.68]  Yeah, the rapid fire are not rapid.
[1753.68 --> 1757.68]  Colton's actually gotten to the point where he's doing a surprisingly good job of the
[1757.68 --> 1758.68]  WAN show document.
[1758.68 --> 1762.68]  Well, no, it's surprising given how crappy they were before.
[1762.68 --> 1763.68]  Oh, okay.
[1763.68 --> 1766.68]  Which I guess doesn't make what I said any nicer.
[1766.68 --> 1769.68]  I love the veiled, not even veiled at all insults.
[1769.68 --> 1772.68]  They were really bad and you've made them not as bad.
[1772.68 --> 1773.68]  No, they're really good now.
[1773.68 --> 1775.68]  That's why I said it's surprising.
[1775.68 --> 1779.68]  How do you go from like really terrible to quite excellent?
[1779.68 --> 1780.68]  So let's do-
[1780.68 --> 1781.68]  Just don't try to compliment people.
[1781.68 --> 1782.68]  Let's do-
[1782.68 --> 1785.68]  Oh no, if I wanted to compliment people, you'd know.
[1785.68 --> 1792.68]  So our first sponsor of the day is Comic Bento.
[1792.68 --> 1797.68]  You can use promo code Linus to save $5 on a new subscription.
[1797.68 --> 1803.68]  And Luke is going to do our unboxing of what the Avery special Comic Bento box looks like.
[1803.68 --> 1805.68]  Well, I run through some of the benefits.
[1805.68 --> 1808.68]  This is an amped theme.
[1808.68 --> 1811.68]  Comics inspired by music or musicians.
[1811.68 --> 1816.68]  And Comic Bento is the original graphic novel subscription box.
[1816.68 --> 1818.68]  Each box contains at least-
[1818.68 --> 1820.68]  50 dollars.
[1820.68 --> 1828.68]  40 kilograms of bag force worth of at least $50 of surprise graphic novels.
[1828.68 --> 1829.68]  What do you got?
[1829.68 --> 1830.68]  I- this one is-
[1830.68 --> 1831.68]  Whoa!
[1831.68 --> 1835.68]  Straight up Battlestar Galactica Volume 1 Memorial.
[1835.68 --> 1836.68]  Nice.
[1836.68 --> 1838.68]  This one is Youngblood.
[1838.68 --> 1840.68]  You can check out that one.
[1840.68 --> 1841.68]  Youngblood.
[1841.68 --> 1842.68]  Casey Donovan Crabtree.
[1842.68 --> 1843.68]  Huh.
[1843.68 --> 1846.68]  This one is a Marvel comic of some type, I think?
[1846.68 --> 1848.68]  The Invincible Iron Man.
[1848.68 --> 1849.68]  The Invincible Iron Man.
[1849.68 --> 1850.68]  Marvel Masterworks.
[1850.68 --> 1853.68]  So you apparently get some pretty sick stuff.
[1853.68 --> 1854.68]  Oh.
[1854.68 --> 1855.68]  That's actually really cool.
[1855.68 --> 1861.68]  Um, and then there's one like big, super nice hardcover one at the end, which is the
[1861.68 --> 1862.68]  The B.B.B.
[1862.68 --> 1864.68]  The Brian Epstein story.
[1864.68 --> 1865.68]  Huh.
[1865.68 --> 1869.68]  So basically, each box contains at least 50 bucks worth of surprise graphic novels.
[1869.68 --> 1871.68]  So this one, I mean, it's got a price right on the back cover.
[1871.68 --> 1872.68]  This one's worth 10 bucks.
[1872.68 --> 1874.68]  Um, from the biggest creators in comics to the unsung-
[1874.68 --> 1881.68]  This one by itself is 50 US or 55 Canadian, let alone the other things that are in the box.
[1881.68 --> 1883.68]  Or Unsung Indie Heroes.
[1883.68 --> 1887.68]  It ships to the US and Canada and brings you a new theme each month with graphic novels to go along with it.
[1887.68 --> 1894.68]  So you head over to www.comicbento.com to check out their pricing, but it starts as low as $17.50 a month.
[1894.68 --> 1899.68]  And you can use offer code Linus to save five bucks on new subscriptions.
[1899.68 --> 1901.68]  Guys, these guys are a new sponsor for us.
[1901.68 --> 1902.68]  So check it out.
[1902.68 --> 1903.68]  Let us know if it's cool.
[1903.68 --> 1909.68]  And, uh, you know, as we always tend to do with new sponsors, if you guys all hate it and think that it's terrible, you might not see them again.
[1909.68 --> 1911.68]  But if you guys like it, let us know.
[1911.68 --> 1914.68]  And, uh, it seems actually like a pretty compelling value to me though.
[1914.68 --> 1916.68]  This is $110 US dollars.
[1916.68 --> 1917.68]  So there you go.
[1917.68 --> 1919.68]  I totaled all the values on the back.
[1919.68 --> 1920.68]  And it's $17.50.
[1920.68 --> 1921.68]  Love it.
[1921.68 --> 1924.68]  And it starts at $17.50, plus shipping and handling.
[1924.68 --> 1925.68]  Oh, it starts as low as.
[1925.68 --> 1928.68]  So just- I'm not- I'm not 100% sure what's included with every plan, but let us know, guys.
[1928.68 --> 1929.68]  Let us know what you think.
[1929.68 --> 1931.68]  This could be like a special badass one.
[1931.68 --> 1934.68]  Alright, next up is Lynda.com.
[1934.68 --> 1937.68]  I think you guys all know what's cool about Lynda.com.
[1937.68 --> 1940.68]  Building it learning style.
[1940.68 --> 1941.68]  Your brain, that is.
[1941.68 --> 1948.68]  Yes, my friends, learning things in your brain with online videos that are used by millions of people around the world.
[1948.68 --> 1950.68]  They've got more than three- including this guy.
[1950.68 --> 1953.68]  They've got more than 3,000 courses available.
[1953.68 --> 1960.68]  They're taught by industry experts and they have all kinds of tools that make Lynda.com easier to use than ever before.
[1960.68 --> 1962.68]  I mean, it used to be you had to stream the courses.
[1962.68 --> 1967.68]  Now, you can just download them and play them back on demand on your iOS or Android device.
[1967.68 --> 1968.68]  You can take notes.
[1968.68 --> 1974.68]  You can share playlists of courses with your friends so you can all learn the same stuff at the same time and support each other.
[1974.68 --> 1978.68]  You can get a 10-day free trial which gives you access to every course on Lynda.com.
[1978.68 --> 1979.68]  Yes, all you can eat.
[1979.68 --> 1982.68]  And plans start at only $25 a month.
[1982.68 --> 1990.68]  So whether you want to get better at your hobby or train for a brand new career and really, you know, amp things up in your professional life,
[1990.68 --> 1996.68]  head over to Lynda.com slash WANshow to claim your 10-day free trial and start learning today.
[1996.68 --> 1998.68]  Seriously, like, personal comment.
[1998.68 --> 1999.68]  They're pretty sweet.
[1999.68 --> 2000.68]  I've been doing it lately.
[2000.68 --> 2001.68]  They're really easy to follow along.
[2001.68 --> 2002.68]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[2002.68 --> 2003.68]  You're back on it.
[2003.68 --> 2004.68]  Yeah.
[2004.68 --> 2005.68]  They're really easy to follow along.
[2005.68 --> 2011.68]  The teacher that I'm doing photography stuff, the teacher that I have is actually awesome and the videos are really good.
[2011.68 --> 2017.68]  And then there's a script that go along with each video which I like a lot because you can search through the script with like control F or whatever
[2017.68 --> 2020.68]  and then find that part of the video if you just want to look something specific up.
[2020.68 --> 2021.68]  We need a shirt.
[2021.68 --> 2023.68]  Control F or whatever.
[2023.68 --> 2025.68]  How to find things.
[2025.68 --> 2026.68]  Yeah.
[2026.68 --> 2027.68]  Yeah.
[2027.68 --> 2030.68]  And finally, FreshBooks.
[2030.68 --> 2038.68]  So if you run a small business, whether it's a, oh, I don't know, say for example, you run a small computer repair shop
[2038.68 --> 2043.68]  where you were to refurbish computer things in your small neighborhood or whatever the case may be.
[2043.68 --> 2056.68]  If you run a, you know, if you're a plumber or electrician, some kind of a freelancer, FreshBooks could be the breath of fresh air that your accounting system needs.
[2056.68 --> 2057.68]  It's all cloud based.
[2057.68 --> 2064.68]  It allows you to keep track of your hours, keep track of the expenses for your jobs, keep track of your invoice, send bills to clients.
[2064.68 --> 2069.68]  See if your clients have viewed their bills and you can even have them pay directly through the app.
[2069.68 --> 2079.68]  And if you run a sort of business that requires deposit, say for example, you're a house painter, FreshBooks allows you to process deposit payments separately before the lump sum.
[2079.68 --> 2081.68]  At the end, you can do the split however you want.
[2081.68 --> 2086.68]  It is easy to use even if you're not a numbers person, especially if you're not a numbers person,
[2086.68 --> 2092.68]  and lets you focus your time on running your business rather than doing boring paperwork,
[2092.68 --> 2096.68]  because not everyone has a wife to do all of his boring paperwork for him.
[2096.68 --> 2097.68]  Thanks, hun.
[2099.68 --> 2102.68]  One thing, okay, I've always been confused about this.
[2102.68 --> 2104.68]  You say especially if you're not a numbers person.
[2104.68 --> 2105.68]  Yes.
[2105.68 --> 2106.68]  Why is it easier if you're not a numbers person?
[2106.68 --> 2108.68]  Because it's relative ease.
[2108.68 --> 2114.68]  If you're a wicked numbers person, the relative ease with which you could whip through this stuff in a spreadsheet...
[2114.68 --> 2115.68]  So it's relatively easier.
[2115.68 --> 2116.68]  Yes.
[2116.68 --> 2117.68]  Not actually easier.
[2117.68 --> 2121.68]  It's how much, yeah, it doesn't make it easier if you are not a numbers person.
[2121.68 --> 2124.68]  Being a numbers person will still help you use FreshBooks.
[2124.68 --> 2125.68]  Okay.
[2125.68 --> 2127.68]  It's how much of an improvement you can expect a game.
[2127.68 --> 2128.68]  Yeah, yeah.
[2128.68 --> 2129.68]  I got that.
[2129.68 --> 2130.68]  It's just it's not fundamentally easy.
[2130.68 --> 2132.68]  That's why I read it the first time.
[2132.68 --> 2133.68]  I was like...
[2133.68 --> 2134.68]  But no.
[2134.68 --> 2135.68]  No, no.
[2135.68 --> 2136.68]  Yeah, no.
[2136.68 --> 2137.68]  I get it.
[2137.68 --> 2138.68]  I get where they're going.
[2138.68 --> 2139.68]  I get where they're going with that.
[2139.68 --> 2140.68]  Yeah.
[2140.68 --> 2141.68]  I thought that was your comment.
[2141.68 --> 2143.68]  No, no, no.
[2143.68 --> 2144.68]  No, no.
[2144.68 --> 2145.68]  That's FreshBooks's pitch.
[2145.68 --> 2146.68]  Oh.
[2146.68 --> 2160.68]  So our topic people posted in the forum so far are DAWB, SJR, Aries Krieger, ZMule, and we've got WKD Paul, and we've got Mr. Troll.
[2160.68 --> 2161.68]  Mr. Troll.
[2161.68 --> 2162.68]  Mr. Troll.
[2162.68 --> 2163.68]  No, wait.
[2163.68 --> 2164.68]  No, we have ZMule again.
[2164.68 --> 2169.68]  So apparently Google paid Apple one billion.
[2169.68 --> 2175.68]  One billion US dollars to keep their search bar on the iPhone.
[2175.68 --> 2178.68]  Holy actual crap.
[2178.68 --> 2186.68]  Hopefully Google can play Firefox more so that Firefox stops telling me that if everyone reading this donated three dollars, they wouldn't need to ask anymore.
[2186.68 --> 2188.68]  Well, no, that deal's dead, right?
[2188.68 --> 2191.68]  Firefox is with Yahoo now for a long time.
[2191.68 --> 2192.68]  No, I know.
[2192.68 --> 2193.68]  Oh, yeah.
[2193.68 --> 2195.68]  But you just wish that hadn't been a thing.
[2195.68 --> 2202.68]  I think Yahoo isn't paying them as much money, probably because everyone's manually switching their search back to Google anyways.
[2202.68 --> 2207.68]  So the aggressiveness of Firefox asking for money is pretty intense.
[2207.68 --> 2208.68]  Right.
[2208.68 --> 2214.68]  I've actually donated a relatively okay amount of money to Firefox, and they're still like, actually, that's probably why they're doing it.
[2214.68 --> 2218.68]  That's only the reason, because as soon as I donated to Wikipedia, they harassed me all the time.
[2218.68 --> 2219.68]  Yeah.
[2219.68 --> 2220.68]  Same thing with BC Children's Hospital.
[2220.68 --> 2223.68]  Like, I get letters all the time.
[2223.68 --> 2230.68]  I'm like, Canadian Red Cross, actually, they were really making me mad, because I actually have a monthly donation to them.
[2230.68 --> 2231.68]  Monthly.
[2231.68 --> 2232.68]  Every month.
[2232.68 --> 2234.68]  And all of a sudden, they were calling me all the time.
[2234.68 --> 2235.68]  They were like, yo, can you re-up?
[2235.68 --> 2236.68]  Can you double up?
[2236.68 --> 2237.68]  I'm like, come on.
[2237.68 --> 2240.68]  You know, why don't you go keep doing what you were doing?
[2240.68 --> 2241.68]  Going door to door.
[2241.68 --> 2244.68]  Like, someone came to my door and was like, yo, do you want to donate to the Canadian Red Cross?
[2244.68 --> 2245.68]  I'm like, sure.
[2245.68 --> 2246.68]  So go do more of that.
[2246.68 --> 2248.68]  Find new donors.
[2248.68 --> 2253.68]  Like, don't harass the people who are already like, yeah, I think what you're doing is great.
[2253.68 --> 2256.68]  Because you're going to lose my support.
[2256.68 --> 2260.68]  I think there's a nice way to do that kind of stuff.
[2260.68 --> 2261.68]  Yeah.
[2261.68 --> 2271.68]  Anyway, so Apple apparently received a billion from Google in 2014 to keep the search bar, according to the transcript of the court proceedings from Oracle Corp's lawsuit against Google.
[2271.68 --> 2276.68]  So Google has an agreement that gives Apple a percentage of revenue that Google generates through Apple devices.
[2276.68 --> 2280.68]  At one time, that share was apparently 34%.
[2280.68 --> 2282.68]  Although we don't know, like, who got the 34%.
[2282.68 --> 2283.68]  Yeah.
[2283.68 --> 2284.68]  Hmm.
[2284.68 --> 2291.68]  The attorney for Google tried to get the judge to strike the mention from the record, which did not work.
[2291.68 --> 2292.68]  Obviously.
[2292.68 --> 2295.68]  John is here.
[2295.68 --> 2296.68]  Is that just crazy?
[2296.68 --> 2297.68]  What's that?
[2297.68 --> 2301.68]  If someone had an agreement where there was like, we're sharing 34% of this profit thing.
[2301.68 --> 2304.68]  And someone was like, can you just strike that from the agreement in court?
[2304.68 --> 2306.68]  That's just never going to work, right?
[2306.68 --> 2313.68]  Not unless there's some sort of like exceptional circumstance or maybe evidence that like that was just slipped in without the other party knowledge.
[2313.68 --> 2315.68]  Which was just something crazy.
[2315.68 --> 2316.68]  Yeah.
[2316.68 --> 2317.68]  Okay.
[2317.68 --> 2318.68]  John assures us that would have been very unlikely.
[2318.68 --> 2319.68]  Yeah.
[2319.68 --> 2320.68]  He's our resident.
[2320.68 --> 2324.68]  Used to know a thing or two about law before he became a Canadian.
[2324.68 --> 2327.68]  Disclaimer not licensed to practice law in California.
[2327.68 --> 2328.68]  Yeah.
[2328.68 --> 2329.68]  Disclaimer not licensed to practice law in Canada.
[2329.68 --> 2330.68]  That's...
[2330.68 --> 2331.68]  Or California.
[2331.68 --> 2332.68]  Or California.
[2332.68 --> 2333.68]  Oh, really?
[2333.68 --> 2334.68]  Well, we were talking about California.
[2334.68 --> 2335.68]  Oh, we were talking about California.
[2335.68 --> 2336.68]  Who cares?
[2336.68 --> 2337.68]  Okay, you do.
[2337.68 --> 2338.68]  I know.
[2338.68 --> 2339.68]  Because that's...
[2339.68 --> 2340.68]  I'm sad now.
[2340.68 --> 2343.68]  You're okay.
[2343.68 --> 2345.68]  We love you, John.
[2345.68 --> 2347.68]  We love you, boss.
[2347.68 --> 2355.68]  Intel is rebuilding itself on three pillars and the PC is apparently not one of them.
[2355.68 --> 2359.68]  So their three pillars are like Internet of Things, server, and memory?
[2359.68 --> 2360.68]  So yeah.
[2360.68 --> 2372.68]  So their CEO, Brian Krasanich, said that the PC business provides a foundation of intellectual property and a source of cash flow, but it is not the sole driver of our growth.
[2372.68 --> 2374.68]  I actually read this article.
[2374.68 --> 2377.68]  Okay, this is one where Colton's notes could have been a little bit better.
[2377.68 --> 2382.68]  Because it was something along the lines of the PC is...
[2382.68 --> 2383.68]  Here, I'm gonna...
[2383.68 --> 2394.68]  Okay, so already those three businesses generated nearly 40% of Intel's revenue and 60% of their operating profits.
[2394.68 --> 2398.68]  Very, very interesting.
[2398.68 --> 2405.68]  So that's how Intel continues to grow lately in spite of the ever shrinking demand for desktop PCs.
[2405.68 --> 2416.68]  Now, I suspect there's some chicken and egg going on here where if Intel was building dramatically faster computers that enable dramatically different user experiences,
[2416.68 --> 2423.68]  there might be more demand for them, but Intel also is not in control of the pace of the rest of the industry.
[2423.68 --> 2431.68]  So Intel can build as many eight core CPUs as it wants, but if no one is building software that actually leverages all those threads,
[2431.68 --> 2437.68]  then they're basically just more cores sitting in your computer consuming power and doing pretty much not a whole lot of anything.
[2437.68 --> 2438.68]  Which is a thing.
[2438.68 --> 2439.68]  Which I totally get.
[2439.68 --> 2440.68]  So that...
[2440.68 --> 2443.68]  AMD's news is...
[2443.68 --> 2446.68]  They lost a lot of money, but like, not as much.
[2446.68 --> 2449.68]  But actually more, depending on how you want to compare it.
[2449.68 --> 2450.68]  Yeah.
[2450.68 --> 2451.68]  Yay, AMD!
[2451.68 --> 2452.68]  Yay!
[2452.68 --> 2453.68]  Yay!
[2453.68 --> 2457.68]  It is just kind of a miracle to me that they still exist at this point.
[2457.68 --> 2458.68]  Enabling today, inspiring tomorrow.
[2458.68 --> 2459.68]  Losing today.
[2459.68 --> 2460.68]  Losing money today.
[2460.68 --> 2462.68]  Losing money tomorrow.
[2462.68 --> 2467.68]  Hopefully not losing money anymore three days after tomorrow.
[2467.68 --> 2468.68]  That's the goal.
[2468.68 --> 2470.68]  So you guys can check out the numbers if you want.
[2470.68 --> 2472.68]  As usual, we're going to have all that stuff linked.
[2472.68 --> 2483.68]  But the long and the short of it is that on a revenue of just shy of four billion, they were down 28% year over year revenue wise,
[2483.68 --> 2486.68]  primarily due to lower client processor sales.
[2486.68 --> 2491.68]  They had a gross margin of 27%, down six percentage points year over year.
[2491.68 --> 2502.68]  And due to lower unit volumes, this is due to lower unit volumes and product mix, and they had a net loss of 660 million on that $4 billion of revenue.
[2502.68 --> 2503.68]  Which is, yeah, okay.
[2503.68 --> 2504.68]  Yep.
[2504.68 --> 2514.68]  Hopefully their processors and new GPUs do well in the future.
[2514.68 --> 2515.68]  Yep.
[2515.68 --> 2520.68]  I think that we're all hoping for their upcoming GPUs to absolutely rock the house.
[2520.68 --> 2521.68]  That would be really good.
[2521.68 --> 2526.68]  And for their Zen processors to rock even more houses even harder.
[2526.68 --> 2530.68]  Yeah, I agree with that statement too because of exactly what Intel just did.
[2530.68 --> 2532.68]  So that article was posted by Zmule.
[2532.68 --> 2534.68]  The next one we have up here, also Zmule.
[2534.68 --> 2536.68]  Zmule is like on fire this week.
[2536.68 --> 2539.68]  I'm going to post all the articles because my name is Zmule.
[2539.68 --> 2540.68]  Yeah, that's what he sounds like.
[2540.68 --> 2541.68]  Yeah.
[2541.68 --> 2542.68]  Alright, you hit this one.
[2542.68 --> 2543.68]  He types that fast.
[2543.68 --> 2544.68]  He's like, brrrr.
[2544.68 --> 2546.68]  Okay, so this is actually not that interesting.
[2546.68 --> 2547.68]  Sorry, Zmule.
[2547.68 --> 2548.68]  It is in rapid fire.
[2548.68 --> 2549.68]  And Colton.
[2549.68 --> 2550.68]  And Colton.
[2550.68 --> 2552.68]  It is in rapid fire on the thing.
[2552.68 --> 2557.68]  The Oculus' founder, so Palmer Luckey is being sued for stuff.
[2557.68 --> 2562.68]  Apparently he worked for some company in 2011 who had him produce some stuff.
[2562.68 --> 2568.68]  And then now maybe that stuff is part of an Oculus or maybe it's not.
[2568.68 --> 2569.68]  We don't know.
[2569.68 --> 2575.68]  All we know at all is that a judge said like, okay, this can become something in court.
[2575.68 --> 2583.68]  Lucky calls the lawsuit a brazen attempt to secure for themselves a stake in Oculus VR's
[2583.68 --> 2586.68]  recent multi-billion dollar acquisition by Facebook.
[2586.68 --> 2591.68]  So basically doesn't seem to think a whole lot of it.
[2591.68 --> 2592.68]  Yup.
[2592.68 --> 2594.68]  We've got another rapid fire topic.
[2594.68 --> 2595.68]  Wow, Zmule again.
[2595.68 --> 2596.68]  Zmule!
[2596.68 --> 2597.68]  Zmule!
[2597.68 --> 2598.68]  Zmule!
[2598.68 --> 2602.68]  Zmule, I carry all Zmule's things.
[2602.68 --> 2603.68]  Zmule.
[2603.68 --> 2605.68]  So here the original article is from the JDEC website.
[2605.68 --> 2612.68]  These are the presumably super cool at a party engineers who develop memory standards.
[2612.68 --> 2615.68]  Actually, to be completely honest, if I was at a party and there was a JDEC engineer,
[2615.68 --> 2617.68]  I would definitely probably hang out with them the entire time.
[2617.68 --> 2619.68]  So I was actually actually, I'm going to tangent.
[2619.68 --> 2620.68]  Just putting that out there.
[2620.68 --> 2624.76]  putting that out there and i know you've done that kind of stuff before too yep i was at an ocz
[2624.76 --> 2630.40]  party where like some famous person like some rapper or something i can't remember like actually
[2630.40 --> 2638.80]  a big deal was performing and i managed to find um a guy who worked on the original sata specification
[2638.80 --> 2646.12]  um for then he like worked at marvell like during those years and like we were he like talked my
[2646.12 --> 2652.36]  ear off about sata the entire time we like found a quiet corner and i was just like so like tell me
[2652.36 --> 2657.40]  about this and tell me about that and like you know what what makes it better than peta how do we make
[2657.40 --> 2662.52]  it faster how do we keep making it faster what's the future of drive interfaces and and like like
[2662.52 --> 2669.88]  the whatever taren it was cool um so yes yes as much as i really is wearing a shirt that says talk
[2669.88 --> 2677.54]  nerdy to me yeah and tries to mock you yeah some guy talking nerdy to you yeah so anyway jadek
[2677.54 --> 2683.10]  publishes gddr5x graphics memory standard so they're targeting data rates in the 10 to 14 gigabit per
[2683.10 --> 2688.92]  second range which would be about a 2x increase over gddr5 now to be clear this is not a replacement
[2688.92 --> 2694.10]  for hbm or hbm2 which is what you're going to see on high-end graphics cards like amd's current fiji
[2694.10 --> 2700.10]  cards but rather um a replacement for the mid-range cards where you can't necessarily
[2700.10 --> 2705.98]  afford the additional cost of cutting edge hbm memory nor would you necessarily see a benefit
[2705.98 --> 2713.38]  from it because it's no secret that modern high-end cards are doing just fine with gddr5
[2713.38 --> 2719.46]  so it usually takes a few generations for a mid-range or a low-end card to catch up to the performance of
[2719.46 --> 2724.08]  an old high-end card so in theory we'd be good with slower memory for quite some time well this
[2724.08 --> 2733.84]  is a way to address that yeah um all right what else we got here i think i'm just gonna kind of
[2733.84 --> 2739.24]  you want to do the thing yeah yeah let's do it why don't why don't you go first while i do a little
[2739.24 --> 2744.30]  mini news thing here so this was posted by that norwegian guy the original article here is wccf tech
[2744.30 --> 2756.24]  and uh let me just pull up my screen capture here the gtx 970 now the most popular graphics card on the
[2756.24 --> 2762.74]  steam survey which i actually had a number of people in the forum thread about this say was not
[2762.74 --> 2768.48]  interesting and not remarkable that is incredibly interesting and incredibly remarkable i don't
[2768.48 --> 2776.16]  remember the last time actually no i think probably the last time we would have seen a current gen card
[2776.16 --> 2784.04]  like high-end card as a top card on the steam survey would have been in the 8800 gt days and what you
[2784.04 --> 2794.28]  guys need to also realize is the 8800 gt was i think it was like it was 299 or or something 249 i think it
[2794.28 --> 2799.22]  then it got jacked up to 299 and then for like super clock or whatever it was up to like 349 don't
[2799.22 --> 2805.24]  don't quote me on the exact numbers but it was a very very reasonable price and delivered pretty much
[2805.24 --> 2812.86]  the same performance as the 8800 gtx that had come before it so that was an extremely disruptive card
[2812.86 --> 2822.52]  the gtx 970 not that disruptive compared to nvidia's own lineup so the fact that it has sold so incredibly
[2822.52 --> 2826.68]  well no go ahead i'm gonna run and get one the fact that it has sold so incredibly well over time
[2826.68 --> 2834.48]  really points to uh what a success uh nvidia has been in creating and marketing that card all right
[2834.48 --> 2838.18]  well you talk about what you found i'm gonna go find something cool if you guys want to find cool
[2838.18 --> 2847.34]  things so i don't even know like what entirely this is it has little arm things which seem to be able
[2847.34 --> 2852.50]  to operate so this one is like a clampy arm the other one is also a clampy arm but it has like
[2852.52 --> 2858.46]  you could put something in it and it would sit there i don't know how it operates like the arm
[2858.46 --> 2866.34]  can move it can reach out and grab things and do whatever but realistically like there's a huge thing
[2866.34 --> 2872.64]  in the back there's dcn i'm assuming the head turns internally within the dome the dome doesn't turn
[2872.64 --> 2881.66]  itself but it's it's a tape player so right now there is currently um a depeche mode tape
[2881.66 --> 2887.82]  construction time again by depeche mode so it's a tape player and a robot
[2887.82 --> 2896.06]  i don't i don't know i don't i don't know it's not for sale it's up in the store that's not for
[2896.06 --> 2899.66]  sale this is what was actually right beside it so i'm gonna take this away you're up all right
[2899.66 --> 2905.66]  okay so i found two things first of all this awesome coca-cola phone that's not really that
[2905.66 --> 2912.10]  big of a deal putting replacement plates on phones was uh was a thing no no what i'm into right here
[2912.10 --> 2924.08]  is this toshiba t 1200 yes my friends mechanical keyboard yeah that's right lcd display with brightness
[2924.08 --> 2933.86]  brightness knob wheel right here latching fold down display lcd contrast wheel over here on the left as
[2933.86 --> 2940.28]  well as a b and dis and reset whatever the devil all that is we've got our 12 volt input our power
[2940.28 --> 2945.94]  on and off switch as well as there's a hard drive on and off switch which i think is fantastic the
[2945.94 --> 2952.48]  battery release button here it's got a oh printer port external floppy disk drive port uh composite port
[2952.48 --> 2960.14]  uh keypad port oh rgb i think did they used to call it vg oh look at that that three and a half inch
[2960.14 --> 2967.82]  floppy drive with three and a half inch expansion bay below it this thing is about as freaking vintage
[2967.82 --> 2974.44]  as it gets made by the toshiba corporation and i think john's got something john sub in here man go
[2974.44 --> 2981.64]  for it tell them all about what you found so i just found what appears to be okay can you guys see me
[2981.64 --> 2989.68]  great i think this is the original sound blaster it has oh hi luke luke is back so it has a
[2989.68 --> 2996.28]  joystick port okay it has an old it has an old school joystick port and some sort of dial it has
[2996.28 --> 3000.72]  some sort of like weird dial thing sticking out i guess that's for volume and something called the
[3000.72 --> 3007.44]  talking parrot i'm get this mischievous parrot mimics your speech talks back passes outrageous remark and
[3007.44 --> 3013.26]  screams when you tickle it so it kind of sounds like the predecessor to bonzi buddy except it won't
[3013.26 --> 3017.12]  install like horrible malware on your system that system that you can't get rid of
[3017.12 --> 3028.82]  uh yeah system requirements dos 2.0 or higher coming to a um coming to an egb or excuse me an ega
[3028.82 --> 3036.52]  based graphic system near you um so yeah you need 512 kilobytes of ram minimum hold on there luke
[3036.52 --> 3042.74]  make sure you have at least 512 kilobytes of ram who has 512 kilobytes of ram i don't i heard that's
[3042.74 --> 3047.44]  all you'll ever need no bill gates said what it was like 64 you know he never said that he never said
[3047.44 --> 3052.84]  that oh okay okay then today i learned they have giant stacks i only bought brought part of the giant
[3052.84 --> 3056.86]  stacks i don't even know if these are written yet probably not but they have giant stacks of all the
[3056.86 --> 3062.06]  linux you could need they have ubuntu and i believe mint you can come here and get a free disc and then one
[3062.06 --> 3067.52]  thing that i like is going to be kind of hard to show but i'll get it up there giant bin of cpu
[3067.52 --> 3073.56]  yeah you can you you can see it show them the pentium pro show them the pentium pro and they can't hear
[3073.56 --> 3082.46]  you remember because the mic's over here check out that pentium pro yeah boy yeah boy okay okay i've got
[3082.46 --> 3088.42]  i've got two i cheated i brought two things oh you brought two things too okay okay mine right here
[3088.42 --> 3098.94]  this my friends is the 3d mouse 3d mouse it has it's made by a4 tech since 1987 feel the noiseless
[3098.94 --> 3104.26]  comfort it's actually got like a a thing through the package so you can spin the scroll wheel check
[3104.26 --> 3114.18]  this out dpi 520 which is 30 faster than 400 dpi wow wow amazing enjoy quiet scrolling without distracting
[3114.18 --> 3122.28]  noises 3d mouse wow also does it go in the z direction and also no it does not so it doesn't
[3122.28 --> 3128.12]  do z it just does x and y yeah here show show them the close-up of the package the package is so amazing
[3128.12 --> 3132.74]  yeah it's it's fine it's fine yeah uh shift it down a little bit it's got a reflection
[3132.74 --> 3142.76]  there uh the other way there you go okay check that out dpi 520 is 30 faster than 400 dpi my friends
[3142.76 --> 3150.06]  yes my friends wow indeed okay okay check this out check this out this is okay you're my vanna white
[3150.06 --> 3160.38]  right now i think this is uh higher there you go this is before the aol the aol cd became a thing okay
[3160.38 --> 3168.78]  that is an aol three and a half inch floppy diskette yes my friends that is a great value right there i can
[3168.78 --> 3177.34]  let that go for as little as 1499.95 yes that can be done in seven easy payments of two hundred dollars
[3178.04 --> 3182.94]  going once going twice gone my sanity is gone thank you thank you for that
[3182.94 --> 3186.08]  did you find something john get in there all right go go go
[3186.08 --> 3194.00]  so i also this is another fantastic thing i found you guys remember this it's one of those old slot
[3194.00 --> 3200.88]  style pentium twos and thank you taryn and if i recall correctly i think this is the only
[3200.88 --> 3210.10]  the only ever the only slot style um consumer cpu that intel ever produced and of hey linus um correct
[3210.10 --> 3215.62]  me if i'm wrong on this but wasn't this basically just a pentium three without some like instruction
[3215.62 --> 3222.50]  set extension like don't remember actually that is you're going back so far that yeah before my time
[3222.50 --> 3227.38]  the performance isn't too far off from a pentium three but it comes in this really cool slot that
[3227.38 --> 3232.10]  has a shiny thing on it and they just don't make them like that anymore unfortunately the pentium two
[3232.10 --> 3244.58]  can you sit down i can sit down okay i'm talking for luke uh yeah you hold it higher up yeah right
[3244.58 --> 3252.98]  there that's a whole bunch of ram two gigabytes minimum capacity two gigabytes minimum capacity ecc memory
[3252.98 --> 3260.10]  you're just gonna have to talk louder i'll do it all right so that is a bucket of two gig sticks of
[3260.10 --> 3266.50]  ddr2 ecc ram server ram right there a lot of those look like fully buffered dims if uh if they have
[3266.50 --> 3274.50]  those heat sinks on them yes my friends that is a very very small fraction of the random ram that they
[3274.50 --> 3282.34]  have around here they've got everything check this out new sealed microsoft windows server 2003 enterprise
[3282.34 --> 3293.54]  edition brand new sealed adobe photoshop cs4 what else you got over there oh that is a doozy of a that
[3293.54 --> 3300.58]  is a doozy of a keyboard this my friends commodore 64 keyboard it's got the green sticker on it so that
[3300.58 --> 3309.78]  means it works i mean look at this this has keys that run stop like i got are you kidding me control
[3309.78 --> 3315.78]  port one control port two this is this is pre my days like my family had a commodore but that was
[3315.78 --> 3321.06]  when i was at an age where i would not i would not remember such a thing i mean commodore they counted
[3321.06 --> 3330.74]  like microsoft f1 f3 f5 f7 it's like xbox xbox 360 xbox one it's did no one knows how to count in the
[3330.74 --> 3337.86]  computer industry it's absolutely amazing so i think uh i think we're gonna get kicked out of here pretty
[3337.86 --> 3342.26]  soon so we're not gonna we're not gonna carry on too much longer but if luke and john find one more
[3342.26 --> 3349.06]  thing each we can uh we can show you guys some other cool relics here but don't miss oh wow oh wow
[3349.06 --> 3352.34]  taren brought yeah okay well this is worth waiting around for guys
[3355.38 --> 3361.78]  this am i holding it up correctly can they hear you yeah yeah it's good it's good they can see it
[3361.78 --> 3367.30]  okay so this is this was actually donated as is except for probably the free geek sticker that's sitting in
[3367.30 --> 3372.10]  there it's fedex shipping boxes that someone made it rotated around yep that someone made into a
[3372.10 --> 3376.50]  computer case that's still holding together it was properly water cooled at one point it's been
[3376.50 --> 3381.46]  slightly taken apart so it's not exactly functional this moment but it could work if you just kind of
[3381.46 --> 3387.70]  hook some things up and probably replace the fluid so yeah people can get creative i don't know
[3388.90 --> 3394.50]  that's pretty crazy so someone ran this as their computer is it a fire hazard maybe to a certain
[3394.50 --> 3401.78]  degree but uh it worked this is the best thing ever it worked it did work this is another one of those
[3401.78 --> 3407.94]  like actually not for sale things and if taren dropped it it would be very bad
[3410.34 --> 3419.46]  i was just gonna go on the other side yeah that's fine okay so uh thank you guys very much all 8600 of
