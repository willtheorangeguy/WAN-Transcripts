[0.00 --> 8.16]  the start of the show you know it's really good that you're the one who sings copyrighted theme
[8.16 --> 14.64]  songs and jingles um whenever we sing them on the show because i think your interpretations
[14.64 --> 25.04]  of them are very unlikely to get us uh to get us sued that turned that turned from i think
[25.04 --> 33.04]  indiana jones into star wars like i i it would be very difficult to attack
[36.16 --> 41.52]  which harrison ford movie is this from i'm not criticizing you i'm saying it's a good thing
[42.88 --> 47.84]  uh welcome to the wan show guys sorry we're a little late i know that you grow you've grown
[47.84 --> 54.24]  tired of our excuses and there really is honestly it was i have never seen this one before please
[54.24 --> 61.52]  so the funny thing is is this is at least partially my fault even if i didn't realize it a little bit
[61.52 --> 68.16]  so i had requested to xsplit and this is actually really cool i had requested a feature in the
[68.16 --> 76.32]  software because we have one camera in particular that you cannot turn off the output of the onboard
[76.32 --> 83.92]  microphone over hdmi and we have one capture card that does not allow you to select a single mono
[83.92 --> 91.92]  channel and output it in stereo mono okay so i requested a feature that was that would allow
[91.92 --> 99.68]  you in xsplit to clone the left channel to the right or the right channel to the left they obliged
[99.68 --> 107.04]  they provided said feature so i was trying to set up the show today i didn't realize this okay i was
[107.04 --> 114.16]  trying to set up the show today and i had levels on the microphone and i was talking into the microphone
[114.16 --> 120.08]  and the recorded file which i always check now because i'm tired of you guys being the ones to
[120.08 --> 128.56]  inform me that uh that i'm doing it wrong so i did a pre-recording and i checked it to discover that uh oh
[128.56 --> 138.24]  there's there's no audio on the output file turns out my features there except it was cloning the empty
[138.24 --> 146.00]  channel because we have a mono microphone to both channels which the audio level monitor doesn't account
[146.00 --> 154.64]  for so uh maybe additional feature is to check if the channel is empty and then make the default option
[154.64 --> 162.16]  to copy the non-empty channel one store and says pre-recorded to which i would reply i am either a
[162.16 --> 171.92]  freaking genius or uh big and tasty posted posted two squirtles i like squirtle a lot i like squirtle
[171.92 --> 179.12]  yeah uh and we've got a bunch of you saying there's no audio but we've also uh a i checked and b we've got
[179.12 --> 184.96]  some of you saying that indeed there there is there is audio so um so there you go that's what
[184.96 --> 191.28]  happened today i have been diagnosing why i have audio levels on my on my indicator and no audio in
[191.28 --> 202.48]  my files you know because i'm not audiophile oh oh dang um snore but whatever says totally not live
[203.28 --> 208.48]  um so there you go all right let's uh let's get into the show we've got a lot of great topics for you
[208.48 --> 217.44]  guys today number one is of course google io sort of a big deal uh number two is after i scroll
[217.44 --> 224.64]  through all the google things um nvidia has posted official gtx 1070 specifications pretty similar to
[224.64 --> 229.44]  what we were thinking but uh it's nice to have that confirmed yes also there's an english bank that is
[229.44 --> 236.64]  literally going to electroshock you if you spend too much money which is fantastic i i i think that is
[236.64 --> 242.32]  wonderful and hilarious also uber is joining the race for driverless cars because screw employees
[243.12 --> 248.32]  who needs them who may or may not be employees by the way you know because because oh if ai gets
[248.32 --> 253.28]  so sophisticated that we create a massive ai force to do all the work for us then we have to pay them
[253.28 --> 264.96]  wouldn't that suck
[264.96 --> 294.64]  wow that is a big sponsor call out that violates our normal sponsored spot guidelines cook bah cook
[294.64 --> 303.52]  dot bah blue apron started by vikings not true possibly true not sure what the hell are you talking
[303.52 --> 304.56]  about cook dot bah
[308.40 --> 315.60]  that's what i'm talking about okay so i feel like the first thing that we should probably acknowledge
[315.60 --> 323.84]  um is the way we tried to pull the wool over your eyes last week with a pre-recorded man show
[324.72 --> 331.20]  so to be clear not a whole lot of forethought went into that nope we sat down to record the show and i
[331.20 --> 336.08]  was like you know what we should do it would be funny we should pretend that it's live we should
[336.08 --> 340.88]  pretend we're live the internet connection there was awful there was no way it was going to be able to be
[340.88 --> 350.64]  live no that was that was not going to be a thing um and i will confess that while our plan did not
[350.64 --> 357.12]  extend to altering the time on the clock in the bottom right hand corner of my screen
[360.16 --> 369.28]  whoops it did extend to um us starting the pre-recorded broadcast a little late so you guys
[369.28 --> 374.32]  wouldn't think something was up and we did like a few people said this uh we did say that like the
[374.32 --> 379.36]  chats complaining about the camera or whatever else yeah which if we were noticing those things we
[379.36 --> 385.12]  probably would have super noticed the massive glaring audio issues that we apparently had so
[385.12 --> 390.80]  i figured out after the fact what the audio issues had to do with it seemed like they were related to
[391.44 --> 399.20]  um the audio input from that recording camera not coming in anymore because the battery died
[399.28 --> 407.36]  or something and then it just it took it took the microphone a bit to get its crap together the
[407.36 --> 412.72]  weird thing about it is that we were using a single microphone we were recording on a razer siren and
[412.72 --> 418.00]  that microphone was running the whole time and that was responsible for both the left and the right
[418.00 --> 424.96]  channels but only one channel was messed up so that's why the archive didn't have the audio issues which
[424.96 --> 432.72]  took me until about 6 a.m to fix by the way because um non-fixed frame rate footage is a nightmare um
[432.72 --> 441.20]  when the camera switched to the webcam was causing a desync even in sony vegas which handles um non-fixed
[441.20 --> 446.32]  frame or variable frame rate footage not non-fixed variable frame rate footage better than anything else
[446.32 --> 451.68]  i went through handbrake ffmpeg because i'm familiar with taking variable frame rate footage and turning
[451.68 --> 457.04]  it into something that premiere can recognize with ffmpeg there is a procedure for that it's a pain in
[457.04 --> 461.92]  the butt but it's doable but i tried that that didn't work handbrake didn't work premiere didn't
[461.92 --> 468.32]  work vegas didn't even work and to make matters worse i didn't have any of those programs installed
[468.32 --> 473.44]  on my laptop the internet was awful so i was trying to do all of this stuff remotely because i had
[473.44 --> 478.48]  actually already sent the file back to the office right and then i would have to upload them from the
[478.48 --> 485.76]  office to youtube wait for processing on a 55 minute video and then i could preview it back in
[485.76 --> 493.20]  my hotel room to find out if the synchronization was working that sounds horrible uh question though
[494.40 --> 500.48]  how does xplit footage end up being mixed frame rate so uh because it's not always mixed frame rate
[500.48 --> 505.44]  i think they have a i think they okay it was a new install okay because i was streaming off of a
[505.44 --> 510.08]  machine that i don't normally stream on okay so i hadn't gone through all of my all of my procedures
[510.08 --> 515.52]  but the weird thing is that it wasn't flv it was variable frame rate mp4 which i think may have
[515.52 --> 522.40]  actually had to do not with xsplit screwing up but with xsplit covering my butt when the camera changed
[522.40 --> 531.52]  to the webcam oh so i think we ended up with a variable frame rate mp4 that xsplit somehow managed managed
[531.52 --> 535.28]  to merge because the webcam was running at a different frame rate yeah okay because i was going to
[535.28 --> 540.96]  say i've used xsplit to record things a number of times and imported into adobe premiere and had no
[540.96 --> 546.00]  problems but i do also know that people have had problems doing that yes so i wasn't sure how that
[546.00 --> 549.52]  worked but we had no choice because the battery died you know the funny thing is about after that
[549.52 --> 555.52]  broadcast where i had and some of you actually noticed this is hilarious my laptop was running off
[555.52 --> 562.48]  of a portable battery bank that couldn't output enough current to run my laptop so i had to constantly
[562.48 --> 568.56]  keep turning it back on because the overcurrent protection was triggering um but right after the
[568.56 --> 575.12]  show i found an outlet on the wall it was like right beside it yeah that was that was rough oh man oh
[575.76 --> 582.48]  that trip was actually pretty tiring i had a lot of fun uh travel day back was uh was kind of uh kind
[582.48 --> 588.88]  of a drag because it was i don't know i just like went on my ah yeah i don't i don't mind layovers as
[588.88 --> 595.12]  much as most people do because i'm in like this place that has everything that i probably need and
[595.12 --> 602.24]  it probably spent okay if it has wall outlets and it has wall outlets mostly unless you're in like malaysia
[602.24 --> 607.60]  yeah then it's fine and most airports in the states have those things so i just like plugged in my laptop
[607.60 --> 613.12]  plugged in my earbuds or my other headphones which i bring both of just in case i get annoyed with one
[613.12 --> 618.16]  of them like i don't know i have everything that i need in my bag always and i'm in a place that has
[618.16 --> 623.52]  everything else that i would really need and it's just like okay well yep yeah i don't have as much of
[623.52 --> 628.24]  an issue with it either which probably made me less empathetic than i probably should have been um
[629.52 --> 635.76]  all right so this was posted by suicidal franco on the forum well like the yeah the general discussion
[635.76 --> 640.72]  thread was posted by suicidal franco and then we're gonna have a bunch of like different things from
[640.72 --> 648.32]  like the verge or techno buffalo or whoever else happened to cover it yeah so uh google io kind of
[648.32 --> 656.08]  a big deal so first up our original article here is from techno buffalo let's go ahead and uh no buffalo
[656.08 --> 662.80]  screen share here our good friend john rettinger over there no no no brandon russell so one of his guys but
[662.80 --> 670.40]  i'm sure john glanced at it at some point or another this is the google home there's all there's
[670.40 --> 676.88]  also home.google.com if you want to see uh news directly from google it's it's kind of google's
[676.88 --> 683.04]  response to the amazon echo which did we actually release a review on that okay so the amazon echo we
[683.68 --> 688.24]  we bought one yeah we got it here in spite of the fact that it's not available in canada we realized that
[688.24 --> 693.52]  nothing worked in canada and we couldn't even like vpn trick it in any kind of because like it just
[693.52 --> 699.52]  didn't know how to do like with uh microsoft for for cortana i don't think you have to anymore but
[699.52 --> 703.92]  for a while there to get it to work you had to vpn out to get it to work but then it actually was
[703.92 --> 707.76]  kind of fine i understood why they didn't do it because didn't know everything yeah for most general
[707.76 --> 714.96]  things it was fine not echo echo just yeah no so we had a contract writer that was writing tech
[714.96 --> 721.04]  quickies for us for at the time and we sent the echo to him to do an ltt for the first time ever
[721.04 --> 725.84]  and he basically disappeared off the face of the earth and now he has an amazon echo i was just gonna
[725.84 --> 731.28]  say got that echo though he's a nice he's a nice enough dude i i harbor no ill will towards him
[731.28 --> 735.60]  there was some crazy stuff going on yeah probably just misplaced his life was complicated at the time
[736.16 --> 744.32]  but uh he has an echo and we do not yes um google alo alo alo google alo
[744.32 --> 749.20]  all right oh really we're not going to talk anymore about the echo excuse me i guess that
[749.20 --> 753.04]  was the problem i felt like we stopped talking about the echo but we actually just yeah anyways
[753.04 --> 754.80]  no no you're right you did it too
[757.44 --> 764.48]  anyways it will answer questions it will play music it will have leds thanks for them notes bruh
[764.48 --> 769.68]  um it will be customizable with different colored shells so you can like if you just need to kind of
[769.68 --> 773.28]  put it somewhere in a dark corner where you don't really see it you can probably get it in black the
[773.28 --> 777.36]  one that they have in their main picture on home.google.com is in white which looks like
[777.36 --> 782.88]  nice and clean and stuff it can communicate with a chromecast that's cool which is actually quite cool
[782.88 --> 788.40]  yep um it but it won't support multiple google accounts on launch but it might uh do that later
[788.40 --> 793.04]  i don't know if you said it plays music it does do that as well yeah so that should tie in pretty
[793.04 --> 800.64]  well to the the chromecast tie-in uh yes because hopefully chromecast music or chrome music or whatever
[800.64 --> 804.80]  they decided to i forget what they call it yeah but the music version of the chromecast
[804.80 --> 808.40]  can tie in with this thing and then it can play sound because i don't really trust
[808.40 --> 813.20]  this like tiny little speaker to be very good or useful in terms of playing sound google's branding
[813.20 --> 819.12]  sometimes in its simplicity gets complicated yeah because we're working with the google store on like
[819.12 --> 823.20]  a father's day thing i don't know if you know about this i've heard about it um so i'm i'm gonna be
[823.20 --> 829.76]  um actually i don't know if the contract is signed so maybe i won't be but um in theory possibly i'm
[829.76 --> 835.84]  actually going to be showing a bunch of google technology to my grandpa in not necessarily just
[835.84 --> 843.84]  like a straight up elders react tm uh type of ripoff okay that i will probably get you know sued for or
[843.84 --> 851.20]  something um at least we know but more it's more about you know here's a guy who i tried to set up
[851.20 --> 856.56]  with an internet connection 10 years ago with like a hand-me-down crt monitor and like a cheap tower
[856.56 --> 861.12]  and and like i i tried to make it as affordable for him as possible and he loved it but it was like
[861.12 --> 866.08]  it was like really hard on his eyes because the screens were small and stuff at the time so so
[866.08 --> 871.92]  here's me kind of trying to bring that into the year 2016 and show him some of the cool applicable
[871.92 --> 877.04]  things that some of google's technologies would would allow um things like better medic medication
[877.04 --> 883.04]  notifications and reminders definitely yeah i'd love to see him try vr um so i've just yeah
[883.04 --> 891.68]  uh old people in vr are like so i think they're sending a smart watch um a nexus 6p so a nice big
[891.68 --> 896.24]  smartphone i'll have to see if it has like old man vision mode it probably does i think it does
[896.24 --> 903.12]  there's an app you can get yeah um they're sending a google cardboard um uh that there's some there's some
[903.12 --> 907.52]  other stuff too so i'm working on that but anyway getting back to my point that i was trying to make
[907.52 --> 911.60]  uh one of the things that they were saying was we want you to be really clear that you're working with
[911.60 --> 919.44]  google store i'm like yeah they're like that is not a retail like google store it's like a website
[919.44 --> 924.40]  google store and i'm like yeah and they're like it is separate from the google play store which is
[924.40 --> 930.88]  not the google store because the google store sells physical items the google web physical store
[930.88 --> 942.56]  uh uh so so anyway but doesn't the google play store also sell devices or is that wrong i think
[942.56 --> 948.56]  it has i thought you could i think it has at times yeah oh so so so so so back to where we were trying
[948.56 --> 955.44]  to figure out chromecast i was gonna suggest that maybe maybe it was like google google music but then
[955.44 --> 960.00]  now that's like play music because i couldn't remember what they call the damn thing yeah and
[960.00 --> 969.04]  um that's a nightmare yeah so so yeah like is it chromecast music or which is different from google
[969.04 --> 973.44]  the best thing is we could have just googled this the whole time i know with their own software we
[973.44 --> 980.64]  could find it out um oh there's people commenting in the chat about the uncensored f-bomb in one of our
[980.64 --> 987.28]  recent videos what what video oh was it me no oh good and well you wouldn't have edited it anyway
[988.08 --> 995.60]  like it was an editor no did i say it no it was an editor saying it no i said it oh yeah wasn't me this
[995.60 --> 1004.72]  time yeah so no i just said uh i just said here is uh you know gold star for smarty pants is already
[1004.72 --> 1011.28]  knowing how like um ipmi or and wake on land and like all that stuff works i was just like well
[1011.28 --> 1017.28]  here's a gold star for the rest of you here's a video um and it was supposed to be i should have said
[1017.28 --> 1026.08]  that on the synergy video yeah it was done by yeah well you know part of it was seeing those comments
[1026.08 --> 1030.16]  on some of your videos as well where people will like people will watch our videos and they'll go
[1030.16 --> 1036.24]  is this the first time you ever heard of wake on land i've known about this for 15 years it's like
[1036.24 --> 1041.28]  okay yeah that's good what if it's someone's first year into computers bruh then why are you clicking
[1041.28 --> 1047.44]  on a video about wake on land maybe just don't maybe just don't i mean click it anyway we love your views
[1047.44 --> 1051.60]  you know we love to talk to you guys sometimes we make jokes and maybe maybe there's something in
[1051.60 --> 1057.04]  there that you didn't know about or or maybe there's something that we missed and you can help inform
[1057.04 --> 1061.52]  people you know in the comments you could say something helpful or constructive it's like i've
[1061.52 --> 1068.56]  known about this forever and so so i was i was proactively responding to those comments and giving
[1068.56 --> 1074.64]  them gold internet stars um which i think is important you know you like a gold star for
[1074.64 --> 1079.84]  something that you've known for a long time that i didn't right sure makes you feel like a big man yeah
[1079.84 --> 1083.76]  gold star right there buddy that would actually be wonderful if we all got gold star stickers
[1083.76 --> 1088.80]  like anytime someone around the office helps you you like put a gold star on their shirt
[1091.60 --> 1099.92]  you know what's you know what's horrible is like from my experience as a parent and as a swimming
[1099.92 --> 1109.60]  teacher managing kids and from my experience as a small business owner managing adults it would
[1109.60 --> 1113.44]  probably work the principles are really not very different yeah and you know what's really funny is
[1113.92 --> 1119.68]  what you're saying and joking about is really not that different from the kinds of principles you
[1119.68 --> 1125.20]  will read about in management books the only difference is the physicality of it gold star
[1125.20 --> 1130.48]  yeah because walking around doing the same thing giving people little attaboys for doing something right
[1130.48 --> 1137.92]  is actually by far the best way to reinforce positive behavior yeah and actually by uh by doing so
[1137.92 --> 1143.84]  eliminate bad behavior yeah maybe i should get sheets of gold stars i think people feel like i'm
[1143.84 --> 1148.56]  patronizing them a little yes i think that but that's that's why you remove the physicality because
[1148.56 --> 1155.76]  then it doesn't see if it feels so patronizing what is that bad word um it's only bad in certain
[1155.76 --> 1163.44]  contexts i think like because okay so let's break it down patron so like that's a different word
[1163.44 --> 1169.20]  okay because a patron is like you could be a patron at a bar no no okay that's a different
[1169.20 --> 1175.76]  way of using the word but patron can be the same as matron which would be the male form of of of like
[1175.76 --> 1181.52]  like a mother or a father figure yes so patronizing it's funny we talk about how the gold stars would be
[1181.52 --> 1188.56]  more like dad and the kids means treating you like a child yes so that's where that's where now that
[1188.56 --> 1194.64]  i've sort of because patronizing is so bad but then like maternal instinct is a good thing yeah and and
[1194.64 --> 1201.36]  like and feeling cared for in the same way that your parents would care for you is something that we
[1201.36 --> 1208.40]  crave and something that we want we just don't want them to act like they're our parents anyways after
[1208.40 --> 1217.44]  all that it's called chromecast audio we got there um all right so original article here is from
[1217.44 --> 1225.76]  techno buffalo again we've got google aloe which uh heals your burns yeah i needed some of that
[1226.56 --> 1232.32]  still sort of do yeah mexico was fun for everyone but luke on the day when he got he got second degree
[1232.32 --> 1238.16]  burns on his freckles yeah which sounds like a very specific injury but it's a thing
[1238.40 --> 1243.60]  yeah i didn't know that yeah that's apparently a thing the rest of my skin was like i'm fine
[1243.60 --> 1251.36]  where the freckles are roasted wow it was bad uh yeah so i want you to find this it's not that hard
[1251.36 --> 1257.04]  to find google him find this thing because this ties into what we're exactly okay yeah yeah i'll find the
[1257.04 --> 1262.64]  tweet i'll bring that up okay you you talk about it in the meantime okay so snowden has tweeted about
[1262.64 --> 1268.64]  google's allo thing uh he says that google's security expert blogs discussing about how allo
[1268.64 --> 1278.56]  is unsafe by default um hours later he erased that part of the uh uh blog um and he says below that i
[1278.56 --> 1286.32]  believe i have it up google's decision yep there's another tweet actually google's decision to disable
[1286.32 --> 1292.56]  end-to-end encryption by default in its new allo chat app is dangerous and makes it unsafe and he
[1292.56 --> 1300.96]  recommends to avoid it for now that has 8 000 retweets and 7 800 likes so with that warning in
[1300.96 --> 1306.16]  the back of your mind let's talk a little bit about what it is yes uh it's a new messaging app for mobile
[1306.16 --> 1314.08]  only to which you might kind of go what the hell why do we need this what happened to g talk and then
[1314.08 --> 1324.80]  what about don't we have hangouts and uh doesn't uh oh man doesn't google own like uh some other
[1324.80 --> 1331.04]  stuff i think yeah so hold on who owns snapchat again is that facebook is like i think facebook
[1332.96 --> 1342.72]  yeah snapchat owned by facebook i thought google bought something anyway the point is why do we need
[1344.08 --> 1350.56]  another messaging app and maybe maybe this is more of a question for the people that use other
[1350.56 --> 1359.52]  messaging apps like i still can't quite figure out why people need um any more than just like yeah one
[1359.52 --> 1366.72]  i can't figure out what happened to that concept of like awesome desktop clients like trillion that just
[1367.52 --> 1373.76]  um amalgamated all your different chats and made it it's like and i used trillion for a long time i
[1373.76 --> 1380.40]  loved trillion but they just couldn't keep the bugs out of it because it feels like the um the chat
[1380.40 --> 1385.76]  platform owners were constantly changing things just to screw with trillion um i don't know if it's
[1385.76 --> 1391.12]  really good these days i'd love to hear from you guys but um the answer is that it is meant to be a
[1391.12 --> 1395.68]  fresh start for google's new communications division you sign up with a phone number and
[1395.68 --> 1402.80]  you can connect your google account to it so it's whatsapp but with additional nonsense yeah
[1403.76 --> 1409.52]  speaking of which who owns whatsapp again that's facebook owned by facebook oh okay yeah there we go
[1409.52 --> 1415.44]  that's facebook yeah i know that one yep um you can shrink or enlarge texts before sending it in
[1415.44 --> 1420.88]  messages which sounds super annoying i mean remember when msn messenger had the ability to
[1420.88 --> 1426.08]  change your font size okay that was kind of cool you had pink font yeah no i just mean it's not
[1426.08 --> 1430.88]  innovative right okay remember when msn messenger added the ability to write with your mouse can
[1430.88 --> 1436.00]  microsoft just make msn again i would actually go back i would go back yeah 100 like that especially
[1436.00 --> 1445.04]  if it worked on my phone oh my god so good i would hardcore go back to msn it was by far the best it had
[1445.04 --> 1450.72]  like the ability to send files to people it actually worked remote desktop control was built into
[1450.72 --> 1455.20]  it oh i diagnosed so many computers that way i was like oh you have msn yeah okay sweet we can just
[1455.20 --> 1460.72]  do this you know now it's like a huge mess we're gonna have to implement a new policy for wanshow
[1460.72 --> 1466.48]  anytime we talk about a messaging app we can't just talk about msn okay that's probably fair
[1467.36 --> 1473.92]  and this is emoji support was worlds ahead of what other applications you could import your own and you
[1473.92 --> 1480.24]  could send them yep which was freaking awesome um i wasn't a huge fan of them when they implemented them
[1480.24 --> 1486.64]  but when they when they introduced like the higher definition ones like that you had like all this
[1486.64 --> 1494.64]  variety like yeah okay so speaking of which you can send and receive indicators emojis and custom stickers
[1494.64 --> 1503.60]  they do say that uh conversations are encrypted on the wire which means nobody on the internet can read
[1503.60 --> 1510.16]  them as you send your message which is a funky way of saying that um they're they're the response to
[1510.16 --> 1515.52]  snowden's thing about it being not end-to-end encrypted is apparently that that is done because of
[1516.40 --> 1524.72]  the voice command side of things um my response to that is figure it out there is some cool stuff
[1524.72 --> 1529.84]  to be clear like for example if you're discussing with a friend like uh hey we want to go out for
[1529.84 --> 1535.28]  dinner you can actually bring google now features like recommending a restaurant right into the chat
[1535.28 --> 1539.84]  that's super cool which i can't think of any reason why you wouldn't be able to do with hangouts which
[1539.84 --> 1546.64]  also has video and works cross-platform why do companies think that single platform mobile only
[1546.64 --> 1552.48]  is better that's very stupid um one thing that i do like is the uh if your friend sends you a message
[1552.48 --> 1557.52]  aloe puts some suggested replies at the bottom that's super cool because if your phone can tell that
[1557.52 --> 1563.20]  you're like working out or you're at work or you're i love how work was in both of those or it can
[1563.20 --> 1568.32]  like tell you're doing something like you're driving it or that although you might not want an automated
[1568.32 --> 1575.92]  reply unless it's a lie yeah like hey i'm petting the dog yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um or like driving
[1575.92 --> 1580.64]  or something if you're doing something where you don't really have time to respond you can be able
[1580.64 --> 1587.52]  to respond easily in a like pre-done little packaged thing which is kind of cool um this is actually a
[1587.52 --> 1593.60]  suggestion not for aloe but for a messaging application that i'm actually likely to use like maybe hangouts
[1593.60 --> 1597.84]  so if anyone from google is watching this was actually terran's suggestion i think he was like
[1598.32 --> 1602.08]  because i was just reading the bit about how it has a feature where you can doodle on the pictures
[1602.08 --> 1607.04]  that people send you or it can like suggest to you whether you're the picture of your friend's dog
[1607.04 --> 1614.96]  is cute or not what yeah i don't think that's that useful um but what about this what if you could set
[1615.84 --> 1622.80]  contacts to send you pixelated versions of their images by default so you could tell if it's a
[1622.80 --> 1630.72]  dick pic before you open it i thought that was edsel was it ed maybe it's ed i don't know someone
[1630.72 --> 1635.12]  someone talking to me about that too yeah someone in there was talking about that i was like that is
[1635.12 --> 1642.08]  brilliant i mean who wouldn't want especially like at work like yeah say for example if you know hangouts
[1642.08 --> 1647.76]  wasn't a complete piece of trash and had a desktop client which it should have um so that you could
[1647.76 --> 1653.04]  actually have settings that stuck with computers rather than just being account wide you know there
[1653.04 --> 1658.32]  are reasons that client applications still make sense um so at work you could enable the feature
[1658.32 --> 1663.04]  that automatically blurs pictures so you wouldn't have an awkward situation where someone you know
[1663.04 --> 1668.48]  walks and looks over your shoulder and there's like boom dick pic yeah there's a good idea free of
[1668.48 --> 1676.48]  charge it's a thing um speaking of good ideas free of charge um let's see so that's kind of boring yeah
[1676.48 --> 1681.68]  yeah there's google duo i guess which is a video calling app because they need another app for
[1681.68 --> 1689.28]  communication okay so as a companion to the brand new messaging app yay we're splitting it up so we
[1689.28 --> 1700.88]  have more than one app to do the same thing yep um so yeah um so basically it has caller id
[1700.88 --> 1708.24]  which is the unique feature where you can see a stream of the person before you answer the call
[1708.24 --> 1710.96]  yeah um
[1714.08 --> 1720.08]  which i guess is the kind of thing that's going to lead to a lot of accidental nose picking
[1721.36 --> 1727.68]  while someone's looking at you while people figure out that that's a feat i i can't think of a any
[1727.68 --> 1733.44]  possible reason on the planet why i would want someone else's stream when they're calling me
[1733.44 --> 1737.92]  to start automatically before i pick up the call i know who it's from
[1740.48 --> 1750.08]  why why and i mean this is not like i'd like i hope to i hope i guess like if you're gonna do like
[1750.08 --> 1755.20]  uh we're gonna get a little tmi here for a second but if you're gonna have like a fap session with your
[1755.20 --> 1760.80]  partner and it happens to be their mom that is using their phone to video call you it might be a
[1760.80 --> 1766.56]  good idea for you to know it'd be like i should cover up before i answer this why would you ever
[1766.56 --> 1770.72]  answer a video call naked i mean you're just ready to go
[1774.80 --> 1779.68]  okay so why would you be ready to go if there wasn't some kind of pre-planning in place and if
[1779.68 --> 1785.28]  there was pre-planning wouldn't you know that who is operating the other end because if it's their
[1785.28 --> 1792.00]  mom while you're having a discussion about video calling maybe maybe communications with this person
[1792.00 --> 1798.48]  are just so often uh that that you're just you know you're just or maybe you want to like surprise them
[1798.48 --> 1805.76]  it's the the naked man tactic from how i met your mother where you're like i'm ready to go and then it's
[1805.76 --> 1810.64]  their mom and you're like crap maybe i'm still ready to go but it's not appropriate but a little less
[1814.48 --> 1822.24]  wow um luke getting his freak on here i mean you know uh the kids the twitch chat twitch chat's
[1822.24 --> 1829.20]  exploding now sex each other what says tristan we can't do that we're in person yeah it's against
[1829.20 --> 1837.04]  the twitch regulations anyway come on to get your act together yeah um so okay another app that i'm
[1837.04 --> 1843.60]  clearly too old to understand the value of so there you go it's apparently very simple to use and quick
[1843.60 --> 1851.44]  as demonstrated by the verge i managed to teach my 67 year old father who was still running ios 6 like
[1851.44 --> 1859.92]  three months ago how to chat on hangouts in like 40 seconds so i'm pretty sure that a video call in
[1859.92 --> 1865.20]  hangouts probably wasn't that hard to use the entire app is approximately five megs five megs of
[1865.84 --> 1872.56]  duplicating a function of an app that i literally by default definitely already have installed on my
[1872.56 --> 1883.28]  phone if it's an android phone and it's mobile only because screw you yeah i screw you people who you
[1883.28 --> 1888.96]  know want to sit in a chair at a desk and see a reasonable size image and not hold something while
[1888.96 --> 1895.20]  they chat with somebody yeah i mean because that that ties up one of your hands why is it always coming
[1895.20 --> 1900.00]  back to this one thing that is really annoying about the mobile only thing though actually the main
[1900.00 --> 1905.60]  thing in my opinion is a lot of work stuff like of course i'm going to usually use that app on my
[1905.60 --> 1909.92]  mobile device yeah to be completely honest but if i'm sitting at a desk it's really nice to be able
[1909.92 --> 1915.60]  to not pick up my phone and access it there lenovo you can figure your crap out will eventually be
[1915.60 --> 1922.96]  releasing the lenovo link 32 gb which looks great and i don't know what that is waiting to get it ever
[1922.96 --> 1928.88]  since ces and have been on an email list so that once they release it i can buy it personally bring it
[1928.88 --> 1934.80]  in here and then make a review about it and they still haven't oh my god what is it it's a usb
[1934.80 --> 1938.56]  pass-through device kind of thing that you plug into your computer and then you plug a charging cable
[1938.56 --> 1945.52]  to your phone into and then it makes it so that you get your phone on your computer which can already
[1945.52 --> 1951.68]  be done with like yeah asus includes that i think but who runs an asus phone yeah and it's it's device
[1951.68 --> 1956.56]  agnostics you can do it with whatever the heck you want um it's very fast there's something that you can
[1956.56 --> 1960.72]  do with like uh having your computer be a server and your phone communicates with it wireless yeah
[1960.72 --> 1966.48]  it's the wi-fi but it's extremely fast the link has storage built into it which is nice um and it has
[1966.48 --> 1971.28]  like a few other features like it can tell what orientation the phone is in oh okay and it like
[1972.00 --> 1976.48]  can you can drag and drop file there's a few things that it could do i can't remember exactly what they
[1976.48 --> 1984.16]  are right now that are better than the thing that the app could do and the other solutions it was it looks
[1984.16 --> 1991.20]  very nice and luke likes his pc like he likes his girls oily sometimes they don't need oil
[1995.20 --> 2001.12]  sometimes they're just good to go um so the android n beta speaking of being good to go
[2001.12 --> 2008.56]  has started it is an open beta type of relationship if you know what i mean and the full release will be
[2008.56 --> 2016.48]  coming later on this summer i don't need that i have done absolutely my relationship is 100 satisfactory
[2016.48 --> 2019.52]  i have uh no need for really that's not what you told me
[2022.64 --> 2029.04]  um i have actually done literally zero research into android n and why we would care because i actually
[2029.04 --> 2034.88]  follow very little pre-release uh news these days i kind of wait till the product lands and go oh yeah
[2034.88 --> 2038.08]  i like this or i don't like this because the reality of it is a lot of the features that get
[2038.08 --> 2043.84]  announced for products or software never end up making it into the product in the first place or
[2043.84 --> 2049.20]  the implementation is just kind of half-assed and stupid anyway yeah um so anyway android and open
[2049.20 --> 2058.32]  beta coming so it's supported by the uh nexus 6 nexus 9 nexus 5x nexus 6p nexus player pixel c and general mobile 4g
[2058.32 --> 2064.16]  and that'll be a story that's the full release coming this summer not like
[2065.04 --> 2071.84]  more beta-ness or whatever people might have interpreted that to mean um speaking of coming
[2071.84 --> 2078.96]  this summer coming this summer to a kitchen near you is blue apron and the oh by the way this is cool
[2078.96 --> 2085.84]  the first 250 people to use this link get two free meals on their first order so blue apron
[2085.84 --> 2093.92]  is the most upsetting sponsor for me that we have ever had because it's only in the us right now
[2093.92 --> 2102.08]  just gonna complain yep i know i know and it sounds amazing it sounds so cool so they deliver farm fresh
[2102.08 --> 2107.36]  ingredients that are locally sourced right to your doorstep in the right proportions for you to create
[2107.36 --> 2114.24]  the meal that they send you um they have two plans a two-person plan and a family plan the recipes are
[2114.24 --> 2118.40]  delivered in a refrigerated box so the ingredients will stay fresh even if you're not at home and
[2118.40 --> 2123.12]  they offer a large selection of recipes and they're always adding new dishes to the menu every week
[2123.12 --> 2129.76]  each menu is about 500 to 800 calories per person and the meals can be prepared in 40 minutes or less
[2129.76 --> 2136.96]  so with blue apron you cook for yourself but you get a quality meal you don't waste food yeah and
[2136.96 --> 2142.80]  huge thing if you it says one to two people so like i live on my own wasting food if i want to make
[2142.80 --> 2148.56]  interesting complicated meals is basically inevitable it's like even if you buy like one
[2148.56 --> 2153.12]  stupid thing of cilantro it's more than you need oh yeah and unless you're going to use cilantro again
[2153.12 --> 2159.44]  tomorrow it's all wilty and gross yeah exactly so like making anything fancy is really frustrating
[2159.44 --> 2163.60]  and like i just cook chicken every day it's one of those things where it's like it's a fundamental
[2163.60 --> 2170.48]  problem with the system okay i end up buying a bag of carrots this big every time i buy carrots why
[2170.48 --> 2175.84]  because the bag of carrots this big at superstore costs as much as buying the three carrots that i
[2175.84 --> 2184.72]  need to make pasta sauce today at nester's market so even though i might only use three of those carrots
[2184.72 --> 2188.16]  and that's this is an extreme example obviously i'm going to use more of the carrots than that we
[2188.16 --> 2192.80]  actually like do cook and stuff and munch them and whatnot yeah so yeah let's even if i'm only gonna
[2192.80 --> 2198.96]  use three of these carrots i'm still better off on my grocery trip to superstore which i'm gonna do
[2198.96 --> 2206.24]  anyway i'm better off stocking up on stuff that i don't need only to end up wasting it later than i am
[2206.24 --> 2213.92]  buying the correct quantity from a place that sells lower quantity things off the shelf and carrots are not
[2213.92 --> 2217.76]  even the best example because you can actually buy individual carrots at superstore if i recall correctly
[2217.76 --> 2221.84]  same with celery uh celery stocks you can buy individual sticks yeah you can buy individual
[2221.84 --> 2229.04]  sticks funny story i didn't realize that a celery stock was all of them and a celery stick was one
[2229.04 --> 2234.96]  see i used to work in the produce section very recently um so blue apron lets you get out of your
[2234.96 --> 2240.32]  comfort zone it actually takes if you can make the meal in 40 minutes that is and my wife and i have
[2240.32 --> 2246.72]  done the numbers that is actually less time than it takes to drive somewhere sit down like be seated
[2246.72 --> 2251.68]  especially if it's like dinner time yeah and you gotta wait 15 20 minutes to get seated order your
[2251.68 --> 2257.92]  food and wait for your food it is actually more efficient to eat at home and more affordable with
[2257.92 --> 2262.16]  blue aprons so i've talked about this for a really long time i want to add one quick thing before we're
[2262.16 --> 2265.76]  done sure and i probably won't bring this up if we do sponsor spots for them in the future but i just
[2265.76 --> 2273.52]  want to bring this up here uh my girlfriend she has a uncle or like some form of family connection
[2273.52 --> 2279.84]  who's this really fantastic chef and he had basically this idea and made a kickstarter for it
[2280.48 --> 2287.52]  and checked out the kickstarter and i was like wow this is a wonderful idea but the kickstarter is
[2287.52 --> 2294.32]  bad yeah and the kickstarter failed and i was kind of sad and now i just hope that blue apron comes up here
[2294.32 --> 2302.16]  so i again i won't do this next time we do a spot for this but um yvonne and i have a business plan for this
[2302.16 --> 2309.68]  from like about a year ago that's that's actually pretty in line with the kickstarter i hadn't seen
[2309.68 --> 2318.40]  that um i was trying to convince her to uh to leave costco and even if she didn't want to pursue a
[2318.40 --> 2324.08]  career at linus media group i still really felt like her talents would be better suited to something
[2324.08 --> 2330.32]  bigger than running a pharmacy and we actually kicked this idea around and we came up with it together
[2330.32 --> 2336.24]  where we would leverage the strengths of linus media group to promote and to uh provide video
[2336.24 --> 2342.08]  guides to go along with the recipes i would oh man i would have loved to do that this was like it was
[2342.08 --> 2346.16]  a really cool idea oh that would have been fun because it was and it was i know the idea is not
[2346.16 --> 2351.84]  the newest thing ever like like food being delivered yeah um but we we sort of had this concept for how we
[2351.84 --> 2359.60]  could leverage partnerships just locally and start it locally and then create this this kind of this fun
[2359.60 --> 2365.76]  cooking with whoever it is um and these personas and these these video personalities to go along with
[2365.76 --> 2372.80]  it that we really thought could take it to the next level and would be way cooler um but so there you go
[2372.80 --> 2379.60]  if blue aprons watching this spot guys video video uh video instructions would be like super duper cool
[2379.60 --> 2386.40]  um and you guys could have like a side thing which is like like call it like fun food and do like not
[2386.40 --> 2392.08]  necessarily just like a meal do you like have like a fun food yeah super bowl edition and you know
[2392.08 --> 2398.16]  some really cool video content creators up in uh vancouver canada who would love to do more around food
[2398.72 --> 2405.20]  just kind of saying yeah speaking of things that i'm just kind of saying um i fix it i'm not going to
[2405.20 --> 2410.00]  deny that i fix it is sponsoring the video today like i did with that other video that i then found out
[2410.00 --> 2417.12]  later they were indeed the sponsor of um i fix it is your complete diy electronics repair solution from
[2417.12 --> 2422.96]  their 19 000 free step-by-step repair guides to their huge inventory of replacement parts they have got
[2422.96 --> 2428.80]  you covered and today we're talking about these notes are awful way to go colton and nick today we're
[2428.80 --> 2435.84]  talking about their latest and greatest the all new pro tech toolkit completely reimagined design but just as
[2435.84 --> 2442.64]  rugged and portable it's got more driver bits than ever before 64 compared to 54 okay it is actually
[2442.64 --> 2447.20]  better it comes in a better case it's got a magnetic thing that holds the screwdriver in place and the
[2447.20 --> 2451.60]  lid on the screwdriver kit it's got a better swivel top precision screwdriver it actually feels a lot
[2451.60 --> 2455.84]  nicer in the hand you can get more torque um torque was a problem with the last it comes with the
[2455.84 --> 2462.00]  suction cup uh which the old one didn't which i actually used on our trip to mexico to pry open an iphone
[2462.00 --> 2467.84]  6s it's not as good as their special tool for opening iphones but i was able to do it and i
[2467.84 --> 2472.00]  didn't break anything so you've got like everything you kind of need and the best part is that it's
[2472.00 --> 2479.52]  backed by a lifetime warranty and is available for 70 bucks and you can save five dollars off a purchase
[2479.52 --> 2485.28]  of ten dollars or more on their store by going to ifixit.com slash minus and using offer code when
[2485.28 --> 2501.76]  when you do it speaking of when you do it oh snap squarespace has squarespace done more when show
[2501.76 --> 2507.28]  sponsorships than any other brand they've probably done more when show sponsorships than like a fair
[2507.28 --> 2514.24]  number of other brands combined i think that is probably a fair thing for you to say uh oh uh oh nick's
[2514.24 --> 2519.76]  nick's giving nick sending me messages during the sponsor spots that's never good it's always bad
[2519.76 --> 2524.56]  no i'm i'm not gonna look at it sorry nick oh no i'm just kidding i i looked at i looked at i'll get
[2524.56 --> 2529.92]  to it nick um to squarespace simple powerful beautiful that's the slogan they had when we

[2610.80 --> 2618.08]  should those are old notes yes they are simple power beautiful powerful beautiful i mean how old is that
[2618.08 --> 2623.20]  slogan i'm gonna go on squarespace's website right now and see if they have like a new slogan i don't think
[2623.20 --> 2634.16]  so i think it's still you should still you should oh hold on no i don't see you should anywhere no
[2637.68 --> 2646.48]  perfect websites trusted by the world's best why aren't we on here because oh so we're not as cool as
[2646.48 --> 2652.24]  like fast company and freeman's yeah and what the heck is hashtag girl boss i don't know i'm sure
[2652.24 --> 2659.36]  someone knows but i don't over one million paying customers wow you can do that math hey whoa
[2661.44 --> 2669.20]  ballin so hard that's like the new world of warcraft squarespace of warcraft world of squarespace
[2669.20 --> 2675.68]  i mean can you imagine an mmo based on website building the boss is like this really complicated
[2675.68 --> 2683.52]  extensive website it's like flash yeah and inherently because this is classic world of squarespace you
[2683.52 --> 2687.84]  need a 40 person team and a huge part of the difficulty is just coordinating all of those
[2687.84 --> 2693.84]  developers to create this like intense flash based website you know what the worst thing about this
[2693.84 --> 2699.92]  conversation is is this sounds like exactly the kind of asinine idea that would get thrown around
[2699.92 --> 2707.44]  in like a boardroom full of like how do we gamify building websites well you know i heard a word of
[2707.44 --> 2717.12]  world of warcraft once you know maybe we need like like website craft squares in spacecraft
[2717.12 --> 2723.68]  it's like starcraft but like not just stars all of space
[2727.68 --> 2734.64]  all right android where 2.0 getting back on topic somewhat is a huge new update one about which i am
[2734.64 --> 2745.20]  extremely disappointed i recently oh yeah i recently completely my own fault and i have no one to blame
[2745.20 --> 2752.08]  but myself broke my zen watch 2 by diving to about 70 feet you should blame the zen watch to salt water
[2752.08 --> 2757.12]  then watch 2 should have a warning being like we're detecting water you should resurface yeah that's
[2757.12 --> 2766.32]  why i'm so salty not because of the water yeah salinity yeah um to be fair i'm kidding that was a joke
[2766.32 --> 2770.32]  so it includes a new smart reply feature allowing you to respond to incoming notifications quickly by
[2770.32 --> 2773.68]  scribbling on the touch screen this just means you're gonna get a new watch
[2773.68 --> 2778.88]  uh uh i think it should be a software update i guess i'll find out because i still there's
[2778.88 --> 2784.88]  still a g watch over there i might just steal that um but you know what i want is more granularity in
[2784.88 --> 2789.68]  the control of what i do with notifications and ways to synchronize across devices that is really my only
[2789.68 --> 2794.88]  complaint about android wear it kind of already does everything i could possibly want it to do other than
[2794.88 --> 2801.20]  the fact that it really makes me mad when i reply to something with voice and then that email is still
[2801.20 --> 2806.40]  sitting unread in my inbox because it's just why let me know what you think about this i'm going to
[2806.40 --> 2810.88]  deviate a little bit i was just thinking in my head about how like you do the traditional watch thing
[2810.88 --> 2816.96]  and i'm thinking about doing the fitness watch thing um i'm gonna still do the video that we had planned
[2816.96 --> 2824.08]  first yeah yeah um should i say yeah yeah yeah okay so i'm gonna benchmark um a bunch of traditional
[2824.08 --> 2832.16]  fitness trackers against like a fitbit not like a zen watch but like a fitbit yeah against a chest strap
[2832.16 --> 2838.32]  which is traditionally a lot better um at accurately determining your heart rate and then comparing
[2838.32 --> 2843.28]  how well the wrist version does and then what i'm thinking is take the top one maybe two and do a
[2843.28 --> 2848.08]  proper review on them that's a good idea so be like okay these ones are really accurate these ones
[2848.08 --> 2851.44]  are probably the ones you should be going for if you want a fitness tracker now i'm going to properly
[2851.44 --> 2857.36]  review are they actually any good just as a usable device there's huge amounts of issues on that side
[2857.36 --> 2865.20]  of things holy crap um and like i'm very frustrated right now with the fact that the like more like
[2865.20 --> 2871.44]  i'm going to say traditional but that is so literally the wrong word um the like smart watch side of
[2871.44 --> 2877.60]  things are kind of really bad generally i'd like to see the people who call you burger boy fight you
[2877.60 --> 2884.64]  burger boy someone called you luke burger boy i would love to fight them too um the yeah the like
[2884.64 --> 2888.96]  smart watch kind of stuff is usually really bad at doing fitness stuff the apple watch is pretty good
[2888.96 --> 2894.16]  but then it has other issues and then the fitness watches suck at being smart watches and we just need
[2894.16 --> 2900.72]  them to yeah do the thing together um yeah no i think that's a great idea i think that makes a ton of
[2900.72 --> 2906.64]  sense um so let's see what else it's got it's that there's updates to the fitness software allowing you
[2906.64 --> 2910.24]  to leave your phone at home and track your activity automatically using a third-party app on android
[2910.24 --> 2915.20]  where it's set to launch this fall uh devs can create watch faces that show information from any android
[2915.20 --> 2919.36]  where app so that's cool i guess those are both good things um let's move into some of our more rapid
[2919.36 --> 2924.88]  fire news for this week uh original article here is from pcgamer.com or geforce.com if you want to get
[2924.88 --> 2932.80]  it directly from the horse's mouth uh nvidia posts an overwatch advertisement uh gtx 1070 specifications
[2932.80 --> 2938.08]  which is super exciting because it's actually quite a bit cheaper and it's probably the more relevant one
[2938.80 --> 2945.92]  because that is that is that is well the the 599 price point versus the 379 price point is like
[2946.56 --> 2952.40]  whoa a lot more people are gonna be yeah so this is going to in terms of performance effectively
[2952.40 --> 2956.48]  displace the do you want to come say say bye to the wancho people no
[2962.72 --> 2968.48]  goodbye wancho people this is this is ash you may recognize him from such youtube videos as
[2968.48 --> 2975.36]  videos that he's made um i'm i'm sure the twitch chat's gonna freak out and you're already gonna be
[2975.36 --> 2981.04]  gone anyway it was really nice hanging out today and lunch and all that stuff is that a high 10 yeah
[2981.04 --> 2991.20]  okay yes bye see you later and we'll talk soon um so yeah so at 375 79 dollars for not a founder's
[2991.20 --> 3000.88]  edition yeah wow it's gonna have the performance of a gtx 980 ti it looks like oh because a 980 ti is
[3000.88 --> 3007.04]  that's a thing i mean that is a good vr experience and you will have the new stuff which almost matters
[3007.04 --> 3012.40]  more uh depending on what you're doing than the like raw performance because you'll have smp so
[3012.40 --> 3017.20]  i'm saying he's multi-production and zil if you're into that kind of stuff but mainly smp smp makes
[3017.20 --> 3025.04]  stuff like vr and multi-monitor support like crazy amounts better um so yeah looking pretty cool okay
[3025.04 --> 3030.56]  so you're really still oh we never actually talked about what the specs are we did a bad job okay so the
[3030.56 --> 3037.60]  the it's still a gp104 so that's not big pascal that's like smaller same same guy as the 1080 just
[3037.60 --> 3046.00]  uh lower binned one yeah so the core clock is 1506 the boost clock is 1683 very close to 1080 yes do
[3046.00 --> 3053.12]  remember that uh clock for clock on graphics cards isn't really a thing um although 1080 versus 1070 it
[3053.12 --> 3057.04]  will be more of a thing but like compared to other generations don't necessarily do that calculation
[3057.04 --> 3066.48]  uh your vram clock speed is 8 000 that is gddr5 not gddr5x if eight gigs of ram your bus width is 256
[3066.48 --> 3071.52]  bit um there's some question mark specs on here so i guess they haven't fully released everything
[3071.52 --> 3076.32]  i'm pulling up the one the official one from nvidia here oh sweet okay um yeah it looks like they are
[3076.32 --> 3085.04]  not being 100 clear about everything released a lot of yeah 150 watt tdp um two slot cooler blah blah blah
[3085.04 --> 3091.68]  blah blah the 1080 is being released on the 27th so i believe it's being released for sale on the 27th
[3091.68 --> 3099.68]  and then the uh launch date of the 1070 is june 10th so is that rumored or is that confirmed that's
[3099.68 --> 3105.52]  shown without a question mark on here okay so i'm assuming that that's yeah that's from the pc
[3105.52 --> 3111.04]  gamer article um i actually haven't gotten a confirmation from nvidia exactly when 1070 is dropping so
[3111.04 --> 3116.40]  okay uh so don't don't quote don't quote us on that don't get us in trouble because uh we talked
[3116.40 --> 3123.68]  about um three-way sli not being a thing on the 1080 on the wan show and i got this frantic email from
[3123.68 --> 3129.84]  nvidia oh guys they're like actually guys luke was like super sick during that part of the presentation
[3130.48 --> 3136.80]  um that's not a thing to be fair the way that they're doing is really dumb yes and it's like kind
[3136.80 --> 3141.92]  of sketchy and it's probably gonna suck a lot like way worse than it normally does and we'll probably
[3141.92 --> 3146.96]  have a video on that yeah and we super don't agree with how they're doing it yeah i haven't talked to
[3146.96 --> 3150.48]  you about it but i don't agree and i assumed you don't i don't agree either what is your reason though
[3150.48 --> 3155.20]  might as well talk about it i think software unlocks for a product that you bought to enable functionality
[3155.20 --> 3160.16]  that you gave me with the last generation product is a dick move yep um i understand the reason why they're
[3160.16 --> 3166.32]  doing it because these are people with more money than cents anyway um well i think part of it's
[3166.32 --> 3171.60]  because the way like it is i think uh yeah i'm still a little misinformed i'm waiting until we get
[3171.60 --> 3177.68]  the actual bridges so i'm probably gonna get another mad email from bdr sorry um but i think if it's being
[3177.68 --> 3183.36]  enabled it's through the back end through dx12 and not at all through their stuff so i think they don't
[3183.36 --> 3190.16]  want it to happen but i think because of dx12 they don't have a huge amount of choice because
[3190.16 --> 3196.64]  they'll either look like the super bad guy for locking it down no matter what or they'll look like
[3197.76 --> 3203.04]  kind of not very good if they have it enabled for everybody and then it just sucks i think it's just
[3203.04 --> 3207.28]  gonna suck the same amount as it always has really i think it's gonna suck more you think it's gonna
[3207.28 --> 3214.96]  suck more okay well then stay tuned let's find out just how much yeah um but yeah i i do kind of
[3214.96 --> 3220.56]  agree with the like if you're gonna sli you should probably stop it too yeah kind of mentality anyways
[3220.56 --> 3227.04]  so if you're gonna sli you should definitely stop it too three and four is for people with more money
[3227.04 --> 3233.68]  than cents it is legitimately not better take it from me how many video cards do you think i could
[3233.68 --> 3238.96]  take home at the end of the day if i felt like it that'd be annoying because then they wouldn't be in
[3238.96 --> 3245.52]  inventory right but i but i get you how many could i yeah a lot i mean i could just i could just so
[3245.52 --> 3252.00]  many titans i could just okay i could like call up anyone literally any video card maker i could say hey
[3252.00 --> 3258.40]  i need four video cards i'm doing a personal rig update video and they would be in the mail literally
[3258.40 --> 3268.00]  any video card maker i do not run those because it's a bad idea yeah it's it's a bad experience
[3268.00 --> 3275.12]  themselves in an extremely difficult demo that they were like pushing really hard to run ran two-way sli
[3275.12 --> 3285.44]  with a physics card not three-way not four-way so like so please don't speaking of please don't
[3286.00 --> 3291.76]  don't spend all your money you love this topic i absolutely love this topic it is so cool okay so
[3292.56 --> 3297.52]  there's an english bank um what is it called intelligent environments or something i don't
[3297.52 --> 3304.64]  even really care but it gives you like a wristband and if the funds in your account go below an agreed
[3304.64 --> 3310.40]  limit the band kicks in and will hit you with 200 with a 255 volt shock
[3310.40 --> 3318.56]  i hope it does it every single time that the value continues to go further down so it's like man i
[3318.56 --> 3323.52]  really want to buy a sandwich because i'm pretty hungry but i'm gonna get electric shocked and i
[3323.52 --> 3329.04]  really hope that like people don't just take it off because that is so fabulously hilarious there's
[3329.04 --> 3336.32]  another thing uh oh no oh no no it's a british firm giving bank customers an electric shop so no bank
[3336.32 --> 3343.92]  has actually announced support yet so it could be across multiple banks which is really cool and
[3343.92 --> 3349.60]  they're looking to add more functionality like the ability to turn down your nest heating to save on your
[3349.60 --> 3359.12]  energy bill if the funds are low honestly i think with the way that okay i forget i wanted to add more
[3359.12 --> 3365.20]  and be like if you leave the house and the the central heating is still on it'll just like shock you
[3365.20 --> 3372.00]  like every 10 minutes until you remotely turn it down like i want this thing to just be like hey you're
[3372.00 --> 3378.24]  screwing up hey fix it this is why you shouldn't design the product but i was having one for myself
[3380.64 --> 3385.20]  just mod it yeah i'm sure there will be mods yeah i'm sure you'll be able i'm sure any company that
[3385.20 --> 3390.16]  designs something to electroshock people i'm sure you could convince them to make a more hardcore
[3390.16 --> 3395.52]  version i'm sure they'd be down yeah yeah um but i was talking to to brendan about this where he's like
[3395.52 --> 3402.72]  yeah like it seems like our generation doesn't save money like can't save money yeah and i you know
[3402.72 --> 3409.20]  part of the conversation with him was like look at the way that you know everything from the smell
[3409.20 --> 3415.84]  in a retail store is designed like the amount of research and like psychology that goes into making
[3415.84 --> 3424.16]  people buy stuff i mean i'm not saying that you know oh poor you you bought that 200 pair of jeans and
[3424.16 --> 3429.28]  now you can't afford your rent you're such a victim i'm not saying that that's not that's not
[3429.28 --> 3435.20]  what's happening here but i am saying that you are up against forces that are bigger than you probably
[3435.20 --> 3441.20]  realize when it comes to really big people trying to get your money from there's even like uh road
[3441.20 --> 3446.56]  signs that you can drive past that emit the smell of like steak before you come up to a steak shop like
[3446.56 --> 3452.00]  there's oh there's some stuff out there lots of stuff going on so it's refreshing to see
[3452.00 --> 3458.16]  intelligent environments giving a crap um and my okay my reason for this a bunch of people in
[3458.16 --> 3462.32]  the chat it's the pavlock wristband by the way is what the product's called which is kind of funny
[3462.32 --> 3466.72]  um but they're calling me masso or whatever which is like that's fine i get where you're coming from
[3466.72 --> 3472.24]  but my actual reasoning for this is uh myself and a lot of other people i will self-admit this
[3472.24 --> 3475.92]  find it easy to put things off because i'll just be like oh i have something more important to do right
[3475.92 --> 3480.88]  now the importance of things increases when you are literally being electroshocked
[3483.92 --> 3488.88]  and if like i left the heat on and i'm like well crap i'm doing whatever right now i'm driving right
[3488.88 --> 3493.84]  now i don't want to do this if it's like and i'm like okay i should probably pull over
[3493.84 --> 3498.80]  deal with this and then keep driving because honestly that's fine it's not going to take me
[3498.80 --> 3502.16]  that much time to pull over to the side of the road deal with it and keep driving it's not a big
[3502.16 --> 3509.44]  that's a crazy background um but like it just i don't know i want it i think it would be good
[3511.20 --> 3516.64]  um uber joins the race for driverless cars the original article here is from the verge
[3517.28 --> 3526.80]  meet uber's first self-driving car it's a ford fusion hybrid how exciting um so i mean this shouldn't
[3526.80 --> 3531.20]  come as any surprise i think two weeks ago we were talking about lyft working with whoever the crap it
[3531.20 --> 3538.72]  was to deploy a fleet of them like immediately um i mean the amount of money that someone like uber
[3538.72 --> 3543.20]  could save remember how much you can charge for a service doesn't necessarily have anything to do
[3543.20 --> 3547.60]  with the cost of providing the service it has to do with how much it costs someone else to provide the
[3547.60 --> 3551.68]  service so if you are the first one to have a fleet of driverless cars you can effectively
[3552.80 --> 3557.60]  just make mad bank because you don't have to pay the person that someone else has to pay in order to
[3557.60 --> 3563.76]  compete with you um there's not really a whole lot to say other than that the things i'm going to
[3563.76 --> 3569.52]  find interesting are like uh refueling them recharging them those sort of things are they
[3569.52 --> 3574.00]  going to have to pair up with gas stations to make it so the driverless car can drive up and there'll be
[3574.00 --> 3578.16]  an attendant that will fill it and if you were a gas station would you want that uber contract
[3578.16 --> 3585.20]  definitely i sure would holy crap yeah yeah um or are they all electric do they do they know like like
[3585.20 --> 3590.64]  Roombas to go like pull back into a parking spot so they can keep charging and then keep going or
[3590.64 --> 3596.72]  like how was it tesla talking about like wireless charging pads yeah yeah but like but are they
[3596.72 --> 3601.84]  going to have to program intelligence for them to like go home for a while and charge sounds fairly
[3601.84 --> 3606.88]  simple it wouldn't be that bad but like that'd be really interesting to drive by like the little
[3606.88 --> 3611.76]  the little nest of cars that provide all the uber transactions for the city is this going to become
[3611.76 --> 3618.32]  cheaper for a lot of people if there's electric driverless cars that you just call on your phone
[3618.32 --> 3624.00]  and are there extremely fast than owning a vehicle for sprawling cities like vancouver like they're
[3624.00 --> 3629.84]  like we're just it's just this like suburban sprawl because there's already go cars i can see this
[3629.84 --> 3635.28]  legitimately eliminating the need for people to own at least own two cars like maybe they only need one
[3635.28 --> 3640.40]  now and they really like legitimately needed two because they commute this way and that way yeah he's
[3640.40 --> 3644.80]  talking about like families yeah yeah not individuals needing to own two cars this is
[3644.80 --> 3649.12]  the biggest first world problem ever yeah it's like oh which one should i drive today i mean this
[3649.12 --> 3653.60]  one like looks cooler but this one's more utilitarian i'm not sure yeah i know he's talking about like
[3653.60 --> 3658.16]  families that have to go different directions um speaking of going different directions i'm going
[3658.16 --> 3663.12]  a different direction i'm going backwards in terms of topics what if your bank account went below
[3663.12 --> 3669.60]  your limit while you were like in the checkout on like a porn site and your hand was like occupied
[3671.04 --> 3675.92]  this is uh e pete's asking about what if you get a shock while you're kind of you know busy well then
[3675.92 --> 3679.76]  it's worse well then it's worse i guess you just gotta deal with it so you probably shouldn't be
[3679.76 --> 3684.72]  spending your last dollar yeah you should then be more aware right of what your current bank account
[3684.72 --> 3688.80]  is like watching like a live cam or something like that and you're just kind of throwing money at
[3688.80 --> 3694.88]  it then you should be more than you should probably be shocked that's your fault okay yes entirely if
[3694.88 --> 3699.92]  you want to throw money at it you need to set yourself a limit yeah and play within the limit
[3699.92 --> 3706.16]  that's how gambling works that's like financial tips yeah yeah just the tips exactly um unless they
[3706.16 --> 3716.40]  want more let's see oh this is horrible um a california dad accidentally uh live stream child's birth
[3716.40 --> 3722.88]  from the delivery room um the mom says i was okay i was just focused on pushing it's a beautiful thing
[3722.88 --> 3728.96]  nothing to be ashamed of good response i've had two kids um i don't agree with i don't agree with that
[3728.96 --> 3735.84]  either but how do you accidentally live stream i agree that it was the right right response um
[3737.28 --> 3742.32]  you know given this given the circumstances how do you again how do you accidentally live the video
[3742.32 --> 3749.68]  was shown through facebook live has now been viewed over 300 000 times um and to be clear guys we're
[3749.68 --> 3754.24]  talking about this news topic we are not recommending that you go you know i would recommend that you
[3754.24 --> 3759.36]  don't i would recommend that you not because you know it's one of those things where for the 12 year
[3759.36 --> 3765.04]  olds in the audience it might sound pretty cool it's not nope it's not like it's kind of gross even
[3765.04 --> 3771.76]  yeah it's not um i don't want a kid let's see let's see what else we uh let's see what else we
[3771.76 --> 3776.48]  got oh yeah this sucks uh so i knew about this already this happened a while ago actually but uh
[3776.48 --> 3781.84]  oculus drm kills the hack that ports games to competing headsets um they had already figured
[3781.84 --> 3786.88]  this out when i was trying to play lucky's tale on the vive which i believe i should have every right
[3786.88 --> 3793.20]  to do i have already paid for an oculus rift they just haven't shipped it to me so why can't i play
[3793.20 --> 3799.04]  lucky's tale on my vive anyway anyway they just had it exclusive to the store not exclusive to the
[3799.04 --> 3805.52]  headset uh i yeah no i i understand their perspective but i also fully understand my
[3805.52 --> 3811.36]  perspective i shouldn't have to play on the headset i don't want to play on if i legitimately own the
[3811.36 --> 3818.24]  game even if it's a game you can only get by buying a rift if you owned both the uh setup use
[3818.24 --> 3824.64]  case of lucky's tale would play better on a rift i just want to play it i know and if you don't own
[3824.64 --> 3827.76]  both then that's better the reason why i say that is just because the rift is more comfortable and
[3827.76 --> 3832.88]  lighter and it's just a seated experience anyways so it's better for that so they had it they had
[3832.88 --> 3838.32]  tweaked it so that when i tried to do the hack uh your controller wouldn't work so maybe now it's even
[3838.32 --> 3843.92]  more uh has been passionate i have a really good feeling that someone's gonna beat that because if
[3843.92 --> 3848.32]  they're just making it so that your controller doesn't work i gotta imagine someone's just gonna
[3848.32 --> 3853.60]  make a thing that tricks it into thinking that it's a different controller you know i gotta imagine
[3853.60 --> 3859.20]  that in the world of like dorky dorks who code dorky things for other dorks and don't have money
[3859.20 --> 3868.16]  that's always the best combination yeah vr is gonna be like a thing for uh for for hacks um speaking of
[3868.16 --> 3873.60]  being a thing nokia wasn't a thing for phones for a bit there they're returning to mobile with android
[3873.60 --> 3879.92]  phones and tablets i was just thinking you know what we don't have enough makers of android phones
[3879.92 --> 3885.04]  and tablets yeah when i read this i was like wow i don't care so yeah i guess we're in the same boat
[3885.04 --> 3890.72]  so microsoft is offloading nokia's old phone business to foxconn's subsidiary and a company called hmd
[3890.72 --> 3896.64]  global oif for 350 million it's probably more than it's worth um nokia has revealed that hmd is also
[3896.64 --> 3900.56]  acquiring rights to use the nokia name on smartphones and tablets for the next 10 years
[3900.56 --> 3908.72]  head mounted display no no no no not head mounted anyway um so there you go nokia's involvement in
[3908.72 --> 3916.08]  the new devices will be very limited so basically it'll be chinese smartphones and tablets with nokia
[3916.72 --> 3922.88]  name on them sure stuff um so there was one more topic that i wanted to hit before we close out the
[3922.88 --> 3932.80]  show today and i oh crap i forget where it went where did it go where did it go oh no oh yeah no
[3932.80 --> 3941.68]  i guess that was it i just wanted to um yeah i just wanted to show nerd sports so it's really funny um
[3942.64 --> 3948.64]  there was an issue with our network connection last time i tried to show you guys a teaser from a nerd
[3948.64 --> 3954.32]  sports episode that made it look like vessel didn't work because the timing was perfect um so
[3954.32 --> 3961.44]  that's not actually what happened so this is my follow-up to that where i wanted to show you guys
[3961.44 --> 3967.28]  some clips from the hockey episode of nerd sports so all five episodes are out now and vessels available
[3967.28 --> 3972.40]  at the link under the wan show uh for with a free one-week trial so you can actually check them all out
[3972.40 --> 3978.00]  and then decide if the early access is worth it for you or not um if you're like nerd sports is behind
[3978.00 --> 3987.60]  a paywall i mean just if you can watch five episodes in a week yeah these guys were they were mostly nice
[3987.60 --> 3993.84]  except when they celebrated after knocking over dennis yeah this is that was that you trying to help him
[3993.84 --> 4001.12]  up yeah yeah i couldn't skate either a bunch of people have sent me things being like i thought
[4001.12 --> 4007.76]  you'd be better at hockey i'm actually pretty good at ball hockey i went like uh you're better than colton
[4007.76 --> 4013.44]  i went like look at him skate look at him skate oh no colton
[4016.88 --> 4020.32]  so this is them skating around in hula hoops so for those of you who don't really
[4020.32 --> 4025.36]  get the whole nerd sports concept we almost got that one that was you passing to me oh
[4025.36 --> 4029.76]  that was actually pretty good that's not bad i screwed up the shot i remember i apologize to
[4029.76 --> 4036.24]  you about this like so many times you oh no no oh we both almost got it there was a few times that
[4036.24 --> 4042.80]  we did that uh but i screwed up oh oh wow so at that point in the video they're actually playing
[4042.80 --> 4047.92]  with little plastic hockey sticks skating with hula hoops and i think they're holding pineapples
[4047.92 --> 4054.08]  tables or something like that so the idea behind nerd sports is that is not just that nerds go up
[4054.08 --> 4060.40]  against real athletes but that we actually try to level the playing field yeah um as creatively as as
[4060.40 --> 4067.44]  we can and uh sometimes we have to go pretty hardcore in order to get them to uh to be competitive
[4067.44 --> 4072.48]  with us that sequence like if if you ignore the fact that those guys didn't have sticks and
[4072.48 --> 4076.08]  couldn't skate because they had hula hoops around each of their skates looked pretty good like
[4076.08 --> 4082.16]  that looked like a legit like cool scoring chance yeah i like yeah to reiterate my hockey thing i
[4082.16 --> 4087.20]  played a lot of ball hockey played on like a national level it was great could never afford to play ice
[4087.20 --> 4094.96]  hockey ice hockey is like easily one of the most expensive of that type of sports um like the gear
[4094.96 --> 4101.44]  is extremely expensive like american football you get your gear from your club and then you give it
[4101.44 --> 4106.80]  back at the end of the year ice hockey is not that way you buy all of your own gear and it's extremely
[4106.80 --> 4114.32]  expensive could not afford it as a kid never was into ice hockey not very good i knew like where i
[4114.32 --> 4119.92]  should be and what i should be doing and was just not really able to do it because of the skates which
[4119.92 --> 4131.28]  was so frustrating so my the extent of my hockey experience is watching it on tv yeah and i uh i had
[4131.28 --> 4138.24]  played ice hockey at like a company event about i was still in university so this must have been about
[4138.24 --> 4147.28]  10 years ago um for about 20 30 minutes and i had never i had i had done a lot of like i'm pretty good
[4147.28 --> 4154.24]  on rollerblades um inline skates excuse me i used to be yeah like i i am pretty fast i am pretty stable
[4154.24 --> 4160.00]  i'm i'm pretty good on rollerblades and i had done a lot of like skating around on the concrete slab at home
[4160.00 --> 4167.28]  with the orange ball and the hockey stick and the way that that slab was set up um there were no walls
[4167.28 --> 4174.88]  anywhere so if i missed the net i had to go hike um so i i'm like an okay shot with a ball so like i i
[4174.88 --> 4179.84]  know the wrist action yeah it's different um but the extent of my ice hockey experience was like that
[4179.84 --> 4185.04]  20 30 minutes at like that company thing and the extent of my ice skating experience is probably less
[4185.04 --> 4189.52]  than 10 hours on ice including all my elementary school trips to the rink yeah i wouldn't be surprised
[4189.52 --> 4196.72]  if i was similar so we did our best but uh it was not good um and then the last thing the thing
[4196.72 --> 4202.08]  that nick was bugging me about is that he wants me to do a call out for the foil shirts like the ones
[4202.08 --> 4205.36]  that i am wearing right now those are limited edition shirts i'm going to go ahead and post
[4205.36 --> 4211.52]  those in the twitch chat here boom there's a silver one and uh here's the gold one the gold one actually
[4211.52 --> 4215.60]  the consensus around the office seems to be that the gold one looks better so maybe check out that
[4215.60 --> 4220.72]  gold one that's the second link i just put up if you want uh a limited edition foil shirt not this
[4220.72 --> 4225.04]  at all but the idea of what i'm doing that ties into this can i call that out yeah sure yeah yeah
[4225.04 --> 4231.28]  yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm doing a charity stream starting after party but not but it oh it's not
[4231.28 --> 4235.60]  starting tonight so i'm going to be doing an after party tonight for sure okay um which is going to be
[4235.60 --> 4240.00]  setting the whole after party thing is going to be working on like dos box and like setting up a
[4240.00 --> 4246.32]  whole bunch of stuff because i'm doing a charity stream starting tomorrow saturday at noon pst which is
[4246.32 --> 4252.72]  going to be i think like 27 plus hours long which is ridiculous i'm starting in 1990 and playing you
[4252.72 --> 4257.20]  better be conscious when you come in on monday yeah it's the reason why i'm starting at noon is so that
[4257.20 --> 4262.88]  i have enough time to sleep for like 12 hours or something before i have to come to work um yeah no
[4262.88 --> 4268.80]  it's it's okay it's it's planned out um so i'm gonna be doing a different game every hour starting with
[4268.80 --> 4274.48]  a game from 1990 and iterating the year every time so the first hour will be super mario worlds from 1990
[4274.48 --> 4279.76]  the second hour will be civilization one from 1991 and then i think it goes like wolfenstein 3d
[4280.48 --> 4284.80]  doom and like progresses all the way through and there's a bunch of different games throughout the
[4284.80 --> 4289.20]  way it's not like what was the best game from that year it's what was the most like influential
[4289.20 --> 4294.64]  game on me so there's a bunch of elder scrolls there's halo one and two there's like some some
[4294.64 --> 4298.96]  series stuff like that but yeah it'll be a lot of fun and it's gonna be a giant charity stream for
[4298.96 --> 4305.84]  extra life so come on by should be fun all right i uh posted a link to luke's channel in the uh in
[4305.84 --> 4310.24]  the chat there so guys uh check that out if you're into that sort of thing i've got people asking you
[4310.24 --> 4314.08]  to play total annihilation i still need to teach you supreme commander so we can play sometime it's such
[4314.08 --> 4320.32]  a good game i think there's still like uh like an underground like group that maintains uh rankings
[4320.32 --> 4324.80]  and servers and stuff like that that's awesome you know a game was really good when that happens
[4324.80 --> 4330.08]  mm-hmm it was just too cult that's too niche yeah all right so good night guys thank you for tuning
[4330.08 --> 4338.80]  into the wanchul we'll see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye
