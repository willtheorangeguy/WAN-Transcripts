[0.00 --> 10.34]  All right, we are live and like exactly on time if I do read that correctly, which means
[10.34 --> 15.78]  that I'm actually assuming possibly almost no one's here because we're usually like half
[15.78 --> 18.02]  an hour late and that's probably what people are used to.
[18.28 --> 20.00]  But Dennis is with me on the show.
[20.14 --> 21.14]  That's why it's on time.
[21.32 --> 22.00]  Ah, yes.
[22.50 --> 24.62]  Dennis is the one that made it be on time.
[24.68 --> 26.48]  That's actually kind of true, isn't it?
[26.48 --> 26.74]  Yeah.
[26.74 --> 31.14]  Because it's been not on time for like, do you know how long it's been since we were
[31.14 --> 31.46]  on time?
[31.64 --> 35.16]  Okay, so I've been working for Linus Mini Group since August of 2015.
[35.74 --> 36.74]  August of 2015.
[37.08 --> 37.92]  August of 2015.
[38.66 --> 41.20]  And I remember the week I got hired is the week we did the meetup.
[41.42 --> 42.96]  It has never been on time.
[43.08 --> 43.50]  Since then.
[43.52 --> 44.34]  As long as I've been here.
[44.38 --> 45.60]  So this is the first time.
[45.62 --> 45.94]  Good job.
[46.14 --> 47.04]  And Dennis is here.
[47.36 --> 49.24]  Actually, we are like a minute late.
[49.48 --> 51.80]  No, it was exactly, it's a minute late now.
[52.62 --> 54.66]  Oh, my time, okay, my love restaurant.
[55.02 --> 55.36]  Okay.
[55.36 --> 55.68]  Okay.
[55.68 --> 57.20]  So we are on time.
[57.28 --> 60.00]  By both of these computers, we're fine.
[60.32 --> 60.70]  We're fine.
[61.00 --> 61.18]  Okay.
[61.32 --> 61.78]  Cool.
[62.00 --> 66.62]  So do you want to give people like a short thing on like what happened and how you're
[66.62 --> 67.32]  back and stuff?
[68.28 --> 69.48]  So it's been so long.
[70.34 --> 71.54]  Like even on last time.
[71.58 --> 71.82]  Four months or something?
[72.14 --> 72.56]  Yeah.
[72.76 --> 73.50]  I don't remember exactly.
[73.76 --> 74.40]  Four months.
[74.56 --> 74.80]  Okay.
[74.92 --> 78.42]  When I left, I had a really good vacation.
[78.92 --> 79.84]  Good rest.
[80.08 --> 80.26]  Yeah.
[80.26 --> 87.14]  And now I'm back and we finally sort everything out and I'm working on my permanent residency.
[87.68 --> 87.84]  Yeah.
[87.84 --> 92.34]  So hopefully I don't have to worry about all the visa stuff anymore.
[92.34 --> 96.60]  And it might take another six months to process.
[96.98 --> 97.66]  Six months?
[97.66 --> 97.98]  Yeah.
[97.98 --> 98.66]  Oh, wow.
[98.66 --> 100.30]  So it's always so slow in Canada.
[100.44 --> 101.50]  Everything is so slow.
[101.62 --> 102.76]  But like you're good, right?
[102.88 --> 103.34]  Yeah, I'm good.
[103.48 --> 103.74]  Okay.
[103.92 --> 104.14]  Okay.
[104.26 --> 107.18]  That'll just take six months to be like super efficiently.
[107.18 --> 111.66]  If next time I just disappear, that just, I'm actually like gone.
[111.90 --> 112.20]  Gone.
[112.34 --> 112.60]  Okay.
[112.62 --> 113.28]  Going back to Taiwan.
[113.50 --> 113.76]  Okay.
[114.06 --> 115.34]  Hopefully that doesn't happen.
[115.36 --> 116.14]  That's not going to happen.
[116.26 --> 116.40]  Hopefully.
[116.40 --> 116.74]  Yes.
[116.82 --> 117.02]  Yes.
[117.14 --> 120.98]  But for now, we do have some pretty interesting topics for you today.
[121.10 --> 125.72]  Google has an AI that has created its own form of encryption.
[125.96 --> 127.56]  And we'll dive more into that a little bit later.
[127.62 --> 128.60]  Not too deep though.
[128.66 --> 129.52]  Just a little bit.
[129.76 --> 131.82]  And VR Mark is now available.
[132.48 --> 132.96]  Finally.
[133.24 --> 134.42]  You can benchmark VR.
[134.42 --> 137.16]  I haven't tried it myself, but theoretically you can benchmark VR.
[137.28 --> 137.72]  What else do we got?
[138.18 --> 138.50]  Okay.
[138.70 --> 143.32]  So Samsung is not only calling back their new phone.
[143.52 --> 147.42]  Also, they're recalling almost 2.8 washers due to impacts injuries.
[147.42 --> 148.26]  2.8 million washers.
[148.26 --> 149.46]  2.8 million.
[149.84 --> 150.06]  Yeah.
[150.34 --> 150.52]  Yeah.
[151.00 --> 156.38]  So another thing is Adobe publishing panel in Premiere Pro, they have a new feature.
[156.54 --> 160.20]  You can publish videos directly on social media.
[160.84 --> 161.12]  Oh.
[161.60 --> 162.14]  Kind of cool.
[162.42 --> 163.16]  That is kind of cool.
[163.16 --> 163.76]  For us.
[163.76 --> 163.98]  All right.
[164.22 --> 164.32]  Yeah.
[164.32 --> 165.90]  So let's roll the intro.
[166.08 --> 166.76]  Hopefully this works.
[167.52 --> 168.00]  Hey.
[169.72 --> 170.82]  Hell yeah.
[171.18 --> 171.86]  Okay.
[172.32 --> 172.70]  File.
[173.34 --> 173.98]  Do you what?
[175.00 --> 175.18]  What's that?
[175.18 --> 176.48]  Flashlight.
[176.48 --> 178.32]  I said I'm trying.
[178.38 --> 181.64]  Trying to see the comment and do everything.
[181.76 --> 182.28]  Yeah.
[187.28 --> 187.88]  Ghost monsters.
[187.88 --> 188.12]  Ghost officers.
[188.12 --> 188.68]  Ghosts Rodas shaves.
[188.94 --> 190.66]  I have not shaved in a while.
[191.18 --> 192.18]  I've been squiking a lot.
[192.44 --> 192.94]  Be this 모�re.
[193.18 --> 193.78]  Squarespace.
[193.78 --> 199.02]  and also fresh books. I'm gonna put this back up there really quick.
[199.02 --> 203.72]  Okay so here we are. I love yeah every time I have to do something
[203.72 --> 208.24]  for Dollar Shave Club it's always like oh yeah I've been working on this crazy
[208.24 --> 212.54]  new platform thing all week and I haven't shaved so I look terrible.
[212.54 --> 216.64]  One of these times I'll just like shave on the show. It's a terrible idea I should
[216.64 --> 221.32]  literally never do that. Okay first topic that we have other than the fact that
[221.32 --> 226.54]  Dennis is just here at all is Google's AI thing. Yeah. So let me see if my screen
[226.54 --> 233.20]  share will work I believe it will. Wow that is in the worst. Oh my laptop is so
[233.20 --> 240.88]  big I have to. Your laptop is ginormous. Okay I need to. You're sitting above it but then now both of our heads are being chopped off.
[240.88 --> 248.68]  Okay. Pella I thought you framed the camera. Oh we're good good good it's fine. My head's still getting chopped off.
[248.68 --> 254.62]  It's all good though. Anyways Google's brain thing I believe it's called brain right?
[254.62 --> 266.90]  Google brain yeah there we go had a group of AIs trying to communicate with each other so there was two of them specifically I think it has it.
[266.90 --> 275.90]  Alice and Bob were trying to communicate and Eve three different AIs Eve was trying to eavesdrop on the communication.
[275.90 --> 283.28]  And what Alice what Alice had to do was figure out a way to talk to Bob without Eve being able to figure out what she was saying.
[283.28 --> 300.90]  And Alice was actually able to do this. The messages were sent in zeros and ones and by the end of I believe it was 15,000 attempts they were able to make it that Eve only had about a 50% accuracy on what she was guessing.
[300.90 --> 308.28]  Meaning that she's just essentially flipping coins. It wasn't actually accurate because she's guessing a zero or a one so she's at 50% she's failing.
[308.28 --> 316.28]  So I don't know. So they have their own they can create their own secret between the robots. Two different computers. Two AI.
[316.28 --> 327.90]  Yeah. What do you think about this? I think that's kind of scary. I feel. Why? Why is it scary? I feel though all the AI thing they show on the movies actually happening.
[327.90 --> 331.44]  I feel they are actually happening. Shouldn't they allowed shouldn't they be allowed to have their own privacy?
[331.86 --> 335.12]  They're artificial intelligence. No no no no no no. Yeah. Okay.
[335.90 --> 342.00]  They are robots. Okay. We should know everything. We still need to control them. That's you're creepy.
[342.96 --> 350.48]  They are robots. So you can do everything. But it's an AI. It's artificial intelligence man. It's more than just that.
[350.48 --> 357.54]  No. That's... I don't know what to say.
[357.54 --> 367.04]  But that's... What if one day they actually have... They can create everything. They can... Maybe they have their own nation.
[367.34 --> 372.98]  Okay. What about this? Researchers don't even know what kind of encryption method Alice devised.
[372.98 --> 378.04]  So they don't even know if it can be useful in any practical applications. Because they don't even know what it was.
[378.64 --> 381.04]  That's the scary part. They don't even know.
[382.04 --> 384.04]  That's... That's horrifying.
[384.36 --> 390.26]  I think if you stand for privacy, you should stand for end-to-end privacy with no compromises.
[390.94 --> 392.28]  Robots need secrets too.
[392.82 --> 393.14]  Why?
[393.36 --> 394.12]  Luke 2016.
[394.38 --> 395.28]  They have no feeling.
[396.72 --> 398.64]  Artificial intelligence. It might.
[399.20 --> 400.86]  They don't get hurt.
[400.86 --> 405.50]  I don't... Yeah. That's... I don't like AI thing.
[406.16 --> 407.40]  I like to stay simple.
[407.78 --> 408.54]  Stay simple.
[408.76 --> 408.90]  Yeah.
[409.76 --> 413.84]  So we've got privacy for everyone. No compromises. Luke 2016.
[414.22 --> 416.62]  And stay simple. Dennis 2016.
[417.18 --> 417.70]  Yeah.
[417.84 --> 419.30]  So it's like our political campaign.
[419.46 --> 419.76]  Yeah.
[420.38 --> 420.82]  That's good.
[421.00 --> 422.72]  Stay simple. Don't worry about it.
[423.22 --> 423.64]  Okay.
[424.00 --> 425.92]  I don't know. That's... It's...
[425.92 --> 427.40]  It's interesting.
[427.40 --> 431.04]  Seeing the constant march of AI has been an interesting thing to follow.
[431.26 --> 435.40]  And watching like Stephen Hawkins and...
[436.16 --> 437.88]  Why am I pulling a blank?
[437.96 --> 443.40]  Elon Musk bring out these crazy talks or papers or whatever on...
[443.94 --> 445.68]  And Elon Musk backing it financially.
[445.82 --> 453.46]  The whole idea of like we need to be careful about AI because it's this amazingly powerful thing that could be essentially doomsday.
[453.46 --> 456.90]  And then watching stuff like this happen, which is amazing.
[457.34 --> 463.78]  They've done stuff in the past like teaching their AI system to make art, which is incredible.
[464.16 --> 466.88]  Well, I think AI, they should just work individually.
[467.06 --> 468.26]  They shouldn't talk to each other.
[469.46 --> 472.06]  So you don't really want them to just have...
[472.06 --> 473.04]  They do their own work.
[473.10 --> 473.60]  ...no privacy.
[473.98 --> 475.24]  You want them to have no friends.
[475.24 --> 476.24]  They can have privacy.
[476.32 --> 477.96]  They can have their own privacy by themselves.
[478.06 --> 479.02]  You're like Robot Hitler.
[479.66 --> 480.32]  Am I?
[480.32 --> 482.00]  I'm kidding.
[482.40 --> 482.92]  I'm kidding.
[483.30 --> 483.86]  But they...
[483.86 --> 485.34]  Yeah, they should be their own.
[485.64 --> 486.46]  Shouldn't talk to each other.
[486.56 --> 486.86]  Oh, yeah.
[486.92 --> 487.88]  That sounds kind of bad.
[487.88 --> 489.42]  But what if it makes them more powerful?
[489.48 --> 490.42]  What if they have lonely?
[492.14 --> 493.16]  Now I'm winning yours.
[493.56 --> 495.08]  No, they do have feelings.
[495.50 --> 496.42]  I feel for them.
[498.00 --> 498.40]  Okay.
[498.56 --> 498.80]  Okay.
[499.04 --> 499.52]  They can...
[499.52 --> 501.58]  Maybe they can have some robot pets.
[501.94 --> 502.32]  Pets?
[502.46 --> 503.02]  Robotic pets?
[503.18 --> 503.28]  Yeah.
[504.16 --> 504.56]  Okay.
[504.98 --> 505.52]  That'd be cool.
[507.92 --> 508.68]  What was I going to say?
[508.76 --> 509.66]  Yeah, but what if...
[509.66 --> 512.10]  Okay, so they probably need to talk to each other to a certain degree.
[513.60 --> 514.08]  But...
[514.08 --> 517.06]  So that they can be more efficient at what they're doing in terms of work.
[517.62 --> 518.80]  Communication is important.
[518.80 --> 518.82]  Yeah.
[519.30 --> 522.92]  They can talk about work, not about their personal stuff.
[523.92 --> 524.94]  Like, be professional.
[524.94 --> 525.50]  But what if...
[525.50 --> 531.32]  Okay, what if you have a factory, and you want your workers to be able to communicate with each other,
[531.32 --> 536.04]  but you want their communications encrypted, so that someone else can't figure out what your factory is doing?
[537.28 --> 538.72]  Well, you mean someone else...
[538.72 --> 541.38]  Just people out of the work.
[541.46 --> 541.64]  Yeah.
[541.92 --> 543.18]  Their boss should know.
[543.90 --> 544.24]  At least.
[544.32 --> 544.52]  Okay.
[544.52 --> 544.92]  Yeah.
[544.98 --> 545.46]  That's...
[545.46 --> 545.74]  That's fine.
[545.74 --> 550.08]  But then you can teach the robot to communicate the encryption bits to the boss.
[552.48 --> 553.82]  That's very tough.
[555.40 --> 556.24]  I don't know.
[556.36 --> 558.90]  There's positives and negatives to so many things.
[558.90 --> 565.22]  So it's like, should you trust human, or should you trust the robot?
[566.40 --> 568.86]  I would go with...
[568.86 --> 571.24]  Humans are sketchy as heck, too, man.
[571.72 --> 572.80]  I don't know.
[573.06 --> 573.66]  I don't know.
[573.78 --> 574.30]  This is too complicated.
[574.30 --> 576.14]  Humans have done some pretty terrible things.
[576.38 --> 579.54]  Anyways, I think this is just going to get a little bit weird.
[579.88 --> 582.90]  Moving on, we have VR Mark, which is now available.
[583.26 --> 587.28]  The Advanced Edition is $20 with a 25% discount in the first week of release.
[587.28 --> 589.12]  Hopefully, we're still within that.
[589.44 --> 591.12]  And it gets you some more stuff.
[591.20 --> 592.72]  I'm going to jump to PC Per here.
[592.84 --> 596.86]  He has a really good write-up on the VR Mark stuff.
[597.32 --> 600.06]  I'm going to move the camera back to where it normally goes.
[600.68 --> 602.18]  So VR Mark arrives.
[602.40 --> 604.68]  It's finally freaking here.
[605.04 --> 610.18]  I had to do so many graphics card reviews with a little copy and paste part in my review
[610.18 --> 615.36]  that's like, by the way, no VR benchmarks, because we can't really do that yet very accurately.
[615.76 --> 616.60]  So, I don't know.
[616.60 --> 617.52]  I'm happy that it's here.
[617.80 --> 623.06]  The VR Mark Basic Edition is able to see if your PC can meet the performance requirements
[623.06 --> 624.76]  for the Vive and Oculus Rift.
[626.00 --> 629.22]  It's able to test readiness with the Orange Room benchmark,
[629.54 --> 632.44]  and you can explore the Orange Room in experience mode.
[632.90 --> 633.94]  What's the Orange Room?
[634.22 --> 637.26]  So, the Orange Room is just like one of the testing environments that they have.
[637.66 --> 640.92]  So, this thing is just for you to benchmark your VR?
[640.92 --> 641.54]  Oh, that's cool.
[641.76 --> 644.56]  It's to benchmark your computer to see if it's ready for VR.
[645.48 --> 650.32]  So, like, you could run it on this and then see if you could play a Vive off of your laptop.
[650.32 --> 653.80]  For me, I don't know how you guys benchmark stuff.
[654.20 --> 654.32]  Yeah.
[654.32 --> 655.48]  If I have this thing to download.
[655.96 --> 657.36]  Yeah, that is very cool, actually.
[657.36 --> 659.04]  You can get it on Steam, too.
[659.16 --> 659.64]  I believe.
[659.78 --> 660.52]  Pretty sure it's on Steam.
[660.52 --> 664.64]  And then the VR Mark Advanced Edition will cost $20.
[665.20 --> 669.00]  It unlocks the Blue Room, which is for even more high-performance PCs.
[669.68 --> 673.44]  And you can see detailed results of your hardware monitoring charts
[673.44 --> 676.08]  and explore both rooms in experience mode.
[676.16 --> 680.90]  And then you can do more tests with more or less demanding custom settings,
[681.12 --> 682.02]  which is cool as well.
[682.10 --> 685.58]  So, like, that would be more helpful for me.
[685.58 --> 690.12]  But if you just kind of want to see, like, check or X if your computer is ready,
[690.26 --> 693.52]  the Basic Edition, which is free, is probably good enough, which is cool.
[694.02 --> 698.86]  So, the Orange Room benchmark shows an impressive level of detail
[698.86 --> 702.58]  that can be achieved on a PC that meets the recommended hardware requirements
[703.16 --> 705.28]  for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
[705.32 --> 710.30]  If your PC passes this test, it's ready for the two most popular VR systems today.
[710.30 --> 716.28]  One of the problems that I have with VR benchmarking is – and, like, it needs to happen.
[717.18 --> 722.78]  You need to be able to do this because it is such a jump
[722.78 --> 724.88]  and it is such a unique thing that you're trying to do.
[725.12 --> 728.42]  But experiences on each platform are so unique.
[728.54 --> 732.26]  Like, there's a company that's working with NASA that has talked to us
[732.26 --> 737.04]  who's trying to make, like, a simulation of, like, moonwalks and, like, spacewalks
[737.04 --> 738.68]  and, like, working on the space station and stuff.
[738.74 --> 739.28]  With NASA.
[739.28 --> 740.24]  Yeah, they're working with NASA.
[740.24 --> 742.38]  Like, real – you can see the real space.
[742.88 --> 744.14]  Well, it's, like, graphical.
[744.26 --> 744.68]  Graphic, oh.
[744.70 --> 744.90]  Yeah.
[745.16 --> 749.40]  So, like – but that program that they're making struggles on, like,
[749.54 --> 754.28]  multiple thousand-ish dollar graphics cards.
[754.50 --> 754.84]  Wow.
[755.16 --> 755.96]  But then –
[755.96 --> 756.48]  Very, very cool.
[756.54 --> 758.28]  This thing isn't going to pass you on that.
[758.60 --> 760.12]  But it will pass you on most things.
[760.24 --> 764.26]  So, it's kind of weird because they're, like, certifying that your computer is fast enough
[764.26 --> 771.56]  to run a display plus some other stuff and then assuming performance difficulties of games,
[771.56 --> 775.28]  which it will almost always, I'm going to say, be accurate with.
[775.28 --> 780.76]  But maybe not forever and not for technically everything.
[780.76 --> 782.64]  So, it's kind of a weird space.
[782.90 --> 783.48]  But, yeah.
[783.74 --> 788.00]  The Blue Room is a more demanding test with a greater level of detail.
[788.26 --> 793.72]  It is the ideal benchmark for comparing high-end systems with specs above the recommended requirements
[793.72 --> 795.24]  for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.
[795.48 --> 796.78]  Yeah, like, that's what you're testing.
[796.90 --> 800.90]  You're testing recommended requirements, which is kind of a weird terminology.
[800.90 --> 801.80]  But whatever.
[802.92 --> 807.82]  A PC that passes this test will be able to run the latest VR games at the highest settings
[807.82 --> 811.42]  and may even be VR-ready for the next generation of VR headsets.
[811.56 --> 811.92]  That's pretty cool.
[811.92 --> 812.52]  Oh, that's awesome.
[812.92 --> 813.10]  Yeah.
[814.02 --> 814.98]  I'm very happy about it.
[814.98 --> 819.52]  So, before you buy VR, you should try this on – to benchmark your PC.
[820.04 --> 821.16]  Yeah, well, probably.
[821.26 --> 823.46]  Especially because one version is free, right?
[823.74 --> 823.98]  Yeah.
[824.14 --> 828.18]  So, like, it's not really that big of a deal if you can just download something for free
[828.18 --> 832.74]  off of what I believe is Steam, which, like, most people have anyways.
[832.74 --> 832.92]  Yeah.
[833.38 --> 833.60]  Yeah.
[833.98 --> 834.54]  Do you have Steam?
[834.84 --> 838.22]  I have – I downloaded it last year.
[838.54 --> 838.76]  Oh, okay.
[838.76 --> 840.54]  Actually, I didn't know what Steam it was.
[840.54 --> 841.80]  You got that pretty late in the game.
[841.88 --> 842.26]  I know.
[842.50 --> 844.56]  Did you get that after you started playing League of Legends?
[845.22 --> 845.62]  No.
[846.24 --> 848.36]  After I started playing Age of Empire.
[849.62 --> 853.42]  So, like – I thought you've been playing Counter-Strike for, like, a while, though.
[853.94 --> 855.98]  But I was – that was, like, long – a couple years ago.
[855.98 --> 857.18]  Was all League of Legends, Counter-Strike –
[857.18 --> 858.18]  That was way before.
[858.18 --> 859.12]  That was all within a year?
[860.28 --> 860.72]  No, no, no.
[860.98 --> 862.86]  I have been playing League of Legends.
[863.06 --> 863.26]  Yeah.
[863.42 --> 864.60]  But it's not on Steam, right?
[864.86 --> 865.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[865.44 --> 867.10]  So, Counter-Strike is on Steam.
[867.32 --> 870.46]  But before I was playing on something else.
[870.66 --> 871.48]  It's not on Steam.
[871.64 --> 872.94]  It's the older version.
[873.14 --> 874.32]  But I haven't played for so long.
[874.68 --> 875.22]  Oh, okay.
[875.38 --> 876.12]  Like, way back.
[876.12 --> 877.56]  So, I didn't know what Steam was.
[877.66 --> 878.16]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[878.18 --> 878.34]  Okay.
[878.38 --> 881.10]  But I got it since you guys told me what Steam was.
[881.10 --> 882.24]  Not free on Steam.
[883.86 --> 884.54]  Hold up.
[884.54 --> 886.94]  Let me just check this real quick.
[887.18 --> 888.18]  VRMark Steam.
[888.18 --> 890.22]  Is it supposed to be free?
[891.68 --> 894.54]  It says, yeah, basic edition.
[895.44 --> 896.96]  Basic edition is supposed to be free.
[897.04 --> 898.24]  I'm looking into this right now.
[900.42 --> 902.08]  Is it the VRMark Preview?
[903.04 --> 904.34]  Mixed overall reviews.
[904.60 --> 905.50]  Oh, dear.
[906.68 --> 906.94]  Wow.
[906.94 --> 908.18]  Let's read some of those.
[908.18 --> 908.88]  There's only eight.
[909.12 --> 910.24]  And they're mixed so far.
[911.02 --> 911.40]  Recommended.
[911.48 --> 911.82]  Recommended.
[911.92 --> 912.48]  Not recommended.
[912.68 --> 915.96]  Launches 3DMark with no options to run VRMark tests.
[916.44 --> 917.32]  Can't get it to work.
[917.40 --> 918.80]  Launches 3DMark but no VR.
[918.98 --> 921.30]  Launches 3DMark but can't find VRMark.
[921.30 --> 922.76]  Oh, dear.
[923.76 --> 925.80]  Sounds like they got some bugs for them.
[925.90 --> 929.28]  But look for the VRMark, not basic edition.
[929.48 --> 930.92]  I guess they're calling it Preview.
[934.30 --> 935.26]  Link demo, please.
[935.42 --> 938.54]  Just Google Steam VRMark.
[938.54 --> 942.44]  And you'll find that.
[943.34 --> 944.98]  Anyways, moving on.
[946.46 --> 946.98]  EVGA.
[947.62 --> 951.62]  I have heard so much about this through a bunch of random people.
[951.74 --> 953.62]  But we haven't had any problems with our cards.
[954.06 --> 957.08]  So I didn't really have anything to base it off of.
[957.44 --> 962.58]  Apparently there have been tons of issues with 1080s, 1070s, and 1060 graphics cards.
[962.58 --> 968.60]  It's Tom's Hardware Germany initially reported an issue with EVGA's cooling system.
[969.18 --> 975.26]  And the site found that the card reached up to 107 degrees Celsius or 224 degrees Fahrenheit.
[976.68 --> 978.04]  Which is kind of crazy.
[978.36 --> 980.92]  And this happened when they put it under a Furmark stress test.
[981.66 --> 983.98]  Why is everything causing fire this year?
[984.12 --> 984.56]  Everything.
[984.90 --> 985.44]  Almost everything.
[985.44 --> 985.72]  Seriously.
[986.78 --> 987.26]  Okay.
[987.44 --> 991.44]  So for me, I don't trust any electricity thing.
[991.44 --> 994.60]  So when I go to bed, I unplug my PC.
[995.06 --> 995.72]  My laptop.
[996.06 --> 996.98]  I unplug my laptop.
[997.60 --> 999.18]  I unplug my Christmas light.
[999.88 --> 1001.10]  I have Christmas night.
[1001.44 --> 1001.94]  Oh, that's cool.
[1002.04 --> 1003.12]  I'm done with that.
[1003.36 --> 1006.52]  I unplug the boiler.
[1006.88 --> 1007.52]  What about your fridge?
[1008.58 --> 1010.14]  That's the only thing I can unplug.
[1010.82 --> 1013.52]  But yeah, so I unplug everything mostly.
[1014.44 --> 1015.18]  That's kind of crazy.
[1016.24 --> 1017.28]  Because I don't...
[1017.28 --> 1019.14]  Like you don't just like turn off a power bar.
[1019.26 --> 1020.34]  You're unplugging it all.
[1020.34 --> 1025.78]  Because, okay, when I was in the military service, I was working at a fire agency.
[1025.78 --> 1026.06]  Fire, yeah.
[1026.12 --> 1028.30]  We are doing fire investigation.
[1029.08 --> 1031.48]  Even if it's plugged in, it's not on.
[1031.74 --> 1033.42]  It still has a chance to get on fire.
[1034.34 --> 1035.80]  So I just...
[1035.80 --> 1036.50]  For safety.
[1036.88 --> 1038.14]  I have smoke detector.
[1038.96 --> 1039.40]  But...
[1039.40 --> 1040.88]  Do you have a fire extinguisher?
[1041.72 --> 1042.02]  Yes.
[1042.18 --> 1042.62]  Okay, yeah.
[1042.62 --> 1043.04]  I do have that.
[1043.08 --> 1044.28]  Because a lot of people don't.
[1044.40 --> 1047.22]  But you know, when I sleep, I can sleep very deep.
[1047.66 --> 1048.92]  Like no one can wake me up.
[1049.76 --> 1051.12]  When you're in bed, you're really deep?
[1051.24 --> 1051.46]  Yeah.
[1051.66 --> 1051.96]  Okay.
[1052.12 --> 1052.78]  Very, very deep.
[1052.94 --> 1054.20]  Yeah, so deep when you're in bed.
[1054.20 --> 1056.26]  So yeah.
[1056.52 --> 1057.64]  So I don't...
[1057.64 --> 1059.00]  Yeah, I just unplug stuff.
[1059.10 --> 1063.52]  But if they caught on fire when I'm using it, I'm ready to...
[1063.52 --> 1064.24]  Like I'm fine.
[1064.36 --> 1065.04]  I can...
[1065.04 --> 1066.06]  I have fire extinguisher.
[1066.32 --> 1066.56]  Nice.
[1066.76 --> 1066.92]  Yeah.
[1067.16 --> 1067.28]  Yeah.
[1067.34 --> 1067.64]  Good.
[1067.90 --> 1068.52]  And experience.
[1069.24 --> 1070.02]  Experience, yeah.
[1070.24 --> 1070.48]  Yeah.
[1070.98 --> 1071.18]  Yeah.
[1071.86 --> 1072.94]  So much experience.
[1072.94 --> 1078.36]  Anyways, EVGA is offering optional thermal pads for those who don't feel like just a standard
[1078.36 --> 1079.84]  VBIOS update is sufficient.
[1080.50 --> 1082.80]  And they can ship those out to you and you can replace those.
[1082.96 --> 1085.80]  I would probably recommend just doing that, to be completely honest.
[1086.20 --> 1089.54]  And the company will be honoring warranties as well, they have stated.
[1089.94 --> 1090.98]  And replacement...
[1090.98 --> 1095.24]  And they will replace affected cards with new updated ones.
[1095.38 --> 1100.44]  And there's a chart which I can link for people to see if their cards are affected.
[1100.80 --> 1101.62]  Let's see here.
[1101.62 --> 1102.06]  Here.
[1102.64 --> 1103.12]  Do-do-do.
[1103.54 --> 1105.26]  So all these model numbers.
[1106.20 --> 1108.76]  Looks like pretty much everything.
[1109.26 --> 1114.46]  So if you have a card with that specific model number ID, product ID kind of deal,
[1114.96 --> 1118.56]  I would contact EVGA in some way.
[1118.72 --> 1120.84]  I would maybe get those thermal replacement pads or whatever.
[1120.98 --> 1122.34]  I believe we have a video.
[1122.58 --> 1124.48]  I don't know what it's called or where it is or whatever.
[1124.82 --> 1129.20]  On like how to do replacement thermal pad stuff from like way back in the day.
[1129.20 --> 1133.36]  If not, I'm sure someone else does like Jay or something like that.
[1133.42 --> 1134.74]  Jay does a lot of water cooling stuff.
[1134.82 --> 1136.38]  And I believe he has a video on this.
[1136.50 --> 1137.04]  Jay's two cents.
[1138.20 --> 1140.76]  I'm pretty sure he has a video on the whole EVGA thing.
[1140.86 --> 1143.92]  So if you're confused, there's multiple ways to follow up.
[1144.28 --> 1146.56]  I'm sorry to hear that there was problems.
[1146.56 --> 1153.42]  Luckily, as far as I can tell, I haven't heard anyone saying that EVGA has been trying to screw them over.
[1155.14 --> 1159.02]  I'm going to say that like with a so far thing, which is good.
[1159.02 --> 1163.98]  But if you guys do hear anything, please tweet me so I can keep track of what's going on.
[1164.06 --> 1167.28]  I've like I've just been hearing that this is a thing.
[1167.54 --> 1173.96]  I haven't actually talked to anyone specifically who's like had it be a problem and then dealt with EVGA yet.
[1174.18 --> 1176.24]  So I'm just going off of hearsay.
[1176.34 --> 1178.02]  And so far, the hearsay is that things are fine.
[1178.80 --> 1180.76]  Safety first for everything.
[1182.40 --> 1182.92]  Yeah.
[1184.28 --> 1184.84]  Yes.
[1185.16 --> 1186.54]  Do you take the battery out of your laptop?
[1186.54 --> 1192.62]  No, I think I should replace my battery because it drains so fast.
[1192.74 --> 1193.02]  Oh, yeah.
[1193.04 --> 1195.24]  There might be some problem with my battery, too.
[1195.94 --> 1197.82]  But my laptop is dying.
[1198.32 --> 1199.50]  So I'll probably just let it die.
[1199.92 --> 1200.88]  And I'll just let it die.
[1200.98 --> 1201.84]  I'll just get a new one.
[1202.00 --> 1202.98]  I need a PC.
[1204.12 --> 1205.26]  Are you going to build like a desktop?
[1206.22 --> 1207.02]  I want to.
[1207.26 --> 1210.28]  Yeah, I need a real PC, not a laptop.
[1210.72 --> 1212.68]  Mine is like three years old.
[1212.92 --> 1213.96]  What is your use case?
[1213.96 --> 1219.48]  Are you going to be like rendering videos at home and editing videos at home just for fun or just games?
[1221.78 --> 1224.18]  Yeah, probably for editing videos.
[1225.70 --> 1226.74]  Yeah, mostly.
[1227.08 --> 1228.34]  But this is the same.
[1228.92 --> 1233.26]  If I can edit on my PC, I probably can play my stuff, too, because I don't play.
[1233.26 --> 1233.92]  Yeah, I know.
[1233.96 --> 1235.76]  I was just wondering like what you were doing.
[1235.98 --> 1240.70]  Because like if your only use case was playing League, then it's like pretty easy.
[1240.92 --> 1241.08]  Right?
[1241.14 --> 1243.52]  Like you don't need much to do that.
[1243.70 --> 1245.70]  Probably mostly for video editing.
[1245.86 --> 1246.90]  So then you need a lot more.
[1247.08 --> 1247.26]  Yeah.
[1247.28 --> 1250.52]  You need a much more powerful computer than just one that needs to play League.
[1250.58 --> 1250.76]  Yeah.
[1251.14 --> 1252.04]  Not that big of a deal.
[1253.22 --> 1254.48]  But yeah, that'll be kind of cool.
[1254.52 --> 1255.36]  Are you going to do a build log?
[1256.26 --> 1257.44]  Yeah, I talked to Linus.
[1257.60 --> 1258.16]  Oh, nice.
[1258.38 --> 1260.38]  But we will see what it's going to do.
[1260.46 --> 1260.66]  Maybe?
[1260.94 --> 1261.14]  Yeah.
[1262.06 --> 1262.38]  Woo!
[1262.86 --> 1263.70]  Dennis build log.
[1263.92 --> 1264.76]  You got to mod it.
[1265.82 --> 1267.66]  You got to Taiwan number one like crazy.
[1267.92 --> 1268.84]  I want to make...
[1268.84 --> 1270.60]  Like paint the flag on the side of it.
[1270.60 --> 1278.14]  I want to do like the kind of case you've made for Scrabat or that one.
[1278.48 --> 1279.22]  What's that called?
[1280.42 --> 1281.44]  The fire one.
[1281.56 --> 1281.96]  That one?
[1282.06 --> 1282.50]  That one.
[1282.62 --> 1283.36]  Yeah, that one.
[1284.06 --> 1285.66]  You want to do like a Mad Max thing?
[1285.76 --> 1286.60]  Just without the fire.
[1287.32 --> 1289.42]  Yeah, or something like that.
[1289.56 --> 1291.66]  Because that has butane in it.
[1292.10 --> 1293.26]  I want something really cool.
[1293.28 --> 1294.16]  I think it's still...
[1294.16 --> 1295.20]  I want handmade.
[1295.76 --> 1298.50]  I don't want to just buy a case.
[1298.72 --> 1298.86]  Okay.
[1298.86 --> 1302.06]  You want to build it from Scrap or do you want to like mod one?
[1302.40 --> 1302.68]  Wow.
[1303.84 --> 1304.96]  That's not Scratch built.
[1305.14 --> 1305.78]  That's not.
[1306.04 --> 1308.96]  That started as a normal computer case.
[1308.96 --> 1310.74]  I always start with something.
[1310.92 --> 1311.48]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1311.80 --> 1312.20]  Yeah, yeah.
[1313.00 --> 1314.96]  So like heavily modified case.
[1315.02 --> 1315.62]  That's what you want to do.
[1315.72 --> 1316.26]  That's cool.
[1316.62 --> 1317.34]  I'm down to help.
[1317.76 --> 1319.20]  Like 100%.
[1319.20 --> 1323.16]  I want to have some different lighting.
[1323.32 --> 1326.50]  I don't know if I want water cooling, but I want some cool lighting.
[1326.50 --> 1329.14]  And I don't know.
[1329.32 --> 1330.44]  Like LED strip lighting?
[1330.44 --> 1332.78]  I want to have some theme.
[1334.70 --> 1336.40]  Have you seen the movie, Nerf?
[1337.18 --> 1338.90]  Their color graphics.
[1338.90 --> 1339.02]  I don't think so.
[1339.68 --> 1340.28]  Really cool.
[1340.42 --> 1341.20]  The color tone.
[1341.96 --> 1343.60]  I like that kind of color on my PC.
[1343.66 --> 1344.26]  It's really cool.
[1344.56 --> 1344.90]  Nerf.
[1344.90 --> 1348.90]  Nerf.
[1348.90 --> 1349.46]  Nerf.
[1351.62 --> 1352.46]  Oh, Nerf.
[1352.54 --> 1352.98]  Nerf.
[1352.98 --> 1353.04]  Nerf.
[1353.04 --> 1353.38]  Nerf.
[1353.38 --> 1353.68]  Okay.
[1353.82 --> 1354.12]  Yeah, yeah.
[1354.28 --> 1354.52]  Sorry.
[1356.70 --> 1357.52]  That color.
[1357.58 --> 1357.88]  Yes.
[1358.00 --> 1358.22]  Okay.
[1358.40 --> 1359.42]  So like crazy neon.
[1359.80 --> 1360.26]  Yes.
[1360.36 --> 1361.18]  That's really cool.
[1361.46 --> 1362.14]  Like that.
[1362.32 --> 1363.18]  That would be pretty awesome.
[1365.12 --> 1365.30]  Oh.
[1366.88 --> 1368.70]  Google it just gets weird sometimes.
[1368.76 --> 1369.00]  Okay?
[1369.06 --> 1369.78]  That's not my fault.
[1369.96 --> 1370.08]  Yeah.
[1370.08 --> 1371.08]  That looks pretty cool though.
[1371.08 --> 1372.70]  I want like that color.
[1372.96 --> 1373.22]  Yeah.
[1375.62 --> 1376.06]  Okay.
[1376.74 --> 1378.50]  Like do you want to do like this kind of stuff?
[1378.60 --> 1379.46]  Like crazy neon.
[1379.56 --> 1380.22]  I don't want pink.
[1380.64 --> 1384.32]  I want blue, green.
[1384.54 --> 1386.72]  So like not the Nerf thing, but the background.
[1386.72 --> 1387.50]  Yeah, like that.
[1388.50 --> 1389.82]  But like those blue and green things?
[1389.84 --> 1392.12]  But I don't want to just use the LED stripe.
[1392.34 --> 1393.30]  I want something.
[1393.80 --> 1395.00]  You want it like painted that way?
[1396.44 --> 1396.84]  Yeah.
[1397.18 --> 1397.46]  Okay.
[1397.46 --> 1403.12]  You could get like UV reactive paint and then put UV lights in there.
[1403.12 --> 1403.62]  Yes, yes, yes.
[1403.62 --> 1405.64]  And then everything would look like it's kind of glowing.
[1405.80 --> 1406.44]  That would be pretty cool.
[1406.52 --> 1408.28]  I want my PC like glowing.
[1408.74 --> 1409.10]  Glowing.
[1409.66 --> 1413.60]  So you unplug everything and are scared of fire hazards, but you want your PC to glow.
[1414.40 --> 1416.04]  That's an awesome combination.
[1416.24 --> 1417.38]  I'm just putting that up there.
[1417.74 --> 1418.80]  I enjoy that a lot.
[1420.84 --> 1422.40]  So yeah, vaporwave.
[1422.50 --> 1423.72]  Someone just posted that in the thing.
[1423.80 --> 1425.52]  Vaporwave might be an interesting search.
[1425.74 --> 1426.14]  Vaporwave.
[1426.14 --> 1426.62]  Let's see.
[1426.62 --> 1426.64]  Let's see.
[1426.72 --> 1427.06]  One sec.
[1427.24 --> 1428.72]  Vaporwave is like a music thing.
[1429.84 --> 1432.76]  I think it's popular with them young kids.
[1433.60 --> 1434.52]  Like this kind of stuff.
[1434.52 --> 1434.54]  Oh.
[1435.32 --> 1435.76]  Yeah.
[1436.36 --> 1437.86]  Yeah, that kind of color tone.
[1438.80 --> 1439.84]  But not the pink.
[1440.60 --> 1441.56]  So like this?
[1443.08 --> 1444.48]  That's just kind of...
[1444.48 --> 1446.12]  Look at that first one.
[1446.54 --> 1447.18]  Top left.
[1448.32 --> 1448.74]  Wow.
[1450.80 --> 1451.24]  Wow.
[1452.64 --> 1453.74]  I don't know what I did.
[1453.74 --> 1455.62]  What the heck?
[1456.46 --> 1456.72]  That.
[1456.92 --> 1457.66]  Yeah, that's cool.
[1457.86 --> 1458.26]  That's cool?
[1458.60 --> 1458.96]  Mm-hmm.
[1459.16 --> 1459.50]  All right.
[1459.82 --> 1461.16]  That's going to be an interesting computer.
[1461.36 --> 1462.62]  And I want my logo on it.
[1463.40 --> 1463.98]  Your logo.
[1464.30 --> 1464.74]  My logo.
[1464.78 --> 1465.36]  You have a logo?
[1466.14 --> 1466.98]  What's your logo?
[1467.38 --> 1468.76]  I have to create one.
[1468.96 --> 1469.36]  Okay.
[1471.44 --> 1472.12]  I'm excited.
[1472.44 --> 1473.32]  That sounds really cool.
[1473.32 --> 1474.12]  Okay.
[1474.38 --> 1474.82]  Anyways.
[1475.00 --> 1479.02]  Moving on from Dennis's potential awesome custom computer.
[1479.90 --> 1482.64]  Google Fiber Division cuts staff by 9%.
[1482.64 --> 1483.08]  Bleh.
[1483.80 --> 1485.94]  Pauses fiber plans in 11 cities.
[1486.94 --> 1487.54]  Bleh.
[1488.20 --> 1488.40]  Mm.
[1488.82 --> 1489.70]  Really sucks.
[1489.88 --> 1495.06]  Access, the alphabet division containing Google Fiber, will lay off employees and replace its CEO
[1495.06 --> 1498.86]  as it looks for cheaper ways to deliver internet service to new cities.
[1499.44 --> 1501.52]  Access CEO's Craig Barrett.
[1501.52 --> 1502.76]  Hopefully I said that properly.
[1502.90 --> 1503.14]  Barrett.
[1503.28 --> 1503.58]  Barrett.
[1503.72 --> 1503.98]  Barrett.
[1504.44 --> 1509.90]  Made the announcement in a blog post saying he would only be staying on as an advisory role.
[1510.26 --> 1513.48]  Mentions that Access is going to pause operations in 11 cities.
[1513.48 --> 1519.66]  And the future of Access seems to be in wireless, which is very unfortunate.
[1521.46 --> 1525.40]  Access purchased the internet provider Web Pass in June.
[1525.40 --> 1538.18]  And it's giving it the technology to begin developing over-the-air gigabit internet to homes that in theory provides the same service that fiber would,
[1538.52 --> 1540.10]  but without as many deployment hurdles.
[1543.70 --> 1544.54]  I don't know.
[1544.68 --> 1545.02]  We'll see.
[1545.20 --> 1547.82]  Google Fiber is only in the States.
[1547.90 --> 1548.14]  Yes.
[1548.14 --> 1553.14]  Are they going to expand their location?
[1553.14 --> 1554.20]  I kind of doubt it.
[1555.30 --> 1560.12]  Not beyond the U.S., at least for a long time, as far as I know.
[1560.80 --> 1563.18]  Someone in this chat could be correcting me.
[1563.44 --> 1563.78]  But, yeah.
[1564.18 --> 1566.10]  That's pretty insane over-the-air.
[1566.18 --> 1567.50]  I just want to put that out there right now.
[1567.60 --> 1569.74]  That is very, very fast wireless.
[1569.74 --> 1572.74]  Gigabit wireless is pretty insane.
[1573.50 --> 1577.04]  That's, for instance, that's the internet connection that we have here in entirety.
[1577.40 --> 1577.60]  Oh.
[1577.70 --> 1581.76]  And they would send that here wirelessly instead of over landlines.
[1582.06 --> 1582.42]  Oh.
[1582.96 --> 1583.90]  Which would be pretty crazy.
[1586.18 --> 1596.42]  What I don't really like about that is there's just so consistently problems with wireless technologies.
[1596.42 --> 1605.78]  The only time that I've been, like, properly impressed with wireless was when I went to Switzerland and saw that new mouse thing that Logitech did.
[1606.76 --> 1607.70]  Darkwave, I believe.
[1608.28 --> 1609.50]  I could totally be getting that wrong.
[1609.86 --> 1617.22]  But this G900, and I think one more mouse now, but I don't remember the exact model of it because I hate Logitech's model things for their mice.
[1617.34 --> 1618.64]  4.0 something.
[1618.98 --> 1619.30]  Whatever.
[1620.06 --> 1621.14]  That's very cool.
[1621.72 --> 1623.58]  Yeah, I don't like wireless either.
[1625.08 --> 1625.96]  I don't know.
[1625.96 --> 1627.08]  It's stable to your home.
[1627.08 --> 1627.36]  Yeah.
[1627.58 --> 1635.06]  If it's stable to your home and then you could run your own local wires properly, that's cool.
[1636.34 --> 1637.48]  And it's Google.
[1637.72 --> 1641.68]  So if Google's going to do it, I'm kind of suspecting that it will be stable to your home.
[1641.84 --> 1643.14]  It just makes me worry.
[1643.96 --> 1644.70]  Darkfield.
[1644.86 --> 1645.08]  Cool.
[1645.34 --> 1645.50]  Yeah.
[1646.22 --> 1646.58]  Awesome.
[1647.28 --> 1648.84]  Everyone in chat is just spamming your name.
[1649.22 --> 1649.36]  Oh.
[1649.98 --> 1651.24]  Someone said Dennis for president.
[1651.80 --> 1653.94]  I think, what was it?
[1653.94 --> 1654.54]  Keep it simple?
[1654.60 --> 1655.60]  Electra's next Tuesday, right?
[1655.96 --> 1656.98]  It's the 8th.
[1657.36 --> 1658.98]  So four days.
[1658.98 --> 1660.26]  Yes, that's next Tuesday.
[1661.96 --> 1662.36]  Yeah.
[1663.14 --> 1664.06]  See, I know it.
[1665.06 --> 1665.64]  Are you excited?
[1665.88 --> 1666.50]  Are you scared?
[1666.50 --> 1670.12]  I don't know.
[1670.12 --> 1672.42]  I think I'm scared literally no matter what happens.
[1673.46 --> 1674.10]  I don't know.
[1674.50 --> 1675.52]  I just, I don't know.
[1675.60 --> 1678.60]  Anyways, let's move on to other political things.
[1678.90 --> 1682.70]  Uber drivers win key employment case against Uber.
[1682.70 --> 1689.42]  So this is from the BBC because it was very specifically, I think, in England and Wales.
[1689.42 --> 1692.00]  There's 40,000 Uber drivers in England and Wales.
[1692.00 --> 1705.24]  And they now have, they're now entitled to holiday pay, rest breaks, and the national minimum wage, which is very different compared to how Uber normally operates.
[1705.24 --> 1711.62]  Uber said that it's going to appeal the ruling that states that they acted unlawfully.
[1711.62 --> 1723.14]  The ruling accused Uber of resorting in its documentation to fictions, twisted language, and even new, brand new freaking terminology.
[1723.48 --> 1724.82]  Just making stuff up.
[1725.22 --> 1725.72]  Adding,
[1725.72 --> 1736.96]  The notion that Uber in London is a mosaic of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common platform in our mind is faintly ridiculous.
[1737.76 --> 1740.70]  What is happening at Uber is just the tip of the iceberg.
[1740.94 --> 1745.76]  Lots of people are now trapped in insecure jobs with low pay and no voice at work.
[1746.20 --> 1749.28]  We need the government to get tough on sham self-employment.
[1749.36 --> 1752.26]  So it was like pretty direct.
[1752.26 --> 1756.06]  They didn't really leave a lot of like legalese style stuff in there.
[1756.14 --> 1759.72]  They just seem to have attacked quite plainly.
[1760.06 --> 1762.48]  Uber, we don't have Uber in Vancouver.
[1762.78 --> 1762.94]  No.
[1763.18 --> 1769.74]  And I feel government need to catch up with the technology nowadays and create their,
[1770.70 --> 1778.32]  I think people who work for Uber or the drivers, they can form a union or something to pursue their rights.
[1778.92 --> 1779.04]  Yeah.
[1779.82 --> 1781.74]  Well, they just did here, essentially.
[1781.74 --> 1781.98]  Yeah.
[1782.94 --> 1783.94]  Same in Taiwan.
[1784.26 --> 1786.92]  We have Uber, but it's not legal.
[1788.20 --> 1790.82]  So their work's still insecure.
[1790.92 --> 1791.72]  They can get a fine.
[1792.36 --> 1794.94]  But why don't they just push them to legal?
[1794.94 --> 1802.36]  Because I think a lot of taxi drivers, they're afraid of that effect.
[1802.84 --> 1805.34]  They're afraid of switching because it's possibly screwed over.
[1805.34 --> 1808.36]  But that's, it's moving on, you know?
[1809.20 --> 1809.40]  So.
[1810.22 --> 1811.46]  Catch up with the times.
[1811.84 --> 1812.06]  Yeah.
[1812.18 --> 1812.50]  I don't know.
[1812.54 --> 1814.76]  It's rather frustrating not having Uber here.
[1814.90 --> 1819.02]  Like to get a cab from the airport to my house, it's over $100.
[1819.02 --> 1820.42]  Yeah, from here.
[1820.82 --> 1823.32]  From work to the airport, it's how much?
[1823.42 --> 1823.88]  Like $100.
[1824.24 --> 1824.82]  About $100.
[1825.48 --> 1825.70]  Yeah.
[1825.70 --> 1827.60]  Like, wow.
[1828.68 --> 1829.08]  Last?
[1829.38 --> 1830.14]  How long?
[1830.26 --> 1831.68]  It was like 40 minutes drive.
[1833.78 --> 1835.54]  $100 for a 40-minute drive?
[1835.74 --> 1836.66]  It's pretty intense.
[1836.66 --> 1842.96]  And the biggest part for me is cabs are just annoying to deal with.
[1843.38 --> 1847.02]  It's so much easier just to call an Uber and get everything done.
[1847.12 --> 1848.56]  I hate calling cabs.
[1848.64 --> 1850.02]  It is so, so frustrating.
[1850.44 --> 1853.10]  I used to dislike it, but it was like, oh, it's the only option.
[1853.18 --> 1855.72]  Then Uber came around, and I'm like, wow, yeah, screw that.
[1856.20 --> 1857.54]  Especially for foreigners.
[1858.36 --> 1860.06]  Like, we have communication problems.
[1860.14 --> 1860.40]  Yeah.
[1860.74 --> 1866.44]  And if you call a cab, and one time we were going to Taiwan for Computex.
[1866.66 --> 1871.50]  I called, and apparently he was not Canadian either.
[1871.60 --> 1873.00]  He was from somewhere.
[1873.16 --> 1876.34]  He wasn't from here because he has an accent, and I have an accent too.
[1876.44 --> 1879.50]  So we couldn't talk to each other, and it took me like 30 minutes.
[1879.50 --> 1879.76]  In Taiwan?
[1880.16 --> 1880.66]  No, here.
[1880.98 --> 1882.18]  Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.
[1882.18 --> 1882.78]  Okay, yeah.
[1882.78 --> 1887.00]  So it took me like 30 minutes to try to get a cab.
[1887.64 --> 1888.24]  Oh, jeez.
[1888.24 --> 1893.92]  And I was almost late because Luke couldn't find his passport.
[1894.56 --> 1895.18]  Oh, yeah.
[1895.18 --> 1897.74]  I did find it eventually.
[1898.28 --> 1899.38]  I did find it eventually.
[1899.38 --> 1900.12]  That was so scary.
[1900.32 --> 1900.44]  Okay.
[1900.76 --> 1904.74]  Linus forgot his passport for the trip he was on right now.
[1905.18 --> 1907.34]  He never told me, conveniently.
[1907.68 --> 1909.12]  He told like everybody else.
[1909.12 --> 1909.62]  Oh.
[1910.82 --> 1916.26]  And Yvonne had to rush his passport out to him.
[1916.66 --> 1916.92]  Oh.
[1916.92 --> 1921.32]  And I think he said he got it within like probably two minutes of when he would have had it.
[1921.32 --> 1921.52]  Oh, wow.
[1921.52 --> 1921.86]  I'll have it.
[1922.18 --> 1925.34]  So like that was, damn.
[1925.64 --> 1926.62]  That was pretty intense.
[1926.70 --> 1927.16]  Oh, my God.
[1927.18 --> 1928.82]  The chat can see itself on screen.
[1929.76 --> 1930.46]  That's a...
[1930.46 --> 1930.68]  Oh.
[1930.94 --> 1931.24]  You know what?
[1931.24 --> 1932.14]  I'm just going to leave that there.
[1932.60 --> 1933.44]  That's fine.
[1933.44 --> 1933.50]  That's fine.
[1933.50 --> 1937.66]  We'll just let them talk to themselves for a second and then I'll take it away because
[1937.66 --> 1939.12]  eventually it'll get way too trolly.
[1939.62 --> 1941.50]  And now that I've said that, I'm going to move it away.
[1942.06 --> 1942.80]  That's probably smart.
[1944.62 --> 1944.98]  Yeah.
[1945.14 --> 1945.92]  What was I going to say?
[1945.92 --> 1951.02]  That's the other really nice thing about Uber is I can get around Taiwan.
[1951.42 --> 1951.64]  Yeah.
[1951.74 --> 1954.14]  In Uber is completely fine.
[1954.22 --> 1957.90]  Between Google Translate and the Uber app, I can just be like, I'm going here.
[1957.98 --> 1960.32]  And then if they have any questions, I can be like, there.
[1960.58 --> 1961.34]  Also, it's good.
[1961.68 --> 1964.04]  It's easier for people for business trip.
[1964.20 --> 1966.40]  They have received invoice.
[1967.12 --> 1967.32]  Yeah.
[1967.52 --> 1969.00]  You can get a business account in Uber.
[1969.16 --> 1969.36]  Yeah.
[1969.36 --> 1973.82]  And then it gathers all your invoices together and then sends them all at once to whoever
[1973.82 --> 1976.04]  does your accounting, which is absolutely fantastic.
[1976.60 --> 1980.72]  And then you were in Boston for PAX East with me last time.
[1981.14 --> 1986.64]  Boston, out of all places I've gone to on various trips, Boston is where cabbies have
[1986.64 --> 1992.92]  tried to screw me over the most to the point where I map every single ride that I do in
[1992.92 --> 1995.86]  a cab in Google Maps while I'm going.
[1995.86 --> 2002.50]  And I know like I pre-map out the route from the hotel to the convention center and I check
[2002.50 --> 2006.16]  all the potential different ways with traffic and all this kind of stuff to figure out how
[2006.16 --> 2008.00]  they could get to different locations.
[2008.48 --> 2013.14]  And oh my God, if I ever have to take a cab, it's like a 75% chance they're going to try
[2013.14 --> 2017.34]  to screw me over because I'll say something and they'll be able to tell that I'm obviously
[2017.34 --> 2020.82]  not from Boston and they'll just wreck me.
[2020.90 --> 2021.58]  It's terrible.
[2021.74 --> 2023.30]  And Uber saves that.
[2023.30 --> 2027.72]  And they've even Uber drivers have tried to screw me in Boston too, but you can just
[2027.72 --> 2032.92]  check it once you're done and just be like, uh, yeah, no, that was bullshit.
[2033.04 --> 2034.16]  Just press the little button.
[2034.16 --> 2036.06]  And then Uber is like, yeah, okay, here's your money back.
[2036.30 --> 2036.52]  Yeah.
[2036.58 --> 2037.16]  You can report.
[2037.26 --> 2041.64]  I did report one, one time when we, when we were in Taiwan, like two years ago, you,
[2041.74 --> 2046.68]  you guys went to Taiwan and I haven't, I wasn't working with, um, with them yet.
[2046.68 --> 2050.04]  I took them and then Uber secret interview process.
[2050.16 --> 2051.10]  Oh, okay.
[2051.10 --> 2053.78]  That Uber driver was insane.
[2053.88 --> 2054.26]  Remember?
[2054.48 --> 2056.56]  Which he was like driving.
[2056.80 --> 2057.34]  So yeah.
[2057.34 --> 2057.62]  Yeah.
[2057.62 --> 2058.12]  On the highway.
[2058.30 --> 2060.08]  And we almost got hit.
[2060.30 --> 2060.40]  Oh my God.
[2060.44 --> 2061.48]  We seriously almost died.
[2061.54 --> 2063.74]  So I, I report that when we got our money back.
[2064.24 --> 2065.20]  That was nuts.
[2066.02 --> 2067.22]  That was actually nuts.
[2067.30 --> 2068.68]  I, I'm remembering that now.
[2068.78 --> 2069.00]  Yeah.
[2069.06 --> 2070.02]  That was really freaky.
[2070.10 --> 2070.30]  Yeah.
[2070.52 --> 2070.84]  Okay.
[2070.84 --> 2074.68]  There's, there's not that many times that I've been in a cab and I was like, I might die.
[2075.30 --> 2077.50]  And that was, that was, that was, uh, that was one of them.
[2078.36 --> 2084.44]  Talking about politics, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and WhatsApp were all shut down in Turkey.
[2084.70 --> 2087.12]  Let me jump over to this screen really quick.
[2087.60 --> 2088.56]  It's white for now.
[2088.88 --> 2090.72]  I don't like this cam position.
[2090.72 --> 2094.32]  What if we just do it over here where article things usually are not?
[2094.90 --> 2100.28]  Oh, it's because it covers Linus's tabs because he doesn't know what he has up on his screen.
[2100.28 --> 2101.08]  That makes sense.
[2101.22 --> 2101.76]  Mine are clean.
[2101.88 --> 2102.34]  That's fine.
[2103.00 --> 2103.82]  Um, yeah.
[2103.98 --> 2108.90]  So Turkey blocks Twitter account, which is official shows what has been blocked.
[2109.02 --> 2112.96]  You can see twitter.com, facebook.com, youtube.com all taken down.
[2113.16 --> 2116.00]  And then I believe WhatsApp is part of Facebook.
[2116.00 --> 2118.68]  So then that would be down because of that.
[2118.84 --> 2121.44]  Oh, uh, not so good.
[2121.94 --> 2122.62]  Oh no.
[2122.70 --> 2123.16]  There it is.
[2123.22 --> 2124.28]  WhatsApp also down.
[2125.08 --> 2126.10]  I can't imagine.
[2128.26 --> 2130.16]  Can't imagine living without your social media.
[2130.28 --> 2130.98]  I'm kidding.
[2131.10 --> 2132.28]  It's way deeper than that.
[2132.38 --> 2133.28]  It's not cool at all.
[2133.36 --> 2134.32]  I was just making a joke.
[2134.84 --> 2138.24]  See, like people like us, we, we, we have a YouTube channel.
[2138.40 --> 2139.90]  It's like losing your job.
[2140.78 --> 2142.66]  I literally didn't even think about that.
[2142.84 --> 2143.06]  Yeah.
[2143.90 --> 2144.34]  Wow.
[2145.74 --> 2146.82]  You're losing your job, man.
[2146.82 --> 2147.12]  Yeah.
[2148.16 --> 2148.60]  Okay.
[2148.60 --> 2149.74]  That's really brutal.
[2150.06 --> 2152.36]  I had never even considered that aspect of it.
[2152.64 --> 2154.16]  My thing was just freedom of speech.
[2154.16 --> 2161.68]  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and WhatsApp is how a lot of people would communicate, um, potentially rebellious things.
[2162.22 --> 2164.76]  Um, or things that may be anti-government.
[2165.18 --> 2166.84]  And that's the only way I really thought about it.
[2166.92 --> 2168.46]  I didn't even think about livelihoods.
[2168.80 --> 2171.58]  That's its own ball of wax.
[2171.58 --> 2174.08]  How many people are losing their job in Turkey?
[2174.16 --> 2176.58]  If they work, if they have their YouTube channel.
[2177.54 --> 2181.04]  And yeah, loss of the communication is, that's horrible.
[2181.86 --> 2182.08]  Yeah.
[2182.08 --> 2191.08]  So Turkey Blocks monitors, uh, Turkey Blocks monitoring probes have identified, uh, throttling at the ISP level as the source of slowdowns.
[2191.98 --> 2199.32]  Uh, shutdown was first detected by national provider TTNet, Turkcell, and other major ISPs.
[2199.84 --> 2204.28]  Uh, smaller providers have not yet been affected as of November 4th, 2016.
[2205.12 --> 2211.34]  VPN tunnels have proven to be an effective means of circumvention for users determined to work around network throttling,
[2211.34 --> 2213.18]  as per usual.
[2213.58 --> 2214.38]  That is pretty cool.
[2216.30 --> 2216.90]  Okay.
[2217.70 --> 2220.92]  Uh, Razer mocks Apple Pro with crude humor.
[2221.12 --> 2221.92]  Did you see this?
[2221.92 --> 2223.24]  I thought that was kind of funny.
[2223.72 --> 2224.06]  Right?
[2224.22 --> 2224.96]  Like, uh.
[2225.64 --> 2226.76]  I don't know.
[2229.04 --> 2230.98]  Just a giant picture of the CEO.
[2230.98 --> 2231.82]  That's very creative.
[2232.26 --> 2236.06]  I love how Tech Mike is just like, this is the person that said it.
[2236.38 --> 2238.28]  The CEO said this thing.
[2238.72 --> 2239.94]  Terrible, terrible, terrible.
[2239.94 --> 2241.42]  Um, yeah.
[2242.08 --> 2249.16]  Razer computers, S-My-D tweet is the definition of sexism in tech.
[2249.30 --> 2249.60]  Okay.
[2249.78 --> 2250.62]  Well, okay.
[2250.86 --> 2252.62]  So maybe because you think of that way.
[2252.68 --> 2253.96]  Maybe it's something else.
[2254.42 --> 2260.42]  I think what Razer said is just genuinely Razer doesn't want women as customers.
[2261.06 --> 2261.54]  Ah.
[2261.54 --> 2265.80]  I don't think that's it.
[2265.90 --> 2268.50]  Honestly, I'm not going to call their names out specifically.
[2268.70 --> 2269.46]  Uh, one of them.
[2270.00 --> 2270.52]  I will.
[2271.04 --> 2271.68]  Ah, no, no, no.
[2271.72 --> 2273.00]  I'm not going to call their names out specifically.
[2273.00 --> 2282.94]  But two, uh, friends that are in my life that are females say S-My-D with those words extended
[2282.94 --> 2285.78]  fully more than any guy I know.
[2286.28 --> 2286.56]  Oh, really?
[2286.56 --> 2287.74]  Because they say it as a joke.
[2289.26 --> 2290.50]  Because it's just supposed to be funny.
[2290.56 --> 2292.02]  Like, I didn't take this seriously.
[2293.14 --> 2294.72]  You call yourself pro S-My-D?
[2294.90 --> 2295.82]  I never said this.
[2295.82 --> 2296.76]  SD card.
[2297.02 --> 2297.68]  Oh, right.
[2298.02 --> 2298.62]  Like, it's supposed to be funny.
[2298.62 --> 2301.90]  But it's less of a joke when you say it than when a girl says it.
[2302.74 --> 2304.04]  Because then it's like, okay, well.
[2305.62 --> 2306.32]  I don't know.
[2306.42 --> 2306.80]  I don't know.
[2307.30 --> 2307.70]  Yeah.
[2307.86 --> 2310.80]  I just, I think people are taking stuff way too seriously.
[2311.80 --> 2313.50]  And I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[2313.68 --> 2314.30]  It's pretty crazy.
[2314.60 --> 2317.30]  It's not the most PR friendly tweet.
[2317.66 --> 2318.40]  Yeah, it's not.
[2318.40 --> 2321.08]  It could have maybe done it a little bit better on that aspect.
[2321.30 --> 2324.82]  But, like, I don't think, I don't think it's that bad.
[2324.82 --> 2327.08]  I think it's kind of funny.
[2328.42 --> 2329.48]  This isn't effing helping.
[2330.04 --> 2331.48]  You've got to roll in the gaming market.
[2331.86 --> 2333.12]  Use it to do the right thing.
[2333.22 --> 2334.48]  Not encourage this behavior.
[2335.66 --> 2337.78]  Yo, I know this is a lot of tweets.
[2337.96 --> 2341.80]  But I'm showing you some of the bullshit that happens when women talk about games.
[2341.88 --> 2342.68]  It's just for today.
[2342.88 --> 2343.76]  Whoa, okay.
[2348.38 --> 2349.24]  I don't know.
[2349.60 --> 2351.22]  I'm not going to get into this way too much.
[2351.36 --> 2354.00]  I just, I think people are maybe overreacting a little bit.
[2354.00 --> 2357.60]  It wasn't the greatest thing to do in a PR move.
[2358.30 --> 2358.78]  Yeah.
[2359.48 --> 2359.82]  Yeah.
[2361.10 --> 2363.14]  It was a little intense.
[2363.26 --> 2364.38]  Razer responded via Twitter.
[2364.74 --> 2365.94]  We're not looking to offend.
[2366.24 --> 2370.10]  Just proud of our SD card slot, which is becoming increasingly rare.
[2370.78 --> 2371.50]  And, like, yeah.
[2371.90 --> 2375.18]  I mean, using one of your laptops right now that doesn't have it.
[2375.18 --> 2378.78]  So, you're right.
[2379.14 --> 2379.74]  That's true.
[2379.78 --> 2381.24]  It is becoming increasingly rare.
[2381.54 --> 2386.06]  Also, the other laptop that we have that isn't the Blade Stealth also doesn't have it.
[2386.30 --> 2390.24]  So, it is becoming very increasingly rare, even in your own products.
[2391.10 --> 2392.16]  But, yeah.
[2392.22 --> 2392.62]  I don't know.
[2393.08 --> 2394.24]  I wonder what Twitch chat says.
[2394.62 --> 2394.98]  Let's see.
[2395.04 --> 2395.76]  Let's do a straw poll.
[2395.76 --> 2398.62]  Maybe I'm totally off base.
[2401.04 --> 2402.04]  Straw poll.me.
[2402.38 --> 2402.98]  What do you think?
[2404.18 --> 2404.86]  S-my-D?
[2405.12 --> 2405.44]  Oh.
[2407.92 --> 2409.38]  About a tweet, I think.
[2409.72 --> 2410.90]  Like, is it horribly offensive?
[2411.40 --> 2412.30]  I think it's okay.
[2412.36 --> 2413.32]  I think it's pretty creative.
[2413.86 --> 2414.42]  Pretty creative?
[2414.70 --> 2414.88]  Yeah.
[2414.88 --> 2419.32]  I laughed when I saw that.
[2419.50 --> 2419.80]  Did you?
[2420.00 --> 2420.28]  Yeah.
[2420.84 --> 2423.74]  You think of reason.
[2423.74 --> 2425.10]  Well, I didn't even think that's.
[2425.84 --> 2429.92]  I wouldn't tweet that, but I don't think it's that bad.
[2430.48 --> 2430.94]  Yeah, okay.
[2431.26 --> 2433.08]  Yeah, like, I probably wouldn't tweet that either.
[2433.32 --> 2436.16]  Like, it's a little bit too far, but, like, I don't think it's that bad.
[2437.16 --> 2437.48]  Creative.
[2440.56 --> 2440.96]  Oppressive.
[2444.88 --> 2445.80]  Oppressive.
[2445.80 --> 2446.00]  Oppressive.
[2446.28 --> 2446.36]  Oppressive.
[2446.36 --> 2446.64]  Oppressive.
[2446.64 --> 2446.72]  Oppressive.
[2446.72 --> 2447.24]  Oppressive.
[2447.24 --> 2454.24]  So the options are going to be creative slash funny, oppressive slash mean, or turnip slash turnip.
[2455.32 --> 2463.12]  Just to make sure that we have all the bases covered, and then we will come back to that fairly soon.
[2463.20 --> 2464.32]  Can you guys hear the train?
[2464.84 --> 2465.88]  Do you think they can hear the train?
[2466.72 --> 2467.08]  Probably.
[2467.30 --> 2468.24]  I can't hear if I'm here.
[2468.66 --> 2471.10]  That thing is so annoying when we're trying to film.
[2471.48 --> 2474.60]  The train will go by, like, right in front of our freaking building.
[2474.98 --> 2475.16]  Yeah.
[2475.16 --> 2476.82]  Then we just have to wait until it's gone.
[2477.56 --> 2478.72]  Oh, God, it's frustrating.
[2478.92 --> 2479.54]  Crackling a bit.
[2479.62 --> 2481.08]  There's not a ton I can do about that.
[2481.26 --> 2481.60]  Sorry.
[2481.94 --> 2482.20]  Mm-hmm.
[2484.86 --> 2485.22]  Yes.
[2485.38 --> 2486.70]  Yes, they can hear the train.
[2487.08 --> 2487.36]  Okay.
[2487.36 --> 2490.36]  Everyone just wanted very quickly, very vocally.
[2490.60 --> 2493.20]  They can definitely, for sure, hear the train.
[2493.44 --> 2497.14]  It's fine when we're on, like, the WAN show and stuff, but when we're trying to record,
[2497.28 --> 2501.52]  like, I'll be trying to do a review, and I'll get into, like, a really serious part where
[2501.52 --> 2503.16]  I'm trying to be all, like, stern and stuff.
[2503.50 --> 2504.00]  Dr-dr-dr-dr-dr.
[2504.28 --> 2504.76]  Brr!
[2504.98 --> 2508.02]  It's just like, God damn.
[2508.26 --> 2508.94]  Oh, man.
[2509.00 --> 2512.18]  It'll be, like, one of my best takes, too, and then it just completely fails.
[2512.66 --> 2513.60]  Sucks so much.
[2516.06 --> 2516.90]  What's next?
[2517.66 --> 2517.88]  Oh.
[2517.88 --> 2520.02]  You want to talk about the next battery failure thing?
[2520.78 --> 2528.16]  Booster tells people to stop riding its electric skateboard after battery mode functions.
[2529.90 --> 2530.34]  Ridiculous.
[2530.46 --> 2531.78]  So, okay.
[2532.34 --> 2535.06]  I feel like 2016 is, like, the year of product failures.
[2535.18 --> 2535.28]  Okay.
[2535.28 --> 2536.14]  I talked to Nick.
[2536.28 --> 2536.74]  Nick Light.
[2537.42 --> 2537.60]  Yeah.
[2537.60 --> 2540.96]  I said, oh, why are there so many things that catch on fire?
[2541.92 --> 2543.74]  Their battery, what's wrong with their battery?
[2543.74 --> 2549.48]  He says, oh, maybe because of the people are trying to do waterproof, so they keep the heat
[2549.48 --> 2555.40]  in the battery itself so the heat doesn't go out, so it might cause a fire.
[2555.62 --> 2556.58]  I don't know if it's true.
[2557.14 --> 2557.50]  Yeah.
[2559.64 --> 2560.78]  I think there's a few things.
[2560.82 --> 2562.74]  That's probably one of them, to be fair.
[2563.02 --> 2567.94]  I think part of it is they're just trying to do more with less, or they're trying to do
[2567.94 --> 2569.50]  more with the same amount that they had before.
[2569.60 --> 2570.78]  They're trying to draw more from the battery.
[2570.86 --> 2572.52]  They're trying to pack more into a smaller space.
[2572.52 --> 2572.88]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2572.88 --> 2577.64]  When you try to pack more into a smaller space, the, I'm going to really screw this
[2577.64 --> 2577.84]  up.
[2577.96 --> 2581.98]  There's better, look into, like, the science of batteries, but you start to lose the bit
[2581.98 --> 2585.30]  that's in the middle, and then things transfer improperly, and you can overload them, and
[2585.30 --> 2586.44]  there's problems.
[2586.90 --> 2592.94]  I think, also, there's been a heightened awareness since the Note 7 issue, and if someone's battery
[2592.94 --> 2597.30]  catches on fire or some crap like that, they're starting to report it more and sort of just
[2597.30 --> 2597.36]  Yeah, yeah.
[2597.58 --> 2598.32]  Yeah, that's true.
[2598.32 --> 2602.90]  Ignore it, because the Note 7 made the whole world way more interested in this stuff, which
[2602.90 --> 2603.28]  is good.
[2603.34 --> 2603.90]  It's a good thing.
[2603.94 --> 2605.00]  I'm not complaining about that.
[2605.00 --> 2611.80]  On two separate occasions, a lithium battery cell has vented inside the battery pack of
[2611.80 --> 2613.62]  the second-generation boosted board.
[2613.96 --> 2621.14]  The battery enclosure is a fire-retardant composite and worked as designed to contain the cell failure.
[2621.30 --> 2622.86]  So, they did a really good job.
[2622.86 --> 2625.74]  Fortunately, no one was injured and no property was damaged.
[2625.90 --> 2629.86]  Our engineering team is conducting a thorough investigation, and we will update everyone
[2629.86 --> 2630.52]  with the results.
[2630.88 --> 2636.16]  So, their fire-retardant housing stuff is doing great, but things are still catching on fire.
[2636.34 --> 2638.72]  So, they're looking into it, and they're going to try to solve the problem, which is
[2638.72 --> 2638.88]  good.
[2639.50 --> 2640.98]  Good for boosted board, I guess.
[2642.10 --> 2644.84]  I'm going to look at the results.
[2644.84 --> 2648.32]  Kind of as I expected.
[2648.98 --> 2651.62]  64% of people said that it was creative and funny.
[2651.92 --> 2658.86]  30% of people said turnip slash turnip, so they probably just don't care at all.
[2658.96 --> 2661.48]  And then 6% of people said oppressive slash mean.
[2664.74 --> 2665.58]  I don't know.
[2666.00 --> 2667.84]  I don't think it was a...
[2667.84 --> 2674.58]  I think it's maybe something that, like, you say amongst yourselves at Razor, maybe
[2674.58 --> 2675.62]  not something that you tweet.
[2676.16 --> 2681.32]  But then Razor's always been a little bit, like, younger and edgier than a lot of other
[2681.32 --> 2681.80]  brands.
[2682.64 --> 2686.36]  Not quite as, like, corporate walk kind of deal, you know what I mean?
[2686.90 --> 2687.70]  So, I don't know.
[2688.36 --> 2690.56]  I really don't think it's that bad.
[2692.06 --> 2694.18]  Who would find this offensive?
[2696.36 --> 2696.76]  Female.
[2697.84 --> 2700.30]  What is it?
[2701.54 --> 2702.76]  I mean, potentially.
[2703.52 --> 2703.96]  Yeah.
[2704.90 --> 2706.40]  Or Mac.
[2706.72 --> 2707.20]  Apple.
[2707.50 --> 2707.86]  Apple.
[2708.12 --> 2708.30]  Yeah.
[2708.62 --> 2709.74]  I don't, like, I don't know.
[2709.96 --> 2711.72]  I don't think it's just...
[2711.72 --> 2717.60]  I think it's interesting to look at it as a just anti-female thing.
[2717.70 --> 2718.44]  I think that's very odd.
[2718.44 --> 2719.94]  No, she didn't do that that way.
[2720.42 --> 2722.68]  No, yeah, because that could be said to literally anyone.
[2722.86 --> 2723.14]  Yeah.
[2723.94 --> 2725.12]  Just SD card.
[2725.92 --> 2726.92]  SD card stuff.
[2726.92 --> 2727.92]  So...
[2727.92 --> 2728.30]  Yeah.
[2728.38 --> 2728.84]  I don't know.
[2728.96 --> 2730.08]  I don't think it's a big deal.
[2730.42 --> 2731.80]  I think people are overreacting.
[2731.80 --> 2736.00]  I don't think it was the smartest thing to tweet.
[2736.72 --> 2737.04]  Yeah.
[2737.20 --> 2739.50]  But, yeah, I don't think it was all that big of a deal.
[2739.64 --> 2740.02]  Oh, yeah.
[2740.12 --> 2741.36]  Twitch chat's on screen again.
[2741.52 --> 2742.12]  Oh, geez.
[2742.48 --> 2742.90]  There we go.
[2742.98 --> 2743.56]  No, it's not you.
[2744.22 --> 2744.64]  It's there.
[2744.70 --> 2745.66]  Oh, you just want to see it?
[2745.72 --> 2745.86]  Yeah.
[2746.10 --> 2746.64]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2749.14 --> 2749.54]  Hyper...
[2749.54 --> 2750.46]  Hyper Beast confirmed.
[2750.62 --> 2751.52]  This thing is cool.
[2751.86 --> 2752.24]  Oh!
[2752.38 --> 2752.66]  Oh, yeah.
[2752.74 --> 2753.20]  I saw that.
[2753.28 --> 2754.00]  Yeah, the case.
[2754.10 --> 2754.50]  Yeah, it's cool.
[2754.54 --> 2755.12]  Do you...
[2755.12 --> 2756.92]  Are you interested in this thing or do you want to model it yourself?
[2756.92 --> 2758.42]  I don't want flat.
[2758.76 --> 2759.54]  I want 3D...
[2759.54 --> 2759.92]  You want flat?
[2759.92 --> 2760.42]  Oh!
[2760.42 --> 2762.64]  3D case.
[2763.08 --> 2763.34]  Okay.
[2763.52 --> 2765.02]  I want, like, it look...
[2765.02 --> 2765.78]  Like, it pop up.
[2766.20 --> 2767.62]  The color's really cool.
[2767.72 --> 2768.42]  I like this color.
[2768.90 --> 2769.92]  And I like the design.
[2770.44 --> 2772.68]  Looks really fancy.
[2773.10 --> 2773.92]  But I want...
[2775.26 --> 2777.06]  I want it, like, not just...
[2777.06 --> 2778.92]  Oh, like, the bomb...
[2779.52 --> 2780.50]  The bomb case.
[2780.84 --> 2781.04]  Yeah.
[2781.10 --> 2782.36]  Not just, like, regular case.
[2782.50 --> 2783.40]  I want it to look different.
[2783.70 --> 2784.02]  Okay.
[2784.20 --> 2786.52]  Or you can make, like, a volcano case.
[2786.88 --> 2787.66]  Volcano case.
[2787.68 --> 2788.18]  That's cool.
[2788.18 --> 2789.08]  That'd be pretty sweet.
[2789.92 --> 2790.08]  Yeah.
[2790.56 --> 2792.26]  So this thing is very cool.
[2793.68 --> 2795.94]  NZXT logo glows blue on the side.
[2796.06 --> 2800.48]  You've got the Hyper Beast art on the front and the left-hand side.
[2800.70 --> 2802.38]  And maybe the top?
[2802.46 --> 2804.28]  I haven't seen a picture of the top yet.
[2805.40 --> 2805.96]  I don't see.
[2805.96 --> 2806.02]  No.
[2806.02 --> 2806.34]  Yeah.
[2806.56 --> 2808.02]  I don't see a picture of the top.
[2808.40 --> 2814.88]  The back, or, like, the right side, I guess you'd say, has H440 Hyper Beast printed on it.
[2814.88 --> 2820.02]  And just a big, clean panel, which actually looks pretty good, considering the rest of it's all inked out.
[2820.44 --> 2820.70]  Yeah.
[2820.84 --> 2821.38]  Looks really cool.
[2821.46 --> 2825.12]  Production, there will be 1,337 units, which is pretty leet.
[2826.74 --> 2827.56]  Yeah, it's cool.
[2827.68 --> 2831.44]  It's based on the M4A1S CSGO weapon skin.
[2831.44 --> 2836.92]  I think it was made with the, yeah, Brock Hoffer, the graphic artist behind the Hyper Beast, which is very cool.
[2837.30 --> 2840.96]  He did the M4A1 weapon skin featuring the Beast.
[2841.34 --> 2841.46]  Yeah.
[2841.90 --> 2842.30]  $200.
[2842.98 --> 2843.30]  $200.
[2843.70 --> 2845.76]  Based on the H440, which is a wicked case.
[2846.56 --> 2847.38]  Nice case.
[2847.92 --> 2848.42]  Looks cool.
[2848.82 --> 2849.00]  Yeah.
[2849.12 --> 2849.72]  Looks really good.
[2850.12 --> 2850.98]  I like this a lot.
[2851.26 --> 2852.42]  I hope this does well.
[2852.84 --> 2859.24]  I hope they sell all 1,337 of them, and then I hope people keep on doing this, because I think that's very cool.
[2859.58 --> 2867.44]  If I was interested in buying a case like this right now, instead of just getting, like, a gray one or something, I would definitely get this.
[2867.56 --> 2868.42]  This thing looks awesome.
[2868.60 --> 2868.78]  Yeah.
[2868.88 --> 2870.74]  I don't want my case just a case.
[2870.74 --> 2875.14]  I want it also be, like, an art to display in my house.
[2875.30 --> 2875.50]  Yeah.
[2875.78 --> 2875.94]  Yeah.
[2876.04 --> 2876.22]  Yeah.
[2876.22 --> 2876.62]  Yeah.
[2878.50 --> 2880.32]  So that was rather cool.
[2881.28 --> 2883.10]  Wii U production is ending this week.
[2883.82 --> 2885.72]  There's not really a ton else to say there.
[2887.18 --> 2889.46]  The GameCube sold 21 million consoles.
[2889.60 --> 2891.74]  N64 sold 32 million consoles.
[2892.18 --> 2895.34]  The Wii sold 101 million consoles.
[2895.34 --> 2900.24]  And then Wii U went down to 13.36 million consoles.
[2900.46 --> 2901.38]  Less than the GameCube.
[2901.74 --> 2903.02]  Less than the Nintendo 64.
[2903.02 --> 2908.48]  And then not even anywhere close to the original Wii.
[2908.56 --> 2910.54]  There's a number of reasons to why that happened.
[2910.86 --> 2913.68]  One of them being literally out of my entire friend group.
[2913.76 --> 2918.92]  I was the only person that knew that the Wii U wasn't just an accessory for the original Wii.
[2918.92 --> 2922.58]  So their marketing was really bad.
[2923.36 --> 2925.34]  And the naming was very bad.
[2925.46 --> 2926.76]  Wii versus Wii U.
[2927.02 --> 2928.32]  Like, it's not clear.
[2928.44 --> 2930.22]  It actually does kind of sound like an add-on.
[2930.38 --> 2932.98]  That's another thing that I worry about with the Nintendo Switch.
[2933.78 --> 2935.48]  It doesn't sound like a console name.
[2936.26 --> 2936.48]  Yeah.
[2936.64 --> 2938.36]  It sounds like an accessory name.
[2938.36 --> 2939.46]  I never tried Wii.
[2940.02 --> 2940.76]  So I don't...
[2940.76 --> 2941.80]  You never tried Wii or Wii U?
[2942.30 --> 2943.26]  None of them.
[2943.26 --> 2944.10]  Okay.
[2944.46 --> 2944.62]  No.
[2944.84 --> 2945.40]  So I...
[2945.40 --> 2947.32]  I don't like they are good at that.
[2947.56 --> 2947.76]  Yeah.
[2948.08 --> 2948.66]  Now, okay.
[2948.96 --> 2950.30]  Totally have a topic for you.
[2950.40 --> 2952.32]  I have no idea what the heck is going on.
[2952.70 --> 2953.94]  Adobe Publishing Panel.
[2954.00 --> 2954.16]  Oh.
[2954.88 --> 2955.40]  So...
[2955.40 --> 2957.48]  Okay.
[2957.56 --> 2958.12]  Let me open it.
[2959.44 --> 2965.72]  So Adobe, they have a new feature that when you export your video, you can...
[2965.72 --> 2972.72]  Social Publishing to your media, social media, like YouTube...
[2972.72 --> 2974.04]  Let's go through this.
[2974.18 --> 2974.44]  It's easy.
[2974.78 --> 2975.52]  You can...
[2975.52 --> 2976.20]  YouTube, Facebook.
[2976.32 --> 2977.12]  Yeah, YouTube, Facebook.
[2977.34 --> 2977.78]  Behance.
[2977.92 --> 2978.64]  I don't know what that actually is.
[2978.64 --> 2979.76]  Yeah, some other...
[2979.76 --> 2981.62]  And you can also hashtag.
[2982.28 --> 2982.90]  That's cool.
[2985.04 --> 2985.90]  So you can...
[2985.90 --> 2986.04]  Okay.
[2986.20 --> 2987.36]  This picture is too small.
[2987.72 --> 2987.80]  Okay.
[2988.24 --> 2988.96]  There you go.
[2989.10 --> 2989.28]  Here.
[2989.40 --> 2990.04]  We can...
[2990.04 --> 2990.46]  Oh, there.
[2990.58 --> 2990.72]  There.
[2990.82 --> 2991.82]  We can look at your screen.
[2992.52 --> 2992.74]  Oh.
[2992.84 --> 2994.16]  I don't know why you're this zoomed in.
[2994.16 --> 2995.60]  So...
[2995.60 --> 2996.40]  Because this...
[2996.40 --> 2997.32]  So you can tag.
[2997.42 --> 2998.26]  Oh, I see.
[2998.30 --> 2998.54]  You can tag.
[2998.70 --> 2999.46]  Like how you do...
[2999.46 --> 3001.68]  When you upload videos on YouTube, that's how you tag.
[3001.78 --> 3002.44]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3002.56 --> 3002.68]  YouTube Publishing Series.
[3002.68 --> 3005.88]  So you can do title, description, and...
[3005.88 --> 3011.86]  Choose all the resolution you want to export.
[3012.24 --> 3014.42]  So you go directly to YouTube, I think.
[3015.16 --> 3015.60]  And I guess...
[3015.60 --> 3016.52]  But I don't know how steady this is going to be.
[3016.52 --> 3017.70]  You'd link your channel somehow?
[3017.70 --> 3018.30]  Yeah, I think so.
[3018.34 --> 3019.62]  You can choose from the left side.
[3019.62 --> 3020.86]  I don't know if I would trust Adobe.
[3021.72 --> 3023.98]  I mean, I would still do...
[3023.98 --> 3025.26]  Export, upload.
[3025.48 --> 3026.22]  Yeah, exactly.
[3026.38 --> 3026.96]  Like I would do...
[3026.96 --> 3027.84]  Okay, I would do Twitter.
[3028.14 --> 3028.98]  I would do Instagram.
[3029.46 --> 3030.78]  I would do stuff like that.
[3031.02 --> 3033.18]  I don't know if I would do YouTube.
[3033.70 --> 3036.22]  Because like the upload and processing time and stuff takes so long.
[3036.34 --> 3036.84]  And Adobe...
[3036.84 --> 3039.24]  Like the amount of times that we have our media encoder and stuff crash.
[3039.24 --> 3039.96]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3040.06 --> 3040.56]  That's good.
[3040.60 --> 3041.34]  That's one concern.
[3041.48 --> 3046.84]  Because what we do here is we export to Cineform, transcode, and upload.
[3047.50 --> 3055.42]  And if you fail, say, if there's one error in a video and you take like two hours or an hour to the last step, you have to redo it again.
[3055.42 --> 3059.74]  So, it's just...
[3059.74 --> 3060.40]  I don't know.
[3061.20 --> 3063.28]  It might be a cool feature for some people.
[3063.74 --> 3068.04]  But for me, for us, I think we probably just do what we're doing right now.
[3068.10 --> 3070.18]  Just export by itself and upload it.
[3070.36 --> 3070.48]  Yeah.
[3070.48 --> 3073.38]  But it's a really cool feature because I've never seen that before.
[3073.58 --> 3074.54]  They can...
[3074.54 --> 3075.78]  You can do everything.
[3076.44 --> 3076.82]  Just one.
[3077.28 --> 3079.78]  Someone in chat just asked, what does Dennis do?
[3079.96 --> 3081.44]  I guess it has kind of been four months.
[3081.56 --> 3083.44]  Well, it's been like four months since you've been around.
[3083.56 --> 3087.46]  So, there might be some people that don't actually know you that well anymore.
[3087.60 --> 3088.86]  Oh, so I...
[3088.86 --> 3095.58]  I've been working here since 2015.
[3096.04 --> 3098.06]  Other than the like four months that you were there.
[3098.06 --> 3098.42]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3098.42 --> 3098.74]  Yeah.
[3098.74 --> 3099.78]  But before...
[3099.78 --> 3102.32]  I started here 2015 summertime.
[3103.10 --> 3104.72]  So, I was from Taiwan.
[3105.70 --> 3108.62]  I added TechWiki channel.
[3109.20 --> 3110.04]  I'm a video editor.
[3110.80 --> 3112.32]  So, he edits all the videos on TechWiki.
[3112.38 --> 3114.84]  And sometimes I will be on LTT.
[3115.14 --> 3115.60]  Oh, not on.
[3115.74 --> 3116.80]  I shoot and edit.
[3117.30 --> 3119.76]  And sometimes for super fun.
[3119.82 --> 3120.50]  Channel super fun.
[3121.52 --> 3122.66]  Sometimes I'm on here.
[3123.16 --> 3124.22]  Very, very rare.
[3125.18 --> 3125.40]  Yeah.
[3125.40 --> 3128.98]  And mostly I do...
[3130.04 --> 3130.98]  Look what happened.
[3131.26 --> 3131.98]  You went to the line.
[3132.14 --> 3132.90]  Oh, okay.
[3133.38 --> 3133.58]  So, I...
[3133.58 --> 3134.06]  That's okay.
[3134.20 --> 3134.66]  I fixed it.
[3135.30 --> 3137.08]  Well, I'm a video editor here.
[3137.44 --> 3141.10]  So, if you haven't seen me before, nice to meet you.
[3141.32 --> 3141.54]  Yeah.
[3141.70 --> 3142.22]  There we go.
[3142.36 --> 3142.58]  Okay.
[3142.58 --> 3147.52]  So, the Samsung kiosks and airports.
[3147.62 --> 3148.86]  We actually talked about that last week.
[3148.98 --> 3152.00]  But if you bring your Note 7 to an airport, you will be okay.
[3152.30 --> 3154.74]  They can exchange your phone at a kiosk in the airport.
[3154.88 --> 3156.06]  You don't actually have to leave it there.
[3156.06 --> 3161.70]  And then, boom, Samsung were calling almost 2.8 million washers due to impact injuries.
[3161.88 --> 3163.38]  You had read about this, right?
[3163.62 --> 3163.86]  Okay.
[3164.16 --> 3164.56]  What do you think?
[3165.72 --> 3170.58]  The following report are impact injuries that include broken jaw from a washer.
[3171.18 --> 3171.98]  Broken jaw.
[3172.52 --> 3172.74]  Yeah.
[3173.22 --> 3175.56]  So, that washing machine, you can see in the thumbnail there.
[3175.58 --> 3177.46]  I'm not going to play the video because it would suck for everyone.
[3178.06 --> 3180.46]  But that is torn the hell apart.
[3180.64 --> 3180.80]  Okay.
[3180.80 --> 3184.64]  You know how strong the washing machine, when they spin?
[3184.88 --> 3185.16]  Yeah.
[3185.50 --> 3188.24]  And tapping can shake, like, very, very hard.
[3188.36 --> 3188.54]  Yeah.
[3188.66 --> 3194.76]  Because one time, like, I used to live with a homestead and their washing machine was broken.
[3195.38 --> 3196.98]  And, like, you just can't stop it.
[3197.08 --> 3198.88]  And you just keep going, keep going, keep going.
[3199.00 --> 3202.36]  And you don't know, like, you should unplug it or, because it's, like, moving.
[3202.62 --> 3202.80]  Yeah.
[3202.92 --> 3206.64]  And when you try to hold it, it's still, like, it's, like, holding you.
[3206.96 --> 3207.18]  Yeah.
[3207.32 --> 3209.10]  Moving you with the washing machine.
[3209.10 --> 3212.30]  Well, your weight compared to a washing machine is not going to be all that helpful.
[3213.18 --> 3216.76]  They're recalling 2.8 million top load washing machines.
[3216.88 --> 3218.18]  So, it's top load washing machines.
[3219.20 --> 3222.30]  And I think it's 34 affected models.
[3222.62 --> 3229.52]  So, if you have a top load Samsung washing machine, check out, I think this will hopefully be a list of the models.
[3230.42 --> 3231.06]  Let's see.
[3233.36 --> 3237.14]  Consumer Product Safety Commission, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission.
[3237.14 --> 3240.22]  They have all the models listed right here.
[3240.42 --> 3242.34]  This is going to be annoying to read on stream.
[3242.44 --> 3247.22]  But if you have a top loading Samsung dryer washing machine.
[3247.96 --> 3248.68]  Washing machine.
[3248.74 --> 3256.14]  But what you have to do first, when you are doing your laundry, you put your, all the clothes evenly in the washing machine.
[3256.62 --> 3257.00]  That's it.
[3257.10 --> 3257.60]  Everyone should know.
[3257.60 --> 3262.50]  Because if it's, if it's uneven, when they spin, they can be like that.
[3263.32 --> 3264.62]  Dennis washing machine tips?
[3265.00 --> 3265.22]  Yeah.
[3265.62 --> 3266.06]  Just tips.
[3266.40 --> 3267.00]  Everyone should know.
[3267.80 --> 3268.82]  So, don't just pull in.
[3268.94 --> 3270.74]  Just, you need to make a little bit.
[3270.74 --> 3273.22]  You'll never believe what happens when I add.
[3274.40 --> 3276.26]  And then you just, everyone has to click on the video.
[3276.60 --> 3277.68]  Just the greatest clickbait.
[3278.30 --> 3278.52]  Oh.
[3278.74 --> 3279.72]  Dennis washing machine tips.
[3279.78 --> 3280.24]  I would wash.
[3280.60 --> 3281.58]  That would be the best.
[3282.10 --> 3282.76]  That's your machine.
[3283.02 --> 3287.08]  Microsoft has lost over 300 million browser users in 2016.
[3287.42 --> 3289.72]  Mostly to Chrome tracking site shows.
[3289.92 --> 3291.50]  I'm not super surprised.
[3292.18 --> 3292.46]  Oh.
[3292.72 --> 3294.16]  Microsoft getting wrecked.
[3294.24 --> 3294.66]  Again.
[3294.82 --> 3295.68]  There's Satay Nadella.
[3296.62 --> 3297.28]  Poor guy.
[3297.28 --> 3298.28]  Whoa.
[3299.40 --> 3299.86]  Here we go.
[3299.98 --> 3301.16]  So, this chart right here.
[3301.18 --> 3301.20]  Whoa.
[3301.88 --> 3302.26]  Let me see.
[3302.38 --> 3302.76]  What's up?
[3302.94 --> 3307.34]  This chart right here shows Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and
[3307.34 --> 3307.62]  others.
[3308.04 --> 3314.22]  So, Firefox kind of took a dip there for a little bit in, like, the summer, which is kind of
[3314.22 --> 3314.48]  funny.
[3314.90 --> 3320.04]  And now that it's out of the summer, the Firefox is, I don't know why it's coming out of hibernation
[3320.04 --> 3322.20]  in the winter, but it's starting to come back up, which is pretty cool.
[3322.60 --> 3326.20]  Internet Explorer has just been absolutely tanking.
[3326.20 --> 3330.70]  Most people are sitting around, like, 5%.
[3330.70 --> 3332.38]  Firefox is at, like, 10%.
[3332.38 --> 3336.16]  Internet Explorer is plummeting down to about 20%.
[3336.16 --> 3339.70]  And Chrome is just dominating everything.
[3339.96 --> 3342.76]  More people are using Internet Explorer than Firefox.
[3343.44 --> 3343.90]  Yes.
[3344.16 --> 3344.34]  Oh.
[3345.48 --> 3346.88]  I used to use Firefox.
[3347.32 --> 3347.64]  Yeah.
[3347.98 --> 3349.72]  Then I switched to Chrome.
[3350.10 --> 3351.14]  I love Firefox.
[3351.14 --> 3353.40]  There's just so many problems right now.
[3353.62 --> 3354.40]  I just, ugh.
[3355.46 --> 3359.02]  Crashes and other terrible, terrible things.
[3359.52 --> 3361.66]  We need to do sponsor spots.
[3361.74 --> 3362.46]  Give me a second here.
[3362.52 --> 3362.68]  Yep.
[3364.16 --> 3364.78]  Do-do-do.
[3365.08 --> 3365.70]  Do-do-do-do.
[3366.12 --> 3367.42]  Dollar Shave Club.
[3368.14 --> 3368.64]  Oh.
[3368.64 --> 3370.48]  Every time I do one of these.
[3370.58 --> 3372.22]  Look, I get this stupid thing.
[3372.38 --> 3373.00]  Do you see that?
[3373.58 --> 3374.80]  See the little patch right there?
[3375.42 --> 3377.06]  Hair doesn't grow, like, right there.
[3377.52 --> 3377.82]  Why?
[3378.04 --> 3378.60]  I don't know.
[3379.34 --> 3382.66]  So, like, when I don't shave for a while, it even just looks really dumb.
[3383.50 --> 3384.24]  You can draw.
[3384.62 --> 3385.48]  You can use Sharpie.
[3385.74 --> 3387.26]  Just Sharpie my beard in?
[3387.26 --> 3388.34]  Just kind of color it.
[3388.40 --> 3389.26]  Wonderful idea.
[3389.44 --> 3390.62]  I'm going to Sharpie my beard in.
[3391.02 --> 3392.48]  Or I could just join.
[3392.58 --> 3394.58]  Well, I guess I'm actually a part of Dollar Shave Club.
[3394.70 --> 3397.42]  But I could get my razors to my door.
[3397.64 --> 3398.24]  And I could order.
[3398.34 --> 3399.64]  If I ordered now, I'd get a month for free.
[3399.70 --> 3401.10]  But I'm already a member, so I don't really get that.
[3401.14 --> 3404.58]  But if you join today, you will get your first month free Dollar Shave Club.
[3404.72 --> 3408.72]  And once you try dollarshaveclub.com, you'll be a proud member like millions of others.
[3408.82 --> 3411.02]  They deliver amazing razors directly to your door.
[3411.02 --> 3414.80]  And membership means that you can get a fresh blade all the time.
[3414.80 --> 3422.30]  Instead of, like, when I was going to BCIT and I used the same one-use razor for, I think it was, like, two years.
[3423.18 --> 3424.80]  That thing was, like, literally rusty.
[3425.16 --> 3425.90]  That's disgusting.
[3426.20 --> 3427.56]  It was, yeah, it was pretty gross.
[3427.72 --> 3430.48]  You can use it with Dr. Carver's shave butter, which is actually kind of cool.
[3430.56 --> 3432.42]  Because it goes on clear, so you can, like, see where your hair is.
[3432.42 --> 3433.60]  I never use shave butter.
[3434.06 --> 3434.38]  You don't?
[3434.44 --> 3436.08]  It might be good for you guys because I don't have beard.
[3436.24 --> 3437.16]  I just shave in the shower.
[3437.98 --> 3439.56]  I blind shave every time.
[3439.64 --> 3441.12]  I don't even use, like, a shower mirror or anything.
[3441.20 --> 3442.28]  I'm just like, yeah, it's about there.
[3442.78 --> 3443.56]  Because I don't, yeah.
[3443.56 --> 3444.82]  And then I trim this bit.
[3444.90 --> 3448.48]  But anyways, they ship to the U.S., Canada, and Australia.
[3449.18 --> 3453.18]  So head over to dollarshaveclub.com and give them a try for free.
[3453.38 --> 3454.60]  I want to give a recommendation.
[3454.94 --> 3456.54]  They're hair wax.
[3457.08 --> 3457.42]  Hair gel.
[3457.42 --> 3457.68]  Okay.
[3457.88 --> 3458.40]  Hair gel.
[3458.76 --> 3459.90]  I don't use anything.
[3460.16 --> 3461.12]  Which one do you use?
[3461.20 --> 3462.04]  They have a bunch of different kinds.
[3462.84 --> 3463.54]  The white one.
[3463.76 --> 3464.26]  The white one.
[3464.68 --> 3465.34]  The cream?
[3465.56 --> 3465.98]  Not cream.
[3466.24 --> 3466.62]  No, okay.
[3466.94 --> 3467.48]  In the thing.
[3468.16 --> 3468.64]  Wax.
[3468.76 --> 3469.12]  Wax.
[3469.36 --> 3469.88]  Hair wax.
[3469.98 --> 3470.10]  Okay.
[3470.28 --> 3470.98]  Hair wax.
[3470.98 --> 3472.34]  Yeah, that is really good.
[3472.44 --> 3473.40]  Are you using it right now?
[3473.56 --> 3474.14]  No, I didn't.
[3474.24 --> 3474.58]  No, okay.
[3474.62 --> 3475.68]  I was going to, but I forgot.
[3475.92 --> 3476.12]  Okay.
[3476.28 --> 3483.32]  So every time I use hair wax, I need to be, like, easier to wash when I find my hands.
[3483.56 --> 3486.14]  Because some of them, other brands are really hard to wash out.
[3486.22 --> 3486.70]  Wash out.
[3487.28 --> 3490.14]  And they stay and make you look good.
[3490.14 --> 3491.92]  All right.
[3491.92 --> 3491.94]  All right.
[3492.00 --> 3492.42]  There you go.
[3494.06 --> 3494.38]  Okay.
[3494.58 --> 3498.06]  So next one is Squarespace.
[3498.76 --> 3501.02]  At least, you know, you should be Squarespace.
[3501.24 --> 3501.88]  Yes, it is.
[3502.42 --> 3504.42]  24-7 live chat and email support.
[3505.40 --> 3505.52]  Fantastic.
[3505.74 --> 3506.66]  It's always been that way.
[3506.72 --> 3508.14]  You can get a hold of them anytime you need.
[3508.20 --> 3509.00]  It's $12 a month.
[3509.24 --> 3513.00]  If you sign up for a year, you get a domain for free just thrown in, which is cool.
[3513.00 --> 3514.02]  It has responsive design.
[3514.02 --> 3526.94]  So if you're looking at it on my phone or Dennis' phone or my laptop or Dennis' ginormous, massive, huge laptop or a computer or a console or whatever tablet, it will all look and work fine.
[3527.02 --> 3529.52]  They have commerce modules so you can sell stuff, which is fantastic.
[3529.52 --> 3533.84]  Or the cover page feature, which is Linus' favorite thing.
[3533.94 --> 3539.82]  When everything is just on one website and you just scroll through it and everything is there, Linus loves that.
[3539.90 --> 3546.28]  If you have an example of a cover page style website that is just one page, tweet it to Linus Tech.
[3546.40 --> 3550.60]  He will absolutely just absolutely love that so much.
[3550.68 --> 3557.14]  Everyone can publish content in Apple News format directly from the Squarespace blog module, which is great.
[3557.14 --> 3559.50]  It opens it up to millions of potential readers.
[3559.92 --> 3567.20]  And you can start a trial today with no credit card required and use offer code WAN for 10% off of your first purchase.
[3567.44 --> 3568.22]  So head over there.
[3570.54 --> 3571.10]  FreshBooks.
[3571.30 --> 3572.16]  Then we have FreshBooks.
[3573.22 --> 3583.20]  FreshBooks is the easy way to get paid faster and create invoices faster and expense things more easily and faster and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3583.20 --> 3592.30]  You can try FreshBooks completely free for 30 days at freshbooks.com slash WAN and make sure that you put WAN in the how did you hear about us section.
[3593.30 --> 3600.20]  FreshBooks has a timesheet function so you can manage your expenses and keep track of who owes you what, which is helpful.
[3600.64 --> 3606.48]  Both my parents have ran a number of businesses and keeping track of that stuff can be really, really frustrating because people don't like paying right away.
[3606.72 --> 3609.88]  They like terms where they can pay in 30 days or whatever else.
[3609.88 --> 3610.68]  It's really annoying.
[3611.04 --> 3617.08]  Also has a feature where you can see if your clients have looked at your invoice, when they looked at your invoice for the first time at least.
[3617.08 --> 3621.92]  The mobile app has all the functionality of their desktop version, which is great, so you can take FreshBooks wherever you go.
[3622.20 --> 3626.32]  If you have any questions, you can reach out to their support where you'll speak to a real human.
[3626.48 --> 3629.22]  No phone tree, no escalations, no return calls.
[3629.44 --> 3631.10]  Just pick up the phone.
[3631.36 --> 3631.70]  It's all good.
[3632.06 --> 3633.26]  FreshBooks.com slash WAN.
[3633.34 --> 3635.10]  Enter WAN in the how do you hear about us section.
[3635.42 --> 3637.72]  And they just got a mobile card reader, which is cool.
[3638.68 --> 3638.88]  Yeah.
[3639.84 --> 3640.24]  Yeah.
[3640.70 --> 3641.10]  Okay.
[3641.56 --> 3642.22]  There we go.
[3644.36 --> 3646.40]  What do we have left in terms of topics?
[3646.40 --> 3648.70]  VR headsets and herpes.
[3649.26 --> 3649.48]  What?
[3649.86 --> 3652.60]  So I was thinking about doing a video on this.
[3653.04 --> 3653.28]  What?
[3653.62 --> 3655.64]  What do I mean?
[3656.02 --> 3669.38]  I got as far as creating a new Word doc to write the script and coming up with some absolutely insane title to go along with VR headsets giving people herpes.
[3669.38 --> 3680.24]  But I decided not to because while I did think the information could be a little bit valuable, it seemed more valuable to just have on WAN show.
[3680.24 --> 3682.74]  And I didn't want to be that clickbaity and terrible.
[3682.94 --> 3685.02]  But I did think it would be pretty funny.
[3685.02 --> 3688.84]  So ocular herpes is actually a thing.
[3688.84 --> 3693.98]  And it can actually be transferred by sharing VR headsets.
[3694.10 --> 3701.04]  It can happen because stuff like your eyelashes can touch things that are in there and ocular herpes can be transferred.
[3701.04 --> 3706.10]  An anonymous chat transcript suggested that VR headsets were spreading herpes.
[3706.76 --> 3712.48]  There's a copy of the transcript and a tweet that go along with it right here.
[3712.94 --> 3720.18]  So you can see, hey Brad, whoever Brad is, ocular herpes is going around VR headsets, ones that are used to share with people.
[3720.84 --> 3723.80]  Blank game studio told us it's going around.
[3724.04 --> 3725.62]  Have to clean headsets regularly.
[3725.62 --> 3729.02]  And they're like, oh my god, WTF and stuff.
[3730.38 --> 3734.36]  Don't they have a replace thing you can just put on the side?
[3734.68 --> 3737.76]  So, yeah, but you can't replace the lenses every time.
[3738.50 --> 3746.92]  So I think kind of the deal right now is that people are trying to wipe down the lenses with like alcohol solutions and stuff to kill whatever is there.
[3747.46 --> 3754.54]  It's highly unlikely but also not impossible that someone could get ocular herpes through a VR headset.
[3754.54 --> 3763.24]  Says Todd Margolis, chair of the Washington University School of Medicine's Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences.
[3763.72 --> 3767.52]  The odds would be like the odds of transmitting herpes on toilet seats.
[3767.92 --> 3769.10]  Okay, so that's pretty low.
[3769.42 --> 3775.54]  General consensus is that VR developers should keep antimicrobial wipes or covers around show booths.
[3775.54 --> 3781.76]  Symptoms of ocular herpes include redness, discomfort, blurry vision, and light sensitivity.
[3781.92 --> 3783.22]  Herpe on your eyes.
[3783.34 --> 3788.08]  Mild forms clear up within a couple weeks and can be easily mistaken for pink eye.
[3788.94 --> 3789.26]  Oh.
[3791.46 --> 3791.78]  What?
[3791.88 --> 3792.46]  I have pink eye.
[3792.52 --> 3793.22]  Why did you point at me?
[3793.60 --> 3794.66]  I don't have pink eye.
[3794.92 --> 3795.68]  What was that?
[3796.68 --> 3798.24]  Let's spread this misinformation.
[3798.78 --> 3800.18]  Come on, let's show this points at me.
[3800.88 --> 3801.24]  Sure.
[3801.24 --> 3803.32]  So mean.
[3804.26 --> 3804.90]  Oh my goodness.
[3805.66 --> 3807.50]  I'm just showing the dock off apparently.
[3807.78 --> 3812.60]  Apple AirPods delayed indefinitely beyond original late October window.
[3813.42 --> 3815.78]  So that's pretty brutal.
[3816.62 --> 3819.86]  Hey, let's make a phone that need these wireless things and then nope.
[3820.92 --> 3821.62]  Get wrecked.
[3822.56 --> 3823.48]  You an iPhone guy?
[3823.64 --> 3824.04]  No, you're not.
[3824.10 --> 3825.00]  No, I'm not anymore.
[3825.20 --> 3825.94]  You used to be, right?
[3825.96 --> 3826.78]  I used to be an iPhone guy.
[3826.78 --> 3828.52]  Yeah, because you had that like super smashed one.
[3828.76 --> 3830.42]  Yeah, I switched to Samsung.
[3830.80 --> 3831.16]  Android.
[3831.48 --> 3832.00]  What do you think?
[3832.70 --> 3833.62]  I love it now.
[3833.94 --> 3834.18]  Really?
[3834.42 --> 3834.64]  Yeah.
[3835.68 --> 3837.76]  You can do, you have download folder.
[3837.94 --> 3839.86]  Now I know what you guys were talking about.
[3840.24 --> 3846.72]  Because I didn't know, I was using iPhone because you guys always say, oh, you guys don't have download folder or something.
[3846.72 --> 3849.76]  Because I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[3849.76 --> 3851.96]  I think you can get one if you jailbreak it, which is like really easy.
[3852.10 --> 3852.78]  I don't jailbreak.
[3852.92 --> 3853.86]  I don't jailbreak it.
[3854.84 --> 3859.02]  Because it might make your iPhone worse, right?
[3859.36 --> 3859.58]  No.
[3860.92 --> 3861.32]  Slower?
[3861.56 --> 3861.82]  No.
[3862.00 --> 3862.32]  Somehow.
[3862.74 --> 3862.96]  No?
[3863.38 --> 3864.16]  Yeah, somehow.
[3864.38 --> 3864.64]  No.
[3865.14 --> 3865.70]  Yes.
[3865.70 --> 3866.36]  I heard that.
[3866.36 --> 3867.04]  No, it doesn't make it slower.
[3867.26 --> 3867.96]  No, no, no, no, no.
[3867.96 --> 3868.22]  Okay.
[3868.40 --> 3868.86]  Oh, whatever.
[3869.60 --> 3869.96]  Here.
[3870.14 --> 3870.30]  Okay.
[3870.42 --> 3870.90]  Twitch chat.
[3871.14 --> 3872.98]  No, we're going to show you guys on screen.
[3872.98 --> 3876.30]  Does jailbreaking your iPhone make it slower?
[3878.02 --> 3879.42]  Let's see what they say.
[3882.86 --> 3883.34]  Okay.
[3883.64 --> 3884.72]  Apple EarPods, though.
[3885.60 --> 3886.12]  What do you think?
[3887.08 --> 3888.58]  That wireless AirPod?
[3888.98 --> 3889.26]  Yeah.
[3890.48 --> 3891.58]  You don't want them anyways?
[3891.76 --> 3892.00]  Okay.
[3892.12 --> 3896.36]  You don't even know how many Air headphones I lost every year.
[3897.86 --> 3898.16]  Yes.
[3898.22 --> 3898.58]  No, no.
[3898.66 --> 3901.02]  I see yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[3901.02 --> 3903.64]  The complete, the whole thing is just a mess.
[3904.72 --> 3905.52]  Twitch chat.
[3906.22 --> 3907.70]  You can't trust them for anything.
[3908.68 --> 3909.66]  Just so ridiculous.
[3911.26 --> 3911.66]  See?
[3912.84 --> 3913.62]  Yes, it does.
[3913.72 --> 3914.38]  No, it doesn't.
[3914.52 --> 3914.74]  Yes.
[3914.84 --> 3915.72]  Hell yes, it does.
[3915.74 --> 3916.54]  No, it doesn't.
[3916.56 --> 3916.72]  Yes.
[3916.84 --> 3917.56]  Not anymore.
[3917.66 --> 3917.96]  Oh, my God.
[3918.02 --> 3918.58]  Look at Stump.
[3919.64 --> 3920.88]  I just said that.
[3921.48 --> 3922.16]  You just said what?
[3922.36 --> 3923.08]  Look at Stump.
[3923.32 --> 3924.66]  Oh, that's mean.
[3924.80 --> 3925.82]  I didn't read it.
[3925.98 --> 3926.28]  No.
[3927.18 --> 3928.72]  That means you just said it.
[3928.90 --> 3929.64]  Yes, yes, yes.
[3929.64 --> 3936.52]  Okay, so I like my Android phone now because it's like a mini PC.
[3937.22 --> 3937.68]  Okay, yeah.
[3937.88 --> 3941.38]  So not just because it's a new phone, but actually like the usability of the phone.
[3941.52 --> 3942.14]  You prefer Android.
[3942.24 --> 3942.40]  Yeah.
[3942.60 --> 3943.32]  Okay, cool.
[3944.28 --> 3944.74]  Confirmed.
[3945.02 --> 3946.02]  Dennis prefers Android.
[3947.44 --> 3947.62]  Yeah.
[3947.68 --> 3948.10]  Confirmed.
[3948.10 --> 3951.08]  I really don't like the ear pod.
[3951.44 --> 3952.18]  What's it called?
[3952.26 --> 3952.74]  Ear air?
[3953.42 --> 3953.68]  What?
[3953.96 --> 3954.28]  AirPods?
[3954.58 --> 3954.84]  AirPods.
[3957.22 --> 3962.34]  Soylent halts the sales of its powder as customers keep on getting sick.
[3963.06 --> 3966.84]  It reported that a handful of customers reported stomach sickness after consuming it.
[3966.84 --> 3971.32]  In an announcement, Soylent said there appears to be a common ingredient that's causing trouble
[3971.32 --> 3974.76]  in the latest version of its product's snack bar and powder.
[3975.64 --> 3978.14]  They said the investigation isn't complete.
[3978.92 --> 3982.10]  Soylent said there shouldn't be any problems with the pre-made drinks.
[3982.44 --> 3986.96]  Soylent urged customers discomfort by version 1.6 of its powder to toss it.
[3987.76 --> 3992.62]  Newly formulated powder and bar should be available by early next year at the latest.
[3992.62 --> 3996.62]  So this doesn't include anything that anyone here does because we buy the bottles.
[3997.10 --> 3998.92]  I don't drink Soylent.
[3999.22 --> 3999.42]  Yeah.
[3999.74 --> 4000.38]  Have you tried it?
[4000.44 --> 4001.82]  I tried it, but I don't.
[4002.08 --> 4003.42]  It's too plain for me.
[4003.68 --> 4003.82]  Yeah.
[4003.86 --> 4004.82]  And I like real food.
[4004.94 --> 4011.16]  So Soylent is for people like you guys if you're in a rush or you don't have time for food.
[4011.24 --> 4012.94]  I thought you were going to say that I don't like real food.
[4013.14 --> 4013.70]  I was like, you don't.
[4013.90 --> 4014.88]  You don't have time.
[4015.04 --> 4015.24]  Yeah.
[4015.24 --> 4019.32]  And you got all the, what's that called?
[4019.38 --> 4022.26]  In, all the health.
[4023.26 --> 4023.70]  Nutrition.
[4023.90 --> 4024.22]  Nutrition.
[4024.32 --> 4025.16]  Nutrition.
[4025.46 --> 4026.36]  You got all the nutrition.
[4026.72 --> 4026.88]  Yeah.
[4027.12 --> 4031.44]  So, but you guys drink the liquid one, right?
[4031.78 --> 4032.14]  Yeah.
[4032.20 --> 4034.90]  So those aren't actually affected by this, which is good.
[4034.90 --> 4035.04]  Yeah.
[4036.32 --> 4037.88]  Jumping over here, the Kodak.
[4038.02 --> 4038.80]  Why is that?
[4038.92 --> 4039.60]  Oh, that's your screen.
[4039.82 --> 4040.02]  Bip.
[4040.66 --> 4041.70]  Kodak Ektra.
[4042.60 --> 4044.34]  This is a Kodak phone.
[4044.82 --> 4047.62]  That's actually not just a camera that we're looking at.
[4047.64 --> 4048.22]  That's a phone.
[4048.36 --> 4050.58]  So like, I don't know if I can scroll.
[4050.94 --> 4051.64]  Let's see here.
[4052.32 --> 4052.64]  Oh.
[4052.80 --> 4053.04]  There.
[4053.18 --> 4053.88]  See the other end?
[4054.08 --> 4054.54]  Look at that.
[4054.88 --> 4055.74]  It's a phone.
[4055.96 --> 4056.54]  That's cool.
[4056.62 --> 4056.80]  Yeah.
[4057.86 --> 4058.62]  I don't want to.
[4058.74 --> 4059.14]  Yeah, I know.
[4059.18 --> 4059.66]  We can do that.
[4059.72 --> 4061.04]  So let's jump on Dennis's screen.
[4061.04 --> 4062.42]  He's actually looking at the forum post.
[4062.50 --> 4063.64]  I'm going to move this out of the way.
[4064.70 --> 4068.90]  So that's pretty cool integration that Tidal Waves did right there.
[4069.48 --> 4070.34]  Information is available.
[4070.34 --> 4073.32]  So it has a, is that Helio?
[4073.42 --> 4079.36]  Helio X20 DekaCore processor, 3000 milliamp hour battery, 3 gigs of RAM, 32 gigabytes of
[4079.36 --> 4082.06]  memory, expandable with micro SD cards, which is awesome.
[4082.36 --> 4084.96]  Makes sense in a essentially camera phone.
[4085.64 --> 4094.40]  5 inch full HD display, 441 PPI, 1920 by 1080 resolution, 21 megapixel main camera with aperture
[4094.40 --> 4098.16]  of F2, which means something, I'm sure.
[4098.16 --> 4103.46]  Optical image stabilization and autofocus, 13 megapixel front facing camera, phase detection,
[4103.58 --> 4106.28]  autofocus and HDR imaging and 4K video capture.
[4106.44 --> 4107.02]  Oh, 4K.
[4107.24 --> 4108.64]  Does that sound interesting to you?
[4109.26 --> 4109.46]  Yeah.
[4109.64 --> 4112.94]  But I, because for their, is their first phone?
[4113.20 --> 4113.70]  I believe so.
[4113.74 --> 4113.86]  Yeah.
[4113.86 --> 4115.94]  I have to see.
[4115.94 --> 4116.44]  From Kodak.
[4116.44 --> 4117.56]  First phone, I don't know.
[4117.78 --> 4120.40]  But might be cool because they're good camera, right?
[4120.88 --> 4121.16]  Yeah.
[4121.62 --> 4121.90]  Yeah.
[4123.04 --> 4123.76]  I'm interested.
[4123.90 --> 4126.70]  I want Brandon to do his first phone review.
[4127.36 --> 4127.66]  And I want him to do this.
[4127.66 --> 4129.08]  Yeah, he should do this phone and camera.
[4129.08 --> 4132.58]  I think that would be super cool to have Brandon do a phone review.
[4132.82 --> 4134.78]  Oh, the skin is cool.
[4135.40 --> 4135.54]  Yeah.
[4135.54 --> 4135.86]  It's like.
[4136.34 --> 4136.56]  Yeah.
[4136.84 --> 4140.04]  And there's like the part where you hold it like on a normal camera, right?
[4140.40 --> 4140.50]  Yeah.
[4140.58 --> 4142.72]  And I believe the shutter button's right up there, which is kind of cool.
[4142.90 --> 4143.82]  Lens is big.
[4143.82 --> 4147.02]  And they have like, they have the, okay, yeah.
[4147.40 --> 4153.72]  They have the classic like camera bag kind of thing going on with the flappy cover and stuff.
[4154.48 --> 4155.32]  That's cool.
[4155.64 --> 4156.44]  That's cool.
[4157.12 --> 4158.36]  Don't just capture create.
[4158.68 --> 4160.90]  So they're showing like filters and stuff.
[4161.66 --> 4162.72]  Studio applications.
[4163.02 --> 4163.16]  Okay.
[4163.28 --> 4163.42]  No.
[4163.50 --> 4164.48]  So it's editing software.
[4165.00 --> 4165.22]  Yeah.
[4165.36 --> 4165.96]  That's cool.
[4166.96 --> 4167.36]  I just.
[4167.50 --> 4168.38]  HDR thing.
[4168.48 --> 4171.54]  I just want to see Brandon review it, to be completely honest.
[4172.24 --> 4173.72]  These are all pictures that they took with it.
[4174.44 --> 4175.02]  It's pretty cool.
[4175.96 --> 4176.58]  I just.
[4176.84 --> 4177.40]  I actually.
[4177.54 --> 4178.84]  I really love Brandon's videos.
[4179.12 --> 4179.28]  Yeah.
[4179.54 --> 4181.90]  And to see Brandon review a phone would be interesting.
[4182.42 --> 4190.28]  And to see Brandon review what is more like a camera phone than a phone with a camera would also be pretty cool.
[4190.70 --> 4193.90]  One of my favorite things about Brandon's reviews is just looking at them.
[4194.54 --> 4200.90]  Because he always spends like a little bit more time setting up the main A-roll set for himself than he does for anyone else.
[4200.90 --> 4204.30]  And then like all the B-roll in it will be perfect.
[4204.74 --> 4209.22]  And then he'll spend like a ton of time getting footage from the device and stuff.
[4209.56 --> 4209.80]  Yeah.
[4210.04 --> 4210.28]  Yeah.
[4210.54 --> 4211.28]  It's like, all right.
[4211.52 --> 4212.70]  When is this phone out?
[4213.42 --> 4214.44]  I'm not entirely sure.
[4214.44 --> 4215.26]  You have to register.
[4216.52 --> 4217.82]  Please let Brandon do it.
[4217.92 --> 4218.12]  Yes.
[4218.18 --> 4218.82]  More Brandon videos.
[4219.82 --> 4220.18]  Yeah.
[4220.18 --> 4220.24]  Yeah.
[4220.34 --> 4222.64]  I hope it comes down that way.
[4222.70 --> 4225.74]  I don't know if Brandon wants to do like a phone review and stuff.
[4225.74 --> 4228.74]  But.
[4228.94 --> 4230.58]  Just tell him it's a camera.
[4231.84 --> 4232.88]  And he'll find out it's a phone.
[4234.96 --> 4235.20]  Yeah.
[4235.48 --> 4235.76]  Yeah.
[4236.52 --> 4238.16]  Pretty sure you'd find out it's a phone pretty quick.
[4239.32 --> 4239.72]  Yeah.
[4240.06 --> 4241.36]  I don't know how well that would work.
[4244.56 --> 4247.52]  I think that's like pretty much it for topics.
[4248.36 --> 4248.92]  Oh, that's fast.
[4248.92 --> 4249.54]  Completely honest.
[4249.82 --> 4250.54]  We're sort of out.
[4251.16 --> 4252.12]  We don't really have any more topics.
[4252.60 --> 4255.48]  I wanted them to put BlizzCon stuff in here.
[4256.68 --> 4259.12]  But there's no BlizzCon stuff in here at all.
[4259.32 --> 4260.80]  So let's jump over to BlizzCon 2016.
[4261.38 --> 4261.84]  You out of here?
[4262.18 --> 4262.58]  Wow.
[4263.20 --> 4263.50]  Wow.
[4264.24 --> 4264.62]  Wow.
[4264.74 --> 4265.12]  Oh, tonight?
[4265.78 --> 4266.46]  No, I just.
[4266.70 --> 4267.12]  Oh, okay.
[4267.84 --> 4268.16]  Okay.
[4268.68 --> 4268.98]  All right.
[4269.16 --> 4269.42]  Bye.
[4269.90 --> 4270.36]  Bye, Ed.
[4270.82 --> 4271.40]  I'm not leaving.
[4271.60 --> 4272.20]  You're not leaving?
[4272.42 --> 4273.18]  You're just doing that?
[4273.20 --> 4273.98]  I'm going to go to the other building.
[4274.30 --> 4274.78]  Oh, okay.
[4274.82 --> 4275.80]  I'm just greeting you.
[4275.92 --> 4277.64]  Oh, I can't greet you back that way.
[4277.64 --> 4279.16]  He's doing that.
[4279.24 --> 4279.52]  No.
[4279.76 --> 4280.44]  Jesus.
[4281.90 --> 4282.84]  He's doing that.
[4284.66 --> 4288.32]  I have shoulder issues, so I can't raise my arm all that high.
[4288.38 --> 4290.64]  You have shoulder issues, so you can't raise your arm that high?
[4292.02 --> 4292.50]  Okay.
[4293.18 --> 4293.84]  Bye, Ed.
[4294.76 --> 4296.08]  Oh, God.
[4296.98 --> 4297.64]  Oh, God.
[4298.86 --> 4300.32]  The Twitch chat just.
[4300.68 --> 4301.48]  Let me see what.
[4301.74 --> 4303.44]  Oh, God.
[4305.48 --> 4306.00]  Oh.
[4306.00 --> 4315.40]  Okay, so to give some context for the people wondering that, Edsel and I were playing Secret
[4315.40 --> 4317.24]  Hitler last night.
[4317.50 --> 4318.52]  Let me find this.
[4320.60 --> 4321.32]  Secret Hitler.
[4321.82 --> 4322.44]  Oh, no.
[4323.30 --> 4324.26]  Yeah, Dennis.
[4324.78 --> 4325.08]  What?
[4325.08 --> 4326.18]  I didn't even know what that meant.
[4326.48 --> 4328.10]  Oh, God.
[4328.32 --> 4329.12]  Oh, wrong screen.
[4329.12 --> 4332.06]  So this is Secret Hitler.
[4334.78 --> 4336.12]  It's a...
[4336.12 --> 4338.42]  I'm going to ask questions.
[4338.68 --> 4340.66]  They don't have pictures of how the game works?
[4341.06 --> 4341.84]  What is Secret Hitler?
[4341.96 --> 4348.26]  Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany.
[4348.26 --> 4354.50]  Players are secretly divided into two teams, liberals and fascists, known only to each other.
[4354.66 --> 4359.28]  The fascists coordinate to sow, distrust, and install their cold-blooded leader.
[4359.68 --> 4363.52]  The liberals must find and stop the secret Hitler before it's too late.
[4363.52 --> 4368.06]  So essentially, at the beginning of every round, you're assigned a role, and no one knows each
[4368.06 --> 4368.76]  other's role.
[4369.64 --> 4375.58]  The fascists know who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who the fascists are, and the
[4375.58 --> 4377.04]  liberals don't know who anyone is.
[4377.04 --> 4384.54]  And you have to vote on things, but you get different cards, and it's all about subtlety
[4384.54 --> 4386.98]  and pretending that you are who you're not.
[4387.06 --> 4393.04]  Everyone wants to pretend in the game that they're a liberal, because that's the only...
[4393.04 --> 4399.48]  There's more liberals in the game than there is fascists, so you need people to think that
[4399.48 --> 4401.72]  you're on their team so that they'll play with you.
[4401.72 --> 4402.34]  You kind of...
[4402.34 --> 4406.50]  It's a very interesting game, but that's why he was...
[4406.50 --> 4406.80]  Ugh.
[4407.40 --> 4407.72]  Ugh.
[4410.72 --> 4412.02]  I don't even know.
[4412.52 --> 4412.84]  Okay.
[4413.20 --> 4414.10]  I don't even know.
[4415.32 --> 4421.26]  Moving on from there, there's BlizzCon 2016 is going on right now.
[4421.26 --> 4424.48]  So November 4th to 5th in Anaheim, California.
[4424.84 --> 4426.64]  It is November 4th right now.
[4427.22 --> 4430.72]  Some people know we were going to be there.
[4431.72 --> 4438.20]  We were supposed to be on a sponsored trip to BlizzCon covering a bunch of streaming
[4438.20 --> 4444.42]  hardware from a particular company, but that got cancelled, so that's why we are not there.
[4445.24 --> 4447.86]  There's some interesting stuff that has already happened.
[4448.02 --> 4450.04]  There's been some Heroes of the Storm information.
[4450.76 --> 4457.32]  I don't think it's all posted right here, right now, but I do know from listening to Nick Light
[4457.32 --> 4458.32]  that they're adding...
[4458.32 --> 4461.14]  Oh, crap.
[4461.22 --> 4461.86]  Who are they adding?
[4463.50 --> 4469.86]  Ragnaros and one other dude who's like the Alliance guy with the cool swords, but don't
[4469.86 --> 4470.92]  remember his name right now.
[4471.34 --> 4472.16]  Varian Wrynn?
[4474.50 --> 4475.08]  Varian Wyn?
[4475.18 --> 4475.60]  Is that right?
[4476.14 --> 4476.96]  Could totally be wrong.
[4476.96 --> 4482.36]  Anyways, they're adding those guys to Heroes of the Storm, and they're having an event for
[4482.36 --> 4482.90]  like...
[4482.90 --> 4485.86]  I think it's from November 20th to December 20th or something like that.
[4485.98 --> 4488.98]  If you play a certain amount of games or if you win a certain amount of games or something,
[4489.08 --> 4490.18]  you get a bunch of Heroes for free.
[4490.52 --> 4493.12]  So they're trying to push Heroes of the Storm, which is cool because they like that game,
[4493.36 --> 4494.48]  but not enough people play it.
[4495.86 --> 4496.68]  And yeah.
[4497.54 --> 4498.52]  BlizzCon will be interesting.
[4498.98 --> 4500.18]  Do you play any Blizzard games?
[4500.62 --> 4500.96]  No.
[4501.18 --> 4501.38]  None?
[4501.38 --> 4503.38]  Have you played StarCraft or...
[4504.04 --> 4504.28]  No.
[4507.16 --> 4507.56]  WarCraft?
[4508.10 --> 4508.28]  Yeah.
[4508.50 --> 4508.74]  No.
[4508.96 --> 4511.84]  I will have to spend too much time on those games.
[4512.02 --> 4512.20]  Yeah.
[4512.32 --> 4513.28]  So only...
[4513.28 --> 4514.48]  You don't actually game it much, do you?
[4515.56 --> 4515.96]  No.
[4516.04 --> 4517.12]  I just watch The Office.
[4517.70 --> 4518.48]  You just watch The Office?
[4518.64 --> 4518.94]  Oh.
[4519.22 --> 4520.42]  You're going to run out of The Office, man.
[4520.46 --> 4520.56]  What season are you on?
[4520.56 --> 4520.84]  I know.
[4520.92 --> 4521.90]  I'm season seven.
[4522.08 --> 4522.32]  Season...
[4522.32 --> 4523.18]  Oh, no.
[4523.96 --> 4524.78]  You're so close to me.
[4524.78 --> 4525.64]  Michael just laughed.
[4525.68 --> 4526.64]  I was so sad.
[4526.72 --> 4527.04]  Yeah.
[4527.42 --> 4528.82]  I was so sad.
[4529.04 --> 4529.34]  Yeah.
[4529.34 --> 4532.46]  Because once he laughed, there's...
[4532.46 --> 4534.34]  I don't know the point of watching that.
[4534.34 --> 4535.26]  You've got to keep watching that.
[4535.26 --> 4535.60]  I know.
[4535.78 --> 4536.14]  I know.
[4536.26 --> 4537.08]  You have to keep watching.
[4537.10 --> 4538.54]  You have to finish that.
[4539.20 --> 4542.90]  You can't go seven seasons in and not finish the whole thing.
[4542.94 --> 4543.64]  I'm going to.
[4543.78 --> 4546.10]  I watch at least three episodes a day.
[4547.12 --> 4547.38]  Yeah.
[4548.62 --> 4550.08]  Everyone's yelling spoilers.
[4550.48 --> 4552.04]  That show is not new.
[4552.04 --> 4553.98]  Just go watch it, man.
[4554.58 --> 4555.78]  Deal with it.
[4556.46 --> 4558.92]  Although you did say specifically what season two.
[4560.10 --> 4561.30]  I'm season seven.
[4564.14 --> 4565.14]  Episode 22.
[4565.40 --> 4566.76]  Is that the one that he leaves?
[4566.84 --> 4567.48]  22.
[4567.86 --> 4570.50]  That's the episode he left.
[4570.62 --> 4570.84]  There.
[4571.04 --> 4572.38]  Now you just got a super spoiler.
[4573.24 --> 4575.14]  Your Office watching experience is destroyed.
[4575.52 --> 4576.88]  It will never be the same again.
[4577.58 --> 4578.32]  It's done.
[4579.04 --> 4580.28]  It's absolutely done.
[4581.02 --> 4583.58]  I didn't say how long he's leaving.
[4584.72 --> 4585.60]  Maybe he's coming back.
[4585.62 --> 4586.28]  I don't even know.
[4586.28 --> 4586.68]  Yeah.
[4586.74 --> 4588.68]  I was going to say you haven't finished the whole thing.
[4588.76 --> 4589.54]  How would you know it all?
[4589.98 --> 4590.20]  Yeah.
[4590.72 --> 4593.58]  Anyways, I think we are going to be done.
[4594.64 --> 4598.06]  We are out of topics and I have more stuff to work on.
[4598.60 --> 4601.38]  Float plane for those who know what that even is.
[4601.90 --> 4605.56]  And I need to get home because I like do that stream and stuff.
[4605.92 --> 4607.24]  Oh, your after party.
[4607.50 --> 4607.78]  Yes.
[4607.78 --> 4613.68]  So after party, if you want to talk about things that happened in this show like ocular herpes, feel free to come join me on there.
[4614.62 --> 4615.02]  Yeah.
[4615.40 --> 4616.18]  I see you, Ed.
[4617.16 --> 4619.08]  Twitch.tv slash Luke on a square life hour.
[4619.24 --> 4620.72]  I'll be like over an hour.
[4620.86 --> 4621.80]  So don't be there too quickly.
[4622.34 --> 4622.86]  Anyways, guys.
[4622.94 --> 4625.56]  Thanks for coming by to the WAN show this week.
[4626.38 --> 4627.12]  Say bye to Dennis.
[4628.06 --> 4629.78]  Next week is...
[4631.06 --> 4631.78]  Let's see.
[4631.78 --> 4632.32]  Let's see.
[4632.32 --> 4632.64]  It's a holiday.
[4632.64 --> 4634.94]  Next week is a holiday.
[4635.72 --> 4639.10]  Also, Ed, are we gone next week?
[4641.08 --> 4642.78]  Is next week the 19th?
[4643.50 --> 4643.86]  No.
[4644.74 --> 4645.18]  No.
[4645.46 --> 4645.72]  Okay.
[4645.84 --> 4648.42]  So Linus, I believe, will be back here next week.
[4648.76 --> 4653.20]  And then the week after that, I don't know what we're actually doing for WAN show because I think we like both might be out or something.
[4653.32 --> 4653.94]  I don't know what's going on.
[4653.98 --> 4655.54]  But anyways, see you guys later.
[4655.98 --> 4656.26]  Goodbye.
[4656.26 --> 4657.12]  For the intro.
[4658.16 --> 4658.96]  Hey, it works.
[4662.64 --> 4673.40]  I'm soạn.
[4677.48 --> 4679.12]  FreshBooks.
[4679.88 --> 4680.24]  Squarespace.
[4681.76 --> 4682.60]  Double aumento.
