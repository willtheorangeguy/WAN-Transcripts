[0.00 --> 10.72]  all right guys welcome to the way the what now lawsuit show the lawsuit show yeah there's gonna
[10.72 --> 17.04]  be some lawsuit topics today no one is suing us for being late all the time you know no false
[17.04 --> 22.08]  advertising just gonna say is that how long we're when we're gonna go live is it false advertising
[22.08 --> 30.48]  if you're just actually a failure um i don't know uh i mean this is starting to sound like sort of
[30.48 --> 41.60]  kickstarter territory here can you get sued for being terrible at life maybe maybe it depends not
[41.60 --> 49.76]  a clear answer there um however you can get sued for saying a graphics card has four gigs of memory
[49.76 --> 56.48]  if it does indeed have four gigs of memory but in fact uh an eighth of it runs at a lower speed so
[56.48 --> 62.72]  nvidia has settled the graphics card false advertising class action microsoft also faces two new lawsuits
[62.72 --> 68.72]  over their aggressive windows 10 upgrade tactics are you gonna do two of them or am i gonna do no more
[68.72 --> 75.92]  i'll do two more verizon buys yahoo for 4.83 billion it's too bad they spent so much on it because i was
[75.92 --> 82.00]  gonna make a play for yahoo with my you know maybe 40 bucks yeah that i got in my wallet that might not
[82.00 --> 88.32]  be worth it that it was gonna be a tough call without that 40 bucks how would i go play badminton
[88.32 --> 95.76]  tonight that or you could buy 20 cans of pop and 20 chocolate bars and i could feel really terrible
[95.76 --> 101.28]  the next day which is about how i'd feel if i bought yahoo uh also using a vpn in the united arab
[101.28 --> 106.56]  emirates could get you fined could make you feel pretty bad speaking of feeling bad i almost missed
[106.56 --> 115.04]  that segue there uh could get you fined up to 545 000 us dollars so let's run the intro which is
[115.04 --> 118.40]  the only thing that i wasn't 100 sure if it was going to work today
[118.40 --> 132.40]  is the audio good i'm not sure
[132.40 --> 154.40]  okay oh i forgot to do one thing i forgot to do one thing there boom now it'll work next time okay
[154.40 --> 163.20]  nice oh there was an option to reset the scene every time you left it uh no that that that is oh
[163.76 --> 170.16]  like reset all the scene oh you could save what the scene was like and that seems like it would be very
[170.16 --> 175.52]  specifically useful for us for that one scene i don't know that xsplit will implement that but we've
[175.52 --> 184.32]  asked for features before and they've done it so all right so guys with it is with a glad a glad heart
[184.80 --> 191.60]  that i can reveal that i have finally resolved all the issues that i had with the streaming setup here
[192.16 --> 197.28]  um we're using the razer siren pro which for whatever you guys always complain that the audio
[197.28 --> 201.92]  was too quiet and i think part of the problem is that we're using microphones with a cardioid pickup
[201.92 --> 207.68]  pattern as two people and so we couldn't turn them up high enough without introducing distortion
[207.68 --> 213.84]  siren pro works well for some reason in this application i don't know why the other thing is that
[213.84 --> 220.48]  we had a mishmash of capture cards from el gato waver media and black magic including cards from their
[220.48 --> 227.44]  deck link as well as their intensity lineup um it seemed like from week to week one or the other
[227.44 --> 233.52]  could be responsible for everything being completely bunged up we are now consolidated we are using all
[233.52 --> 239.68]  epiphan capture cards um a combination of them and we actually have more input devices now so i can do
[240.32 --> 248.80]  this with linus's screen or i can do uh yeah work with luke's screen wow so we can both screen share
[248.80 --> 254.32]  now also this is a really funny bug that hey we can prove that we're watching the show now oh yeah
[254.72 --> 261.36]  because people will see the chat on my screen um huh so uh this is a really funny bug that i was having
[261.36 --> 268.40]  with the elgato card was where it would take like eight seconds to switch scenes so i would bring up
[268.40 --> 273.60]  the uh i would bring up the article that we were talking about and it would be sitting there and i
[273.60 --> 278.40]  wouldn't be able to change to my notes on it and i would always just have to kind of kill 10 seconds
[278.40 --> 284.56]  after i clicked yeah so uh yeah this is a pretty interesting article that i'm planning to talk to you
[284.56 --> 290.16]  about but i don't have any of my exact notes here's some kind of you know a thing that i okay yeah blah blah
[290.16 --> 296.56]  blah blah here's what's going on yeah so we're pretty much solved as far as issues go i'm super
[296.56 --> 302.80]  thrilled and yes i got a sunburn thank you for making that observation i also got a spray tan
[303.52 --> 307.76]  yeah on the same day that i went out and got a sunburn are you sunburned on your face oh yeah
[307.76 --> 314.00]  oh my face is like wicked burnt like yeah i don't think my face is very well you were wearing a bucket
[314.00 --> 319.52]  yeah yeah i did everything i could possibly do yeah to not get sunburned including just putting a bucket on
[319.52 --> 324.16]  my head and like putting my shirt on every opportunity i had and i don't even know how much
[324.16 --> 329.68]  of this is spray tan or burn it's so hard to figure it out or burn yeah because i actually and
[329.68 --> 337.44]  this was really hard but i went home had a shower and like scrubbed because i was trying to get spray tan
[337.44 --> 343.68]  off so i scrubbed a sunburn when i got home from the shoot yesterday should we scrubbed a little bit
[343.68 --> 349.28]  but i'm not burnt as bad should we tell them what we were shooting and why your beard is shaved
[350.16 --> 355.12]  why i have a how long till it's gonna be coming out it's gonna be at least two to three weeks but
[355.12 --> 360.00]  should we should we tease it anyway maybe we should tease it anyway i kind of think so i kind of can we
[360.00 --> 364.40]  show the original i think we should tease it anyway i don't want to show the original and get the
[364.40 --> 371.52]  monetization pulled off when show because that'll probably happen okay but we did as close as we could
[371.52 --> 380.64]  a shot for shot reenactment of the volleyball scene from top gun now mind you none of us are
[381.28 --> 388.80]  uh shredded enough for it except for maybe linus but okay the funny thing about okay so we're talking
[388.80 --> 394.08]  body fat percentage yeah when you say sort of shredded in that isn't that what that means
[394.08 --> 401.20]  no because i'm i'm not uh like i'm not bulky enough but you look shredded that's what it's all
[401.20 --> 406.40]  is that what you could be jacked as but have too high of a body fat percentage and not look shredded
[406.40 --> 413.28]  oh i see okay well so okay fine i might be shredded enough but i'm just not bulky enough like in the
[413.28 --> 419.36]  picture is tom cruise bulkier there he's bulkier there for sure um i kind of want to i kind of want to
[419.36 --> 427.28]  tweet this right now or something so that i can um there's a picture of me with okay i'll just even
[427.28 --> 432.24]  taran okay there's a picture of me with all three of the other guys that are that are doing the
[432.24 --> 439.44]  volleyball game and i look tiny i look like even though even again like even though my body fat
[439.44 --> 446.88]  percentage is quite low i look like the pinnerist dude next to burkle who i'm pretty sure has four arms
[446.88 --> 452.00]  bigger than my biceps i think well yeah because i think my forearm might be bigger than your biceps
[452.00 --> 457.84]  yeah i think so and so between the two burkle's like massive yeah burkle's chest is like huge
[458.56 --> 463.84]  shoulders are probably bench press like by itself yeah if you give it like probably bench with his
[463.84 --> 470.16]  pecs yeah my entire body weight but like not using his arms and taran in the time i've known him
[470.16 --> 475.44]  has completely changed like he was like the stereotypical and don't take this the wrong way but he
[475.44 --> 481.52]  still has no athletics athletic ability so he can't use his strength but he's quite strong now
[481.52 --> 488.08]  but he was like the stereotypical vegetarian and i don't i don't mean that rudely in any way you know
[488.08 --> 493.68]  vegetarian diet are super jack vegetarians there are lots of jack vegetarians but it's like the
[493.68 --> 499.44]  vegetarian from like the bill burke comic like the caricature of a vegetarian super like to the t
[499.44 --> 504.48]  stereotypical one yeah like the stereotypical vegetarian the guy was like you know six or
[504.48 --> 510.64]  seven inches taller than me and weighed about the same as i did it was bad he's been very intentionally
[510.64 --> 515.76]  putting on weight yeah and very intentionally working he looks good he looks good anyway so so
[516.64 --> 524.24]  i play tom cruise maverick um some of you have probably seen terran's picture on social media where he
[524.24 --> 531.20]  he shaved oh man the pedo stash is far too real actually i'm gonna pull this up it's gone now
[531.20 --> 536.40]  and that's probably a good thing it's gone now yeah he shaved it off oh oh he shaved the pedo stash oh
[536.40 --> 541.68]  yeah yeah yeah that's fine no i thought you meant his no no i doubt that's gone no i'm pretty sure i'm
[541.68 --> 546.48]  pretty sure he tweeted a picture here where's where's the pedo stash where's the pedo stash no i don't see
[546.48 --> 552.24]  it i don't see it down maybe he's on the ltt one maybe he tweeted on the ltt handle
[553.12 --> 558.08]  i didn't put mine on the ltt one because it's a csf thing it's not ltd yeah that's the same reason i
[558.08 --> 563.76]  didn't tweet anything yesterday okay oh i can't find oh oh i feel like terrible right now like i
[563.76 --> 569.76]  really want to okay whatever you guys no no it's okay it's okay it's ridiculous so terran's goose
[569.76 --> 577.20]  okay so um what's your character's name ice man ice man i think it's nice man burkle is is it slider
[577.20 --> 585.52]  or something no i don't remember anyway luke and burkle are like the like mean rivals and then
[585.52 --> 595.52]  taryn and i play tom cruise and and goose and it's just bad the twist is that we use an inflatable
[595.52 --> 603.44]  volleyball that's like this big um it should be good it should be good stay tuned stay tuned i'm not
[603.44 --> 611.52]  making it sound very good but maybe okay i think his name is either stinger viper jester or merlin i'm
[611.52 --> 616.72]  not sure which one i am ice man you're ice man all right and then goose and maverick were correct
[617.92 --> 623.92]  all right so let's move on to some actual news topics here shall we the original article here is
[623.92 --> 632.16]  from top class actions dot com nvidia settles graphics card false advertising class action
[632.88 --> 638.08]  so they've agreed to a preliminary settlement that will resolve claims in a group of proposed class
[638.08 --> 643.84]  action lawsuits that center around allegations that the company misled consumers about the performance
[645.12 --> 651.44]  and uh quote unquote storage capabilities of its product though it should be noted that
[651.44 --> 658.88]  i wouldn't call vram storage i already posted that i wouldn't call vram storage in sort of the
[658.88 --> 669.12]  strictest sense of the word um nvidia says then that it will pay every buyer of a gtx 970 30 dollars
[670.32 --> 678.08]  and they will pay 1.3 million dollars in additional in additional additional attorney's fees
[678.08 --> 685.68]  so there you go we had talked about this at the time we had said we felt like a class action was
[685.68 --> 691.20]  going to be pointless what are you going to get five bucks you know what 30 dollars is decent 30
[691.60 --> 695.60]  buys you an appy and an entree but not a drink at a restaurant
[699.36 --> 704.40]  and i just order waters yeah i drink water too that's a good like big probably going to take some
[704.40 --> 709.12]  home meal yeah that's right that's right that's going to be your dinner and your midnight snack
[709.12 --> 717.04]  yeah while you're gaming yeah on your gtx 970 which is still a very good card yep so you know i we again
[717.04 --> 722.80]  i don't want to beat this dead horse any more than we already have you know like pure ghost loads out of
[722.80 --> 732.24]  that horse at this point um but the 970 is still a good card they shouldn't have done that no i think
[732.24 --> 738.16]  they deserved this yep definitely um i didn't think it was going to work because i thought they
[738.16 --> 743.12]  were going to get away with in the legal court like there's technically four there and there are like
[743.12 --> 748.48]  and there are that's the funny thing about it is they it is misleading i can't deserve it i can't imagine
[748.48 --> 753.76]  they saved a lot of money building the card this way i don't i don't feel like it would be 30 bucks a
[753.76 --> 760.48]  card because they did put four gigs of ram on it like they they bought the the memory they put it on
[760.48 --> 765.60]  there so they actually had to pay for the memory and then they had to pay out and crap pay out to
[765.60 --> 771.60]  their customers as though they didn't so now yeah i don't know lesson learned right don't don't screw
[771.60 --> 777.36]  with the internet so the overall settlement amount was not publicly disclosed within the court papers
[778.00 --> 784.80]  uh it's gonna be a lot but nvidia did say that there would be no cap on the total amount it would
[784.80 --> 789.04]  pay and they would pay all consumers who purchased a 970 graphics card i guess i don't count because
[789.04 --> 794.00]  mine are review samples that'd be pretty sick though if we could turn in our 970s for 30 bucks
[795.12 --> 798.64]  go get some dinner some appies pretty sweet i mean with the amount that we had
[799.60 --> 805.28]  did you get i don't think we had that many 970s at least two yeah we had 60 bucks yeah 60 bucks
[805.28 --> 810.32]  there you go and it's us dollars so like oh dang yeah yeah six hundred dollars what's up
[810.32 --> 818.72]  that is pretty sweet though and i'm happy that it happened this quickly i know some people are
[818.72 --> 825.36]  going to be like what like this happened forever ago but these things sometimes take like what was
[825.36 --> 832.72]  it ddr2 or something there was some like 15 rebate or 20 rebate on ddr2 purchases oh i don't know and it
[832.72 --> 837.92]  happened like 10 years later yeah something is there was an intel one that it was like six or seven years
[837.92 --> 843.76]  down the line everyone got 15 bucks or 10 but yeah dollars or something so 30 bucks is i feel a
[843.76 --> 848.16]  pretty good amount of money and it happened relatively recently afterwards yeah it was
[848.16 --> 852.64]  now it was the right thing for nvidia to just settle it because that's why it got done so quickly was
[852.64 --> 857.20]  that they settled it rather than dragging this out into a really long court battle i mean to be clear
[857.20 --> 863.28]  i don't think they'd have settled it if they thought they could win it but yeah um i uh what was i
[863.28 --> 871.52]  gonna say right there's no form up yet to like apply to get your 30 dollars just in case anyone's
[871.52 --> 877.76]  like scrambling trying to get their money um i think this top class actions website is going to post
[877.76 --> 884.08]  something about it once it's up um so they're trying to get you to sign up for their newsletter i would
[884.08 --> 890.00]  probably just come back to this website instead of signing up for their newsletter so basically um there
[890.00 --> 896.40]  were a total of 15 consumer class action lawsuits that were consolidated in northern california nvidia
[896.40 --> 905.04]  denied all allegations of wrongdoing and then entered into the settlement terms uh and agreed to
[905.04 --> 911.76]  the terms of the settlement and then uh the 30 dollars is not arbitrary it's calculated to represent a
[911.76 --> 916.80]  portion of the cost of the storage and performance capabilities the consumer thought they was the
[916.80 --> 920.64]  consumers thought they were obtaining when they purchased the card which what that's like around
[920.64 --> 925.92]  like 11 of the cost yeah something like that's a pretty pretty more than fair is what i would call
[925.92 --> 931.76]  that cool speaking of although there's something to be said for like you think you buy a product
[931.76 --> 937.36]  and you don't get that and it wasn't even necessarily as much about the money right so you should
[937.36 --> 941.12]  probably get more than the difference which is probably what happened but i don't think that's
[941.12 --> 948.40]  usually how these things work i have no idea so no all right let's move on to our next topic here
[948.40 --> 952.88]  another lawsuit topic the original article here is from extreme tech i'm going to pull this up you want
[952.88 --> 960.72]  to post it yeah all right microsoft slapped with class action lawsuits over windows 10 upgrade practices
[960.72 --> 971.92]  good dun dun dun dun dun dun dun so they're facing two more lawsuits over company over their questionable
[971.92 --> 977.52]  upgrade tactics both suits are seeking class action status the first one was filed in the u.s district
[977.52 --> 984.24]  court in florida and alleges that the microsoft windows 10 upgrade prompts violated laws governing
[984.24 --> 991.68]  unsolicited electronic advertisements, which is a really interesting way of tackling it
[991.68 --> 999.78]  because you could sort of make the argument that, and this is kind of getting into a pretty
[999.78 --> 1006.56]  fuzzy area here, you could sort of make the argument that, let's say, Apple putting an
[1006.56 --> 1013.88]  iTunes update notification in the bottom of your screen all the time is like advertising
[1013.88 --> 1021.06]  impressions because they're showing you the Apple name and the iTunes name and the, or
[1021.06 --> 1025.46]  like if they had like a logo or something in there, like you could almost take it one
[1025.46 --> 1027.54]  step further and go companies prompting you to.
[1027.54 --> 1030.66]  Okay, but then it's like putting a brand name on something, is that advertising then?
[1031.78 --> 1033.26]  If it's unsolicited.
[1033.56 --> 1038.90]  Because the Windows 10 one was an entire window that popped up on your screen.
[1038.90 --> 1040.38]  It wasn't like a notification in the corner.
[1040.38 --> 1046.20]  It was like, hey, upgrade to Windows 10 and it did it all the time and would do it forcefully.
[1046.20 --> 1047.48]  Okay, but hold on a second.
[1047.48 --> 1052.36]  So, yes, they basically put a billboard on your computer.
[1052.36 --> 1053.56]  That is different.
[1053.82 --> 1054.18]  Yeah.
[1054.42 --> 1057.48]  But they weren't trying to sell you anything.
[1057.48 --> 1069.90]  However, in this day and age, so much software is free to play that is there really a difference
[1069.90 --> 1078.36]  between an ad for installing the Twitter app, for example, and an ad for installing Windows 10?
[1078.36 --> 1086.04]  Again, if Microsoft was making the argument that Windows 10 was Windows 8.1 Service Pack 4 or something,
[1086.04 --> 1091.30]  like if they just kind of said, okay, yes, it's a service pack that makes everything look the same.
[1091.30 --> 1093.96]  Oh, by the way, we're going to call it Windows 10 now.
[1093.96 --> 1099.46]  Like if they weren't calling it a different product, they might have gotten away with this not being called advertising.
[1099.46 --> 1107.28]  But if they are effectively trying to get you to download and install a different product from what you have,
[1107.28 --> 1110.14]  then I actually, I kind of see that holding water.
[1110.14 --> 1110.46]  Yeah.
[1110.46 --> 1110.52]  Yeah.
[1110.52 --> 1114.28]  And the length to how aggro they went about it.
[1114.28 --> 1114.78]  Mm-hmm.
[1114.78 --> 1117.02]  All right.
[1117.02 --> 1123.96]  So the second suit, this is more along the lines of what I expected from Windows 10 class action lawsuits.
[1123.96 --> 1128.52]  So this one alleges that Microsoft installed Windows 10 on users' computers without consent.
[1128.52 --> 1133.76]  And they've already paid out $10,000 in a previous US suit over similar circumstances.
[1133.76 --> 1142.80]  And this is a case where because it's a Windows operating system and not part of video memory that still functioned,
[1142.80 --> 1153.16]  but just like wasn't what I thought I was getting, this one I can see people getting significant payouts for being put out by this situation
[1153.16 --> 1156.86]  where their computer doesn't work or their computer doesn't work the way they expect it.
[1156.86 --> 1158.86]  I mean-
[1158.86 --> 1161.80]  Which I hope that happens because I'd like to receive some money for the like half a day that I lost because of that.
[1161.80 --> 1164.00]  I mean, and it could be a lot worse than that.
[1164.10 --> 1165.10]  It could be, you know, like-
[1165.10 --> 1165.12]  No, no.
[1165.34 --> 1168.26]  But it's only not worse than that because it was me.
[1168.76 --> 1169.04]  Yeah.
[1169.38 --> 1169.86]  Like if it was-
[1169.86 --> 1172.74]  I was, my system is set up that it's not that big of a deal.
[1172.92 --> 1178.02]  Like if it's your, you know, I'm not going to say your mom because your mom's fairly tech savvy if I recall correctly.
[1178.02 --> 1180.02]  She's-
[1180.02 --> 1185.46]  Like she wouldn't not be able to find the control panel because you changed the version of Windows, would she?
[1186.56 --> 1188.32]  Or like not be able to find her programs.
[1188.52 --> 1190.44]  I don't think she would know to look for the control panel.
[1190.44 --> 1190.68]  Okay.
[1190.78 --> 1192.14]  Like would she not be able to find her programs?
[1192.14 --> 1192.94]  She could find her programs.
[1192.94 --> 1194.02]  Or like her internet explorer or whatever.
[1194.02 --> 1195.30]  She could find her internet stuff.
[1195.40 --> 1195.56]  Yeah.
[1195.56 --> 1195.84]  Okay.
[1195.84 --> 1196.16]  She could do all that.
[1196.16 --> 1203.06]  So let's talk about if it's someone who legitimately wouldn't be able to use their computer even if the upgrade works correctly.
[1204.00 --> 1204.08]  Right.
[1204.08 --> 1205.44]  There's going to be people saying-
[1205.44 --> 1206.68]  I feel like my mom would be fine.
[1206.88 --> 1207.02]  Yeah.
[1207.16 --> 1211.88]  There's going to be people out there though that would have not been able to use their computer for potentially weeks.
[1212.26 --> 1214.82]  I guarantee my mom would call me and be like, everything looks different.
[1214.90 --> 1215.30]  I'm scared.
[1215.48 --> 1220.72]  And on top of that, would have had to take it to a shop to have it restored to its pre-Windows 10 upgrade.
[1222.06 --> 1225.62]  They could be paying a lot of money per instance.
[1225.62 --> 1229.46]  In the case of that $10,000 one, they ended up buying her a new computer if I recall correctly.
[1229.62 --> 1232.40]  Like it was a new laptop, which I think is unjustified personally.
[1233.34 --> 1233.86]  But-
[1233.86 --> 1235.88]  I think they're very much just trying to get it to go away.
[1235.96 --> 1245.98]  But with that said, the paperwork involved in having a computer serviced by some shop somewhere, like building a service network countrywide.
[1246.72 --> 1251.40]  And remember, people could have been getting Windows 10 upgrades in the middle of Timbuk freaking 2 Kentucky.
[1251.40 --> 1256.32]  Like, it could be easier to just ship them a computer from Dell.com.
[1256.56 --> 1256.76]  Yeah.
[1257.02 --> 1257.18]  Yeah.
[1257.44 --> 1259.00]  Which is kind of terrifying.
[1260.62 --> 1261.56]  Oh dear.
[1261.68 --> 1262.08]  All right.
[1262.20 --> 1262.54]  So-
[1262.54 --> 1264.88]  I'm upset about that kind of stuff.
[1264.98 --> 1267.70]  And I wish that like, I don't know.
[1267.70 --> 1273.46]  It's frustrating and frustrating that it also wasn't easier.
[1273.64 --> 1276.50]  Because like, I'm trying to build some LAN rigs right now.
[1276.86 --> 1281.18]  But like, I don't have enough cases and I'm trying to like, get cases essentially for free.
[1281.30 --> 1283.22]  So there's been like, delays on it and whatnot.
[1283.22 --> 1287.32]  So I haven't built all of them yet.
[1287.46 --> 1288.50]  I've built a couple of them.
[1288.76 --> 1291.98]  But that means there's a few of them that I haven't done operating system installs on yet.
[1292.56 --> 1295.26]  So I guess they're just going to stay on Windows 7.
[1295.80 --> 1297.10]  Because I have keys for that.
[1297.22 --> 1298.50]  I don't have keys for Windows 10.
[1299.04 --> 1305.20]  And I don't really want to buy more operating system keys for LAN rigs that don't need it.
[1305.44 --> 1305.80]  Right.
[1305.94 --> 1307.14]  Everyone can run DX11.
[1307.46 --> 1308.16]  That's fine.
[1308.34 --> 1310.70]  Because DX12 is kind of borked at the moment anyways.
[1310.70 --> 1313.54]  Yeah, you're working on a video about that, right?
[1313.72 --> 1314.48]  Trying to, yes.
[1314.54 --> 1315.10]  Trying to.
[1316.68 --> 1317.78]  You're going to leave it at that.
[1320.92 --> 1325.38]  There are certain reasons why I am not currently able to complete it that are making me frustrated.
[1325.50 --> 1326.24]  But I'll stay away from that.
[1326.48 --> 1326.94]  I should.
[1329.84 --> 1334.02]  I think I'm getting the rest of the information that I want on August 4th.
[1334.02 --> 1337.02]  But that I'm leaving for a while on August 5th.
[1337.76 --> 1340.42]  So it's probably going to be a bit.
[1340.70 --> 1341.70]  Yeah.
[1342.38 --> 1344.04]  But yes, there's a video on Vulkan.
[1344.18 --> 1346.88]  The current state of Vulkan and DX12 that is on the way.
[1347.78 --> 1352.84]  So Microsoft told the Seattle Times that it believes these suits won't succeed.
[1353.46 --> 1355.50]  Although, I mean, they have to say that.
[1355.88 --> 1357.04]  What else are they going to say at this point?
[1357.04 --> 1358.14]  One quick thing that I want to interject.
[1358.26 --> 1359.22]  Someone in the chat said,
[1359.54 --> 1362.54]  If Vulkan succeeds, you won't need Windows 10 or DX12.
[1363.36 --> 1364.12]  That's a good point.
[1364.64 --> 1365.84]  Vulkan works on, like, everything.
[1366.16 --> 1367.02]  Android, Linux.
[1367.02 --> 1367.80]  That's true.
[1367.94 --> 1369.26]  Assuming that the game.
[1369.26 --> 1369.60]  It works.
[1369.80 --> 1372.26]  There's only four games that it supports right now.
[1372.36 --> 1372.76]  Yeah.
[1373.14 --> 1374.00]  One of them is Dota.
[1374.88 --> 1377.04]  So, doesn't matter.
[1378.62 --> 1379.22]  Nice.
[1379.22 --> 1381.16]  No, but no.
[1381.36 --> 1382.58]  Dota is a very important game.
[1382.76 --> 1383.88]  But it's very easy to run.
[1384.00 --> 1384.86]  And you don't need, like...
[1384.86 --> 1387.08]  Oh, I thought you meant specifically Dota doesn't matter.
[1387.08 --> 1388.32]  Dota is a very important game.
[1388.38 --> 1389.54]  I didn't mean Dota doesn't matter.
[1389.90 --> 1393.00]  I mean, like, it being featured in Dota.
[1393.18 --> 1396.22]  The cool part of that means that it's very...
[1396.76 --> 1398.34]  Like, you can play it on whatever you want.
[1398.46 --> 1399.20]  That part is cool.
[1399.30 --> 1400.74]  Because Vulkan is on everything.
[1401.14 --> 1401.52]  Right.
[1401.66 --> 1401.96]  Okay.
[1403.46 --> 1404.96]  Context of that got a little weird.
[1405.14 --> 1405.36]  Sorry.
[1406.44 --> 1407.32]  I was like, wow.
[1407.44 --> 1409.00]  So much hate.
[1409.16 --> 1409.70]  No, no.
[1409.72 --> 1410.80]  So much salt.
[1411.02 --> 1412.56]  It did not mean that at all.
[1413.74 --> 1414.74]  Dota is an important game.
[1414.92 --> 1416.56]  They've done a really good thing for esports.
[1417.20 --> 1418.44]  I like how they do their tournaments.
[1420.08 --> 1421.52]  I just realized that...
[1421.52 --> 1421.84]  Don't play it.
[1422.52 --> 1427.24]  Only the most loyal of our viewers are watching right now.
[1427.24 --> 1428.90]  Oh, you didn't?
[1429.00 --> 1430.82]  Because it didn't push.
[1431.28 --> 1431.70]  Oh, my.
[1432.26 --> 1433.56]  Da-da-da-da-da-da.
[1434.32 --> 1434.98]  That's okay.
[1435.56 --> 1438.00]  There's a couple more things on that topic.
[1439.52 --> 1440.64]  Microsoft getting wrecked?
[1440.98 --> 1441.20]  Yeah.
[1441.28 --> 1441.48]  Yeah.
[1441.54 --> 1444.52]  Basically, their statement is still in there.
[1446.24 --> 1447.24]  Microsoft stated,
[1447.38 --> 1451.12]  Microsoft's marketing scheme falls short of certain protections
[1451.12 --> 1452.68]  which must be afforded.
[1452.98 --> 1453.24]  Wait.
[1453.36 --> 1453.54]  What?
[1454.46 --> 1454.80]  Okay.
[1455.12 --> 1456.16]  I was doing this.
[1456.26 --> 1456.92]  Maybe I'll just pick it right now.
[1456.92 --> 1457.50]  That was done.
[1457.62 --> 1457.84]  Okay.
[1458.76 --> 1462.72]  So basically, they said that upgrades to Windows 10 are a choice,
[1462.84 --> 1463.50]  not a requirement,
[1463.68 --> 1465.02]  which is one way of putting it, I guess,
[1465.14 --> 1468.08]  and that they offer free customer support to those that run into trouble.
[1468.40 --> 1470.64]  Have you ever tried to contact Microsoft customer support?
[1470.64 --> 1471.36]  It's basically the worst.
[1471.90 --> 1477.84]  I don't actually think I've had a worse customer support thing from anyone.
[1478.26 --> 1482.22]  They say people who update to Windows 10 can roll back their prior system for 31 days,
[1482.22 --> 1484.80]  which doesn't help people who are not tech savvy
[1484.80 --> 1486.78]  and whose upgrades don't complete successfully.
[1486.78 --> 1487.00]  Yeah.
[1487.06 --> 1489.68]  Or if it fails, like mine did, not complete successfully.
[1489.88 --> 1490.10]  Yep.
[1490.10 --> 1490.72]  Yeah.
[1490.72 --> 1497.36]  So basically, the lawyer that filed the Florida lawsuit said that Microsoft's marketing scheme,
[1497.74 --> 1501.52]  he calls it, falls short of certain protections which must be afforded,
[1501.80 --> 1508.52]  and then claims that the damages owed to consumers who have struggled with the new software may total tens of millions of dollars.
[1509.40 --> 1509.98]  Wrecked.
[1509.98 --> 1514.90]  And I'm kind of leaning towards, I hate to do this, but I might have to agree with a lawyer.
[1516.76 --> 1517.54]  Sorry, John.
[1518.26 --> 1518.46]  Yeah.
[1518.94 --> 1523.24]  Because I am leaning towards him being more correct about this outcome.
[1523.24 --> 1524.16]  I totally think he's right.
[1524.24 --> 1526.56]  And I think it's going to cost them tens of millions of dollars.
[1526.74 --> 1526.92]  Yeah.
[1527.06 --> 1527.52]  A hundred percent.
[1528.48 --> 1528.64]  What?
[1529.10 --> 1529.32]  What?
[1529.66 --> 1529.88]  No.
[1530.34 --> 1531.28]  No, no, it's all good, John.
[1531.34 --> 1531.66]  Don't worry.
[1532.08 --> 1532.68]  Everything's fine.
[1533.66 --> 1534.06]  All right.
[1534.14 --> 1544.18]  Speaking of everything being good, you and I had some more experience than usual with Dollar Shave Club razors each.
[1544.50 --> 1548.02]  So I don't think I've clean shaven since 2012.
[1548.34 --> 1551.60]  I think in the first WAN show I was in, I think I'm clean shaven then.
[1552.32 --> 1553.52]  Yeah, that sounds about right.
[1553.62 --> 1553.98]  I think.
[1554.26 --> 1554.50]  Yeah.
[1554.50 --> 1555.50]  So it's like weird.
[1555.86 --> 1560.88]  And I didn't realize how like spiky it is if you're trying to let it grow back.
[1561.20 --> 1561.32]  Yeah.
[1561.32 --> 1565.06]  So like this morning I woke up and was like, oh, my hand's stuck.
[1565.10 --> 1565.94]  Oh, it's like sandpaper.
[1566.12 --> 1566.24]  Yeah.
[1566.68 --> 1567.56]  Holy crap.
[1568.08 --> 1570.52]  Anyways, I did use Dollar Shave Club razors to do it.
[1570.64 --> 1570.90]  Yep.
[1571.38 --> 1576.04]  And I used Dollar Shave Club razor to shave my chest for the first time.
[1576.32 --> 1577.30]  I didn't show a nipple.
[1577.46 --> 1578.00]  Was that ever?
[1579.00 --> 1579.72]  No, I've never.
[1579.94 --> 1580.32]  First time ever?
[1580.44 --> 1581.64]  Yeah, I've never shaved my chest.
[1581.72 --> 1582.94]  I've never really felt the need.
[1583.20 --> 1585.22]  I just have kind of like this weird tuft in the middle.
[1585.34 --> 1586.94]  Like I don't have a lot of chest hair.
[1587.84 --> 1588.02]  Yeah.
[1588.36 --> 1590.48]  Is it enough that like if you wear a deep feet, it's just like.
[1590.48 --> 1592.00]  No, because they grow down.
[1592.58 --> 1592.92]  Oh.
[1593.26 --> 1593.44]  Yeah.
[1593.44 --> 1595.72]  Like it's just kind of like this weird like thing.
[1595.84 --> 1596.24]  I got you.
[1596.30 --> 1596.82]  Going on.
[1597.00 --> 1598.32]  And then it's kind of weird.
[1598.32 --> 1600.60]  Like all over the rest of like my shoulders and chest.
[1600.98 --> 1602.66]  I have like these individual.
[1602.82 --> 1604.00]  Random really long one.
[1604.10 --> 1605.42]  Random really long hairs.
[1605.50 --> 1605.56]  Yeah.
[1606.02 --> 1606.90]  Like it's bizarre.
[1606.90 --> 1607.34]  Yeah.
[1607.34 --> 1609.46]  But I shaved my chest for the first time.
[1609.54 --> 1609.94]  I used.
[1610.10 --> 1611.36]  I believe it was the four blade.
[1612.56 --> 1614.34]  I actually borrowed Luke's.
[1614.48 --> 1614.60]  Yeah.
[1614.84 --> 1616.34]  We were at the spray tan place.
[1616.44 --> 1619.18]  And I was like shaving my chest in the bathroom.
[1619.40 --> 1620.34]  It was the executive.
[1620.58 --> 1621.74]  Very strange experience.
[1621.96 --> 1622.26]  Was it?
[1622.32 --> 1622.68]  No, no.
[1622.72 --> 1623.32]  It's not the executive.
[1623.42 --> 1624.38]  That's the six blade one.
[1624.52 --> 1625.24]  Oh, yeah.
[1625.38 --> 1625.84]  No, no, no, no.
[1625.86 --> 1626.38]  You have the one.
[1626.44 --> 1627.12]  You have the step down.
[1627.40 --> 1627.42]  Yes.
[1627.54 --> 1628.02]  The one in the middle.
[1628.36 --> 1628.72]  Anyway.
[1629.04 --> 1630.72]  So dollarshaveclub.com.
[1630.76 --> 1633.14]  Why don't we actually talk about their offer?
[1633.14 --> 1636.58]  It has a special offer for new members who join today.
[1636.72 --> 1639.30]  You get a free month of the executive razor.
[1639.44 --> 1640.42]  That's their top tier.
[1640.54 --> 1645.90]  When you buy a tube of Dr. Carver shave butter, which by the way, I also used for my chest
[1645.90 --> 1650.78]  shaving experience because you do not want to shave blind over a nipple.
[1651.46 --> 1651.72]  No.
[1652.30 --> 1652.62]  Nope.
[1652.84 --> 1654.54]  That's not a thing you would want to do.
[1654.64 --> 1655.92]  So being able to see what you're doing.
[1656.06 --> 1659.14]  Shave butter goes on clear is definitely a plus.
[1659.14 --> 1664.52]  It's trippy because back when I did used to clean shave, I had foam stuff.
[1664.76 --> 1666.88]  So I'm used to like, oh, you can see it when it's ready.
[1666.94 --> 1669.70]  But no, you just, you can still see your face perfectly fine.
[1669.70 --> 1669.90]  Yeah.
[1669.96 --> 1671.04]  It's actually kind of handy.
[1671.20 --> 1671.32]  Yeah.
[1672.90 --> 1675.16]  So yeah, basically that's the offer right now.
[1675.22 --> 1679.34]  All you got to do is go to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus if you live in Canada, the United
[1679.34 --> 1684.54]  States or Australia, and you can be a member of the club enjoying all the great benefits
[1684.54 --> 1688.52]  like razors and other bathroom supplies, including the shave butter, their aftershave and their
[1688.52 --> 1692.24]  one wipe Charlie's delivered directly to your door once a month.
[1692.24 --> 1697.72]  So you can use a fresh razor blade all the time and always feel good and always get a
[1697.72 --> 1698.58]  nice clean shave.
[1698.58 --> 1704.30]  And you can save money compared to going to the, you know, pharmacy or chemist or whatever
[1704.30 --> 1706.76]  it is they call it in the various countries around the world.
[1706.94 --> 1707.32]  The chemist.
[1707.58 --> 1707.98]  Apothecary.
[1708.30 --> 1708.66]  The, yeah.
[1710.82 --> 1711.22]  Apothecary.
[1711.34 --> 1712.92]  Is that how the, is that, yeah, I think that is the right.
[1712.92 --> 1713.24]  Yeah.
[1714.04 --> 1714.44]  Apothecary.
[1715.50 --> 1715.90]  Apothecary.
[1716.04 --> 1716.30]  Anyway.
[1716.76 --> 1718.20]  The point is you save money.
[1718.50 --> 1719.76]  It gets delivered right to your door.
[1719.86 --> 1722.36]  You don't have to leave the house to look like you leave the house.
[1723.18 --> 1728.92]  And yeah, I don't think we've ever gotten a complaint from our viewers about Dollar Shave
[1728.92 --> 1731.46]  Club, which is about the strongest endorsement that I can get for anyone.
[1731.70 --> 1735.52]  I always get comments of people being like, well, you have a beard.
[1735.74 --> 1737.54]  How can you advertise Dollar Shave Club?
[1737.74 --> 1739.40]  One, I shave down here all the time.
[1740.06 --> 1740.34]  Two, there.
[1740.34 --> 1741.22]  Otherwise you'd have a neck beard.
[1741.58 --> 1741.82]  Yeah.
[1741.82 --> 1743.28]  It goes down to like here.
[1743.38 --> 1743.90]  It's really bad.
[1744.08 --> 1745.56]  So I shave it and then it goes back up.
[1747.12 --> 1747.52]  Hooray.
[1748.70 --> 1749.68]  All right.
[1749.88 --> 1752.94]  So more, more Windows 10 crap.
[1753.06 --> 1756.30]  The original article here is from PCGamer.com.
[1756.92 --> 1764.66]  Tim Sweeney thinks Microsoft will make Steam progressively worse with Windows 10 patches.
[1764.82 --> 1765.12]  This is.
[1765.12 --> 1765.84]  Go to my screen and then do.
[1766.08 --> 1766.34]  Sorry?
[1766.76 --> 1768.36]  Share my screen and then go to your thing.
[1768.36 --> 1769.86]  Oh, share your screen.
[1770.06 --> 1770.36]  And then.
[1770.36 --> 1770.60]  I could.
[1771.10 --> 1772.18]  Oh, I could do that.
[1772.24 --> 1773.18]  Did you post it in Twitch chat already?
[1773.20 --> 1773.46]  I did.
[1774.26 --> 1781.10]  So for those of you who don't know, Tim Sweeney is the co-founder of Epic Games and created
[1781.10 --> 1782.82]  the Unreal Engine and stuff.
[1782.82 --> 1784.16]  You know, and stuff.
[1784.16 --> 1787.08]  So like sort of a big freaking deal.
[1787.08 --> 1787.24]  Very big deal.
[1787.24 --> 1789.92]  Like he's right up there with your CarMax and your Newells.
[1790.68 --> 1791.96]  Definitely an important guy.
[1792.56 --> 1798.34]  Believes that Microsoft will work to make Steam progressively worse in order to force developers
[1798.34 --> 1801.46]  onto the Universal Windows platform.
[1801.46 --> 1807.16]  With the end game goal of essentially closing the open PC gaming ecosystem.
[1807.42 --> 1814.18]  A funny thing about this kind of, I'd love to call it tinfoil hatness, but he's a really
[1814.18 --> 1817.44]  smart guy and a savvy guy.
[1817.56 --> 1818.80]  And they are not the same thing.
[1818.90 --> 1819.70]  He's a smart guy.
[1819.80 --> 1821.18]  He's a well-connected guy.
[1821.30 --> 1822.46]  He's a savvy guy.
[1822.46 --> 1825.18]  And he's saying that he thinks that's the direction it's going.
[1825.28 --> 1834.52]  So you know how we were giving Microsoft high fives for bringing Xbox games to the PC platform?
[1834.72 --> 1836.86]  Seeming like they cared about PC gamers.
[1837.54 --> 1843.92]  We might have gotten ahead of ourselves because they might be trying to turn PC gamers into
[1843.92 --> 1844.80]  Xbox gamers.
[1845.26 --> 1848.70]  We might have the exact right amount of caring a few months ago.
[1848.94 --> 1849.24]  Yeah.
[1849.24 --> 1857.00]  One of the things that directly worries me in this is one of the last lines in the actual
[1857.00 --> 1857.42]  article.
[1857.78 --> 1860.64]  If my laptop stops freezing, I will get there.
[1861.54 --> 1868.28]  It says, turning Windows into a closed platform risks neutering new breakthroughs such as VR.
[1868.46 --> 1870.82]  And that is before they had a chance to flourish.
[1871.14 --> 1872.64]  And that is actually a pretty good point.
[1873.10 --> 1876.50]  Steam, for all the shortfalls of things like green light.
[1876.64 --> 1877.68]  Steam is not perfect.
[1877.96 --> 1878.16]  No.
[1878.16 --> 1878.54]  We know.
[1878.54 --> 1879.78]  There's tons of problems.
[1880.28 --> 1887.36]  In the VR section on Steam, there's so many entire pages worth of just terrible, useless
[1887.36 --> 1888.56]  pieces of trash.
[1888.92 --> 1891.00]  And it's kind of a problem for VR right now.
[1891.26 --> 1897.60]  But at the same time, someone who creates something can get on Steam surprisingly without
[1897.60 --> 1898.68]  that much difficulty.
[1898.68 --> 1902.06]  And that can also be relatively important for VR right now.
[1902.06 --> 1909.12]  Because the second someone tries something that's purely innovative and is amazing and
[1909.12 --> 1911.84]  works really well for the platform, it can push out quickly.
[1912.48 --> 1913.62]  And they don't have to jump through hoops.
[1913.70 --> 1914.82]  And it's not a closed ecosystem.
[1914.82 --> 1915.82]  This is great.
[1915.82 --> 1917.90]  This is great.
[1918.64 --> 1923.34]  Big T 1971 asks if the WAN show is sponsored by fake tan this week.
[1924.14 --> 1924.54]  Kind of.
[1924.54 --> 1926.94]  No, but the tan is definitely fake.
[1927.08 --> 1928.28]  Or the fake tan is real.
[1928.42 --> 1929.60]  Look at this side of my arm.
[1929.74 --> 1930.02]  Yeah.
[1930.08 --> 1931.36]  Compared to Linus's face.
[1934.64 --> 1935.34]  There you go.
[1935.50 --> 1936.98]  This part didn't get that much spray tan.
[1936.98 --> 1945.74]  Like, can you imagine trying to play VR games without Valve and Oculus just basically stepping
[1945.74 --> 1948.42]  up and creating their own entire ecosystem?
[1948.68 --> 1948.94]  Yeah.
[1949.32 --> 1949.74]  For them.
[1950.30 --> 1950.44]  Yeah.
[1951.52 --> 1954.74]  And like, I'm going to take a very quick aside.
[1954.84 --> 1956.10]  I promise I won't talk about it for too long.
[1956.34 --> 1960.78]  For all the flack people gave me in the Oculus Rift review from the Vive community, even though
[1960.78 --> 1966.48]  it was a negative Oculus Rift review, which still confuses me about Oculus supporting developers
[1966.48 --> 1970.78]  and how I should have talked about it more, even though I did say that they were only supporting
[1970.78 --> 1973.60]  timed exclusives without a time.
[1973.94 --> 1975.76]  They just wanted them to release on Rift first.
[1976.20 --> 1981.16]  Anyways, Oculus has deeply funded like 70 games or something at this point.
[1981.74 --> 1983.16]  And that's actually pretty cool.
[1984.00 --> 1991.32]  So, I mean, we're giving Microsoft kudos for basically removing horrible things that
[1991.32 --> 1992.38]  they had before.
[1992.38 --> 2001.64]  But they've actually done very little to help VR compared to what companies like Valve and
[2001.64 --> 2004.40]  Oculus are expected to do completely on their own.
[2004.48 --> 2005.96]  I mean, not completely on their own.
[2006.14 --> 2010.16]  And Valve has their own, just to be clear as well, Valve has their own VR funding stuff
[2010.16 --> 2010.92]  that they are doing.
[2011.38 --> 2015.84]  So, like, both of those companies are doing awesome things in terms of helping VR stuff.
[2015.84 --> 2021.08]  So, anyway, to summarize, this was actually in an interview with Edge Magazine.
[2021.36 --> 2025.64]  So, to summarize Sweeney's comments, he basically goes, okay, look, every PC game for the last
[2025.64 --> 2027.02]  few decades has used Win32.
[2027.62 --> 2031.72]  And it's been responsible for the vibrant software market we have now, but also for malware.
[2032.24 --> 2034.84]  Any program can be a virus.
[2035.46 --> 2040.04]  And Universal Windows platform is seen as an antidote to that.
[2040.10 --> 2040.64]  It's sandbox.
[2040.64 --> 2042.06]  It's much more locked down.
[2042.42 --> 2047.30]  But the risk is that if Microsoft convinces everybody to use it, then they phase out Win32
[2047.30 --> 2047.80]  apps.
[2048.38 --> 2052.48]  And if they can succeed in doing that, then it's a small leap to forcing all apps and games
[2052.48 --> 2054.56]  to be distributed through the Windows Store.
[2054.78 --> 2061.54]  Which, as we've seen already, it just doesn't work with higher frame rate.
[2061.62 --> 2064.16]  It doesn't work with anything.
[2064.46 --> 2066.22]  Like, just crappy.
[2066.36 --> 2068.90]  It's like, oh, yeah, every game runs full screen windowed mode now.
[2069.14 --> 2069.54]  Why?
[2069.54 --> 2069.58]  Why?
[2070.46 --> 2072.30]  How about not?
[2072.66 --> 2073.36]  How about not that?
[2073.46 --> 2080.18]  I mean, how are we supposed to do things like, oh, I don't know, benchmark a game using
[2080.18 --> 2086.44]  an application like Fraps that jumps in in between the program and the driver and the
[2086.44 --> 2087.90]  output and overlays things?
[2088.06 --> 2091.50]  Like, this sounds like the kind of stuff that is not going to work very well.
[2091.50 --> 2096.76]  If you lock it down and you go, look, okay, every game runs at 60 FPS, 1080p and 4K, like,
[2096.82 --> 2098.24]  it wouldn't even surprise me.
[2098.46 --> 2105.88]  And I've seen games that don't support certain resolutions just because, I don't know, we
[2105.88 --> 2106.88]  just didn't think of it.
[2106.88 --> 2113.08]  Like, it wouldn't surprise me if you had a 4096 by 2160 monitor, which is 4K, by the
[2113.08 --> 2118.62]  way, 3860 by 21, or 3840 by 2160 is UHD.
[2118.80 --> 2119.60]  They're not the same thing.
[2119.80 --> 2123.32]  If you had a 4K monitor, like, it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't work properly because
[2123.32 --> 2128.34]  that standard kind of took a couple flaps of its gigantic wings and then face-planted
[2128.34 --> 2129.72]  into the sand because no one cared.
[2131.58 --> 2140.06]  And I've seen stuff like that before, where weirdo resolutions like 1440 by 900 just aren't
[2140.06 --> 2141.00]  supported for some reason.
[2142.86 --> 2143.46]  I don't know.
[2143.54 --> 2144.00]  I hate it.
[2144.18 --> 2144.84]  I hate the idea.
[2145.10 --> 2145.88]  Steam's been around forever.
[2146.06 --> 2151.38]  I think if they try to do this, though, they're going to run into crazy anti-competitive problems.
[2151.64 --> 2152.10]  Let's hope.
[2152.10 --> 2153.44]  In terms of legality.
[2154.24 --> 2156.92]  Especially because Steam has already been established for so long.
[2157.96 --> 2158.44]  Yeah, but his...
[2158.44 --> 2159.98]  If you don't think they're going to fight it, that's...
[2159.98 --> 2164.86]  But his thing is, like, if over the years they force patch Windows 10 to make Steam buggier,
[2165.14 --> 2171.24]  then people will welcome the Windows store with open arms because they'll blame Valve.
[2171.36 --> 2173.58]  I mean, blaming Valve is a very popular thing to do.
[2173.68 --> 2177.36]  They'll blame Valve for Steam being crap when ultimately it had nothing to do with them.
[2177.38 --> 2179.30]  Blame Valve, but worship Newell.
[2180.20 --> 2180.48]  Yeah.
[2180.78 --> 2181.78]  That's kind of how it works.
[2182.10 --> 2183.86]  All right.
[2183.98 --> 2185.32]  Maybe I'm more sunburned than I thought.
[2185.44 --> 2187.84]  I just scratched my arm and it's, like, really burning now.
[2187.98 --> 2188.32]  Mm-hmm.
[2188.52 --> 2189.02]  Okay.
[2189.72 --> 2189.98]  Verizon?
[2190.24 --> 2192.70]  The original article here is from CBC News.
[2193.12 --> 2200.22]  Verizon confirms $4.83 billion takeover of Yahoo's core business.
[2200.22 --> 2217.62]  This does not include Yahoo's shares in Alibaba, which are worth a lot, by the way, or Yahoo Japan, which counterintuitively is a separate company and actually has very little to do with normal Yahoo.
[2217.62 --> 2223.54]  So, it includes their advertising, content, search, and mobile activities.
[2223.54 --> 2227.72]  Apparently, Yahoo owned 34% of Yahoo Japan.
[2227.72 --> 2229.28]  That's weird.
[2229.28 --> 2230.00]  Yeah.
[2230.00 --> 2231.00]  Go figure, right?
[2231.00 --> 2237.68]  Like, did Yahoo have content in search?
[2237.68 --> 2239.40]  Like, does anyone search on Yahoo?
[2240.18 --> 2240.38]  No.
[2240.52 --> 2242.10]  I guess Verizon must think so.
[2242.10 --> 2246.92]  I think they also owned a lot of other things, even though it wasn't Alibaba or Yahoo Japan.
[2246.92 --> 2247.84]  Yeah, they just bought AOL.
[2248.30 --> 2248.56]  Yeah.
[2248.74 --> 2250.88]  Which they acquired just over a year ago.
[2250.96 --> 2251.96]  This is a great...
[2251.96 --> 2252.44]  Oh, sorry.
[2252.52 --> 2252.66]  Sorry.
[2252.74 --> 2253.74]  Verizon owns AOL.
[2253.74 --> 2260.34]  So, Verizon seems to be collecting, like, these defunct web companies.
[2260.34 --> 2260.46]  It's very weird.
[2260.46 --> 2262.04]  Like, web 1.0 companies.
[2262.04 --> 2262.48]  Yeah.
[2263.74 --> 2271.80]  So, just a year ago, we acquired AOL to enhance our strategy of providing a cross-screen connection for consumers, creators, and advertisers.
[2272.16 --> 2272.38]  What?
[2272.80 --> 2274.42]  Whatever that means.
[2274.44 --> 2275.26]  What does that mean?
[2275.62 --> 2276.10]  Hello.
[2276.98 --> 2278.68]  And this is great.
[2278.76 --> 2280.00]  This is the rest of the statement from Verizon.
[2280.00 --> 2289.08]  The acquisition of Yahoo will put Verizon in a highly competitive position as a top global mobile media company and help accelerate our revenue stream in digital advertising.
[2289.86 --> 2292.60]  So, Yahoo will be integrated with AOL.
[2293.70 --> 2297.38]  I guess maybe I'm missing something here, but...
[2297.38 --> 2300.00]  But every time we talk about Yahoo, we...
[2300.92 --> 2302.12]  We don't understand it.
[2302.26 --> 2302.52]  Yeah.
[2302.76 --> 2304.04]  Maybe we just kind of have...
[2304.04 --> 2305.00]  Because, okay...
[2305.84 --> 2309.98]  Because even the FarmNet people, I don't know anyone that's on Yahoo.
[2310.00 --> 2310.94]  Yahoo, specifically.
[2311.78 --> 2312.80]  Or, sorry, AOL.
[2313.30 --> 2314.00]  Yeah, no.
[2314.08 --> 2317.56]  I mean, as an ISP, I think AOL is pretty much gone, aren't they?
[2317.68 --> 2318.12]  Yeah, I think.
[2318.14 --> 2319.24]  I mean, maybe Twitch chat.
[2319.32 --> 2324.00]  I mean, I don't think anyone watching videos on Twitch is going to be on AOL.
[2325.06 --> 2333.00]  But maybe people watching the archive at 240p or 144p are going to let us know that they're on AOL.
[2333.88 --> 2334.08]  Yeah.
[2334.08 --> 2334.14]  Yeah.
[2334.64 --> 2335.56]  Yahoo Answers.
[2335.78 --> 2336.20]  Okay.
[2336.92 --> 2337.30]  Okay.
[2337.46 --> 2337.76]  Sure.
[2337.76 --> 2339.92]  I encounter Yahoo Answers from time to time.
[2340.38 --> 2341.88]  Although, not as much as I used to.
[2342.28 --> 2342.54]  Yeah.
[2342.66 --> 2343.72]  Not as much as I used to.
[2344.16 --> 2346.90]  These days, Quora.com comes up a lot.
[2346.94 --> 2347.76]  It's like a pay site.
[2348.70 --> 2350.04]  How are they getting submissions?
[2350.32 --> 2352.18]  Like, do they pay the people who answer the questions?
[2352.36 --> 2353.28]  I don't quite get it.
[2353.32 --> 2353.52]  Maybe.
[2353.78 --> 2354.64]  That could be a good answer.
[2354.64 --> 2357.56]  If so, that's kind of brilliant because the answers on there are really good.
[2357.80 --> 2362.90]  But if you want to click anything else from an answer page, it prompts you to buy a membership.
[2362.90 --> 2370.78]  But if you look at the name of that question page that you want to read and you go back and Google it, then you can go read that one for free.
[2370.78 --> 2379.58]  So, it's actually just the right amount of being accessible to everyone, but putting a barricade in your way if you don't pay.
[2380.84 --> 2381.18]  I don't know.
[2381.30 --> 2382.42]  I think it's really interesting.
[2382.68 --> 2391.88]  Yahoo Mail is apparently very popular according to Brimalm, whose parents probably use Yahoo Mail.
[2391.88 --> 2393.12]  So, they bought Engadget.
[2394.22 --> 2394.58]  Yep.
[2395.06 --> 2396.02]  That's part of it.
[2397.82 --> 2398.18]  Okay.
[2398.78 --> 2399.34]  Sure.
[2400.38 --> 2401.42]  Yahoo Sports.
[2402.10 --> 2402.52]  Okay.
[2403.80 --> 2404.44]  Okay.
[2404.54 --> 2405.80]  So, there's some content there.
[2407.40 --> 2408.00]  Okay.
[2408.62 --> 2409.18]  Alright.
[2409.56 --> 2410.36]  Moving on.
[2410.48 --> 2411.70]  This is pretty scary.
[2412.56 --> 2415.64]  I guess they bought all the people that are technically out of touch.
[2415.64 --> 2416.14]  Right.
[2419.24 --> 2422.16]  Because I don't even know who gets their sports news from Yahoo Sports.
[2422.44 --> 2425.96]  Or, like, people that use Yahoo Mail, but it still exists and people do use it.
[2426.14 --> 2426.40]  Yeah.
[2426.90 --> 2427.60]  I only know one.
[2427.62 --> 2429.74]  Like, I'm pretty sure Yvonne's parents use Yahoo Mail.
[2429.92 --> 2430.26]  Okay.
[2430.48 --> 2431.08]  But, like...
[2431.08 --> 2432.40]  So, they bought everyone who's...
[2432.40 --> 2433.02]  Over 50.
[2433.22 --> 2434.12]  Technically out of touch.
[2434.22 --> 2434.38]  Yeah.
[2434.56 --> 2434.82]  Yeah.
[2435.50 --> 2435.80]  Okay.
[2436.86 --> 2437.34]  Alright.
[2437.34 --> 2439.48]  This is some scary business right here.
[2439.48 --> 2447.68]  If you get caught using a VPN in the UAE, you could face fines up to $545,000.
[2450.00 --> 2450.64]  Wow.
[2452.78 --> 2459.54]  So, they introduced a federal law banning the use of VPNs to try to avoid paying for expensive
[2459.54 --> 2465.76]  voice over IP services, which is a very interesting reason to care about people using VPNs.
[2466.22 --> 2468.60]  It's a royal edict from the president.
[2469.48 --> 2475.34]  Making it illegal for anyone in the country to use a VPN or secure proxy server.
[2475.54 --> 2477.18]  That's such a weird reason.
[2477.82 --> 2486.76]  You could face jail time, by the way, and fines of between $500,000 to $2,000,000 UAE
[2486.76 --> 2487.28]  dirham.
[2487.62 --> 2490.04]  It was announced this week by the UAE president.
[2490.52 --> 2495.72]  And because this is just, like, an edict, like, I think this basically got sprung on people.
[2495.86 --> 2498.02]  I had not heard any rumblings of this.
[2498.06 --> 2499.10]  I had no idea.
[2499.76 --> 2501.18]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[2501.18 --> 2505.50]  The wording is apparently ambiguous and technologically illiterate.
[2505.74 --> 2510.74]  But it basically seems like you're not allowed to use systems that hide the fact that you're
[2510.74 --> 2512.44]  committing a crime or covering one up.
[2512.92 --> 2517.42]  And if you are routing network traffic, you could be evading the eyes of the state while
[2517.42 --> 2518.20]  breaking the law.
[2518.20 --> 2518.64]  Wow.
[2519.76 --> 2520.12]  Wow.
[2520.12 --> 2524.12]  So there's a tweaked law taken from the site Emirates 24-7 that says,
[2524.28 --> 2530.70]  whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address, or IP address, by using a false address
[2530.70 --> 2535.16]  or a third-party address by any other names for the purpose of committing a crime or preventing
[2535.16 --> 2541.88]  its discovery shall be punished by temporary imprisonment and a fine of no less than $500,000
[2541.88 --> 2542.24]  dirham.
[2542.24 --> 2544.48]  And either of these two penalties.
[2544.82 --> 2545.22]  Wow.
[2545.40 --> 2546.02]  That's awesome.
[2546.64 --> 2553.66]  I don't understand, even through reading the article, I don't understand, like, this section
[2553.66 --> 2554.02]  right here.
[2554.16 --> 2559.00]  VoIP, over-the-top apps have been a thorn in the side of telecom operators around the world
[2559.00 --> 2563.08]  because customers no longer need to pay international calling rates to speak to their beloved ones.
[2563.16 --> 2567.96]  They can just speak to them on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber, or Snapchat, or whatever
[2567.96 --> 2568.72]  the hell else.
[2568.78 --> 2569.74]  And so on and so on.
[2569.84 --> 2570.04]  Yeah.
[2570.58 --> 2573.90]  But UAE is one of the first governments in the world to actually regulate on behalf of...
[2573.90 --> 2575.24]  So can you not use those?
[2575.32 --> 2579.44]  Because you don't need a VPN to use Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber, or Snapchat.
[2579.44 --> 2587.46]  No, but the problem is that in the UAE, they have pretty crappy filtering systems in place.
[2589.24 --> 2589.76]  Okay.
[2589.94 --> 2590.10]  Yeah.
[2590.18 --> 2591.66]  So they're filtering the internet there.
[2591.74 --> 2595.88]  People are using VPNs to get around their already restricted internet access.
[2596.36 --> 2598.38]  So this is a really interesting fact from our notes here.
[2598.62 --> 2603.24]  Less than 15% of the kingdom's inhabitants are locals, with the rest of the population made
[2603.24 --> 2604.28]  up of expatriates.
[2604.28 --> 2610.34]  So many of those people probably want access to private corporate networks and the internet
[2610.34 --> 2612.54]  without being limited by that filtering system.
[2612.74 --> 2613.22]  And it looks like...
[2613.98 --> 2621.14]  I mean, I'd like to say that I can't imagine them actually enforcing this because it seems
[2621.14 --> 2621.64]  insane.
[2622.02 --> 2626.90]  But if they were insane enough to implement this law in the first place, maybe they're insane
[2626.90 --> 2627.80]  enough to enforce it.
[2628.16 --> 2633.64]  I personally wouldn't install a VPN because I wouldn't be the one to take that bullet just
[2633.64 --> 2634.26]  to find out.
[2635.06 --> 2635.50]  Right.
[2636.48 --> 2637.40]  That's kind of ridiculous.
[2637.50 --> 2640.32]  Unless some VPN steps up and goes like, we're untrackable.
[2640.44 --> 2642.10]  We'll pay your fine.
[2642.80 --> 2644.30]  Yeah, but they can imprison you.
[2644.92 --> 2645.20]  Oh.
[2645.60 --> 2645.90]  Yeah.
[2646.20 --> 2646.66]  Good call.
[2647.28 --> 2648.52]  I don't want to go to prison, yo.
[2648.68 --> 2649.36]  Freaking ridiculous.
[2650.82 --> 2651.38]  All right.
[2652.38 --> 2652.70]  711.
[2653.12 --> 2654.88]  This article is from theverge.com.
[2655.12 --> 2659.40]  Just made the first commercial delivery by drone.
[2659.40 --> 2662.52]  I mean, can you...
[2662.52 --> 2665.02]  The marketing for this just writes itself.
[2665.74 --> 2668.22]  Look up to the heavens for 7-Eleven.
[2669.00 --> 2669.40]  Oh.
[2669.56 --> 2669.80]  Yeah.
[2670.98 --> 2672.24]  You know what would be kind of great?
[2672.74 --> 2678.02]  If you're like out playing soccer or something, you just have like a Slurpee delivered to you.
[2678.02 --> 2678.84]  I know, right?
[2678.84 --> 2681.02]  So it took place on July 11th, actually.
[2681.76 --> 2688.14]  And they partnered with drone startup Flirty to make the delivery to a private residence in Reno, Nevada.
[2688.46 --> 2692.24]  They delivered a chicken sandwich, donuts, coffee, candy, and...
[2692.92 --> 2693.44]  Slurpees!
[2693.58 --> 2694.18]  Slurpees!
[2694.18 --> 2694.62]  Yes!
[2695.20 --> 2704.50]  The goods were packaged into two containers, each separately flown to the home, and the drone flew autonomously from the store to the household using GPS to navigate.
[2705.92 --> 2706.36]  Wow.
[2706.72 --> 2712.34]  So they've selected a store from which to deliver and surveyed customers within a one-mile radius to see if they'd be willing to take part.
[2712.84 --> 2722.50]  This is not the first delivery that Flirty has made, but it appears to be the first that a customer had placed as an order with the store and then had it delivered.
[2722.50 --> 2724.50]  Like the first sort of proper transaction.
[2724.80 --> 2725.30]  Yeah, yeah.
[2725.68 --> 2734.92]  7-Eleven said it plans to continue working with the drone company, but didn't lay out a timeline for rolling out the service to a wider region.
[2735.06 --> 2735.26]  Right.
[2735.72 --> 2736.66]  Pretty cool, eh?
[2736.84 --> 2737.22]  Yeah.
[2737.22 --> 2757.52]  I mean, we, in our, in my, like, still functional, somewhat, you know, aware adult lifetime, I could live to see a world where a self-driving car picks me up in the morning, I'm, like, hungry or whatever, and I go, okay, yeah, I want, like, a Subway sandwich.
[2757.78 --> 2759.08]  Here's my specs.
[2759.54 --> 2760.68]  Deliver it to my work.
[2760.68 --> 2771.14]  Like, I arrive at work in my self-driving car, having been on my phone the whole time, because by then I guess that law won't be in place anymore, unless you're driving it, in which case it's still better not to be on your cell phone.
[2771.16 --> 2773.20]  So that law wouldn't, has never been in place.
[2773.28 --> 2777.74]  But I could step out of my car, have a drone, basically drop a frickin' sandwich in my hand.
[2778.08 --> 2780.64]  I could walk in, sit at my desk, eat my sandwich.
[2781.32 --> 2785.58]  My car could be running around, carting other people around, making me money all day.
[2785.58 --> 2788.94]  Very possibly, in your lifetime, you might not have to go to work.
[2791.22 --> 2793.76]  Telecommuting is, like, a huge research section.
[2794.26 --> 2796.40]  Yeah, I don't know about it for this.
[2796.86 --> 2798.60]  Because I was kind of still planning to do this.
[2799.06 --> 2799.38]  Okay.
[2800.32 --> 2803.06]  You're wanting to be hosting when your career's ending?
[2803.94 --> 2804.88]  When my career's ending?
[2804.90 --> 2807.02]  No, I was thinking this could happen in, like, the next five to ten years.
[2807.48 --> 2811.10]  Yeah, but you were just talking, like, survivable lifespan.
[2811.10 --> 2815.58]  Oh, no, I mean, before I reach the point where I'm, like, all decrepit and I have no idea what's going on.
[2815.66 --> 2819.52]  Yeah, like, while I'm still about as functional as I am today, give or take.
[2819.68 --> 2819.92]  Okay.
[2820.56 --> 2821.28]  Yeah, yeah.
[2821.68 --> 2822.46]  That's pretty crazy.
[2822.64 --> 2823.12]  Loving it.
[2826.10 --> 2828.24]  Um, alright, I don't know how interesting that is.
[2828.38 --> 2828.94]  Sponsor spot.
[2829.72 --> 2830.10]  I'm sorry?
[2830.26 --> 2830.86]  Sponsor spot.
[2830.94 --> 2831.48]  We already did it.
[2831.72 --> 2832.10]  Did we?
[2832.16 --> 2832.54]  Dollar shave.
[2832.78 --> 2833.24]  Oh, yeah.
[2833.36 --> 2833.52]  Yeah.
[2833.78 --> 2834.44]  We did it early.
[2834.70 --> 2834.90]  Yeah.
[2835.06 --> 2835.62]  No, we didn't.
[2835.72 --> 2836.48]  No, we did it on time.
[2836.50 --> 2838.30]  We didn't start drastically up late.
[2838.54 --> 2838.76]  Yeah.
[2838.94 --> 2839.24]  Okay.
[2839.24 --> 2846.88]  The Xiaomi Mi Notebook Air is now official, and according to the WindowsCentral.com headline
[2846.88 --> 2850.02]  anyway, you will want to buy one.
[2850.50 --> 2857.00]  So, they're going after the 13.3-inch MacBook Air, and it's apparently 13% thinner.
[2857.04 --> 2858.10]  I haven't actually looked at this yet.
[2858.40 --> 2864.10]  13% thinner and 11% smaller while managing to offer a similar-sized screen.
[2864.22 --> 2865.88]  Their laptop is called the Notebook Air.
[2865.88 --> 2871.38]  They couldn't, like, be even slightly creative.
[2871.48 --> 2872.84]  Are they going to get sued for that?
[2873.12 --> 2878.52]  They should call it the Notebook Oxygen-Nitrogen-Carbon Dioxide mix mixture.
[2878.86 --> 2879.04]  Yeah.
[2879.20 --> 2880.94]  I kind of feel like they should get sued for that.
[2881.50 --> 2886.04]  So, it features a brushed aluminum body, laminated 13.3-inch full HD display, edge-to-edge
[2886.04 --> 2891.52]  glass, 6th generation Core i5, and an NVIDIA 940 MX card.
[2891.52 --> 2895.84]  So, it actually has a dedicated GPU, which, by the way, you won't be using to game on,
[2896.08 --> 2901.92]  but you could be using it to accelerate things like Adobe Premiere with, you know, Cineform
[2901.92 --> 2903.18]  codec video content.
[2903.50 --> 2903.62]  Yeah.
[2903.66 --> 2908.22]  Something that we have shown off in an Asus ZenBook in the past, though that ZenBook
[2908.22 --> 2910.04]  is not thinner than a MacBook Air.
[2910.16 --> 2910.88]  So, that's pretty cool.
[2910.88 --> 2918.26]  It's got two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI, one 3.5mm jack and a USB-C port, and there's no Xiaomi
[2918.26 --> 2923.02]  branding at the front, but you can customize the front of the notebook with stickers.
[2923.50 --> 2923.58]  Yeah.
[2924.20 --> 2924.68]  Very cool.
[2925.62 --> 2928.26]  So, here's kind of a cool look at, like, Starry Night.
[2928.60 --> 2930.24]  It has, like, a skin on it.
[2930.54 --> 2931.52]  Do they have the rights to that?
[2932.28 --> 2934.34]  Uh, I don't...
[2934.34 --> 2935.22]  There's a lot of...
[2935.22 --> 2935.48]  Who owns that?
[2935.48 --> 2938.32]  In this article, there's a lot of, like, you might need to be sued for that.
[2938.32 --> 2940.92]  But, like...
[2940.92 --> 2942.10]  It's China.
[2942.34 --> 2944.18]  So, like, Wild Wild Orient.
[2944.42 --> 2946.38]  Yeah, but are they going to sell this in other places?
[2947.26 --> 2947.60]  Yeah.
[2948.20 --> 2950.42]  So, yeah, they can get sued for that.
[2950.48 --> 2950.94]  I don't know.
[2951.58 --> 2952.50]  That's not my problem.
[2952.72 --> 2952.98]  No.
[2953.40 --> 2955.12]  But, like...
[2955.12 --> 2956.28]  So, this is...
[2956.28 --> 2959.52]  Oh, no mentions as of now regarding availability outside of China.
[2959.70 --> 2960.16]  There you go.
[2960.34 --> 2960.68]  Okay.
[2961.24 --> 2963.00]  So, China.
[2963.00 --> 2968.44]  Vizio acquired by Chinese tech company Leico for $2 billion.
[2969.18 --> 2975.92]  This is one of the sketchiest sponsor deals that we have ever turned down, by the way.
[2976.02 --> 2977.00]  You don't know about this.
[2977.00 --> 2979.60]  Um, but I actually...
[2980.18 --> 2980.72]  I...
[2980.72 --> 2985.08]  I'm at the point now where I don't even want to know who they were or why they cared.
[2985.26 --> 2995.96]  But someone approached us about doing a sponsored tweet, um, speculating that Vizio might be acquired, like, by a large tech company.
[2996.18 --> 2998.54]  And then putting, like, Google question mark?
[2998.68 --> 2999.88]  Apple question mark?
[3000.52 --> 3001.12]  Uh...
[3001.12 --> 3004.36]  And we were like, well, which one is it?
[3004.56 --> 3005.94]  And they're like, we can't tell you.
[3006.10 --> 3008.18]  And we're like, that's stupid.
[3008.92 --> 3010.00]  We're not doing that.
[3010.36 --> 3010.72]  Yeah.
[3010.88 --> 3013.80]  We don't know what your agenda is, but we don't like it.
[3014.14 --> 3015.22]  Don't talk to us anymore.
[3015.46 --> 3015.88]  Good call.
[3016.20 --> 3018.68]  Um, and basically...
[3018.68 --> 3022.30]  And, like, to be clear, guys, actually, this is something we almost never talk about.
[3022.30 --> 3025.92]  We almost never talk about sponsor deals that we turn down.
[3026.28 --> 3026.36]  Yeah.
[3026.82 --> 3030.36]  Um, but it happens a lot, because there's a lot of sketchy crap out there.
[3030.36 --> 3035.64]  Um, and it's really, it's really interesting for us, because we have that insider's perspective,
[3035.64 --> 3037.48]  seeing who took the deals.
[3038.00 --> 3038.44]  Oh!
[3038.94 --> 3044.72]  After, because, you know, like, we'll see a tweet that doesn't have a sponsored hashtag on it, or, like...
[3044.72 --> 3048.04]  And it's the exact copy from whoever, yeah.
[3048.34 --> 3048.58]  Yeah.
[3048.58 --> 3053.70]  So it's really interesting for us, seeing who's on the take and being upfront about it and who's not.
[3053.96 --> 3058.18]  Unfortunately, I'm not getting involved in that kind of stuff publicly.
[3058.18 --> 3058.96]  I'm sorry.
[3059.10 --> 3064.16]  I'm sure the Twitch chat is already full of people saying, whoa, why don't you guys say,
[3064.34 --> 3067.20]  no, not going to happen.
[3067.88 --> 3075.68]  Um, just not interested in, in being, like, the next sort of whatever drama channel.
[3076.20 --> 3080.74]  But, um, yeah, I'm really glad we didn't, we didn't take, we didn't take this one,
[3080.74 --> 3084.58]  because I just, I had a bad feeling about it, and I, I'm glad that I trusted myself.
[3084.76 --> 3085.00]  Yeah.
[3085.10 --> 3086.64]  And who the hell even is LaEco?
[3087.14 --> 3088.86]  Um, they're, they're, they're huge.
[3088.94 --> 3089.82]  They're, like, a big deal.
[3090.02 --> 3090.28]  Okay.
[3090.30 --> 3090.96]  But they're...
[3090.96 --> 3091.90]  Are they Google or Apple?
[3092.02 --> 3093.54]  No, they're not Google, they're not Apple.
[3093.54 --> 3093.84]  Interesting.
[3093.84 --> 3095.08]  But they're, they're Chinese, and they're a big deal.
[3095.08 --> 3096.52]  That's a pretty misleading tweet, then.
[3096.52 --> 3096.88]  Yeah.
[3097.52 --> 3107.64]  So, Vizio founder and CEO William Wang will continue to own 51%, and LaEco will own 49%
[3107.64 --> 3108.90]  of InScape.
[3109.90 --> 3112.14]  Uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3112.28 --> 3114.34]  So, Vizio will be operated as an independent subsidiary.
[3114.90 --> 3116.58]  Is Vizio still really, like, a thing?
[3117.40 --> 3119.24]  Uh, and that's Vizio's data business, by the way.
[3119.26 --> 3120.14]  Oh, yeah, Vizio's a thing.
[3120.22 --> 3125.50]  As far as I know, last time I checked, they were the number one TV maker in the U.S.
[3125.50 --> 3126.74]  Okay.
[3127.12 --> 3130.08]  Yeah, they're not, they're not really as much of a thing in Canada.
[3130.36 --> 3130.68]  Okay.
[3130.82 --> 3133.90]  Um, I don't know that they're still number one, but they were at one point.
[3133.98 --> 3135.18]  Maybe that's my problem.
[3135.40 --> 3136.78]  I don't shop for TVs.
[3137.54 --> 3137.98]  Yeah.
[3137.98 --> 3145.14]  The last TV I got, I traded a friend an H100 and some Dominator RAM for it.
[3146.82 --> 3150.08]  And the TV before that doesn't exist.
[3150.68 --> 3153.94]  So, that's my shopping for TVs experience.
[3153.94 --> 3155.90]  All right.
[3158.18 --> 3159.48]  Um, yeah.
[3159.74 --> 3162.16]  I don't really have much else to say about that.
[3163.82 --> 3165.28]  Are we, are we, is that it?
[3165.78 --> 3166.42]  Is that the show?
[3166.62 --> 3168.08]  Is that everything interesting that happened this week?
[3168.08 --> 3168.40]  I don't know.
[3168.48 --> 3171.16]  Apple sold its billionth iPhone, so, like, good for them, I guess.
[3171.36 --> 3171.98]  Good job.
[3173.18 --> 3176.28]  Dota 2 released full VR spectator suite.
[3176.28 --> 3177.44]  It's kind of terrifying, actually.
[3177.44 --> 3180.36]  Like, one iPhone for every seven people on Earth.
[3181.28 --> 3185.40]  Well, not, mm, it's a weird way to look at it.
[3185.70 --> 3189.56]  Because a lot of people would have just been replacing iPhones.
[3189.56 --> 3189.96]  Oh, no, I know.
[3190.28 --> 3192.40]  I don't mean one out of every seven people on Earth owns an iPhone.
[3192.40 --> 3201.58]  I just mean, like, if you walk, if you were to, like, walk down the street, one out of every seven of, like, as you just, like, walk and look at people.
[3201.96 --> 3206.52]  Like, every time you walk by seven people, like, an iPhone rolls off of a factory line.
[3206.52 --> 3209.08]  Like, that's kind of the visual that I had in my head.
[3212.10 --> 3213.66]  That makes sense.
[3214.58 --> 3215.66]  Oh, this is interesting.
[3215.66 --> 3218.92]  So, the original article here is from Overclock3D.net.
[3219.60 --> 3225.80]  NVIDIA's Pascal Titan X will not feature faster FP64 or FP16 performance.
[3226.22 --> 3230.48]  So, this was one of the marks of the original Titan, was that it could handle double precision.
[3231.40 --> 3235.80]  I think not quite as well as a Quadro, but better than a GeForce, if I recall correctly.
[3236.52 --> 3239.76]  And so, it was popular for CUDA programmers.
[3240.02 --> 3241.36]  It was for more than just gaming.
[3242.76 --> 3250.54]  But, the new Titan X will be much like its Maxwell predecessor, and it will not have that feature.
[3250.68 --> 3255.06]  It is just an ultra-powerful gaming GPU and nothing more.
[3258.88 --> 3260.02]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3260.50 --> 3262.82]  I guess that's pretty much all I have to say at this point.
[3263.66 --> 3265.12]  It's been kind of a tiring week.
[3265.12 --> 3268.06]  I have finished, like, nothing this week.
[3268.68 --> 3270.54]  But I have a lot of stuff on the go.
[3271.00 --> 3277.02]  I've got my USB Type-C versus Micro-B head-to-head real-world how-many-plugs comparison.
[3277.56 --> 3284.66]  I've got a really cool idea for reducing the size and weight of the tether on the HTC Vive.
[3284.66 --> 3287.24]  So, I've got that rolling right now.
[3287.34 --> 3289.74]  I've got the Predator G1 desktop from Acer.
[3290.08 --> 3292.62]  I've got the Gigabyte Aero 14 laptop.
[3293.40 --> 3294.22]  I've got...
[3294.22 --> 3297.10]  I'm sure there's other stuff that I've got on the go right now.
[3297.18 --> 3299.02]  But, like, this week has just been frustrating.
[3299.40 --> 3303.08]  Because I've worked on so much, but finished nothing.
[3304.02 --> 3305.98]  I've got what CPU should I buy?
[3306.24 --> 3307.36]  I'm finally...
[3307.36 --> 3309.48]  I can't believe I never did it before.
[3309.94 --> 3312.36]  But I'm finally doing what CPU should I buy?
[3312.42 --> 3318.64]  So, I've compiled this ginormous, like, comparative database that I can use to kind of go, this one.
[3319.18 --> 3321.26]  If you're this person, this one.
[3321.26 --> 3324.68]  And, like, have that be, like, a really good final answer.
[3326.54 --> 3331.22]  I got mostly scripted on three videos.
[3331.56 --> 3334.64]  And then reached out for a comment from a particular company.
[3335.10 --> 3337.30]  And they pushed it back.
[3337.82 --> 3339.94]  And then I pushed for that meeting.
[3340.08 --> 3341.46]  And then they pushed it back again.
[3341.46 --> 3348.52]  So, I just, like, wasn't able to do those three videos.
[3349.50 --> 3351.22]  Which were, like, two reviews.
[3351.36 --> 3353.90]  And then one, like, what the hell is going on with this thing video.
[3355.10 --> 3357.26]  So, I lost, like, all my videos for this week.
[3357.88 --> 3360.00]  So, that's cool.
[3361.42 --> 3364.08]  Although, that means there will be easy videos later.
[3364.40 --> 3364.76]  Yeah.
[3365.22 --> 3366.34]  But work isn't wasted.
[3366.56 --> 3366.90]  Yeah.
[3367.10 --> 3368.46]  Which is nice, I guess.
[3368.46 --> 3372.20]  There's another really frustrating one for me.
[3372.82 --> 3376.64]  The Pimp My Wi-Fi episode two.
[3377.38 --> 3380.34]  Basically, that call that I had just before we started the show.
[3380.46 --> 3382.76]  That was actually one of the reasons the show was a little late today.
[3383.20 --> 3387.08]  That call that I had confirmed that the problem is TELUS.
[3388.10 --> 3388.48]  Really?
[3389.04 --> 3393.68]  Once again, in my life, TELUS has managed to screw me.
[3394.50 --> 3394.94]  Yep.
[3395.50 --> 3396.92]  So, the wiring.
[3396.92 --> 3397.36]  What is it?
[3397.72 --> 3398.00]  Sorry?
[3398.00 --> 3398.62]  What is it?
[3398.82 --> 3404.52]  Basically, the problems that he was having with the system were not related to my system
[3404.52 --> 3406.14]  that I put in with help from Ubiquity.
[3406.72 --> 3408.14]  That's running great.
[3408.78 --> 3413.74]  But his internet keeps bugging out because, and they've even replaced his modem at this
[3413.74 --> 3416.06]  point, but because the, like, wiring is bad.
[3416.34 --> 3421.10]  And there's a technician coming tomorrow, which is a Saturday, which means that whatever's
[3421.10 --> 3423.06]  wrong with it must be super wrong with it.
[3423.06 --> 3423.16]  Yeah.
[3423.16 --> 3426.40]  Because TELUS normally does not come out on a Saturday that I'm aware of.
[3426.54 --> 3426.66]  Yeah.
[3426.66 --> 3428.72]  All right.
[3429.32 --> 3433.32]  Oh, also, someone in the chat speculated that what I was talking about was a Titan XP.
[3433.58 --> 3434.36]  It is not.
[3434.36 --> 3438.18]  I also got completely dodged on that at this point.
[3438.18 --> 3439.60]  I think they're just not giving us one.
[3440.24 --> 3440.86]  Oh, really?
[3441.38 --> 3441.68]  Yeah.
[3441.92 --> 3442.16]  Wow.
[3442.16 --> 3443.74]  I asked three times, I think.
[3443.82 --> 3444.38]  No response.
[3444.90 --> 3445.48]  Oh, okay.
[3446.48 --> 3446.88]  So.
[3446.88 --> 3449.68]  It's, like, available in, like, three days or something, isn't it?
[3449.80 --> 3450.54]  August 2nd.
[3450.66 --> 3450.88]  Yeah.
[3451.02 --> 3451.32]  Okay.
[3451.96 --> 3452.36]  So.
[3453.54 --> 3454.44]  I don't know.
[3457.54 --> 3459.02]  Well, thanks for tuning in, guys.
[3459.10 --> 3460.30]  We'll see you again next week.
[3460.40 --> 3462.22]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3462.22 --> 3465.80]  I gotta say, it was pretty refreshing not having any technical issues on the show.
[3467.14 --> 3469.00]  Huge shout out to Epiphan.
[3469.20 --> 3471.60]  And you guys can get used to hearing this over the next little bit.
[3471.66 --> 3473.32]  Because they didn't do, like, a formal sponsorship.
[3473.70 --> 3475.78]  But they did provide us with the capture equipment.
[3476.28 --> 3479.22]  And I did say that I would definitely be giving them a shout out.
[3479.22 --> 3483.74]  We're actually planning still to rebuild the WAN streaming PC.
[3484.06 --> 3485.84]  So that's still gonna be a thing that happens.
[3486.02 --> 3491.70]  And I'm gonna give you guys more details once we've been through a number of seamless shows
[3491.70 --> 3494.00]  on the new capture cards that are just working properly.
[3494.38 --> 3497.86]  I'll give you guys all the full details about what we're using for the setup here.
[3498.20 --> 3498.22]  So.
[3498.42 --> 3498.56]  Yeah.
[3498.84 --> 3499.68]  There you go, guys.
[3501.06 --> 3502.54]  Apparently the audio's messed up now.
[3502.72 --> 3502.86]  Well.
[3503.24 --> 3504.68]  A bunch of people are asking for after party.
[3504.78 --> 3506.92]  I will be doing mine, like I normally do.
[3507.00 --> 3508.56]  And I will be going home, because I'm tired.
[3508.56 --> 3509.82]  It's really hot.
[3510.14 --> 3510.30]  Yeah.
[3510.50 --> 3511.50]  It's like super hot.
[3511.50 --> 3513.16]  And sunburns make you really tired.
[3514.24 --> 3516.56]  What the science is behind that?
[3517.04 --> 3517.56]  Sorry?
[3517.90 --> 3523.00]  I wonder what the, like, science is, or biology is behind sunburns making you really tired.
[3527.50 --> 3528.24]  Yeah, yeah.
[3528.30 --> 3529.74]  But why do you get, like, tired?
[3529.74 --> 3530.88]  I don't know.
[3531.54 --> 3532.20]  I don't know.
[3538.56 --> 3540.18]  Shaving steps.
[3540.18 --> 3540.22]  Shaving steps.
