[0.00 → 7.28] the peg tops for these we're live which are very cool by the way they are yeah maybe a video about
[7.28 → 14.56] that eventually yes, yes maybe eventually welcome my friends to the wand show the show on the internet
[15.20 → 22.48] that's the joke after all wand show yeah why Darien no one got it at this point almost no
[22.48 → 26.96] well no, no I remember when we first changed the name which is hilarious everyone hated the
[26.96 → 33.44] name wand show I bet most of you don't even remember I missed the days when it was the live stream when
[33.44 → 40.64] it didn't have all these production values and 3d printed microphone holders with screw the garage
[40.64 → 46.16] I liked the kitchen or the living room screw the kitchen I liked the whatever was before the
[46.16 → 55.68] kitchen with the bookshelves and changes never good why get off my lawn um all right so uh oh wow yeah
[55.68 → 62.00] I've got people talking in the uh talking in the chat about who's wearing their wan hoodies
[62.72 → 66.80] yes the wan hoodies have finally dropped mine's actually at home
[67.68 → 76.24] mine's at home I do have to wash it occasionally also short sleeves like it is finally getting to be
[76.24 → 81.20] the real spring going on over here it's interesting I noticed excited because I do thermal
[81.20 → 84.88] testing in the warehouse and the warehouse doesn't really have liked it has heating things, but they're
[84.88 → 90.32] usually off um you can track like what season the video came out in based on the ambient temperatures
[90.32 → 95.36] in the warehouse because in the winter it was like 16 degrees now it's like 22 it's like oh okay
[96.00 → 102.08] I really hope it doesn't get like too hot in here in the summer probably going to you know what last
[102.08 → 109.36] summer it was somewhat bearable on the days when we didn't open up the bays and we have the window
[109.36 → 115.84] coverings now that's because like my office someone walked into my office uh yesterday terryn
[115.84 → 122.32] came into my office yesterday before we shot the channel super fun, and he was like holy crap it's hot
[122.32 → 130.96] in here I had the I had the window cover open for about seven minutes when before I beams right in
[130.96 → 138.00] there before I got them that office was like a sauna it was horrible I hate that it was absolutely
[138.00 → 143.36] horrible so much and to be clear guys we have an air conditioning setup yeah, but you don't air
[143.36 → 150.24] condition a warehouse generally speaking it's not unless you're like a cold storage place yeah do you
[150.24 → 156.80] have any idea how balling it would be to uh air condition the entire warehouse have you been up on the
[156.80 → 162.16] roof no okay so the two air conditioning units you can like you can like to see them up there so we have
[162.16 → 168.32] two air conditioning units each of which are about double the size of this table um and that is just
[168.32 → 173.44] for the office space which is only about a third of the entire space in here so we would have to have
[173.44 → 177.76] like six air conditioning units or much larger ones in order to air condition the warehouse which is
[177.76 → 181.52] insane, and it's huge amounts of money lots of electricity yeah, so there 's's a
[181.52 → 188.32] 100 ongoing costs suck yes, so there's that even when you live in bc and your power is pretty
[188.32 → 195.12] cheap because everything's just falling water it still sucks one time costs are good yeah things like
[195.12 → 200.96] buying a camera like in the grand scheme of things evens a five thousand dollar camera is not that bad
[200.96 → 206.80] hiring an employee for you know let's say oh I don't know twenty-five hundred or three thousand
[206.80 → 211.60] dollars a month let me tell you that adds up extremely quickly especially murder I can't
[211.60 → 216.64] remember two months in you're already way past and then like with the stuff that employers have
[216.64 → 220.96] to pay for different various things possibly one month, and you know what's BS with the camera
[220.96 → 222.96] I pay for it once I can use it forever
[225.68 → 231.84] it turns out employees are nothing like slaves the second you stop paying them they stop working in fact
[231.84 → 235.92] if you terminate them it is customary to pay them to keep working for another two weeks even
[235.92 → 244.88] though they don't do it anyway we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today uh tesla announced
[244.88 → 253.12] the model three yay dun don't dun, although you'll have to wait a while if you want one yes more on
[253.12 → 259.44] that in a little while oh this is interesting lawmakers pushing to make owning an unregistered prepaid phone
[259.44 → 267.76] illegal in the United States of a teleportation from Microsoft that's all I'm going to say is hollow
[267.76 → 275.20] hortation anything is better with hortation at the end yeah, yeah like uh like transportation
[275.76 → 281.68] that's a little boring maybe yeah that's not always um planes trains automobiles yeah that's a great movie
[281.68 → 287.04] yes anyway you don't even know that's a movie do you know that's I don't know you didn't know who
[287.04 → 293.28] Tom Hanks was I you didn't know Harrison Ford played Han Solo right oh okay those are misquotes and not
[293.28 → 301.12] fair okay you know what's great about the internet speaking of quotes no they can go watch mr Gabe Newell
[301.12 → 309.92] once said that you can't lie to the internet yes you did not know Harrison Ford I know who Harrison Ford is
[309.92 → 315.76] I forgot his name in context when talking about Han Solo it's still inexcusable, but that's not how
[315.76 → 327.04] it happened that's why I said a misquote god won't you misquote another topic um in uh Intel earrodwell
[327.04 → 335.84] IP branched there I misquoted a topic which was intel Bradwell no you're done intro's rolling you're done
[335.84 → 340.96] and when it's done rolling he won't be there
[351.44 → 356.56] okay no, no see there's a problem with this there's a there's a big problem with this so I'm going to have
[356.56 → 361.84] to fix this here we've got we've got ourselves a problem I'm just gonna hold on i have to just
[361.84 → 370.72] there we go yeah okay oh no, no he's back okay yeah good enough his feet can stay that's it you're done
[373.92 → 380.24] oh what am I trying to do right now oh yeah sponsors square's maze oh he's back
[380.24 → 382.72] wait hold on I have to fix this there we go
[388.16 → 393.36] all right so I get get back in here get back so that what you said wasn't going to be
[393.36 → 396.96] uh a misquote so I had to not be there yeah because then we'd have to get rid of me and
[396.96 → 400.56] then there would be no and that's a problem do you know how many when shows in a row
[400.56 → 408.80] we have done on Fridays whether it's you know Christmas or new years which I think both fell
[408.80 → 414.16] on Fridays this year we kind of fake out the Christmas April fools we did fake it on Thursday
[414.16 → 419.92] that's true we did we did every other one we honestly haven't faked it yep i I don't
[419.92 → 425.12] think we've I don't think we yeah I don't think we've ever actually claimed it was a live broadcast when
[425.12 → 430.32] it wasn't any I've had people in the chat be like this isn't live there's no way it's live then I'll
[430.32 → 436.48] like reply to them in chat, and then they're like oh okay really that actually happens like quite a
[436.48 → 441.44] bit oh it'll be some holiday, and they'll be like there's no way they came into work it's like actually
[441.44 → 446.40] we did there's been a few times when we'll move when we get the holiday so like we'll take the holiday
[446.40 → 451.28] on the Monday or instead of the Friday or there's been other times when we just come into work at like
[451.28 → 456.96] four yep I think we did that I think we only did that once but Luke and I did do one day when just
[456.96 → 461.44] he and I came in no one else was in the office we hosted the wan show and then we placed out it was
[461.44 → 466.24] a beautiful day if I recall correctly it was actually yeah yeah I think it must have been like bc day or
[466.24 → 472.16] family day or something like that, and we're just like yeah it's really hot in this room, and it's really
[472.16 → 479.52] gorgeous outside we had to like to listen to the kids walking yeah anyway speaking of gorgeous outside
[479.52 → 488.80] the original article was posted on the forum by Maybach 123 yes I have tesla model 3 announced
[488.80 → 496.32] the release is set for 2017 which is a very, very generous headline courtesy of the verge because uh
[496.32 → 505.60] I think what musk actually said was that production will be starting in late 2017 with the plan being to
[505.60 → 512.64] actually deliver cars by the end of 2017. At least a few which is yeah which based on how many
[512.64 → 518.40] people have pre-ordered the damn thing already probably doesn't mean that everyone who pre-orders
[518.40 → 524.16] is getting one right off the hop no, no definitely not like i I wouldn't expect it to be any different
[524.16 → 528.56] than their other launches where they're just going to go in order their pre-order list so okay what do you
[528.56 → 538.40] think the very front okay so what I think it looks ugly okay but because you said speaking of beautiful
[538.40 → 542.72] I was like yeah I'm not much no I'm not much of an I'm not much of a car guy so I generally don't have
[542.72 → 552.08] much of an opinion about a car okay, but this looks jarring and unattractive to me but I think I understand
[552.08 → 557.76] why again maybe because well it looks like it kind of crashed into a wall maybe because I'm not a car
[557.76 → 566.08] guy because I'm looking at it, i I like to think very objectively and I think what I don't like
[566.08 → 571.12] about it is just that the grill is missing I understand why the grill is not there you don't
[571.12 → 576.24] need one you don't need one for an electric car there's no there's no radiator there's no heater core
[576.24 → 580.32] well oh no there is a heater core probably but I guess that would just be handled down here or something
[580.32 → 586.64] anyway, anyway like i I get why it's ugly, and it has kind of uh it has kind of a Porsche look to it
[586.64 → 591.20] a little bit to me like the okay I see it like the hood has kind of like a Porsche look to it
[593.28 → 599.28] Brandon says it looks like a Panama to him but I think if you shopped a grill onto it
[599.28 → 603.36] yeah all of a sudden I didn't think about the girl thing at all until you brought it wouldn't look so
[603.36 → 610.24] unnatural to people and I think car people who find beauty in every line and every aspect of a car are
[610.24 → 615.68] used to seeing something it's like it's like let's say a very beautiful woman who didn't have a nose
[617.36 → 624.56] maybe she's still beautiful, but you're looking for you're looking for the elements that make
[624.56 → 630.80] the person a human and well and if something's missing its I think it's jarring but then at the
[630.80 → 634.48] same time you're going to get people that want jarring, so people are going to really like this
[634.48 → 639.52] yes there's people that might be super into the chick with no nose it is like it but yeah exactly when i
[639.52 → 644.96] first saw this I thought it looked especially probably because of the lighting in that photo
[644.96 → 650.40] if you want to jump back there and share it yeah sure um so I'm assuming it's especially because this
[650.40 → 654.64] specific photo is the only time that I've been like oh I don't really like it, but you can see
[654.64 → 660.80] right along the edge here it's its I'm gonna yeah I can't really so right along there you can see the
[660.80 → 666.24] line from the lighting, and it makes it look like this super harsh angle it does it look like it was like
[666.24 → 672.00] angle folded in yeah and like it was smashed into a wall and I don't really like that but in profile
[672.00 → 676.24] pictures it doesn't look nearly as bad so I think it's because of the lighting in that one photo
[676.80 → 684.00] interesting it looks it looks like super bent in and awkward and I know like uh Brandon brought up the
[684.00 → 688.96] Panama and there are some Porsche cars that do kind of do that, but then there's something going on
[688.96 → 694.88] there whether it's a grill or something an opening I know they have the opening at the bottom but it
[694.88 → 698.64] doesn't really look the same it still looks like a pretty harsh edge it still does look like it still
[698.64 → 703.60] does look like you know it looks like someone took a styrofoam cutter just cut off the front of the car
[704.40 → 709.28] yeah I can see it, and you know what like the thing is that if there was a grill on there
[710.16 → 715.60] it wouldn't bother you I bet probably because you could even have the grill come it could even be
[715.60 → 719.60] concave I mean concave grills are a thing yeah you could have a concave grill right there and it
[719.60 → 723.04] would look totally natural but I think it's I think it's like the nose analogy is pretty good
[723.76 → 728.16] where it's just like the nose isn't there yes, and you're looking for something you're expecting and
[728.16 → 734.08] you end up with like it kind of looks bland here like I'm expecting yeah because the grill is
[734.08 → 739.84] is an accent piece I mean that's why you that's why you call you know the gold teeth nonsense that's
[739.84 → 745.60] why you call it a grill it's like right it's a fancy it's a dressed up element of a vehicle, and it's
[745.60 → 756.08] missing on this car um the registration plate will be there yeah I don't know how much that's gonna
[756.08 → 760.96] help yeah a good point, and thank you for bringing that up but I don't know how much it'll help it's
[760.96 → 767.84] going to be such a small thing, and it's very overlooked on a lot of cars anyway yeah it surprises me that
[767.84 → 773.44] for the sake of fuel economy they don't have like an air scoop that filters air through the car or something
[773.44 → 778.48] like that like you uh like it is looks like a very blunt nose but I'm sure the engineers at tesla
[778.48 → 783.28] thought of i was just going to say I'm sure there's some logic behind the like even aerodynamics of it
[783.28 → 787.60] having a straight wall doesn't normally seem like a great idea for that but I'm sure there's something
[787.60 → 793.36] going on there I mean it's one of those things where it's not until you, it's not until you sit in
[793.36 → 798.88] a better engineered car that you appreciate certain things about it like I had uh the first vehicle
[798.88 → 803.92] that I ever sat in that I noticed this on like my family always had North American vehicles
[803.92 → 810.08] and so the first car I ever noticed this on was a Volkswagen Jetta of some sort some model it was
[810.08 → 815.76] a long time ago and I marvelled that when I opened the windows when I unrolled them in the rain
[816.56 → 824.72] the rain didn't drip inside the car and I was like leave it to the Germans to figure out how you can
[824.72 → 830.32] open your window like as long as it's not torrential downpour or like coming in that way yes or
[830.32 → 837.20] angled yeah how to have the water kind of fly past the car instead of like going right into the window
[837.20 → 841.68] and soaking whoever's in the back seat I was like this is amazing I think it was a 91 Jetta and i I don't
[841.68 → 847.44] I suspect that not every Volkswagen or and it could have been by chance could have been entirely by
[847.44 → 854.80] chance although I doubt it yeah um so it is blows me away the number of things that go into
[854.80 → 860.16] something as that's seemingly as simple to the untrained viewer as the body design of a car where
[860.16 → 866.00] you just kind of go yeah it must just be for looks right no manufacturer ability yeah uh aerodynamics
[866.00 → 870.80] things like keeping the freaking rain off of people absolutely, absolutely stunning the amount of work
[870.80 → 877.28] that goes into something like this um being said I think the rest of the car is very good-looking
[878.16 → 884.80] I think the rest of the car is actually very plain looking for a 35 000 car though brand-new okay so
[884.80 → 890.24] here I'm gonna I'm going to do this I'm going to put us here does that not pretty much look like the butt
[890.24 → 896.08] end of my civic I just like the little tesla badge to be completely honest you just like the tesla badge
[896.88 → 903.76] really you don't like this no i I just like oh you just like that that's it not dislike okay so
[903.76 → 908.72] I didn't know like because when you covered it up I was like kind of boring so like that's probably
[908.72 → 916.56] that's probably a significant part of it you are so freaking shallow if you look at the back too though
[916.56 → 921.44] I think there's like a cool window thing going on uh yeah okay so no they've uh verge has another has
[921.44 → 926.16] another shot of it um here let's go ahead I'm just gonna because I liked that cool I thought
[926.16 → 932.32] yeah so that's pretty cool okay so it's one continuous piece of glass all the way from the
[932.32 → 936.88] front of the windshield to the back of the windshield and this is a five-star safety rating
[936.88 → 941.52] I was going to say this is another thing that kind of blows me away because musk has come right out and
[941.52 → 948.80] said that it will be one of the safest cars available and I'm kind of giant piece of glass over
[948.80 → 952.96] everyone and I'm kind of going I mean this is something people don't think about because how
[952.96 → 962.24] often do you pick up you know a six-foot-long piece of glass not very often no freaking heavy oh yeah i
[962.24 → 970.24] had to put the door back on my uh my glass enclosed shower thing at home with the help of my with the
[970.24 → 979.36] help of my wife and like it was all we could do to get it on crooked it's on crooked now and I was like
[979.36 → 984.08] she wanted to take it off, and it was one of those like husband and wife things where you know she's
[984.08 → 990.00] wrong, and you know you're going to regret it, but you do it anyway because you're just like yes you're right
[990.00 → 995.92] dear it is very, very important indeed to you know clean the thing under the hinge or whatever stupid
[995.92 → 1004.72] asinine thing it is that we're doing right now um let's take it off, and so we did and I regretted it
[1004.72 → 1011.28] and so did she so now it actually doesn't close anymore no but it kind of mostly closes get splash
[1011.28 → 1017.28] or anything no okay no it is functionally functional but not aesthetically functional it is functionally
[1017.28 → 1022.64] yes, thank you for that yeah I knew what I said was dumb as soon as I said it but uh but I like anyway
[1022.64 → 1027.12] the instant replay was much appreciated coming back to the car I do like that part a lot it
[1027.12 → 1035.28] looks really cool I worry about it in crashes and stuff yeah I mean if he's i I mean the model s is a
[1035.28 → 1043.12] shockingly safe car it is and this is a five-star safety rating so like I don't know again that just
[1043.12 → 1051.92] seems like I mean so many the thing about modern cars is that what has made them so safe speeds on
[1051.92 → 1058.80] highways have gone up the speeds that people travel have gone up the incidents of injury and death
[1058.80 → 1067.12] and collisions have gone down dramatically in the last 50 years and crumple zones that's been the answer
[1067.12 → 1075.92] is let the car take the brunt of it and I don't understand how glass factors into a crumple zone unless
[1075.92 → 1082.88] it is that cubing glass that you find on automobiles where it's designed to go okay
[1083.52 → 1092.16] I'm dead and disintegrate into a bazillion pieces but why would you want that type of glass above the
[1092.16 → 1097.44] driver and the passenger I thought it would be windshield glass well that would be that's that's
[1097.44 → 1105.68] that kind oh I thought you're okay yeah so it's either designed to be rigid in which case um
[1107.20 → 1113.28] it seems like a problem yeah, or it's designed to shatter into a bazillion pieces in which case
[1113.28 → 1117.68] but windshield glass holds together when it shatters it visibly shatters, but it holds together
[1117.68 → 1122.72] windshield glass hold on maybe I'm thinking is it side glass then side glass am I thinking of side glass
[1122.72 → 1127.84] blows the hell up because okay my mom had a while I was in the car had a rock come through her back
[1127.84 → 1133.52] glass same thing right exploded window is gone the front of the window you can beat the crap out of
[1133.52 → 1137.92] the front of a car window, and it'll just no you're right because you can like to stick a bat through them
[1138.56 → 1146.56] okay so but either way then either answer I don't understand I think I understand windshield glass a lot
[1146.56 → 1152.64] more no, no but so you think this is windshield glass yeah okay I get like I mean then in that
[1152.64 → 1157.20] case yeah and what someone just said roofs aren't part of crumple zones it would be your trunk and
[1157.20 → 1163.68] your front that's true okay that's true so as long as you don't get hit by a semi the theory would be
[1163.68 → 1170.24] then that the crumple in which case you're doomed anyway yeah, so the theory would be then that the
[1170.24 → 1179.20] crumple zone wouldn't actually reach the roof things that kind of worry me uh outside of that are if you
[1179.20 → 1185.12] get T-boned yes and your door like by something big yeah and the door frame like if you get hit by
[1185.12 → 1190.08] uh by a SUV like a truck or a SUV or something and the like upper part of your door frame bends
[1190.80 → 1197.20] but then if it's made of windshield glass then it should just visibly explode but yeah mostly hold it
[1197.20 → 1202.48] assuming it's affixed very securely here and here which it kind of looks the idea would be that
[1202.48 → 1208.72] it could basically dent in without necessarily creating a disastrous rain of glass layered I think
[1208.72 → 1212.72] there's like glass and then plastic and then glass like laminated yeah I don't remember exactly what
[1212.72 → 1217.04] it is don't quote me on that I would look it up it's kind of cool actually, but it should
[1217.04 → 1221.76] visibly shatter like crazy but then kind of hold this shape to the point where if I remember correctly
[1221.76 → 1226.56] I've seen videos of people like pulling it, and it like bends, but it still holds its shape and like will
[1227.36 → 1232.08] visibly blow up but still hold this shape I don't remember what the exact combination of things is but
[1232.96 → 1237.60] it's their like guys stop you know nothing about glass well that's welcome to the wan show that's
[1237.60 → 1241.28] true um all right so let's talk about some of the other things we do know about the car price is
[1241.28 → 1249.60] looking to start at 35 000 which puts it right smack in range of the new bolt that uh hold on volt and
[1249.60 → 1256.16] volt the volt that Chevy was no wait no bolt that Chevy was showing off at the auto show that i just
[1256.16 → 1262.00] attended oh that is so confusing so yeah Chevy volt is the hybrid which is a plug-in
[1262.00 → 1269.20] hybrid starting 2017 and then the bolt is the pure electric um so Chevy is saying that the bolt will
[1269.20 → 1275.76] be subbed 30 000 in the U.S. assuming that you get the full federal uh tax credit which I think can be as
[1275.76 → 1285.92] much as 7 500 okay but if you are in a lower income bracket you won't necessarily be able to take advantage of it
[1285.92 → 1294.96] because it is a tax refund so it assumes that you paid 7 500 in taxes, and then they refund that okay um
[1294.96 → 1302.56] um it will deliver at least 215 miles of range, although we are a long way out from when the car
[1302.56 → 1311.68] is actually shipping um which is end of 2017. Elon Musk fairly confident according to our notes here
[1311.68 → 1316.00] that deliveries will begin by the end of 2017 so they've got time to tune it means like nothing and
[1316.00 → 1321.20] that's very similar to what Chevy is quoting on the bolt actually it's really it was actually kind of fun
[1321.20 → 1326.56] doing the auto show even though like again I'm not really a car guy because I got to talk to so many
[1326.56 → 1330.00] people that I have like little snippets of information that are actually relevant to what
[1330.00 → 1333.12] we're talking about right now for a change I don't have to kind of sit there and be like
[1334.64 → 1342.56] during the car topics um it's also fairly comparable to uh Hyundai's ionic which is I believe
[1342.56 → 1349.20] shipping now in Korea and coming soon to North America so um yeah really cool car have you seen the
[1349.20 → 1355.60] ionic no three different drive trains uh traditional hybrid plug-in hybrid so with like um I think it's
[1355.60 → 1362.24] about a 22 or 25 mile or 18 somewhere in the 18 to 25 mile pure electric range and then it
[1362.24 → 1368.88] switches over to a gas motor for a gas engine and then a pure electric so three different drive trains
[1368.88 → 1376.24] of otherwise the same basic car very interesting car oh so you can buy okay I was like why the hell would
[1376.24 → 1381.92] you ever do that no, no no, no no, no it's like yeah hot swap drive trains like that just sounds
[1381.92 → 1390.16] needlessly expensive for so many reasons okay yeah um so that's really this is great so the the the
[1390.16 → 1395.12] pre-orders in our notes are 130 000 although I think you were saying musk has tweeted a number that's higher
[1395.12 → 1407.04] than that uh someone about this uh model three pre-orders yay for having computers are 7.5 billion
[1407.84 → 1415.52] worth of model 3 pre-orders in 24 hours 20 hours ago it was uh past the 150 000 mark
[1418.56 → 1425.04] so hold on a second let's let's whip out the old uh calculative here oh here we go 180 000 cars
[1425.84 → 1432.88] now the craziest thing about this and this is really cool this is really smart is that those
[1432.88 → 1441.36] people did more than just kind of uh you know uh answer a straw poll on the internet or like a
[1441.36 → 1447.84] Facebook event invitation right yeah yeah yeah they paid a thousand dollars each for the
[1447.84 → 1454.08] like actually legit pre-ordered it crazy and what's really cool about that is I was actually talking to
[1454.08 → 1462.24] Brandon when we were at the car show about how much cash tesla has burned over the last 18 months
[1462.24 → 1467.60] it's like over a billion dollars like they're actually I believe they are they could be it's
[1467.60 → 1471.44] somewhere in they have somewhere in the neighbourhood of one billion dollars of cash left
[1471.44 → 1475.52] don't quote me on that exact number, but they're burning through it so fast that I was talking to
[1475.52 → 1480.16] Brandon I was like yeah like they're going to run out at some point here so they're going to have to go
[1480.16 → 1489.52] back for another round of investment or something brilliant idea take pre-orders you know uh 20 months
[1489.52 → 1497.20] in advance and that actually just put a significant amount of cash into the company that actually lets
[1497.20 → 1503.76] them run for not an insubstantial amount of time to continue developing the model 3 while they are
[1503.76 → 1509.92] still not able to actually ship cars I mean you know do do do the i I should be able to do this in
[1509.92 → 1517.20] my head and I feel bad so the 7.5 billion is the total if everyone paid full price for the car which i
[1517.20 → 1521.92] don't even think is uh possible right now so it's about 180 million dollars yeah so that's the cash
[1521.92 → 1530.32] injection they just got as effectively as uh like an uh uh uh kickstarter towards the model
[1530.32 → 1535.68] 3 except that you don't actually have to pay the full amount yeah, and they don't have to give kickstarter
[1535.68 → 1543.68] a cut yeah so that is an incredible chunk of uh chunk of molar in order to uh in order to get things
[1543.68 → 1549.28] in order to get things rolling over the next little bit oh this is great USA today has pre-orders
[1549.28 → 1558.72] topping 198 000 as of two hours later than the verge like check this out this is very much a developing
[1558.72 → 1567.44] story how many pre-orders tesla is getting oh my on the model 3 wow um I can't share topics right
[1567.44 → 1573.84] now because firefax that's basically what it is doing right now fail fox um Firefox is
[1573.84 → 1578.72] completely crashed uh I can do it give me a moment uh which one are we which one are we linking
[1578.72 → 1585.52] here just uh I was gonna I was gonna share some of the statistics sites um but for this oh I think
[1585.52 → 1591.28] I already shared the car oh okay then we're good um okay, so five adults will fit comfortably in the
[1591.28 → 1598.64] model 3 and comfortably is apparently the important part here um all model 3 cars will support tesla's
[1598.64 → 1603.76] high-speed supercharging network as well as feature the hardware which is interesting they
[1603.76 → 1609.36] specifically said the hardware for autonomous driving features um so it's possible you will
[1609.36 → 1614.40] end up having to pay more in order to enable the software unlock of it but what's cool about it
[1614.40 → 1619.36] coming with the hardware is it means that you could potentially uh buy that later on down the line
[1619.36 → 1623.76] which is a lot easier to swallow for people and would be really cool for things like the resale value
[1623.76 → 1628.96] of this type of vehicle so if you kind of go no I want to drive my car myself but hey you're looking
[1628.96 → 1634.48] to sell it and someone else wanted the autonomous version hey that's that's pretty cool you can just
[1634.48 → 1640.88] download that kit of the car all models will apparently feature the full safety suite so all of
[1640.88 → 1647.76] the safety features and um shoot there was something else that was really cool that I was going to say
[1647.76 → 1655.12] just now right and there will be, but there will be variants that will cost more so that 7.5
[1655.12 → 1662.32] billion dollar estimate that assumes that people are only spending uh the very base right 35 000
[1663.04 → 1667.60] but there's going to be a two-wheel drive there's going to be a four-wheel drive model there's going to be
[1667.60 → 1672.96] any number of different trim levels, so a thousand dollars down just means you're committed to buy one
[1672.96 → 1677.44] it doesn't mean that you're committed to buy a base model and I can imagine people spending more
[1677.44 → 1684.72] than 35 000 on okay it was based off an average retail price of 42. oh, 42 sorry so I didn't know
[1684.72 → 1689.44] that so thank you I just wanted to double-check because I wasn't sure I assumed they would just go
[1689.44 → 1695.04] for that but like I don't know I have canned you even go through like a car configurator at this point
[1695.68 → 1700.24] I really don't think so I don't so then how do people know what the average retail price is
[1700.24 → 1706.08] is I don't know yeah but like option mix and stuff
[1708.64 → 1716.08] yeah no, no no, no yeah so I'm not really sure entirely how people are getting that number um
[1716.64 → 1719.84] because like I'm not necessarily sure especially without a super affordable car
[1721.12 → 1725.68] um that's going to come with a lot of its features anyway like how much extra people necessarily going
[1725.68 → 1731.52] to add I don't know you know I actually take a completely different view of it than you do
[1732.72 → 1737.44] the way that I see it like as someone who's a total cheapskate and has never bought an expensive car
[1738.16 → 1744.72] um one of the things that I've been waiting for to upgrade the super civic is an electric vehicle that
[1744.72 → 1754.00] makes sense so for me if I'm kind of going okay I have the super civic is a 2003 that I've been driving
[1754.00 → 1761.12] since 2006 and so for a 10-year investment do I really want to do to myself what I did to myself
[1761.12 → 1766.48] last time keeping out and not getting air conditioning and is this thing going to not
[1766.48 → 1771.44] come with air conditioning no like that's what I mean like without a kit configurator ac is usually
[1771.44 → 1778.64] extra really I mean well, but the thing is tesla's cars cost six figures right now yeah so it would be
[1778.64 → 1783.68] a base model feature, but this is a 35 000 car so I don't know without a kit configurator it's
[1783.68 → 1789.20] impossible to say yeah but I could see myself investing in some extra creature comforts if I'm
[1789.20 → 1795.28] going surprised either like real deal I'm going to keep it 10 years yeah yeah I could know I could
[1795.28 → 1802.40] totally see that I'm just saying like just deciding on that number is maybe a little weird anyway um so
[1802.40 → 1810.80] this is interesting here's a blog post from Elon Musk August 2nd 2006 where he outlined the master plan
[1810.80 → 1818.24] which has actually totally come to fruition blah blah blah as you know Tesla Roadster is the first
[1818.24 → 1823.44] car it's a sports car I am going to use the money we make on this to fund to make something more
[1823.44 → 1828.88] affordable enter the model s then I'm going to use the money from that to make something that is much
[1828.88 → 1833.76] more affordable enter the model 3 so basically he said 10 years ago what he was going to do
[1833.76 → 1836.80] blah blah blah here you go so here's the summary
[1840.40 → 1848.72] the rest of the automotive industry had 10 years to react to this master plan that he actually put in
[1848.72 → 1857.84] plain and simple English on the teslamotors.com blog and only Chevy looks like they have
[1857.84 → 1872.08] somewhat reacted to it properly tried yeah um with that said I do see the electric car as a secondary
[1872.08 → 1880.00] vehicle for most people still even the model 3. with a secondary vehicle I see it as a second I see it
[1880.00 → 1886.16] like the second family car kind of deal not necessarily even the second one but I see it as a
[1886.16 → 1892.48] as a car for people who have two vehicles because the range and recharging considerations
[1893.20 → 1900.16] make it um make it so that if I wanted to go on a family road trip and I realize you can just rent a
[1900.16 → 1904.96] van and do things like that but aside from the cost, and it's much less common for road trips these days
[1904.96 → 1913.20] very inconvenient um so the the the is it that bad if you're going on a road trip you could plan out
[1913.20 → 1922.24] supercharging stations you could 15 miles a day is not that much no if you're doing a family road
[1922.24 → 1927.28] trip though yeah that's true you need to slam like I don't know that's true but I mean I don't know i
[1927.28 → 1931.12] I don't feel like I would need to buy an entirely different car on the off chance that I wanted to do
[1931.12 → 1936.88] a family road trip and book it the whole time but would you as someone who only has a single car
[1936.88 → 1942.72] would you buy a pure electric then sure you think so uh here it would be a little bit harder
[1943.36 → 1949.28] well I would also probably be completely fine because the craziest stuff I do is drive to kids
[1949.28 → 1954.80] line on back so which is completely covered in 215 miles I guess what I'm trying to say
[1954.80 → 1962.24] many times is I can see why everyone else not everyone but many others are betting so much more
[1962.24 → 1968.72] heavily now on hybrid electric or excuse me plug-in hybrid um is what everyone's
[1968.72 → 1973.92] calling it where it has an electric motor and some of them are very reasonable like I think uh the Prius
[1973.92 → 1981.44] prime is able to do something like 80 85 miles an hour on the electric motor like it's its not or 77 or
[1981.44 → 1988.16] something whatever it's its like highway cruising very comfortably very quickly speed um and with a
[1988.16 → 1994.96] range of about 22 miles it's like everyone's in like that high teens uh to low to mid 20s range with
[1994.96 → 2003.12] a range like that I do kind of see it as best of both worlds where you can do your daily commute probably
[2003.12 → 2009.04] on the electric motor and then the gas motor the gas engine which has got a range of you know 300 to
[2009.04 → 2016.00] 350 miles on most of the cars that I was looking at that'll handle anything that is not covered by
[2016.00 → 2022.40] pure electric that strikes me as a more potentially much more convenient solution if you only have one
[2022.40 → 2027.12] car so while I agree with you depending on your lifestyle pure electric could be the one car
[2028.08 → 2033.28] if I was going to make a 35 000 investment that I was planning to keep for however many years
[2033.28 → 2041.92] i also definitely see the value of a plug-in hybrid I understand that I just think the amount of people
[2041.92 → 2049.68] that expect to drive uh 107.5 miles in one direction and back a day is a little crazy um the amount of
[2049.68 → 2055.20] times people are going to go on a road trip it would be very cost-effective to save the money not buying a
[2055.20 → 2059.84] plug-in hybrid and just buying an electric and then just renting a car unless the plug-in hybrid is very
[2059.84 → 2068.08] similarly priced to appear electric if it is but I don't see the added literal mechanics that have
[2068.08 → 2072.24] to go into the car not making some other form of difference to make it the same price yep you might
[2072.24 → 2075.92] lose a trim level somewhere you might lose something in order to make it the same price I feel like that
[2075.92 → 2080.08] would happen because you're literally adding things to the car so you're thinking potentially even longer
[2080.08 → 2084.48] term than me where you don't want to do any maintenance on the car pretty much other than replacing your
[2084.48 → 2088.88] battery pack periodically that isn't even what I was saying, but that is a very good point and I'll take it
[2088.88 → 2095.04] um what I was saying was literally putting those functions in the car would increase the raw cost
[2095.04 → 2100.48] of the car right so, so like trim level would have to go down or something to make it an equal price
[2100.48 → 2105.36] remember too though that they have much smaller batteries like way smaller batteries and that is
[2105.36 → 2111.36] a huge part of the cost of an electric car super sucks then yes but I mean well they have much
[2112.08 → 2115.44] they have much lower range to correspond to their much smaller batteries yeah here's another
[2115.44 → 2121.28] consideration though um so musk also said that the model 3 is going to be capable of 0 to 60 in under
[2121.28 → 2130.72] six seconds um no one's quoting 0 to 60 times on the plug-in hybrids that I saw at the auto show so
[2130.72 → 2135.20] I don't expect those electric everyone's quoting top speeds which does not mean that you're getting
[2135.20 → 2140.08] torque off the line yeah um I mean you'll probably still be doing okay because it is an electric motor but
[2140.08 → 2144.48] it is not the same kind of electric motor that you would find in a model s or even a model 3. which like some
[2144.48 → 2148.64] people are going to say like oh yeah well like you can't speed because it's legal or whatever anyway
[2148.64 → 2153.76] having fast pickup is actually very, very helpful very useful it's one of the things that I like
[2153.76 → 2159.20] most about riding on a motorbike um is the fact that people say hey riding on a motorcycle is really
[2159.20 → 2166.64] dangerous and it if you get hit you're probably dead on the highway like to be realistic I think
[2166.64 → 2173.84] motorcycle helmets have any functionality up to about 60 to 65 kilometres an hour past that they do pretty
[2173.84 → 2178.32] much nothing you might as well be wearing a baseball hat um don't tell my wife I said that
[2178.88 → 2187.84] I'm actually putting the bike back on the road very, very soon um awesome but one of the counter
[2187.84 → 2195.68] arguments that I make about riding a bike is that a visibility is so much better than you because i
[2195.68 → 2202.00] actually have my full field of vision with no obstructions whatsoever b I am smaller than you so
[2202.00 → 2211.20] someone can actually be encroaching on my lane by a meter and I can still be in my lane and not being
[2211.20 → 2218.16] hit by that person number three is I am way more agile than you so as long as I have my head on a
[2218.16 → 2223.68] swivel I have seen a motorcycle dodge an accident that another car ended up getting in I have seen it on
[2223.68 → 2228.72] the road he saw it coming and just I was just supposed to step on it, but that's not really how that works uh
[2228.72 → 2234.08] uh got out of there really quickly and then the car ended up careening into someone else having fast
[2234.08 → 2240.24] pickup I would argue based on my experience as a rider if you have your eyes not just on the road
[2240.24 → 2245.12] but all around you having fast pickup is as important or more important than fast braking
[2245.12 → 2250.24] if you want to avoid accidents, and it's one of the things I like most about my bike is it makes me
[2250.24 → 2256.40] much more able to avoid a bad situation things are much more on you yes yeah um being a
[2256.40 → 2263.36] defensive rider is while I'm not going to say safe is not as dangerous as I think people would
[2263.36 → 2266.64] potentially believe if they had only ever been behind the wheel of a car and had never ridden a
[2266.64 → 2273.84] bike right so I definitely see having torque um as a very important safety feature in a vehicle
[2273.84 → 2279.20] there was even I don't remember who did it but they did an uh they did a video on
[2280.96 → 2284.48] uh their electric car showing that it was slower than a bunch of other cars
[2285.20 → 2289.36] then they showed that like off the line it was really fast they're like yeah you're not going to
[2289.36 → 2298.16] get the top speed at like a few miles of like this challenger or whatever yeah but in a city
[2298.16 → 2302.00] when all that really matters is you maybe being able to get in front of the other person right
[2302.00 → 2306.16] after the intersection make that light yeah exactly that kind of stuff like you can do those things
[2306.16 → 2309.20] very effectively which is probably all you're really going to be able to use anyway because
[2309.20 → 2312.72] you're probably not going to take this car to a track and that's realistically the only time that
[2312.72 → 2317.76] you'd be able to use that so like that's actually kind of interesting so let's move on to our next
[2317.76 → 2322.24] topic I just realized we had spent like 20 minutes talking about the model 3. I mean I'm on the
[2322.24 → 2326.48] show so I'm sorry I'm on the show, and we're talking about electric cars so we could just keep going
[2326.48 → 2332.56] it's fine yeah I know right virtual reality or electric cars I can just it's fine it'll be okay
[2332.56 → 2338.00] so this was originally posted by nine shadow on the forum lawmakers pushing to make owning an
[2338.00 → 2344.40] unregistered prepaid phone illegal in the U.S., so the original article here is from android
[2344.40 → 2352.56] authority and uh yes, yes matrix references are very clever authorita um, so there's a new
[2352.56 → 2359.04] bill in the works called the prepaid mobile device security gap act of 2016. If it passes
[2359.04 → 2364.96] anyone who purchases a prepaid cell phone will be forced to register their identity with the device
[2364.96 → 2370.32] and this law is being pushed forward by Jackie Speyer a democratic representative from California
[2371.76 → 2379.12] so supporters of the bill are saying that it's a solution to the loophole that is allowing you
[2379.12 → 2384.88] know né'er-do-wells to purchase prepaid phones as ways to conduct their illicit business and that's
[2384.88 → 2392.08] definitely a thing and that is definitely a reality um one thing that I wonder about these days though
[2393.20 → 2397.92] is like you ban this they're just going to buy smartphones without a plan and start using
[2397.92 → 2402.16] other applications a lot more expensive two-bit drug dealers can't afford to run out and buy
[2402.16 → 2408.88] smartphones now um hold on a second yeah but if you were to buy that then you would have to
[2409.76 → 2412.72] if you buy it off a plan you would have to register their identity with the device
[2413.52 → 2417.68] well that's what people are doing right now is they're buying devices uh oh wait so we're talking
[2417.68 → 2422.64] about prepaid cell phones yeah this would not be a would not have cellular so you buy a 20
[2422.64 → 2429.44] smartphone off a plan and then use Wi-Fi and whatnot you could yeah I mean yeah, but you could even hot
[2429.44 → 2438.64] spot Wi-Fi is quite traceable though relatively speaking yeah I mean Wi-Fi gives you the location
[2439.36 → 2445.92] uh that gives you potentially uh security camera feed nearby like if you were making calls off Wi-Fi
[2445.92 → 2451.92] no I was thinking making a hot spot from your phone oh I see yeah but then even that can be traced
[2451.92 → 2458.16] back to that device again so it ends and stuff like I don't know I don't think it's the hardest thing to
[2458.16 → 2463.52] get around I would argue that the average two-bit drug dealer does not know how to use a VPN okay
[2463.52 → 2468.24] that's probably fair, but then they just need like one techie dude in their crew to hook them up with
[2468.24 → 2477.60] cell phones yeah but I would argue that probably many of them do not have that and if and if they
[2477.60 → 2481.52] did that's a more elegant solution than running around buying we need more of those like classic
[2481.52 → 2487.04] gangster squad groups where there's like the hacker guy on the laptop and like the thug dude and
[2487.04 → 2492.08] then like the funny guy that drives the car and like yeah anyway that's how crime every movie ever
[2492.08 → 2502.32] yeah yeah it's like that's your that's your major in crime school which dude you are yeah wow that's
[2502.32 → 2507.76] perfect I wonder how many people remember crime school uh more than you'd think people have been
[2507.76 → 2518.08] bringing it up to me yeah um yeah I mean i I guess to me this doesn't feel so much like taking away a
[2518.08 → 2527.76] freedom as um as closing a gap that was introduced accidentally because it's not
[2527.76 → 2534.72] like when phones were introduced a line wasn't tied to a physical address and then later on when cell
[2534.72 → 2541.12] phones were introduced a line wasn't tied to a person um who also had a physical address when
[2541.12 → 2546.56] the yellow pages started was it literally everyone was in it uh like everyone with them yeah white
[2546.56 → 2552.40] pages, and you're so young so the yellow pages are for businesses and the white pages are for
[2552.40 → 2556.56] individuals well my book had both of them in it, we actually did use if it's been a long time
[2556.56 → 2564.32] yeah uh but but but yes yeah so it used to be that you actually would uh use a contact i
[2564.32 → 2569.28] had looked up people that I knew in the I guess white pages like when I was a kid in order to be
[2569.28 → 2572.96] like I know this dude's name but I don't remember his phone number and then I could just find him
[2572.96 → 2577.84] literally yep, and you would just like call all the like p Fernandez yeah you reach the right yeah
[2577.84 → 2581.60] yeah there might be a few of the same name or whatever but so it used to be that you actually had to
[2581.60 → 2587.84] pay to not be included so you had to you had to I think it was either betel that you contacted
[2587.84 → 2593.36] or it was yellow pages or can page or whatever they were called at the time it's can page now
[2593.36 → 2598.80] oh okay it used to be okay um so you would contact them and then there was a processing fee involved and
[2598.80 → 2604.88] you could get an unlisted number that that was where unlisted numbers okay came from so um
[2604.88 → 2611.44] um yeah so the whole idea of being able to have a phone line anonymously is actually very new
[2612.40 → 2619.84] so I can see why they want to close this gap I really doubt that this law will be pushed through
[2620.40 → 2628.16] and if it is pushed through I doubt there will be any real way to enforce this because in much the same
[2628.16 → 2635.52] way that you can go to NCI, and you can tell them your name is John smith and create a customer profile
[2635.52 → 2640.88] around that the law isn't about buying phones and having them registered the law is about being on a
[2640.88 → 2649.12] plan having a pay-as-you-go plan that's unregistered so I guess what I don't understand is if you have a
[2649.12 → 2656.16] pay-as-you-go plan what prevents you then from okay sorry not phone then uh sim or refill card
[2656.16 → 2660.80] yeah refill card so if I have a pay-as-you-go plan what prevents me from registering it with fake
[2660.80 → 2664.64] information, and you could say yes there will be all these regulations in place to prevent you from
[2664.64 → 2670.16] doing that but at the end of the day that's not going to stop you know Joe two-bit uh you know
[2670.16 → 2675.92] corner store guy from actually what like walking to your house and verifying that you actually live
[2675.92 → 2681.52] there like what personal information are we expecting people to submit in order to register for
[2681.52 → 2685.84] their prepaid plan can you buy I guess you can probably buy prepaid stuff I wonder if it's going to
[2685.84 → 2690.48] stop online sales of prepaid stuff you might have to show your driver's license in store maybe but
[2690.48 → 2695.28] then what will how will you enforce that I mean I guess what you can do then is you can make it the
[2695.28 → 2701.12] problem of the corner store, and then you can shut them down um, but it's going to be a long and uphill
[2701.12 → 2708.16] battle yeah I just people are saying you could ask for social security number I mean come on what do you
[2708.16 → 2714.08] have to provide your social security number like that's terrible that's really if that's the solution and
[2714.08 → 2721.84] I'm not then I oppose this yeah I'm not giving my sin or SSN or whatever to any random like corner
[2721.84 → 2727.44] store or big box store employee there's no way that's happening yeah in a freaking lifetime I mean
[2727.44 → 2733.04] not some employee who will have my like name address phone number on file with my social security or
[2733.04 → 2740.32] whatever and identity theft shot up yeah three thousand percent in the state of California like the worst idea
[2740.32 → 2748.32] oh my god yeah so no that would be that would be terrible um I refuse to go to an uh nick light
[2748.32 → 2755.20] switched gyms we used to work out together, and he switched gyms um and then the new gym they take
[2755.20 → 2762.72] your bank account information and then withdraw money directly from your bank account and I was like okay
[2762.72 → 2768.88] I'm not going to your gym because it's just I don't like that they can't just take a credit card no
[2770.00 → 2774.56] they refuse to take credit card they refuse to take cash they refuse to take it's like a three percent
[2774.56 → 2780.80] processing it has to be on time billing, and it has to be withdrawn directly from your bank account
[2780.80 → 2789.84] but then you can get overdrawn I know I was just like nah dude I'm out like I don't know I don't like
[2789.84 → 2793.60] give and like I don't like giving people that kind of information like checks passing back and
[2793.60 → 2800.72] forth my mind is insane I don't really want people to know anyway yeah just insanity uh speaking of
[2800.72 → 2813.04] insanity sponsors they're insane to sponsor us wait no you should sponsor us so if you guys by some
[2813.84 → 2819.68] freaking miracle are watching the wan show today and don't already know anything about squares

[2860.72 → 2865.60] a situation where you have a lot of technical skill, and you want to make updates to the page that aren't
[2865.60 → 2870.88] included in the template Squarespace has got you covered there too, and you can get in and start
[2870.88 → 2877.28] tinkering under the hood to a limited degree if you should find that to be something that you uh find
[2877.28 → 2884.24] appealing now the best thing about Squarespace is that all you have to do should you wish to start

[2896.72 → 2903.36] get 10 off your first purchase we are getting good at this I was a little bit lying behind because
[2903.36 → 2907.60] I was reading the twitch chat that was talking about something we were just talking about and then
[2907.60 → 2913.44] I forgot we were going to do that but then I glommed on there a little bit after um so on the subject
[2913.44 → 2919.36] of taking credit card and how easy it is maybe that gym should get themselves a fresh books account
[2919.36 → 2926.64] oh my god that would be way better because I'm not even just saying fresh books is the solution to
[2926.64 → 2932.88] your small business accounting needs whether you want to track your expenses track your hours bill
[2932.88 → 2938.72] your customers take deposits uh get payment from your customers and they support a variety of different
[2938.72 → 2945.76] payment methods including allowing you the business owner to see that the customer has received your
[2945.76 → 2950.96] electronic invoice which is very, very cool so they can be like oh yeah man I totally didn't get your
[2950.96 → 2956.40] email yeah I didn't read it yeah sorry I'm late yeah I got you know I just got it today yeah no you didn't
[2958.40 → 2964.00] um so fresh books is great whether you're a plumber you run a small dance studio you know do
[2964.00 → 2970.56] small-time computer repair you I love how the examples are always your parents my parents or me it's just like
[2970.56 → 2976.56] my family okay no lets come up with something that someone no one in your family has ever done
[2976.56 → 2982.40] that's good let's say for example let's say for example um you know driving for the uh the local
[2982.40 → 2989.44] movie productions that are being done here or say for example um doing some work for the fire department
[2989.44 → 2996.64] in the city of Langley or oh I don't know teaching at a community college uh here in Vancouver um or
[2996.64 → 3004.32] you know um, um yeah I don't know uh immigration assistance or maybe um I'm going to come
[3004.32 → 3011.92] up with something here uh warehouse uh dang it on the job tech guy like anyway the point is if you have
[3011.92 → 3016.08] any questions about fresh books all you've got to do is reach out to their support staff where you will
[3016.08 → 3021.20] talk to a real human, and they will help you with whatever it is you're having trouble with and
[3021.20 → 3027.92] you can get a 30-day trial for free at freshbooks.com slash when make sure you type when and how did you
[3027.92 → 3032.88] hear about us section by the way, and we'll buy the oh another this is cool they just got a mobile card
[3032.88 → 3038.56] reader as well so you can take credit card not only electronically but also on the spot so fresh books
[3038.56 → 3042.72] allows you to spend your time developing your business instead of staring at your computer at the end of
[3042.72 → 3048.40] the day when you're frankly already very tired and worrying about accounting crap yes you want to
[3048.40 → 3055.04] hear about another stupid gym payment story sure we have a lot of topics to cover this week though
[3055.04 → 3061.68] and we have done nothing there's a really cool gym in me that I liked a lot went there a few times
[3061.68 → 3066.40] tried to get a membership there the problem was you have to pay on the exact same day every single
[3066.40 → 3072.08] month, and you have to pay in cash in an envelope and if you miss it your key fob dies, and you can't
[3072.08 → 3077.44] come in you have to make an appointment with the guy that owns it, and then you can pay again so i
[3077.44 → 3082.40] was there for a month and then never again I could have told him that you're not organized enough to do
[3082.40 → 3087.84] that well I was literally out of the country for work and I was like this is going to happen way too much
[3092.64 → 3099.20] anyway okay let's talk about teleportation original article here is from Gizmodo
[3099.20 → 3108.00] and that is some cool ship that we got going on right there so right now you're seeing it where
[3108.00 → 3113.84] he's he's scaled it down quite a bit, but realistically this is a previous recording he's he's the one
[3113.84 → 3119.36] facing away from the main camera here that's that's him and his daughter that's a previous recording that
[3119.36 → 3125.92] he had just done in that room like minutes before he shows this demo so what he's trying to show is that
[3125.92 → 3129.36] you can do it in real time you can have conversations with people your family or your
[3129.36 → 3133.52] co-workers or whatever, and then you could theoretically play it back so if you want to
[3133.52 → 3139.92] like relive a memory so say you had um your family over for dinner, and you had everyone hanging out in
[3139.92 → 3146.56] the family room and your family was crazy and said crazy stuff and denied it later you could record it
[3146.56 → 3154.64] it and then give it to everyone in the family to either relive those fantastic memories or to prove
[3154.64 → 3161.36] your accusations later on I guess is where that may or may not have been going um, but this is cool for
[3161.36 → 3166.80] a bunch of reasons one of them is uh being able to have people there say in family situations
[3166.80 → 3171.44] that might live across the country other ones are different companies that might not have everyone
[3171.44 → 3175.76] working in the same place we're in the same place some larger companies have multiple offices around
[3175.76 → 3181.92] the world if you want to work with someone it is actually legitimately kind of easier to do things
[3181.92 → 3187.44] if you feel like you're in the same room and these things how out of business are these guys are so dumb
[3187.44 → 3193.52] in my opinion I've never been into these they like you can control them and like wheel them around
[3193.52 → 3199.12] and there's a screen on it and a webcam, and they just don't matter in my opinion at all oh I have to
[3199.12 → 3204.64] go up the stairs you want to pick me up I'm probably pretty heavy you can put me up there and
[3204.64 → 3208.48] I can keep wheeling around I don't know I always thought that was kind of a stupid thing but this
[3208.48 → 3214.32] is actually kind of cool um if you go to the video and probably mute it but go to the very beginning
[3214.32 → 3219.12] he's interacting with a dude now to be fair all of this looks like it was kind of previously recorded
[3219.12 → 3223.60] because the skits are just so bad, but it might actually just be because the skits are so bad that
[3223.60 → 3228.56] it feels like it was previously recorded before he even said that you could record them I thought they were
[3228.56 → 3234.16] recordings so this yeah he's interacting with this guy so theoretically there you go you see he is kind
[3234.16 → 3238.80] of like teleports into the room, and you can tell he's digital, but it's pretty good that's crazy hey
[3238.80 → 3244.56] yeah so one thing to note is that the camera that's filming this has HoloLens equipment stuff on it so
[3244.56 → 3249.36] that it can overlay things in real time yeah, but that's not obviously exactly what you would see so
[3249.36 → 3254.48] what the HoloLens would actually more kind of see is in the bottom left hand corner, so the colour is
[3254.48 → 3260.64] much less accurate it doesn't look nearly as good yeah, but you can see where it's going and this is
[3260.64 → 3267.12] a dev kit or whatever so it's pretty cool see wow they can't actually high five
[3270.16 → 3275.76] very, very cool though it's super, and you can cameras yes I was just going to say you can see the
[3275.76 → 3280.08] cameras and there's more of them behind them there are cameras all throughout the room, and they're they're
[3280.08 → 3287.84] actually pretty crazy cameras yeah this is uh maybe not going to like be in your home right away but a
[3287.84 → 3293.44] super cool this so actually eventually happened kind of deal and once they get them down to the size of
[3293.44 → 3298.08] like kind of the lighthouse sensors for the five which at this point I'm way more excited for than the
[3298.08 → 3305.36] rift, but that's maybe for a different day um once I get them down to that size and the HoloLens isn't this
[3305.36 → 3309.28] like giant thing that you have to wear on your face, and it's more like glasses that's going to be
[3309.28 → 3317.60] insane absolutely insane I don't know I really like the idea of telecommuting yeah not necessarily
[3317.60 → 3322.40] telecommunication, but telecommuting like being able to go to work digitally I think that's going to be
[3322.40 → 3328.96] super cool especially for congestion and population density in crazy cities because if we get better
[3328.96 → 3334.88] internet infrastructure outside just cities and people are able to commute to work which is
[3335.36 → 3341.12] 10 hours away instantaneously that's awesome we don't have to have everyone in these crazy high
[3341.12 → 3346.00] rises right really close to their work all the time, and we don't have problems like in Vancouver where
[3346.00 → 3351.28] our land in actual Vancouver is fairly restricted and everyone has to live super far out and houses
[3351.28 → 3360.64] mountains water United States of America yeah congestions like it's yes exactly uh so people being able to
[3360.64 → 3368.08] telecommute into Vancouver would help so many things I mean for employers it'd be great if I could hire
[3368.08 → 3375.84] someone where i just kind of go okay so you're proposing that I pay your relocation costs uh your
[3375.84 → 3380.72] labour market impact assessment uh charge which by the way is very expensive with the lawyers involved
[3380.72 → 3387.20] and all that like we hired an American a little while ago not uh easier for him, but we looked into the Lima
[3387.20 → 3394.96] it is very expensive very complicated and very time-consuming um there's a company in Vancouver Hootsuite
[3394.96 → 3400.00] who has recently released a blog talking about how it's becoming excessively difficult for them to
[3400.00 → 3405.20] hire anyone because it's becoming excessively difficult for talented young people to live in
[3405.20 → 3411.44] Vancouver yeah, so there's a mass exodus of like young talent in Vancouver we don't live in Vancouver
[3412.24 → 3417.04] for a very specific reason because it's too freaking expensive, so this makes life a little bit better
[3417.04 → 3420.64] for employers because I could say okay how about this instead of paying your relocation costs and all
[3420.64 → 3425.84] of those other associated fees why don't I just set you up like a space where you're going to
[3425.84 → 3430.96] kind of live and then if I ever want to talk to you than I'll flip on my presumably much more high-tech
[3430.96 → 3436.64] and much less clunky HoloLens glasses I'll pay for you to have a setup next to your desk that you actually
[3436.64 → 3441.12] just set aside at your house wherever you live and if I ever need to talk to you, I'll know where you
[3441.12 → 3446.96] are yeah no seriously it's, and you could literally have like just a corner or whatever because it
[3446.96 → 3452.24] doesn't have to be very fancy on your end but just where they sit theoretically, and you could go see
[3452.24 → 3455.76] them quite physically you could see them working at their desk, and you can be like what's that and
[3455.76 → 3460.24] it could be projected and everything could be kind of cool I don't know very cool speaking of things
[3460.24 → 3464.80] that are cool this was originally posted by Cuba cores on the forum and the original article here is from
[3464.80 → 3477.60] CCF tech and the intel Bradwell EP family has been launched, so this is the Leon e5 2600 v4 family
[3477.60 → 3485.12] based on the Bradwell architecture, so the servers are actually lagging more than a full architecture
[3485.12 → 3491.76] behind the desktop products these days um, but the good news about this is this means that extreme edition
[3491.76 → 3499.52] on LGA 2011 3 can't be far behind so uh hopefully we'll be getting some new uh enthusiast desktop
[3499.52 → 3503.76] uh extreme edition chips that aren't based on sorry what are they're still Haswell based aren't
[3503.76 → 3509.04] they yeah so intel is actually spanning three architectures right now they're running sky lake
[3509.04 → 3514.24] on the mainstream desktop they've got Bradwell based chips on the server side, and then they are
[3514.24 → 3522.48] still running Haswell on the enthusiast side which is like anyway um so they finally launched them
[3522.48 → 3529.12] they make use of their 14 nanometre core architecture increased core count core IPC improvements as we
[3529.12 → 3533.68] already know because there 's's not a lot we don't know about this yeah we're talking Haswell to
[3533.68 → 3540.64] Bradwell this is like happened a while ago um and better performance per watt compared to the existing
[3540.64 → 3548.24] chips the main cool thing 22 threads multithreaded two cores or 22 cores sorry 44 threads yeah right there
[3548.24 → 3558.24] baby so of course I'll be calling up my contacts at intel being like yo i want two one is not enough
[3560.24 → 3566.32] no one CPU can be enough for me, we're getting with GPU announcements on the horizon
[3566.32 → 3572.48] and this kind of happening um we're getting into compensator territory again yep because compensator
[3572.48 → 3576.80] can't I had someone message me the other day, and they're like how are you going to do one when he just
[3576.80 → 3584.24] made the seven gamers one CPU thirty thousand dollar computer how do you make a compensator which was not
[3584.24 → 3591.28] nearly as expensive as that when that just happened I think it can still happen I think so because it's
[3591.28 → 3596.24] more the compensator was never like literally the most insane thing you can possibly build
[3596.32 → 3602.80] no it was like what are the most expensive but still consumer kind of things that you can get
[3602.80 → 3609.68] not dual CPU motherboards and intended for one user yes the compensator machine delivers more horsepower
[3609.68 → 3616.80] to a single user than seven gamers one CPU could have actually yeah on the GPU side of things anyway
[3616.80 → 3621.68] yeah so there you have it there is no reason why we can't still do a compensator in fact I've already
[3621.68 → 3630.08] got GPUs lined up for it oh nice I didn't know that I do okay yes I wonder what those are uh i
[3630.08 → 3637.44] actually don't know all I know is that I'm getting whatever they are seriously not even joking that's
[3637.44 → 3643.28] awesome it's like it's NDA so no one can tell me anything like yes you are getting them you'll get a
[3643.28 → 3653.20] thing yeah okay uh so 7.2 billion transistors on a 456 millimetre square die uh where's the uh yeah 22
[3653.20 → 3662.56] cores maximum that is freaking insane uh three die variants oh this is interesting, so this is not
[3662.56 → 3669.44] necessarily the traditional way of doing multiple CPU skews so what we've seen in the in yeah
[3669.44 → 3674.24] sort of more traditionally in the past is that the Leon and the Pentium 4 would have been based on
[3674.24 → 3679.52] the exact same die um just with a couple of features laser cut off of the Pentium 4 one or
[3679.52 → 3685.60] whatever else and anything from a 2.4 to a 3.46 gigahertz or whatever would have all been based on
[3685.60 → 3690.32] the exact same die, and it's just a binning process well now we've got three dies one that can accommodate
[3690.32 → 3698.08] four to ten cores with 3.4 billion transistors one from 12 to 15 with 4.7 billion and the flagship 16 to
[3698.08 → 3706.80] 24 core with uh seven point whatever a billion transistors freaking cool so epic um what can
[3706.80 → 3714.64] they tell us about this one I want to know what it boosts to 2.2 gigahertz base 3.6 boost not bad wow
[3715.92 → 3721.12] that's ridiculous oh I did not think it was going to boost to that at all, and it tells us on a per
[3721.12 → 3728.00] core basis do you know how hard it is to find this chart for anything from intel seriously have you
[3728.00 → 3735.20] ever tried to find the actual boost breakdown I actually have and I have actually failed it is
[3735.20 → 3748.08] so annoying this is wow look how aggressive turboboost 2.2.0 is here so up to 11 cores
[3748.08 → 3757.04] 11 cores and so up to 10 cores you're getting anywhere from plus 18 over the base 1.8 frequency
[3757.04 → 3763.68] I don't know why they even call it a base frequency if you're going to do plus eight so okay so here let
[3763.68 → 3771.84] me let me do the math so with 22 cores active you get 20 you get one 18 plus 8 so 2.6 gigahertz and then
[3771.84 → 3778.72] with as few as like three or four cores active you can actually get up pretty close you can get like
[3778.72 → 3783.68] 3.3 gigahertz very, very interesting
[3785.68 → 3794.40] hmm so the 2683 v4 is a very interesting skew because it's got a very similar base frequency to
[3794.40 → 3800.72] the 2699 it's got 16 cores which is still an awful lot by the way only two fewer than the previous
[3800.72 → 3809.28] flagship at 18 and its turbos up almost the same up to its full 16 cores which not necessarily all of
[3809.28 → 3815.20] them do oh this one's this one's sexy to the 2697 v4 that's an 18 core so that would be a direct
[3815.20 → 3823.84] replacement for the 2699 v3 that I have now but looks like it can actually turbo up more aggressively
[3823.84 → 3830.64] base frequency of 2.0 man there are a lot of skews this time around very very very interesting
[3831.52 → 3833.52] goes all the way down to a quad course
[3835.52 → 3840.64] so that gets me excited not necessarily all of you but whatever um
[3844.32 → 3849.60] I don't really care about that one yeah let's do uh yeah let's do some of the uh some of the April
[3849.60 → 3855.28] fools jokes that have been around there this was posted by elfin sky on the forum so racer did
[3855.28 → 3863.20] project bread winner uh the racer toaster which it appears they actually did produce toast with racer
[3863.20 → 3869.36] logos on it in order to uh make the video of they put so much work into this video oh yeah like as a
[3869.36 → 3875.76] video production company i can tell you guys that with all the different talents that they had
[3875.76 → 3882.72] uh including some fairly notable game streamers and internet personalities like where's uh where's
[3882.72 → 3889.60] what's his face Mr castles over there he's in here where do you go they probably cut him out a lot because
[3890.40 → 3898.48] because there he is look at this guy uh anyway um they put a lot of freaking work into this thing
[3898.48 → 3904.64] honestly in my opinion at six minutes the joke is kind of old by that point especially because it's
[3905.36 → 3908.72] obviously April fools when I clicked on it, I was very surprised at how long it was
[3909.44 → 3920.48] but uh but i I will say though that um it was good MCATs was probably a little short I was uh I was
[3920.48 → 3925.52] gonna wait till we got to that one but yeah what the heck and a little bit low effort um so oh wait
[3925.52 → 3932.56] what is this press release, but the actual landing page seems kind of fine have you noticed that
[3933.28 → 3938.88] yeah because all I saw at first was the um, and they super try to harvest your email with a pop-up
[3938.88 → 3945.20] right away wow which is super lame way to go guys just kind of wanted to enjoy uh April fool's joke
[3945.20 → 3950.40] already on your mailing list didn't need that anyway um they did some like weird VR thing with like
[3950.40 → 3955.36] VRS in the heel which was a little excessive they should just go with the lighting joke yeah and the video
[3955.36 → 3959.68] which I don't know where it is there you go the video is like the most half-assed thing I've ever
[3959.68 → 3969.36] seen oh like it's not like it's just a static image yeah um and like it's literally a product
[3969.36 → 3976.72] that's actually been made like those shoes exist and like that's not even that far off for
[3976.72 → 3983.04] NZ XT to make them to be completely honest this is probably the most believable one that I've seen i
[3983.04 → 3987.36] thought this is actually kind of cool i kind of wish there was GeForce GTX energy drinks yeah so
[3988.08 → 3993.76] an energy drink get your drink and like if you buy is you buy like a they only come in packs up
[3993.76 → 4000.40] to four you can buy like SLI packs you get like a slight discount if you buy like dual SLI
[4002.00 → 4006.08] if you slide them together just funny because you don't in real life no I know on video cards I know
[4006.08 → 4011.76] yeah if you buy them together you can like click them together and then drink from like one thing
[4011.76 → 4016.80] but it's both of them or something I don't know it would be kind of cool so that that was that
[4016.80 → 4021.12] I thought that was done really well that was pretty cute uh they've got graphs for increasing your
[4021.12 → 4024.80] reaction time and such sort of yeah people are saying like I would actually buy this and stuff like
[4024.80 → 4029.76] yeah that would actually be kind of cool this is really Tripp look at this I'm like clicking here and
[4029.76 → 4037.36] it's going down that's actually really weird there I found it oh what the heck there I found
[4037.36 → 4042.32] it, so this is how fast you are without it this is how fast you are with if it's just obviously a sped
[4042.32 → 4047.84] up video of the same yeah which is which is I think in video exactly how they should have done
[4047.84 → 4054.64] the right amount of effort into their April fools' joke um the next thing seems like an afterthought that
[4054.64 → 4060.96] they put a good web designer on, and then we're like try to get this out really quickly and oh yeah
[4060.96 → 4064.72] don't forget make sure you try to harvest as many emails as you possibly can when they try to watch
[4064.72 → 4070.00] this which kind of sucked the NVIDIA thing actually seemed really genuinely good the racer thing seems
[4070.00 → 4075.84] like they got super massively into it this is so cool I actually ended up watching a fair amount of
[4075.84 → 4081.28] these videos because they're just kind of awesome have you no I actually haven't watched any of the videos
[4081.28 → 4086.80] do you know anything about this not much okay so it actually doesn't explain to it that well here so
[4086.80 → 4093.44] what's really going on is they had snoop dog sit in a theatre with some other I'm assuming YouTube
[4093.44 → 4101.52] employees, and they watched the videos on a big theatre screen so like this, and he just comments
[4101.52 → 4106.40] the video from the background so you can like to turn it around and look at him, and he'll just like talk
[4106.40 → 4112.08] about the video while it's playing, but it's snoop dog so it's awesome, and then you can rotate it back
[4112.08 → 4118.48] and actually like watch the video I don't it's actually kind of cool what was frustrating was
[4118.48 → 4122.80] like I'd watch some random video on YouTube, and it would have a snoop vision or whatever it's called
[4122.80 → 4127.92] I think it's called snoop vision yeah logo and I'd be like oh sweet like they did this one
[4127.92 → 4134.00] that's so cool but then no there's just a little set of the ones that they did there's obviously not
[4134.00 → 4140.56] everything so like that water blue one is actually done in snoop vision so it's 360, and you can turn
[4140.56 → 4144.64] the camera around and see him sitting there and talking about if it's actually kind of cool binge
[4144.64 → 4149.68] on up was pretty funny this was one where they put a ton of effort into it, and it actually like kind
[4149.68 → 4156.96] of worked out no sorry what was that that was them wanting to know my location
[4156.96 → 4164.80] oh so it's its an it's a like a headset thing that just makes it so that your phone is like in front
[4164.80 → 4170.24] of your face uh it goes with their binge on thing where you can watch tons of different services without
[4170.24 → 4174.64] using your data, so their whole idea is like well if you're using that service, and it's not using your
[4174.64 → 4180.56] data you can just do it all the time yeah the problem is that rick mercer's already done it and if
[4180.56 → 4186.80] an amazing Canadian like rick mercer has already done it then you lose yeah this was a long time ago
[4186.80 → 4194.64] this is when blackberry was relevant i love this video see rick mercer genius oh no never
[4194.64 → 4198.48] mind his didn't actually have a spot for the helmet never mind sorry it had a signal booster and it
[4198.48 → 4203.36] made it so that if you walk into the okay, so no rick mercer has not quite done it this I'm pretty
[4203.36 → 4208.64] sure this thing's been done though yeah I'm pretty I'm pretty sure that an uh that a phone holder a phone
[4208.64 → 4214.72] holder again you know what's hilarious is I actually would like a product sort of like this
[4214.72 → 4220.32] like this except for the bed headrest or the headboard have I talked to you about that no it
[4220.32 → 4226.32] just makes sense yeah like because the amount of times I'll be like this right exhausted and then
[4226.32 → 4231.76] drop it just smacks right in the face, and it'd be perfect for things like a Kindle as well yeah oh
[4231.76 → 4236.96] yeah I love reading in bed but like you get uncomfortable on this side ah you get uncomfortable
[4236.96 → 4243.12] that like if you could build a versatile enough arm that it's strong enough to hold a Kindle a tablet or a
[4243.12 → 4248.40] real book even, and then you could just have it so you could like to turn the pages and just like
[4248.40 → 4253.52] have like a clip oh man that would be like the most comfortable way to read ever might even be a thing
[4253.52 → 4260.24] I would never get out of my bed ever again yeah um so who gets your vote for the best
[4260.24 → 4269.28] April fools' joke I enjoyed snoopavision the most enjoyed snoopavision the most I think NVIDIA's was
[4269.28 → 4277.28] very well executed I enjoyed more believable yeah, yeah like it's gotten to the point where I think
[4277.28 → 4284.72] there's a fine line where between ad campaign and April fools' joke yeah and between like between making
[4284.72 → 4292.48] it is funny because like because it's April fools versus actually trying to fool people was yours was
[4292.48 → 4298.00] yours actually trying to fool people though mine was trying to walk the fine line where I was pretty sure
[4298.00 → 4304.24] that some people would believe it but that I wanted people to mostly know that I wasn't serious
[4304.24 → 4307.92] because you don't really end of the video that's like a semi-dangerous thing for people to think is
[4307.92 → 4312.64] actually happening yeah I don't want people to actually and you know what though I think as
[4312.64 → 4319.12] much as a lot of people posted on the video like this was super obvious and you guys are idiots this is
[4319.12 → 4327.04] just another bad video that you've made the number of people that also have like not just publicly like
[4327.04 → 4333.04] ha ha ha ha I am playing along with the April fool wow you got me um but the number of people that
[4333.04 → 4338.00] have reached out to me privately asking if it actually happened I don't think I've had any of
[4338.00 → 4344.80] those that's funny uh so I think we walked the line just right yeah because I liked it I was just trying
[4344.80 → 4352.24] to dissect your point I guess but yeah I like the r's um yeah nvidia I think had a very well
[4352.24 → 4357.36] executed one I enjoyed YouTube's the most which I'm not too surprised about YouTube always does
[4357.36 → 4361.36] such a great job there's more Google ones in here that I guess didn't make it into the dock like the
[4361.92 → 4366.64] I think it's called the Google parachute yeah that's in here oh never mind parachute uh by google
[4366.64 → 4371.12] express I was just I was skipping past it because we're really close to six yeah and this one's kind
[4371.12 → 4375.36] of annoying because oh it worked for you, I had to put in a zip code before I could actually see it but
[4375.36 → 4380.72] this one's kind of funny shop anywhere anytime, and it like parachutes you whatever you're buying
[4381.92 → 4385.04] I thought it was pretty funny probably I think it's kind of funny because like Amazon
[4386.32 → 4389.36] probably not that far off might get to this point with drones where you could be like
[4389.36 → 4394.24] walking around town and be like I want a soft drink, and it just like brings you one like I wouldn't even
[4394.24 → 4399.12] be that surprised if that ends up happening so like I don't know that one definitely didn't win for
[4399.12 → 4402.96] me because I was just like that could totally be a thing maybe not with parachutes but like all
[4402.96 → 4407.60] right let's jump through some of our rapid fire topics here uh first up we've got that AMD announces
[4407.60 → 4417.36] the fire pro s9300 x2 dual Fiji for HPC so yeah pretty much it's an uh fury pro duo except with a
[4417.36 → 4422.88] completely different everything about it except for the GPU cores themselves six thousand dollars yeah
[4422.88 → 4427.04] different PCB uh different cooling design, so these are designed to be in a chassis where the
[4427.04 → 4431.84] cooling is taken care of by the chassis, so there's no fan so it just goes in here and then out the back
[4431.84 → 4439.92] um, and it's got an awful lot of stream processors, and it's got a big boost clock and um there's two
[4439.92 → 4452.08] GPUs on it well I'm a little surprised that it's some 300 watt i all I have to say about this is that um
[4452.08 → 4460.40] Polaris and pascal can't come soon enough I am so tired of talking about uh 28 nanometre GPUs
[4460.40 → 4462.80] yup
[4462.80 → 4471.44] um Windows 10 is possibly getting well okay is getting I guess uh Ubuntu's bash and Linux command line
[4471.44 → 4478.80] which is kind of crazy so apparently you can uh write dot sh scripts on Windows, and they're getting command line
[4478.80 → 4483.04] and stuff because they're baking that into Windows 10 and I have no idea why they're doing this
[4483.04 → 4493.60] well dos is gone, so people might want it I know but like I'm like okay I like that it's happening
[4493.60 → 4496.92] I mean is it I don't understand it from a Microsoft perspective is anyone complaining
[4496.92 → 4505.44] about PowerShell well yeah okay well then maybe they're i just I don't see this changing anyone's
[4505.44 → 4509.84] mind on anything so you don't understand why they wouldn't just make PowerShell better or
[4509.84 → 4518.22] uh well people being more used to things and stuff is cool but like I just okay I don't know
[4518.22 → 4522.86] how to phrase this properly I understand why this is going to be cool for people I'm surprised
[4522.86 → 4527.24] Microsoft did it and I don't understand why they did it like what would be your inspiration
[4527.24 → 4533.90] as a Microsoft employee to be like we should do this well you know what I mean want basically
[4533.90 → 4540.94] everything they've done since Nadella took over has been about increasing the installation base
[4540.94 → 4550.08] making sure to not only not continue to lose not continue to erode the latest version of windows
[4550.08 → 4556.34] install base but claw back market share claw it back from piracy claw it back from apple claw it back
[4556.34 → 4563.38] from even Linux uh however insignificant that install base might be within certain user
[4563.38 → 4567.38] groups because there would be educational institutions for example that would have
[4567.38 → 4573.90] compelling reasons to use and would use Linux and in those cases I would see something like this being
[4573.90 → 4582.66] the thing that could make us go okay now we could have these elements of both worlds with this via this
[4582.66 → 4588.34] new Linux subsystem within Windows 10 like yeah like i i I like it, I'm not saying I don't like it
[4588.34 → 4594.10] if the objective is to actually try to sell your product by doing things that are good for your
[4594.10 → 4601.38] users than I get if it's just that I mean like a Microsoft move that's why I'm confused like that's
[4601.38 → 4607.22] that's the yeah yeah I'm not I'm yeah I'm not I'm not saying it's a bad idea I think it's a great idea
[4607.22 → 4612.10] when I read that I was like wow that's really cool makes things easier in a bunch of different ways
[4612.10 → 4621.70] that's awesome I'm just it just doesn't seem like Microsoft that's all I don't know um apple is
[4621.70 → 4626.50] developing batteries to improve energy capacity and devices this was posted by sans Armin on the
[4626.50 → 4632.10] forum and the original article here is from pc world I guess that's about like saying that apple
[4632.10 → 4638.98] is developing screens that display images to the users of their phones but I'm sure there is uh
[4638.98 → 4648.26] I'm sure there is more to it than that um I mean i you know maybe it's not focusing on ceramic
[4648.26 → 4651.86] maybe it's not quite the same as that because apple actually hasn't done pretty much anything
[4651.86 → 4656.90] to their battery capacity other than release the iPhone 6 plus which just is bigger and has a bigger
[4656.90 → 4660.26] battery in it in the last little while I sure wish they would just do a thicker phone with a higher
[4660.26 → 4664.90] capacity battery please note that they'll ever listen to me, I'm sure they don't care what you worked on
[4664.90 → 4670.18] the show for that what do you think about the see um I do you like small phones I think that they're
[4670.18 → 4679.14] desperate I think that they straight up are pulling a Samsung and going we can't figure out how to sell
[4679.14 → 4684.18] more phones so let's just throw more models at the problem okay that's what I think you're not excited
[4684.18 → 4689.54] because it's smaller I think they are I think they're basically slashing price without trying to
[4689.54 → 4695.22] I think they are putting off for as long as possible slashing the price of the flagship device
[4695.22 → 4701.22] by creating an entry-level tier I think it didn't work well last time with the iPhone 5c but I think
[4701.22 → 4709.62] that the reason that didn't work was that um the 5c was built from the ground up to be cheap in a way
[4709.62 → 4715.86] that was very obvious unapologetically obvious um I hate that word and then there's the there's the
[4715.86 → 4719.06] there's the issue with what they've done in the past where they've just sold previous generation
[4719.06 → 4723.06] devices, but those were not designed to be cheap devices and I think the manufacturing costs are
[4723.06 → 4727.06] higher so I can see why they're doing it they're building something from the ground up to be cheap
[4727.06 → 4733.30] but not that cheap, and they are giving uh, and they're they're taking the fight to the entry-level
[4733.30 → 4738.74] smartphone makers sort of at least in the best way that apple can do that on from a pricing standpoint
[4738.74 → 4745.70] um but I think they basically just aren't sure what to do to to to keep selling more phones because
[4745.70 → 4751.54] much like with many other devices phones are really getting to the point where yes the Galaxy S7 is
[4752.10 → 4756.66] marvellous and I'm going to be switching to it but if I already owned a Galaxy S6 and I actually paid
[4756.66 → 4761.78] for phones i sure as heck wouldn't be doing that yeah University of California Irvine uh hold on i
[4761.78 → 4767.14] wanted to touch on a little bit of a little bit more about this so um focusing on ceramic as the
[4767.14 → 4772.66] electrolyte they've proven in labs that they can provide faster charging and safer batteries which is
[4772.66 → 4777.70] a concern they're also hiring people that can take battery technology from the lab to the factories
[4777.70 → 4782.58] and they already got granted a patent for developing a solid state battery this could be considered the
[4782.58 → 4791.14] next big technology in battery research good cool University of California Irvine announces an
[4791.14 → 4797.06] e-sports scholarship so by the start of 2016 six private schools had developed scholarships based on
[4797.06 → 4804.58] the game which is uh League of Legends in this kind of context um this is the first public state-run
[4804.58 → 4809.70] school to officially support e-sports um they're talking about building a like a little land café
[4809.70 → 4815.46] and everything on campus which I guess would be kind of like your field yeah yeah I mean if you're
[4815.46 → 4820.26] going to have a basketball court you might as well have a land centre yeah I mean if you're taking e-sports
[4820.26 → 4824.18] seriously, and you're going to have like scholarships and stuff you should probably have somewhere for them to go
[4824.18 → 4831.78] yeah anyway the café will be built in the model of Korean pc gaming cafés and will offer a
[4831.78 → 4837.30] premium League of Legends experience I wonder if that includes my favourite part of those cafés which
[4837.30 → 4843.54] is where they like to bring you food and stuff directly to your thing probably not I seriously doubt it so
[4843.54 → 4850.50] they probably mean like sponsored gaming chairs but like still um I don't know this is kind of cool
[4850.50 → 4859.38] i we're getting closer and closer to like JHS yep we like actually are so that's going to get
[4859.38 → 4865.70] interesting I don't know someone's gonna interview like Freddie w in like 15 years or whatever and be
[4865.70 → 4871.54] like how did you know this is come true yeah it's going to be like man I didn't know yeah I thought it was
[4871.54 → 4877.30] funny I was making a joke i just figured it was kind of cool I made a video with my bros yeah
[4877.30 → 4883.78] yeah e-sports is cool this is cool like it's its starting to become a very viable career for
[4883.78 → 4888.02] an actually not insignificant amount of people yeah and not just a professional career but also
[4888.02 → 4894.50] like an indie career through services like twitch yeah yeah so like it actually kind of makes sense
[4894.50 → 4898.74] I'm making fun of it because it's kind of funny, but it does actually kind of make sense Riot Games
[4898.74 → 4906.82] has a guy okay a guy whose job title is collegiate program manager go figure yeah you saw this one
[4906.82 → 4920.02] coming you know um I think that's the show yeah pretty much uh let's see blah blah blah blah blah blah
[4920.02 → 4927.70] blah blah blah blah blah blah blah oh the PlayStation 4.5 is kind of interesting um so
[4927.70 → 4934.58] this is everyone's calling it 4.5 could be called 4k or something like that, but word on the street is
[4934.58 → 4940.90] that Sony will be launching a place an updated PlayStation with roughly double the performance
[4940.90 → 4948.18] of the previous PlayStation uh whether that's enough to actually get them to reasonable performance at 4k
[4948.18 → 4955.38] is uh still very, very much uh to be determined um like no but
[4958.34 → 4964.58] why are you gonna just a wet blanket but like we I did that test like years ago why don't why don't
[4964.58 → 4969.62] you just why don't you just why don't you just go to Japan okay pull up to Sony's headquarters and
[4969.62 → 4973.54] take a giant dump on the lawn why don't you just do that if you're going to be such a downer minus the
[4973.54 → 4978.18] dump on the lawn part we should like to do a diplomatic mission as a video sometime like
[4979.62 → 4983.70] I don't know if it's to Sony or whatever, but we should just like to show up somewhere we could show the
[4983.70 → 4989.94] valve we want to help you design stuff stop putting glossy plastic on your controllers there valve
[4989.94 → 4996.90] perfect done do not put glossy plastic on the top of your damn controllers my dad ended up watching that
[4996.90 → 5000.82] review because he was like kind of interested because couch gaming is totally in his realm of
[5000.82 → 5008.42] things that he would like to do, and he saw the glossy plastic part and was just like what why i recently
[5008.42 → 5013.54] had a conversation with someone where I was like I was half joking because I thought I was talking
[5013.54 → 5020.50] to someone like kind of lower down on the totem pole um and I was just like uh and I was like yeah and
[5020.50 → 5025.46] I can't believe you guys put freaking glossy plastic on it, and it turned out it was the person who like
[5025.46 → 5033.14] made the decision, and he was like why was this gigabyte I don't remember okay because at CES um
[5033.14 → 5038.02] I had a conversation with gigabyte about their knocks really are they're bricks they're bricks and the
[5038.02 → 5043.38] guy was like yeah like um we put mad on it, I hope that's a monitor guy for me oh yeah no it was
[5043.38 → 5047.78] a guy that manages bricks he's like we put mad on it, I hope that's okay I was like that's awesome
[5047.78 → 5053.30] he's like oh what you're not like mad that there isn't glossy I was like what are you talking about who are
[5053.30 → 5060.10] these people but do you read anything have you watched any of our videos like come on and not
[5060.10 → 5065.86] just us oh any anyone's I don't I mean I'm pretty sure we're not the only ones here we're not we're
[5065.86 → 5071.22] not right I shouldn't have said our videos like have you looked at reviews of things
[5071.22 → 5078.74] at all like the what what was it the fury uh NATO that has like the glass over top of the glossy
[5078.74 → 5085.30] uh no what product is it that did that because that was cool that was fine because the glass is
[5085.30 → 5088.90] nice and easy to clean and the glossy plastic under the glass gets protected and doesn't get
[5088.90 → 5092.90] scratched instantly I don't remember what product it is good job, but you know what I'm yeah whatever
[5092.90 → 5097.30] um someone did it is looked great that was a good implementation of it just putting glossy plastic
[5097.30 → 5100.98] especially in places that you're going to touch it's so dumb and I don't understand how they haven't
[5100.98 → 5107.22] figured this out yet back to the PlayStation four and a half a more likely reason for its existence is to
[5107.22 → 5114.10] compete properly with VR computers um so if because I mean we did the math back when Sony was
[5114.10 → 5117.94] saying well you know due to our special sauce we are this much more efficient we're this much for this
[5117.94 → 5123.46] much 60 hertz per eye we can make it okay if we do some fancy interpolation whatever else we did the
[5123.46 → 5128.42] math, and it still didn't add up yeah it was still weird if they have a PlayStation that is twice as
[5128.42 → 5134.50] powerful now it makes sense yeah so if you want to have a proper VR experience it looks like you're
[5134.50 → 5141.30] probably going to be buying a PlayStation 4k or four and a half, or you know for VR edition or
[5141.30 → 5146.42] whatever the case may be so I think that pretty much wraps it up thank you guys for tuning into
[5146.42 → 5151.14] the wan show we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel if you're tuning in late
