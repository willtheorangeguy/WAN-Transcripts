[0.00 --> 13.00]  No, I don't think anyone did bump the cable. I think the microphone is set to allow exclusivity mode, and then Skype was open, and I think Skype grabbed the mic.
[13.78 --> 20.26]  In between recording the local recording and actually going live, so I ended up being completely silent.
[20.26 --> 30.24]  Okay, so what I was trying to say that whole time, in a very long and roundabout way, if it helps at all, I actually hadn't really said anything yet.
[30.30 --> 32.00]  I was mostly just killing time.
[33.82 --> 46.58]  What I was trying to say is that our New Year's resolution is to start the show on time, and that those of you with calendars or fancy phone-a-ma-jiggers in your pockets have probably realized it is not the new year yet, so that's why we are nine minutes late.
[46.58 --> 61.22]  But in that time, I have been tooling around with getting the audio working for a while, and so we are actually more like 14 minutes late, but there's that.
[61.22 --> 70.60]  And I was also going to address that Focusrite, on account of Christmas or something, wusses, has not managed to come by yet.
[70.62 --> 75.14]  This is actually an audio interface that we bought. They're going to bring some other gear.
[75.14 --> 85.56]  But they have not managed to come out here yet. They're going to come in the new year, and we are definitely going to be upgrading the audio setup to something that is not a USB microphone.
[85.76 --> 89.42]  It'll be all XLR and fancy and nice and all that good stuff.
[89.42 --> 95.46]  It's really funny, though. We had a call with them a little while ago, and they were just like,
[95.66 --> 102.66]  Hey, so we couldn't help noticing that, you know, you guys are recording in a warehouse.
[103.24 --> 110.12]  And so we were thinking, like, you know, I don't know, maybe you'd want to put up, like, some sound deadening so you don't get that echo.
[110.12 --> 115.24]  And I was like, yeah, you know what, that's really the least of our problems.
[117.58 --> 126.80]  I mean, if we can have audio working at all, and, like, a compressor would be great, then we're going to call that good.
[127.50 --> 131.44]  And they're like, yeah, but, like, we really think that with these other additional things that we're like,
[131.44 --> 137.28]  I'm like, ah, yeah, it's a set that we use literally one and a half hours a week.
[138.52 --> 142.12]  So if we're creating a bunch of clutter, they're like, yeah, but we think we can make it sound really good.
[142.16 --> 147.96]  I'm like, you know what, let's just get it working, and then we'll worry about making it sound amazing.
[148.72 --> 150.94]  How about it just works first, and then we go from there.
[153.52 --> 157.74]  So, oh, hey, we have a special guest for the WAN show today.
[157.74 --> 158.72]  Hey, Vaughn.
[158.72 --> 161.80]  Can I bore you for a minute?
[166.24 --> 171.36]  Oh, I just wanted my three-month-old daughter to make a special appearance on WAN show today.
[171.94 --> 173.14]  Is she able to do that?
[173.82 --> 174.86]  Is she kind of cranky right now?
[176.28 --> 176.70]  Okay.
[178.26 --> 179.96]  Oh, and...
[179.96 --> 181.06]  Oh, boy.
[181.88 --> 183.56]  Oh, man, they get heavy fast.
[184.12 --> 187.52]  So this is definitely how to handle a baby.
[187.52 --> 191.88]  When you are streaming live.
[192.62 --> 193.20]  There you go.
[193.90 --> 195.22]  So that's my new baby.
[195.32 --> 197.28]  I really don't know what she's looking at.
[197.70 --> 203.18]  You can tell that she is my daughter because she is wearing her brother's hand-me-downs.
[204.12 --> 206.22]  That is the way that you can tell that.
[206.22 --> 208.22]  And, um...
[208.22 --> 209.72]  Hi.
[210.34 --> 211.42]  Are you going to smile for us?
[211.88 --> 212.12]  Hello?
[213.92 --> 216.36]  Oh, she doesn't want to play the tickle-the-nose game.
[217.20 --> 217.44]  Hey.
[218.20 --> 219.46]  What are you even looking at?
[221.30 --> 222.30]  What if I bounce you?
[223.00 --> 224.54]  Wow, you're getting really heavy.
[225.00 --> 225.28]  Hello?
[225.28 --> 225.68]  Okay.
[228.08 --> 228.42]  Yep.
[228.58 --> 231.28]  And she was not stoked on that guest appearance.
[232.04 --> 232.84]  And we're done.
[234.50 --> 235.56]  So, uh...
[235.56 --> 236.08]  All right.
[236.16 --> 239.10]  We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today, which is a total lie.
[239.44 --> 241.32]  But we do have a couple of topics.
[241.32 --> 246.32]  So, Amazon patents reveal...
[247.40 --> 256.70]  I won't call this a plan, but they reveal talk, I guess, of flying warehouses that send delivery drones to your door.
[257.42 --> 263.66]  There's a rumor that HTC is expected to unveil the Vive 2 at CES 27.
[264.12 --> 264.88]  Already?
[265.68 --> 267.78]  I just bought a Vive.
[267.78 --> 270.78]  Um...
[270.78 --> 271.62]  Okay.
[273.00 --> 274.16]  And, uh...
[274.16 --> 279.50]  Tesla predicts accidents and gives warning before it happens.
[280.40 --> 282.66]  And in Florida...
[282.66 --> 283.88]  A Florida senator says,
[284.40 --> 287.80]  We shouldn't need a permit for driverless cars.
[288.88 --> 289.78]  So, uh...
[290.90 --> 292.12]  There you go.
[292.70 --> 294.30]  Let's go ahead and roll the intro.
[294.40 --> 295.04]  Let's see if it works.
[295.36 --> 295.90]  Is it going to work?
[297.78 --> 316.00]  Oh, there's no, uh...
[316.00 --> 316.78]  There's no music.
[316.96 --> 317.22]  Yeah.
[317.38 --> 318.42]  Well, you know what?
[318.52 --> 318.80]  Uh...
[318.80 --> 319.52]  Oh, FreshBooks.
[320.04 --> 320.90]  There we go.
[321.00 --> 322.60]  FreshBooks.com slash when.
[322.60 --> 330.46]  And there's no reason to stay here and stare at the intro because there is no awesome music to go with it.
[330.54 --> 332.44]  So, this is kind of a...
[332.44 --> 332.96]  You know what?
[333.08 --> 333.26]  Here.
[333.50 --> 340.34]  This is a perfect opportunity for me to talk about sort of one of the challenges that I think we've had with the WAN Show computer.
[340.34 --> 350.04]  So, we learned recently that the best way to update XSplit is to fully uninstall it and reinstall it.
[350.84 --> 352.24]  I did not know that.
[352.24 --> 364.98]  But apparently, what XSplit does, if you just install updates on top of updates on top of updates, is it only updates certain parts of the program.
[364.98 --> 378.10]  So, if you've ever had XSplit have, like, the old icon in your taskbar, but then you launch it and it has the new logo on the splash screen, but then it has, like, the older style theme.
[379.72 --> 380.70]  That's why.
[380.70 --> 386.90]  So, I have an issue with XSplit right now where I can't play AVIs.
[387.66 --> 390.44]  And so, that's why I can't play our normal intros.
[390.56 --> 391.44]  They play slowly.
[391.52 --> 392.00]  All of them.
[392.74 --> 399.06]  But I was even able to play back a much higher bitrate file, which is our old, old intro, but one that doesn't have audio.
[399.56 --> 403.42]  And that's how I temporarily got it working, but then I have never looked at it again.
[403.90 --> 406.58]  And so, it's very, very temporary.
[406.58 --> 416.28]  And to the army of people demanding that we use OBS, OBS is a steeping pile in completely different ways.
[416.84 --> 421.00]  So, yes, I have used OBS, and I have used XSplit.
[421.30 --> 423.70]  And in this case, I'm going with the devil that I know.
[423.76 --> 429.22]  If anyone has a suggestion that is not OBS, then I'll be willing to listen to it.
[429.52 --> 430.50]  No, it all sucks.
[430.78 --> 431.04]  Yeah.
[431.98 --> 432.58]  But, uh...
[433.22 --> 433.94]  Turn all of them.
[434.14 --> 434.86]  Thank you.
[434.86 --> 437.30]  Thank you to all the suggestions for OBS.
[438.08 --> 438.86]  But, um...
[439.50 --> 441.92]  Yeah, I'm not pretending that XSplit is perfect.
[442.44 --> 446.58]  I am literally in the middle of complaining about it.
[447.42 --> 450.06]  But that doesn't mean that OBS is great.
[450.20 --> 450.44]  Sorry.
[451.24 --> 451.94]  All right.
[452.88 --> 457.06]  So, let's go ahead and jump into one of our topics here.
[458.96 --> 460.64]  Wow, I could really use some water.
[460.64 --> 464.44]  But we are so short right now on people.
[464.60 --> 469.32]  I don't even know if there's someone that I could cry to to bring me a bottle of water at the moment.
[469.76 --> 473.98]  So, the original article here is from TechCrunch.
[474.50 --> 480.62]  Amazon patents show flying warehouses that send delivery drones to your door.
[480.78 --> 482.14]  Figure three.
[482.32 --> 483.58]  Look at figure three.
[483.58 --> 484.82]  Okay.
[484.82 --> 484.92]  Okay.
[485.44 --> 490.82]  So, this warehouse has this blimp or something.
[491.26 --> 492.34]  So, 350.
[492.86 --> 493.14]  Okay.
[493.72 --> 497.72]  So, blimp 350 goes, like, here or something.
[498.46 --> 498.84]  Okay.
[498.84 --> 504.64]  And then blimp 302 is, like, bigger than blimp 350.
[505.20 --> 508.02]  And has, like, a warehouse.
[508.28 --> 508.84]  I mean...
[510.60 --> 512.48]  Tailspin, anyone?
[513.94 --> 514.78]  Like...
[514.78 --> 515.70]  Oh, thank you, Colton.
[516.16 --> 517.66]  Like, tailspin, right?
[517.76 --> 520.28]  Like, we're just gonna have, like, floating gas stations.
[520.70 --> 522.58]  And, like, Sky Pirates.
[522.86 --> 523.96]  That's the future.
[523.96 --> 528.28]  Sky Pirates busting into Amazon floating warehouses.
[530.26 --> 531.86]  And, like, the air police.
[532.54 --> 535.48]  Like, right now, we've got police on foot.
[535.78 --> 537.34]  We've got police in cars.
[537.68 --> 539.30]  We've got police in motorcycles.
[539.60 --> 540.68]  Police in helicopters.
[541.14 --> 543.14]  In Canada, we have police on horses.
[543.78 --> 546.92]  And now we're gonna have police in airplanes.
[548.22 --> 549.24]  It's gonna happen.
[549.40 --> 550.40]  I'm calling it right now.
[550.40 --> 555.68]  December 30th, 2016, was when Linus predicted airplane police.
[556.28 --> 557.74]  Which probably already exists.
[557.82 --> 558.46]  Just calm down.
[559.10 --> 560.60]  But anyway, so look back...
[560.60 --> 561.54]  Going back to the...
[561.54 --> 563.74]  Going back to the screen share here.
[563.92 --> 567.92]  So, the idea would be that you would have these resupply drones
[567.92 --> 572.24]  carry supplies, presumably, up to the...
[572.24 --> 573.14]  Blimps, not drones.
[573.20 --> 574.00]  I'm not gonna call it a drone.
[574.12 --> 574.28]  Sorry.
[574.40 --> 575.68]  I mean, it would probably be a drone,
[575.76 --> 576.82]  because it would probably be automated.
[577.04 --> 578.22]  But besides the point.
[578.22 --> 581.18]  So, you'd have a resupply blimp from the warehouse, 330,
[581.60 --> 583.78]  to the larger blimp, 302.
[584.00 --> 586.10]  And then you would have drones that, like,
[586.62 --> 588.52]  carry stuff to the city.
[588.62 --> 592.70]  And then, like, maybe returns would go back to blimp 350.
[593.18 --> 594.22]  So, blimp 350...
[595.00 --> 595.68]  Hold on a second.
[595.84 --> 596.24]  So, okay.
[596.40 --> 601.22]  So, drones would go from the main warehouse to the city.
[601.22 --> 605.70]  And they could also go from blimp 350 to the city.
[606.04 --> 608.64]  And then they could also go up to 350,
[608.88 --> 610.72]  and then down from 302 to the city.
[610.80 --> 612.36]  So, the idea being, then, I guess,
[612.74 --> 620.10]  that you would never be deploying more aircraft than you need
[620.10 --> 622.06]  to get to the final destination.
[623.72 --> 625.28]  Very, very cool.
[625.28 --> 627.14]  I will now read the notes,
[627.86 --> 630.78]  because I basically made all that up as I went,
[630.86 --> 632.72]  from one diagram, figure three.
[634.98 --> 636.56]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[636.64 --> 637.26]  More detail.
[637.44 --> 637.94]  Blah, blah, blah.
[638.04 --> 639.04]  Warehouse in a Zeppelin.
[639.20 --> 639.72]  Blah, blah, blah.
[639.86 --> 641.54]  Including temperature-controlled models,
[641.62 --> 643.10]  ideally suited for food delivery.
[643.50 --> 645.32]  That would be freaking awesome.
[645.92 --> 647.84]  Like, food coming down from the sky.
[649.22 --> 650.44]  All my favorite shows.
[650.52 --> 651.84]  Cloudy with a Chance Meatballs now.
[651.84 --> 655.44]  An example cited in the filing is that at a sporting event,
[655.68 --> 661.74]  Amazon AFCs could be loaded above with snacks and souvenirs.
[662.34 --> 667.06]  So, Amazon would be finding a way to take their 8% to 15% cut.
[667.14 --> 670.66]  I forget exactly what it is to get fulfillment by Amazon right now
[670.66 --> 671.88]  as a third-party seller.
[671.96 --> 673.46]  We looked into it with our Wancho hoodies.
[674.00 --> 675.72]  But they're basically trying to figure out
[675.72 --> 679.26]  how to get their 10% to 15% cut on everything.
[680.26 --> 680.66]  Amazing.
[681.84 --> 684.42]  Besides the Airborne Fulfillment Center,
[684.54 --> 685.68]  so those are the AFCs,
[685.76 --> 687.02]  and the affiliated drones,
[687.14 --> 689.10]  the company has envisioned larger shuttles
[689.10 --> 690.40]  that could carry people,
[691.06 --> 692.62]  supplies and drones to the AFCs,
[692.70 --> 693.76]  or back to the ground.
[696.72 --> 698.36]  Well, that sounds like the kind of future
[698.36 --> 699.56]  that I would want to be a part of.
[700.28 --> 701.82]  As long as we don't run out of helium.
[702.72 --> 703.56]  We'll be okay.
[703.94 --> 705.58]  Because they start filling those things with hydrogen.
[705.58 --> 710.58]  Then it doesn't take Linus class future telling
[710.58 --> 714.68]  in order to figure out what's probably going to happen at such time.
[715.58 --> 716.28]  All right.
[716.60 --> 718.82]  Let's move on to our next topic here.
[718.96 --> 722.68]  What on earth is Luke doing in the background of the Wancho
[722.68 --> 723.76]  instead of being here?
[723.84 --> 725.66]  Well, he's waving to you for one thing,
[725.84 --> 727.58]  and he's also finishing up...
[727.58 --> 728.20]  Hold on.
[728.20 --> 729.66]  I'm going to move my chair out of the way.
[731.74 --> 733.22]  I'm going to move myself out...
[733.22 --> 734.86]  Who locks these chairs?
[735.54 --> 737.34]  Who lets Terran sit in these chairs?
[739.28 --> 739.58]  Okay.
[740.58 --> 741.10]  Swear.
[741.22 --> 742.76]  Every time Terran sits in a chair,
[743.12 --> 745.02]  he adjusts the seat so it's like a V
[745.02 --> 748.40]  instead of being flat on the bottom,
[748.40 --> 750.00]  and he locks the tilt.
[750.80 --> 751.70]  I hate him.
[755.04 --> 755.52]  Okay.
[755.86 --> 757.84]  Well, it wasn't him this time, actually.
[758.28 --> 759.14]  But anyway, that's what...
[759.14 --> 759.60]  Get out of here.
[759.68 --> 760.68]  It's so easy to fix.
[760.68 --> 762.00]  It's one lever.
[762.08 --> 763.76]  You're not even in the frame, which is perfect.
[764.84 --> 765.28]  Wow.
[765.42 --> 766.34]  Now I'm in the frame.
[766.60 --> 767.68]  Now I'm in the frame.
[768.38 --> 768.70]  All right.
[769.44 --> 769.92]  Terrible.
[770.20 --> 771.08]  Can I see it?
[771.16 --> 772.06]  So anyway, that's Luke.
[772.28 --> 773.98]  Oh, whoa, whoa, what's that?
[774.58 --> 775.82]  Is that zero gravity?
[776.64 --> 778.60]  Well, not really, but they call it that.
[778.86 --> 780.04]  Not really, but they call it that.
[780.10 --> 780.38]  Perfect.
[780.54 --> 781.26]  Sounds like marketing.
[782.08 --> 782.44]  Okay.
[782.82 --> 785.46]  So Luke's working on the Surface Studio video,
[785.60 --> 787.36]  which will be up at some point.
[787.36 --> 789.04]  I actually have no idea when.
[790.72 --> 792.20]  I haven't looked at the video tracker.
[792.36 --> 794.18]  I've been busy trying to throw together
[794.18 --> 796.42]  all of my content for the lead up to CES.
[796.62 --> 798.62]  So as of next week,
[799.56 --> 802.08]  pretty much the whole company is going to...
[802.08 --> 803.50]  Actually, not even pretty much the whole company.
[803.60 --> 804.52]  There's so many people now.
[804.52 --> 807.58]  A big chunk of the company is going to be out of town
[807.58 --> 809.68]  at the Consumer Electronics Show,
[809.76 --> 811.68]  which I've been informed it is no longer called.
[812.02 --> 813.44]  It is called International CES.
[814.18 --> 814.56]  Okay.
[814.94 --> 815.26]  Sure.
[815.88 --> 818.74]  I mean, never mind that CES did at least at some point
[818.74 --> 820.34]  stand for Consumer Electronics Show.
[820.56 --> 823.04]  Never mind that it is a Consumer Electronics Show,
[823.32 --> 824.06]  International CES.
[824.14 --> 825.96]  So that's where we'll be all next week.
[826.16 --> 829.10]  The plan is to churn out something to the tune
[829.10 --> 833.48]  of 40 to 50 videos sponsored by dbrand.
[835.48 --> 836.92]  And also some other companies.
[837.66 --> 839.90]  Actually, I don't even know if the dbrand deal is inked yet.
[840.02 --> 842.30]  So now that I've said it, he's pretty much stuck, right?
[842.86 --> 844.16]  Anyway, sponsored by dbrand.
[844.32 --> 847.18]  We're going to be covering what's new in the PC hardware space
[847.18 --> 848.40]  as well as Consumer Electronics,
[848.50 --> 849.64]  maybe even some camera crap,
[849.72 --> 851.52]  assuming Brandon can find some.
[851.52 --> 852.98]  We're going to put all that together for you
[852.98 --> 856.10]  and pump out all those videos
[856.10 --> 858.38]  within a span of about five to seven days.
[858.56 --> 859.30]  So stay tuned.
[859.38 --> 861.50]  It's going to be a glut of information
[861.50 --> 863.40]  on all the hot new stuff that's going to be coming
[863.40 --> 866.00]  for about the first half of 2017.
[866.36 --> 867.02]  Look at this glove.
[867.50 --> 868.94]  Speaking of CES rumors,
[869.78 --> 872.44]  what is this glove that you're not going to be getting
[872.44 --> 873.28]  any love if you wear?
[874.10 --> 875.40]  It's like an artist's glove.
[875.70 --> 877.00]  So when you're writing on the screen,
[877.20 --> 878.58]  this part of your hand is gloved.
[878.58 --> 881.36]  So it doesn't put your oils and whatnot
[881.36 --> 882.42]  from your hand on the screen
[882.42 --> 883.78]  and it glides smoothly.
[884.60 --> 884.80]  Oh.
[885.38 --> 886.02]  Ooh.
[888.18 --> 888.82]  Ooh.
[891.92 --> 892.56]  Fancy.
[894.46 --> 896.34]  Yeah, your falsetto is terrible
[896.34 --> 898.60]  and very alarming.
[898.92 --> 899.54]  Disturbing?
[899.74 --> 900.86]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[901.16 --> 901.78]  Unnerving?
[902.32 --> 903.16]  All three.
[905.36 --> 906.36]  All right.
[906.36 --> 908.38]  So on the subject of CES,
[908.62 --> 910.40]  let's move into our next big topic here.
[910.88 --> 913.96]  HTC expected to unveil.
[914.36 --> 920.92]  HTC Vive 2 at CES 2017 says report.
[922.36 --> 923.82]  And the baby's crying.
[925.70 --> 926.30]  Sorry.
[927.76 --> 929.06]  We're working on it.
[929.06 --> 934.88]  So according to Taipei-based Central News Agency,
[935.32 --> 939.54]  the Vive 2 is expected to utilize a wireless transmitter
[939.54 --> 941.42]  to connect with PC systems
[941.42 --> 944.24]  and to come with two 4K displays
[944.24 --> 947.50]  and a monitor refresh rate of 120 hertz
[947.50 --> 949.26]  instead of 90 hertz.
[950.14 --> 953.06]  Meanwhile, HTC has also reduced the price
[953.06 --> 955.06]  of Vive devices sold in China by 10%,
[955.06 --> 959.76]  and this is apparently to pave the way
[959.76 --> 961.78]  for the launch of the Vive 2.
[962.84 --> 965.36]  So I got to jump in here for a minute,
[965.68 --> 968.60]  and actually I'm going to ask Luke to jump in here
[968.60 --> 971.24]  for a minute because we did hear
[971.24 --> 974.38]  about a third-party accessory available for the Vive,
[974.50 --> 978.82]  which if you guys recall is 1440p 90 hertz.
[978.82 --> 983.78]  So let's go ahead and do some basic calculator math here, okay?
[984.46 --> 985.48]  I'm going to use calculator
[985.48 --> 987.82]  because every time I try and do math in my head
[987.82 --> 988.76]  live on the WAN show,
[988.86 --> 990.96]  I screw it up and you guys all make fun of me
[990.96 --> 993.38]  and it hurts my self-esteem very, very much.
[993.70 --> 995.56]  So calculator math, okay?
[997.44 --> 1002.10]  2560 times 1440, okay?
[1002.10 --> 1011.96]  Times, so that's 3.686 megapixels per frame, okay?
[1014.18 --> 1016.60]  Wait a second, that doesn't, oh bloody hell,
[1016.66 --> 1017.68]  that doesn't tell me the data rate.
[1017.74 --> 1018.88]  Well, whatever, times 90.
[1019.82 --> 1023.90]  So every second, 331 million megapixels.
[1023.96 --> 1024.94]  So you're going to tell me
[1024.94 --> 1030.02]  that we're going to take that, 331 million, okay?
[1030.02 --> 1033.50]  Everyone remember, 331 million because I can't, okay?
[1033.94 --> 1039.04]  So 3840 times 2160, okay?
[1039.78 --> 1042.88]  Times 120, okay.
[1043.54 --> 1045.84]  So you're going to tell me with a straight face
[1045.84 --> 1051.28]  that what was already from my conversations with Luke
[1051.28 --> 1055.00]  kind of a janky third-party wireless accessory,
[1055.56 --> 1057.38]  what was already kind of janky,
[1057.38 --> 1061.04]  we are going to 3x the pixel count,
[1061.62 --> 1063.82]  which to be clear doesn't necessarily mean
[1063.82 --> 1065.72]  a tripling of the needed bandwidth,
[1066.06 --> 1069.44]  but it will definitely be significantly higher,
[1069.56 --> 1070.48]  very, very much higher.
[1071.10 --> 1073.36]  So you're going to take that
[1073.36 --> 1075.24]  and you're going to make wireless
[1075.24 --> 1077.80]  part of the out-of-box experience.
[1078.34 --> 1081.46]  I really don't know how much stock
[1081.46 --> 1082.80]  to put in this rumor.
[1082.80 --> 1085.94]  So that's what I'll say about that.
[1086.02 --> 1087.52]  I will be thrilled as all heck
[1087.52 --> 1089.68]  if they are actually showing off the Vive 2,
[1090.10 --> 1093.12]  but given that we don't really have a contact at HTC
[1093.12 --> 1093.94]  or Valve,
[1094.18 --> 1098.16]  we haven't gotten any kind of an early heads up,
[1098.22 --> 1100.08]  nor have we even got a meeting booked.
[1100.42 --> 1102.44]  So if they do show it,
[1102.52 --> 1105.18]  I guess we will just have to door crash
[1105.18 --> 1109.36]  and figure out how to get a video shot of it.
[1111.26 --> 1112.14]  All right.
[1114.14 --> 1115.24]  Actually, you know what?
[1115.46 --> 1120.10]  I have a very interesting straw poll for you guys.
[1121.00 --> 1122.12]  Straw poll me!
[1122.74 --> 1125.96]  I only want to hear from owners
[1125.96 --> 1129.66]  or people who are close enough to an owner
[1129.66 --> 1133.36]  of an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive.
[1133.60 --> 1133.86]  Okay?
[1133.98 --> 1134.90]  This is very important.
[1135.36 --> 1136.40]  This is a very serious poll.
[1136.62 --> 1136.84]  Okay?
[1136.94 --> 1138.66]  So owners of...
[1139.60 --> 1142.66]  I'm going to call them premium VR headsets.
[1144.60 --> 1147.72]  How long since you last used it?
[1152.30 --> 1152.78]  Okay?
[1153.12 --> 1157.92]  So I'm going to put less than one week.
[1159.66 --> 1163.94]  Less than one month
[1163.94 --> 1169.66]  and more than one month ago.
[1170.18 --> 1170.52]  Okay?
[1171.12 --> 1172.68]  I want to hear from you guys.
[1172.76 --> 1173.92]  I'm going to answer the poll,
[1174.02 --> 1176.16]  but I want to hear some results from you guys first.
[1177.60 --> 1182.46]  Who is actually using their VR headsets out there?
[1182.54 --> 1185.06]  So I'm going to go ahead and hit this straw poll again here.
[1185.12 --> 1186.14]  And why are you here?
[1186.14 --> 1189.50]  Because Twitch chat is incredibly upset
[1189.50 --> 1191.64]  that we haven't confirmed
[1191.64 --> 1193.98]  that apparently the news is fake about the Vive 2.
[1194.88 --> 1198.18]  So even though you were saying that you think it's fake,
[1198.28 --> 1199.16]  don't believe it,
[1199.24 --> 1199.58]  they're like,
[1199.70 --> 1202.04]  it's fake and you're stupid for believing it.
[1202.78 --> 1203.38]  So...
[1203.38 --> 1204.72]  But I didn't say I believed it.
[1204.84 --> 1205.24]  Exactly.
[1205.92 --> 1207.22]  I said I don't believe it.
[1207.36 --> 1208.24]  I even did math.
[1208.34 --> 1208.82]  Thanks, Twitch chat.
[1208.82 --> 1209.80]  Which is not a strong point for me.
[1209.80 --> 1210.54]  You guys are great.
[1210.54 --> 1211.86]  Anyway,
[1212.50 --> 1214.68]  PC Gamer released something 27 minutes ago
[1214.68 --> 1216.28]  that HTC said it was fake.
[1216.58 --> 1217.18]  So there you go.
[1217.34 --> 1218.60]  Oh, 27 minutes ago.
[1218.72 --> 1219.14]  Well, what...
[1219.14 --> 1219.84]  Thanks, Twitch chat.
[1220.06 --> 1221.38]  Why isn't Colton on this?
[1221.78 --> 1221.84]  Huh?
[1221.84 --> 1222.48]  Thanks, Twitch chat.
[1222.74 --> 1223.98]  It only happened 27 minutes ago.
[1224.96 --> 1225.22]  Dicks.
[1226.18 --> 1228.44]  I even used math.
[1230.38 --> 1230.98]  All right.
[1231.30 --> 1232.12]  You used a calculator.
[1232.42 --> 1233.44]  Let's go ahead and have a look.
[1233.66 --> 1234.46]  Let's go ahead and have a look.
[1234.68 --> 1236.68]  Oh, oh, that's not looking pretty.
[1236.68 --> 1237.08]  Okay.
[1237.64 --> 1239.74]  So 20% of you,
[1240.12 --> 1242.82]  less than a month ago,
[1243.74 --> 1247.60]  38% of you have actually used it in the last weeks.
[1247.84 --> 1249.62]  I spelled that wrong, but that's okay.
[1249.98 --> 1252.68]  I don't actually believe that 600 of you
[1252.68 --> 1255.10]  have HTC Vibes or Oculus Rifts,
[1255.24 --> 1257.34]  but, you know, that's a whole other conversation.
[1257.90 --> 1261.38]  And more than a month ago, say 42% of you.
[1261.48 --> 1263.32]  So I'm actually going to put...
[1263.32 --> 1265.42]  I'm going to put my vote in here.
[1266.68 --> 1270.26]  Of less than one month.
[1270.36 --> 1271.56]  So it's been more than a week,
[1271.68 --> 1273.10]  but less than a month for me.
[1273.52 --> 1275.32]  And I'm not counting, actually,
[1275.62 --> 1278.28]  having someone over a little while ago
[1278.28 --> 1279.82]  and letting them use it,
[1279.86 --> 1281.52]  because I actually didn't use it.
[1282.26 --> 1284.22]  Neither I nor my son,
[1284.26 --> 1285.78]  and we're the only two people who use it,
[1286.08 --> 1287.40]  have used it in the last week,
[1287.42 --> 1289.42]  and it's been almost a month for both of us.
[1289.42 --> 1292.02]  So as much as I really like it,
[1292.32 --> 1299.18]  the gameplay experiences aren't that amazing yet.
[1299.52 --> 1302.62]  Although Ed has told me that there are some pretty good games
[1302.62 --> 1304.18]  that I should try out pretty soon.
[1304.80 --> 1307.10]  He had me play someone with him,
[1307.16 --> 1307.98]  I forget what it's called,
[1308.10 --> 1309.80]  it involves magic or something,
[1309.90 --> 1311.18]  and standing on platforms.
[1311.94 --> 1313.70]  Yeah, I forget, I don't care what it's called.
[1313.80 --> 1315.64]  He kicked my ass so hard.
[1315.64 --> 1316.62]  It was embarrassing.
[1317.82 --> 1320.00]  I played once with them,
[1320.28 --> 1322.60]  and in my defense, I was having some issues.
[1322.84 --> 1325.56]  I had to play on the Rift, not the Vive,
[1325.94 --> 1328.16]  because I was using a pre-release copy
[1328.16 --> 1330.08]  that was part of our reviewer's kit for the Rift.
[1331.10 --> 1333.52]  And anyway, my cameras weren't really working properly,
[1333.68 --> 1337.30]  and half of my screen was going black a lot of the time,
[1337.38 --> 1339.20]  every five to ten seconds.
[1339.42 --> 1341.54]  In my defense, it really wasn't working correctly.
[1341.54 --> 1345.92]  But I would just move to a platform,
[1346.92 --> 1350.60]  and then he'd be launching all these spells and crap at me,
[1350.66 --> 1352.12]  and then it would cover all my other platforms,
[1352.20 --> 1353.54]  and I couldn't move, and then he would just kill me.
[1354.14 --> 1356.30]  And I was just like, this is dumb.
[1356.92 --> 1358.10]  Okay, it's a cool game.
[1358.44 --> 1358.64]  Yeah.
[1358.64 --> 1360.80]  Just because the scale of abilities.
[1361.18 --> 1362.30]  Because he's played a lot.
[1362.30 --> 1364.36]  Yeah, so basically,
[1364.90 --> 1366.70]  basically, the moral of the story
[1366.70 --> 1370.04]  is that Ed is one of those nerds
[1370.04 --> 1371.46]  who sits and...
[1371.46 --> 1372.90]  Don't move that chair!
[1374.78 --> 1376.78]  Ed is one of those nerds
[1376.78 --> 1380.28]  that sits and practices Mario Kart by himself
[1380.28 --> 1382.42]  so that when all of his friends come over,
[1382.86 --> 1383.64]  he can be like,
[1383.88 --> 1386.40]  oh, I'm gonna hide behind this weak justification
[1386.40 --> 1388.34]  that I wanted to unlock all the characters.
[1388.34 --> 1389.68]  But actually,
[1390.36 --> 1392.04]  all he's done is create an environment
[1392.04 --> 1394.30]  where no one else can have any fun playing with him.
[1394.76 --> 1395.02]  Okay.
[1395.20 --> 1396.36]  Because he's just...
[1396.36 --> 1397.48]  There is online matchmaking
[1397.48 --> 1400.14]  where he can play against other people.
[1400.14 --> 1401.72]  Who sits and plays by himself
[1401.72 --> 1402.70]  because for him,
[1402.78 --> 1404.52]  gaming is not a social experience.
[1405.02 --> 1406.22]  It's a winning experience?
[1406.36 --> 1406.56]  Yeah.
[1406.76 --> 1408.18]  Gaming is just a winning experience.
[1408.40 --> 1409.40]  It's about humiliation.
[1409.58 --> 1411.16]  It's not about other people having fun.
[1413.86 --> 1415.14]  On your way back over there,
[1415.18 --> 1416.90]  do you mind double-checking the focus of the camera?
[1416.90 --> 1418.38]  Minus, I have a question.
[1418.38 --> 1420.20]  That's how I cleverly lured him over here.
[1420.58 --> 1421.18]  Thank you, Ed.
[1421.46 --> 1421.82]  Minus.
[1422.08 --> 1422.96]  Yes, what can I do for you?
[1423.00 --> 1423.42]  Talk louder.
[1423.52 --> 1424.32]  The microphone is here.
[1424.50 --> 1425.44]  Did you get thermals
[1425.44 --> 1427.22]  for the Razer Blade Pro late 2016
[1427.22 --> 1428.82]  for the GPU and CPU temperatures
[1428.82 --> 1429.92]  because I don't have a graph for it
[1429.92 --> 1430.68]  and John has no data?
[1431.18 --> 1431.42]  There.
[1432.52 --> 1434.22]  This has nothing to do with the WAN show.
[1434.52 --> 1435.00]  I'm sorry.
[1435.48 --> 1436.78]  Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize.
[1437.82 --> 1438.18]  Thermals.
[1438.36 --> 1438.72]  I don't know.
[1438.82 --> 1439.60]  Are they in the folder?
[1440.06 --> 1441.32]  John says he doesn't have it.
[1441.54 --> 1442.10]  Where would...
[1442.10 --> 1443.42]  Is there a place for it to go?
[1443.96 --> 1444.26]  Well, yeah.
[1444.32 --> 1445.18]  You say it in the script.
[1445.52 --> 1446.34]  What do I say exactly?
[1446.34 --> 1448.02]  You say thermals of GPU and CPU.
[1448.94 --> 1449.34]  Perhaps.
[1450.26 --> 1451.60]  I don't have that information.
[1452.44 --> 1453.52]  Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[1455.44 --> 1457.00]  So that's a great question.
[1458.34 --> 1461.40]  And I have a really good answer for you.
[1462.20 --> 1466.44]  That is that I will use my Razer Blade late 2016,
[1466.74 --> 1467.94]  which I have right in front of me,
[1468.04 --> 1470.36]  and I will run a stress test right now.
[1470.58 --> 1470.88]  Wow.
[1470.88 --> 1471.66]  On the show?
[1471.74 --> 1472.52]  On the show.
[1472.60 --> 1473.28]  That's right, folks.
[1473.48 --> 1475.00]  You are seeing live creation.
[1475.00 --> 1475.64]  Live benchmarking.
[1475.90 --> 1477.10]  You are seeing live...
[1477.10 --> 1478.30]  On our live video,
[1478.48 --> 1480.48]  you are seeing us live create a video.
[1481.48 --> 1482.86]  Yes, my friends.
[1483.00 --> 1484.44]  That is what is going on right now.
[1484.44 --> 1486.56]  This is how janky things get sometimes.
[1486.56 --> 1487.32]  In this moment.
[1487.32 --> 1487.82]  Yeah.
[1488.12 --> 1488.64]  Well...
[1488.64 --> 1489.40]  I'm working on it.
[1490.12 --> 1490.90]  Thanks, John.
[1491.00 --> 1491.66]  While you do that,
[1491.72 --> 1492.84]  what's the next item on the thing
[1492.84 --> 1495.50]  so I can talk about it with my talking words?
[1495.50 --> 1502.12]  Um, I have no idea why you think I would want you to cover the next topic.
[1502.28 --> 1504.86]  Oh, well, because you're busy is why.
[1504.92 --> 1506.08]  Wrecked so hard.
[1506.08 --> 1506.94]  But I'm not seeing it.
[1507.00 --> 1508.08]  Wrecked so hard.
[1508.18 --> 1509.60]  Because I'm so bad.
[1510.38 --> 1511.48]  Oh, I found.
[1511.64 --> 1512.00]  Oh, yeah, I found the door.
[1512.00 --> 1512.80]  I don't think that's it.
[1512.88 --> 1513.96]  I think that's last week.
[1514.14 --> 1514.40]  Uh-oh.
[1514.44 --> 1515.42]  You should check the date at the top of the page.
[1515.42 --> 1517.10]  Why would last week's be...
[1517.10 --> 1518.74]  Because Luke hasn't been on the show yet.
[1518.84 --> 1519.20]  All right.
[1519.72 --> 1525.22]  Tesla predicts accidents and gives a warning before it happens.
[1525.22 --> 1526.08]  I saw that video.
[1526.24 --> 1526.82]  Look at this.
[1526.86 --> 1527.88]  It's really, really, really cool.
[1528.40 --> 1529.14]  Really cool.
[1529.28 --> 1532.96]  So, the original article here is from E-Technics,
[1533.12 --> 1535.50]  and you should definitely watch the video.
[1536.22 --> 1536.82]  Here we go.
[1537.14 --> 1539.48]  The new radar technology predicts an accident.
[1540.02 --> 1540.52]  Here we go.
[1542.66 --> 1544.44]  It's 52 seconds long,
[1544.58 --> 1546.82]  and hopefully I don't get a copyright strike for this.
[1548.70 --> 1551.58]  Basically, you know, driving.
[1552.80 --> 1553.20]  Driving.
[1553.38 --> 1553.86]  Oh, wow.
[1554.00 --> 1554.38]  Okay.
[1554.38 --> 1555.32]  See, that's bad.
[1555.52 --> 1556.62]  That thing that's going on there.
[1556.72 --> 1556.96]  Wow.
[1557.06 --> 1557.60]  Hit the brakes.
[1558.70 --> 1559.22]  Love it.
[1560.08 --> 1560.44]  Beautiful.
[1561.40 --> 1562.84]  Very unexpected thing.
[1563.96 --> 1566.04]  Honestly, I wouldn't even have a ton of faith
[1566.04 --> 1568.26]  in an experienced human driver
[1568.26 --> 1571.22]  to respond that well and that quickly
[1571.22 --> 1572.68]  to that kind of a hazard.
[1572.72 --> 1573.12]  Now, hang on.
[1573.16 --> 1574.30]  Can you pull up the article again?
[1574.34 --> 1575.96]  Because I don't know if that's a prediction.
[1576.60 --> 1577.62]  Because what I heard was,
[1577.62 --> 1578.90]  it's actually bouncing the radar
[1578.90 --> 1580.76]  underneath the car in front of you
[1580.76 --> 1583.28]  to see the car in front of that car.
[1583.28 --> 1583.70]  Mm-hmm.
[1584.00 --> 1585.46]  And that's the one that it saw
[1585.46 --> 1587.00]  was hitting the brakes really hard.
[1587.16 --> 1587.94]  And so it's like,
[1588.02 --> 1591.14]  oh, the car behind that car
[1591.14 --> 1592.82]  isn't going to be able to brake or it will.
[1592.90 --> 1593.72]  And then the third car
[1593.72 --> 1594.70]  is actually going to hit the thing.
[1594.70 --> 1596.56]  So it didn't predict
[1596.56 --> 1598.46]  as much as be able to see
[1598.46 --> 1600.42]  a car that the human couldn't see.
[1600.62 --> 1600.90]  Yes.
[1601.16 --> 1601.46]  Yes.
[1601.56 --> 1602.52]  So it's like predicting.
[1602.76 --> 1603.72]  Well, that's not predicting.
[1603.86 --> 1605.08]  That's reacting very quickly.
[1605.10 --> 1607.08]  It's predicting that what the human
[1607.08 --> 1608.72]  would have been able to see
[1608.72 --> 1611.86]  will change in some way
[1611.86 --> 1613.28]  that a human wouldn't have been able to know.
[1613.30 --> 1614.88]  I think the word predicting here
[1614.88 --> 1615.82]  is a little bit odd.
[1615.92 --> 1619.04]  I would use fast reaction or something.
[1619.30 --> 1620.64]  Anyway, very cool.
[1620.78 --> 1621.60]  Predictive reaction.
[1621.82 --> 1622.16]  Whatever.
[1622.46 --> 1622.66]  TM.
[1623.16 --> 1623.40]  TM.
[1623.54 --> 1624.62]  Predictive reaction TM.
[1624.82 --> 1625.44]  Very cool.
[1625.52 --> 1626.86]  Someone's going to end up using that.
[1627.20 --> 1628.62]  Some car maker is going to have
[1628.62 --> 1629.94]  predictive reaction technology.
[1630.14 --> 1631.68]  The names they have for things.
[1631.68 --> 1632.70]  It's the new RGB, right?
[1632.76 --> 1633.92]  The names they have for things.
[1634.06 --> 1634.44]  It's like.
[1634.58 --> 1634.94]  I know.
[1635.50 --> 1635.96]  I know.
[1636.16 --> 1637.40]  Well, I mean, we at last,
[1637.48 --> 1638.18]  what was it, CES?
[1638.28 --> 1640.10]  Like we saw like this whole room
[1640.10 --> 1642.20]  full of like car self-driving stuff.
[1642.54 --> 1643.84]  And it was like all these maps and stuff.
[1643.84 --> 1645.42]  And yeah, there was ridiculous names.
[1645.68 --> 1645.92]  Yep.
[1646.04 --> 1646.80]  For all these things.
[1646.92 --> 1647.54]  They had the sensor
[1647.54 --> 1650.00]  and they had like rain flowing at it
[1650.00 --> 1651.50]  to show that it can see through rain.
[1652.04 --> 1652.36]  You know?
[1652.88 --> 1653.64]  Crazy stuff.
[1653.64 --> 1654.24]  All right.
[1654.30 --> 1654.80]  So basically,
[1655.06 --> 1657.62]  this is new radar processing technology
[1657.62 --> 1659.42]  that was pushed as an update in September
[1659.42 --> 1660.90]  under Tesla 8.0.
[1661.42 --> 1663.22]  Elon Musk explained the significance
[1663.22 --> 1664.08]  of the technology
[1664.08 --> 1665.72]  when it was announced in a press statement.
[1666.08 --> 1666.78]  And this is a quote.
[1666.78 --> 1669.90]  In fact, an additional level of sophistication.
[1670.56 --> 1672.62]  We are confident that we can use the radar
[1672.62 --> 1674.30]  to look beyond the car in front of you
[1674.30 --> 1675.74]  by bouncing the signal off the road
[1675.74 --> 1676.70]  and around the car.
[1676.80 --> 1678.28]  We are able to process that echo
[1678.28 --> 1680.06]  by using the unique signature
[1680.06 --> 1681.18]  of each radar pulse
[1681.18 --> 1683.18]  as well as the time of flight of the photon
[1683.18 --> 1685.18]  to determine that what we are seeing
[1685.18 --> 1688.62]  is in fact an echo of the front of the car
[1688.62 --> 1691.00]  that's in front of you.
[1691.00 --> 1694.16]  Holy actual balls.
[1694.94 --> 1695.76]  What are you doing?
[1695.92 --> 1696.82]  Are you coming back to the show?
[1697.46 --> 1698.24]  Okay, bye.
[1698.46 --> 1699.02]  Bye, everyone.
[1699.64 --> 1701.00]  It's not really coming back to the show
[1701.00 --> 1702.72]  if you were never on it.
[1703.60 --> 1704.00]  Yeah.
[1704.50 --> 1705.82]  So how's the Surface Studio?
[1706.18 --> 1708.02]  Really mostly cool.
[1709.32 --> 1710.00]  Watch the review.
[1711.38 --> 1712.12]  You like what I did there?
[1712.60 --> 1713.76]  Because I left like a cliffhanger.
[1714.38 --> 1715.24]  It's not a cliffhanger.
[1715.24 --> 1716.58]  It's just not answering a question.
[1717.72 --> 1718.06]  Fair.
[1719.76 --> 1722.38]  You should tell the producers of Lost
[1722.38 --> 1724.04]  that that's how that works.
[1724.20 --> 1725.08]  That that's how that works?
[1726.50 --> 1727.06]  It just...
[1727.80 --> 1728.08]  Whoa.
[1728.36 --> 1728.56]  Whoa.
[1729.52 --> 1730.18]  That was me.
[1730.24 --> 1730.82]  I kicked a thing.
[1731.02 --> 1731.24]  Okay.
[1731.24 --> 1731.96]  And it's okay.
[1732.14 --> 1732.36]  Okay.
[1732.66 --> 1732.84]  Yep.
[1733.06 --> 1733.90]  Everything is fine.
[1733.96 --> 1734.78]  I was moving at the time,
[1734.84 --> 1735.50]  so I thought it was me.
[1735.84 --> 1736.58]  I was like, no.
[1736.82 --> 1737.92]  I should go get my toque, too.
[1737.92 --> 1738.34]  Just wait.
[1738.56 --> 1739.80]  We're going to publish our video
[1739.80 --> 1741.52]  on the redoing of the WAN show
[1741.52 --> 1743.04]  because there's actually a whole bunch of stuff
[1743.04 --> 1743.84]  we're going to redo at once.
[1743.84 --> 1745.56]  We're going to redo the computer.
[1746.06 --> 1748.48]  We're going to sort of more formally
[1748.48 --> 1750.06]  redo all the capture stuff.
[1750.22 --> 1751.40]  We're going to redo the audio.
[1751.68 --> 1753.22]  We're going to redo the automated lighting
[1753.22 --> 1754.06]  and all that crap.
[1754.28 --> 1755.00]  And just watch.
[1755.22 --> 1756.04]  The first show,
[1756.26 --> 1758.30]  after we announce all these big improvements...
[1758.30 --> 1758.88]  Hour and a half late.
[1758.94 --> 1759.66]  Five minutes in,
[1759.98 --> 1762.44]  I'm going to kick a bucket onto the computer.
[1762.54 --> 1763.86]  It's going to unplug all the cables in the middle.
[1766.86 --> 1768.78]  All the audio stuff's just going to slide
[1768.78 --> 1770.74]  off the back of the table and smash and break.
[1772.38 --> 1772.70]  Yes!
[1773.00 --> 1773.48]  Here, one second.
[1773.48 --> 1774.28]  I want to be your twin.
[1774.60 --> 1775.76]  Nothing can...
[1775.76 --> 1776.36]  Wait, what?
[1776.62 --> 1777.48]  I have that toque, too.
[1777.52 --> 1777.88]  Oh!
[1778.54 --> 1779.36]  Okay, sure.
[1780.84 --> 1782.26]  Yeah, the story behind the toque
[1782.26 --> 1784.24]  is that it was made by a fan
[1784.24 --> 1786.82]  and it matches the LTT colors.
[1786.96 --> 1788.00]  So I think it's super cool
[1788.00 --> 1789.18]  and I've been wearing it this winter.
[1790.22 --> 1792.32]  Okay, so the original article here
[1792.32 --> 1793.60]  is from PolitiFact.
[1795.76 --> 1797.48]  Jeff Brands writes...
[1798.26 --> 1798.66]  I'm sorry.
[1798.66 --> 1800.12]  Jeff Brands says,
[1800.78 --> 1802.44]  unlike California,
[1802.70 --> 1804.76]  we in Florida
[1804.76 --> 1807.40]  welcome driverless cars.
[1807.88 --> 1809.00]  No permit...
[1809.00 --> 1810.36]  Oh, you walked past that
[1810.36 --> 1812.76]  and it blew the thing?
[1812.86 --> 1813.02]  Wait.
[1813.78 --> 1814.78]  No, what is this?
[1814.78 --> 1816.04]  I walked around it.
[1816.04 --> 1816.88]  What is that?
[1817.30 --> 1817.94]  What is...
[1817.94 --> 1818.66]  It's a...
[1818.66 --> 1819.90]  Oh, that's behind you.
[1820.12 --> 1821.76]  Oh, I thought it was the dude ad
[1821.76 --> 1822.58]  that hangs on the thing.
[1822.74 --> 1823.10]  Oh, okay.
[1823.18 --> 1823.42]  Anyway.
[1823.42 --> 1826.78]  So basically...
[1826.78 --> 1826.92]  Yeah.
[1827.54 --> 1828.06]  Here we go.
[1828.84 --> 1830.32]  Uber hit the road
[1830.32 --> 1831.40]  with self-driving cars
[1831.40 --> 1832.90]  in San Francisco in December,
[1833.24 --> 1834.76]  but California regulators
[1834.76 --> 1836.50]  quickly hit the brakes.
[1837.32 --> 1838.24]  So in Florida,
[1838.64 --> 1839.62]  Senator Jeff Brands
[1839.62 --> 1840.12]  saw an opening.
[1840.22 --> 1840.84]  Hey, Uber.
[1841.80 --> 1842.78]  Unlike California,
[1843.14 --> 1844.30]  we in Florida
[1844.30 --> 1845.88]  welcome driverless cars.
[1845.94 --> 1846.72]  No permit required.
[1846.82 --> 1848.68]  Hashtag open for business.
[1848.88 --> 1849.60]  And that was a tweet
[1849.60 --> 1851.46]  on December 22nd.
[1851.46 --> 1853.42]  So that's interesting.
[1853.58 --> 1854.68]  That is either
[1854.68 --> 1856.64]  a very progressive stance
[1856.64 --> 1858.56]  or a very reckless one.
[1858.92 --> 1859.20]  Yeah.
[1860.02 --> 1860.64]  Yeah.
[1861.12 --> 1862.98]  Because not all
[1862.98 --> 1864.28]  driverless car tech
[1864.28 --> 1865.62]  will be built equal.
[1865.88 --> 1866.16]  No.
[1866.60 --> 1868.16]  And I personally
[1868.16 --> 1869.52]  think that
[1869.52 --> 1870.76]  some kind of
[1870.76 --> 1872.46]  government validation...
[1873.08 --> 1874.72]  There needs to be a...
[1874.72 --> 1875.80]  Car by car.
[1876.06 --> 1876.82]  What's the one
[1876.82 --> 1877.44]  that does drugs?
[1878.84 --> 1879.42]  EPA?
[1880.06 --> 1880.54]  No, that's
[1880.54 --> 1881.28]  environmental protection.
[1881.28 --> 1881.80]  What am I thinking?
[1881.86 --> 1882.22]  FDA.
[1882.52 --> 1882.92]  FDA.
[1883.20 --> 1884.18]  And the FDA
[1884.18 --> 1885.46]  is like massively
[1885.46 --> 1886.46]  overworked
[1886.46 --> 1886.94]  and they don't have
[1886.94 --> 1887.26]  enough time
[1887.26 --> 1887.94]  to look at everything
[1887.94 --> 1888.50]  and that's actually
[1888.50 --> 1889.86]  like a terrible situation
[1889.86 --> 1890.82]  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1891.02 --> 1891.66]  But we need
[1891.66 --> 1893.04]  like a version of that
[1893.04 --> 1894.94]  for driverless car tech.
[1895.96 --> 1896.78]  Some type of
[1896.78 --> 1897.62]  government oversight
[1897.62 --> 1898.62]  seems like a good idea.
[1899.06 --> 1899.50]  Everyone's
[1899.50 --> 1900.70]  hating on me.
[1901.04 --> 1901.90]  Because you said EPA?
[1902.04 --> 1902.34]  Yeah.
[1902.46 --> 1903.34]  They're like IRS!
[1905.32 --> 1905.76]  DEA!
[1906.60 --> 1907.54]  Thank you, everybody.
[1907.68 --> 1908.04]  Thank you, Twitch chat.
[1908.04 --> 1908.94]  Government acronym!
[1908.94 --> 1909.44]  Government...
[1909.44 --> 1912.76]  The GAP!
[1913.12 --> 1914.56]  Government acronym police!
[1916.26 --> 1917.48]  They're gonna take care of me.
[1917.48 --> 1917.84]  That's Twitch chat.
[1918.00 --> 1918.50]  Well, Twitch chat
[1918.50 --> 1919.68]  is the everything police.
[1919.94 --> 1920.26]  Yeah.
[1920.54 --> 1921.08]  So...
[1921.08 --> 1922.36]  Except the Twitch chat police.
[1922.46 --> 1923.36]  They're fine to let that
[1923.36 --> 1924.68]  just go to hell in a handbasket.
[1924.90 --> 1925.02]  Yeah.
[1925.58 --> 1927.36]  Speaking of going to hell
[1927.36 --> 1927.94]  in a handbasket...
[1929.24 --> 1930.08]  FreshBooks!
[1930.50 --> 1931.74]  If you feel like
[1931.74 --> 1932.48]  your business
[1932.48 --> 1933.56]  is going to hell
[1933.56 --> 1933.94]  in a handbasket
[1934.50 --> 1935.24]  because you just
[1935.24 --> 1936.34]  don't have time
[1936.34 --> 1937.24]  to...
[1937.24 --> 1937.88]  Can I help you?
[1938.06 --> 1938.96]  Well, I was gonna say
[1938.96 --> 1940.30]  or if you
[1940.30 --> 1941.40]  like wanna make
[1941.40 --> 1941.92]  your business
[1941.92 --> 1943.16]  around hell
[1943.16 --> 1943.92]  in a handbasket
[1943.92 --> 1944.80]  and you wanna like
[1944.80 --> 1946.60]  sell handbaskets
[1946.60 --> 1947.66]  for Halloween
[1947.66 --> 1948.34]  or something
[1948.34 --> 1949.40]  for like gifts.
[1949.90 --> 1950.40]  Say someone has
[1950.40 --> 1951.36]  a birthday on Halloween
[1951.36 --> 1952.08]  and you wanna give them
[1952.08 --> 1953.74]  a themed gift.
[1955.72 --> 1956.42]  Maybe you could...
[1956.42 --> 1957.24]  So one out of every
[1957.24 --> 1958.94]  365 people
[1958.94 --> 1959.96]  theoretically
[1959.96 --> 1960.82]  has a birthday
[1960.82 --> 1961.58]  on Halloween.
[1961.98 --> 1962.46]  Yeah.
[1962.52 --> 1963.24]  Which means
[1963.24 --> 1964.90]  that doing some
[1964.90 --> 1966.28]  quick calculator math here.
[1966.28 --> 1968.10]  7 billion
[1968.10 --> 1969.74]  okay
[1969.74 --> 1970.62]  divided by
[1970.62 --> 1971.50]  365.
[1972.58 --> 1973.44]  That gives you
[1973.44 --> 1973.92]  a TAM
[1973.92 --> 1974.92]  so a total addressable
[1974.92 --> 1975.22]  market
[1975.22 --> 1975.98]  of
[1975.98 --> 1980.08]  19,178,000 people.
[1980.28 --> 1980.50]  Yeah.
[1980.78 --> 1982.12]  So of which
[1982.12 --> 1983.72]  let's say
[1983.72 --> 1985.52]  one
[1985.52 --> 1987.50]  one
[1987.50 --> 1988.60]  20th
[1988.60 --> 1989.02]  of them
[1989.02 --> 1989.80]  or so
[1989.80 --> 1991.60]  are in the United States
[1991.60 --> 1992.24]  and Canada
[1992.24 --> 1994.04]  so divided by 20.
[1994.34 --> 1995.10]  Is that how that works?
[1995.10 --> 1996.68]  So that's a million people
[1996.68 --> 1997.28]  okay
[1997.28 --> 1998.06]  ish okay
[1998.06 --> 1998.82]  a million people
[1998.82 --> 1999.66]  in the US and Canada
[1999.66 --> 2000.28]  approximately
[2000.28 --> 2001.68]  have a birthday
[2001.68 --> 2003.12]  on October 31st
[2003.12 --> 2003.74]  and
[2003.74 --> 2005.26]  you could
[2005.26 --> 2005.96]  let's say you sell
[2005.96 --> 2006.40]  your gift back
[2006.40 --> 2007.28]  I'd say 1999
[2007.28 --> 2008.96]  29.99
[2008.96 --> 2009.98]  20 dollar bill
[2009.98 --> 2010.78]  yeah sounds good
[2010.78 --> 2011.42]  yeah okay
[2011.42 --> 2012.32]  so let's say a 20
[2012.32 --> 2012.50]  yeah
[2012.50 --> 2014.66]  okay so I am estimating
[2014.66 --> 2016.48]  that your market cap
[2016.48 --> 2017.56]  is
[2017.56 --> 2018.02]  wow
[2018.02 --> 2019.12]  19 billion dollars
[2019.12 --> 2019.68]  I mean
[2019.68 --> 2020.54]  liable business
[2020.54 --> 2021.48]  yeah
[2021.48 --> 2022.18]  liable business
[2022.18 --> 2023.08]  based on that math
[2023.08 --> 2024.42]  you should quit here today
[2024.42 --> 2024.98]  yeah
[2024.98 --> 2027.48]  hellandhandbasket.com
[2027.48 --> 2028.74]  I shouldn't even have to fire you
[2028.74 --> 2029.18]  is that a
[2029.18 --> 2029.64]  is that
[2029.64 --> 2030.62]  is that domain taken?
[2031.48 --> 2031.90]  hellandhand
[2031.90 --> 2033.02]  I'm pretty sure
[2033.02 --> 2034.10]  that domain is taken
[2034.10 --> 2034.76]  let's see
[2034.76 --> 2035.20]  and
[2035.20 --> 2036.12]  is there a reason
[2036.12 --> 2037.24]  we turned off all the lights
[2037.24 --> 2038.50]  that were illuminating us
[2038.50 --> 2038.82]  before?
[2039.00 --> 2039.94]  we sort of need those
[2039.94 --> 2041.64]  those are pretty
[2041.64 --> 2043.46]  those are pretty useful
[2043.46 --> 2045.28]  those lights
[2045.28 --> 2050.32]  um
[2050.32 --> 2052.76]  so uh
[2052.76 --> 2054.34]  hellandhandbasket
[2054.34 --> 2054.96]  uh
[2054.96 --> 2055.16]  yeah
[2055.16 --> 2055.68]  sure
[2055.68 --> 2056.96]  that's a little better than
[2056.96 --> 2057.64]  oh it's taken
[2057.64 --> 2058.14]  nothing
[2058.14 --> 2059.58]  which of course it's taken
[2059.58 --> 2060.76]  I thought I'd check
[2060.76 --> 2061.72]  okay
[2061.72 --> 2063.66]  hellandhandbasket.ca
[2063.66 --> 2064.40]  is not taken
[2064.40 --> 2066.28]  so if I make just a Canadian company
[2066.28 --> 2067.82]  then it's only 10 bucks
[2067.82 --> 2068.56]  you thought
[2068.56 --> 2070.68]  we don't pay you to think
[2070.68 --> 2071.44]  oh
[2071.44 --> 2073.02]  oh
[2073.02 --> 2073.98]  well it's because we don't pay him
[2073.98 --> 2075.20]  not because he doesn't think well
[2075.20 --> 2079.60]  anyway
[2079.60 --> 2080.74]  uh
[2080.74 --> 2081.72]  FreshBooks
[2081.72 --> 2083.74]  so FreshBooks
[2083.74 --> 2085.48]  allows you to take
[2085.48 --> 2087.74]  your small business idea
[2087.74 --> 2088.36]  good

[2089.42 --> 2092.00]  and manage your accounting
[2092.00 --> 2093.78]  in a more organized way
[2093.78 --> 2094.62]  so that
[2094.62 --> 2096.12]  the thing that holds back
[2096.12 --> 2096.96]  your business
[2096.96 --> 2098.60]  will be your idea
[2098.60 --> 2100.80]  not your accounting solution
[2100.80 --> 2103.58]  so whether you're running
[2103.58 --> 2104.48]  a dance studio
[2104.48 --> 2105.46]  out of your garage
[2105.46 --> 2106.44]  or doing small time
[2106.44 --> 2107.28]  PC repair
[2107.28 --> 2109.00]  or you know
[2109.00 --> 2110.36]  running a plumbing company
[2110.36 --> 2111.74]  or a painting company
[2111.74 --> 2113.12]  or whatever the case may be
[2113.12 --> 2114.44]  FreshBooks gives you
[2114.44 --> 2115.24]  a ton of flexibility
[2115.24 --> 2116.18]  that you otherwise
[2116.18 --> 2116.82]  wouldn't have
[2116.82 --> 2117.58]  it allows you to take
[2117.58 --> 2119.30]  deposits through the platform
[2119.30 --> 2120.94]  it allows you to log your hours

[2126.72 --> 2128.10]  and allows you to see
[2128.10 --> 2129.52]  when they've gotten them
[2129.52 --> 2130.64]  so there's no more
[2130.64 --> 2131.54]  guessing games
[2131.54 --> 2132.26]  oh hey
[2132.26 --> 2133.04]  have you paid that bill
[2133.04 --> 2133.34]  oh hey

[2134.02 --> 2134.52]  oh yeah
[2134.52 --> 2135.34]  can you send it again
[2135.34 --> 2136.58]  none of that
[2136.58 --> 2138.30]  and they have their own
[2138.30 --> 2139.34]  payment system
[2139.34 --> 2140.04]  as well
[2140.04 --> 2140.72]  so check it out

[2147.42 --> 2148.30]  no I'm trying to figure out
[2148.30 --> 2149.44]  why my base is so much
[2149.44 --> 2149.96]  higher than yours
[2149.96 --> 2150.80]  because it's a completely
[2150.80 --> 2151.34]  different chair
[2151.34 --> 2151.94]  ah okay
[2151.94 --> 2152.90]  cool
[2152.90 --> 2154.14]  it's a bigger chair
[2154.14 --> 2154.88]  for bigger blokes
[2154.88 --> 2158.88]  that makes sense
[2158.88 --> 2159.62]  yep
[2159.62 --> 2161.54]  I liked my basket idea

[2166.36 --> 2166.98]  okay good
[2166.98 --> 2168.68]  I was joking about
[2168.68 --> 2169.80]  liking my basket idea
[2169.80 --> 2170.80]  it's a horrible idea
[2170.80 --> 2171.98]  doing themed
[2171.98 --> 2173.38]  holiday baskets
[2173.38 --> 2173.96]  okay
[2173.96 --> 2174.78]  in entirety
[2174.78 --> 2176.04]  could be a good idea
[2176.04 --> 2177.00]  doing like
[2177.00 --> 2177.66]  someone's got
[2177.66 --> 2179.10]  just hell based ones
[2179.10 --> 2181.22]  is a horrible idea

[2186.28 --> 2187.18]  whenever that happens
[2187.18 --> 2187.92]  and that's it
[2187.92 --> 2189.10]  other than that
[2189.10 --> 2189.74]  you're screwed
[2189.74 --> 2190.52]  yeah and based on
[2190.52 --> 2191.04]  how often
[2191.04 --> 2191.68]  Blizzard launches
[2191.68 --> 2192.76]  a Diablo title
[2192.76 --> 2194.66]  it's gonna be
[2194.66 --> 2195.52]  a feast or famine
[2195.52 --> 2196.38]  type of business
[2196.38 --> 2199.42]  you're doing pretty bad

[2214.64 --> 2215.48]  you can find it
[2215.48 --> 2217.08]  okay I don't really
[2217.08 --> 2217.58]  believe in you
[2217.58 --> 2218.08]  wow

[2223.74 --> 2224.26]  you know what's
[2224.26 --> 2224.72]  really funny
[2224.72 --> 2225.72]  is I thought
[2225.72 --> 2227.22]  a little while ago
[2227.22 --> 2228.32]  we were looking for
[2228.32 --> 2229.80]  domains for our
[2229.80 --> 2231.04]  online video streaming
[2231.04 --> 2232.04]  platform that we're
[2232.04 --> 2232.82]  sort of building now
[2232.82 --> 2233.36]  because
[2233.36 --> 2235.14]  YOLO
[2235.14 --> 2236.58]  rip vessel I guess
[2236.58 --> 2238.02]  oh you have
[2238.02 --> 2238.48]  your vessel
[2238.48 --> 2238.96]  toque
[2238.96 --> 2239.44]  yeah
[2239.44 --> 2240.60]  nice
[2240.60 --> 2241.54]  I couldn't find
[2241.54 --> 2242.32]  my orange one
[2242.32 --> 2243.02]  you should have
[2243.02 --> 2243.60]  told me to bring
[2243.60 --> 2243.92]  one
[2243.92 --> 2244.50]  to bring mine
[2244.50 --> 2245.42]  I have mine too
[2245.42 --> 2246.04]  oh really
[2246.04 --> 2247.00]  yeah I posted
[2247.00 --> 2248.32]  a picture of it
[2248.32 --> 2249.08]  in the chat
[2249.08 --> 2249.42]  yeah
[2249.42 --> 2250.22]  I still have my
[2250.22 --> 2250.68]  vessel shirt
[2250.68 --> 2251.18]  and my vessel
[2251.18 --> 2251.52]  toque
[2251.52 --> 2252.04]  because they're
[2252.04 --> 2252.68]  so much cooler
[2252.68 --> 2252.92]  now
[2252.92 --> 2253.84]  I know right
[2253.84 --> 2254.88]  they're so much
[2254.88 --> 2255.06]  cooler
[2255.06 --> 2255.86]  it's such a hipster
[2255.86 --> 2256.54]  way of thinking
[2256.54 --> 2256.86]  yeah
[2256.86 --> 2258.34]  but it is so true
[2258.34 --> 2258.86]  it is
[2258.86 --> 2259.72]  yeah
[2259.72 --> 2261.10]  anyway
[2261.10 --> 2261.86]  what were we
[2261.86 --> 2262.42]  talking about
[2262.42 --> 2263.24]  right
[2263.24 --> 2263.88]  because like
[2263.88 --> 2264.26]  right
[2264.26 --> 2264.74]  because we have
[2264.74 --> 2265.46]  to build a
[2265.46 --> 2266.90]  we have to build
[2266.90 --> 2267.46]  a video streaming
[2267.46 --> 2268.16]  platform now
[2268.16 --> 2268.88]  so we were
[2268.88 --> 2269.56]  looking at domains
[2269.56 --> 2270.18]  and I thought
[2270.18 --> 2270.90]  GoDaddy was
[2270.90 --> 2271.56]  throttling us
[2271.56 --> 2272.02]  for like
[2272.02 --> 2273.02]  searching too
[2273.02 --> 2273.76]  many too quickly
[2273.76 --> 2274.30]  like I thought
[2274.30 --> 2274.62]  they thought
[2274.62 --> 2275.18]  we were a bot
[2275.18 --> 2275.66]  or something
[2275.66 --> 2276.84]  no way
[2276.84 --> 2277.78]  oh my god

[2296.02 --> 2296.52]  through with it
[2296.52 --> 2297.00]  because he
[2297.00 --> 2297.60]  obviously can't
[2297.60 --> 2298.22]  show the like
[2298.22 --> 2298.90]  checkout process
[2298.90 --> 2299.34]  because it would
[2299.34 --> 2299.96]  show all the
[2299.96 --> 2300.82]  things that are
[2300.82 --> 2301.14]  important
[2301.14 --> 2301.98]  oh I am
[2301.98 --> 2302.56]  I am
[2302.56 --> 2303.66]  I am buying
[2303.66 --> 2304.98]  hellbaskets.com
[2304.98 --> 2306.54]  so hard right
[2306.54 --> 2307.44]  now
[2307.44 --> 2309.72]  someone's going to
[2309.72 --> 2310.38]  maybe try to
[2310.38 --> 2310.98]  snipe it before
[2310.98 --> 2311.76]  they can try and
[2311.76 --> 2313.04]  snipe but I am
[2313.04 --> 2314.18]  I am armed
[2314.18 --> 2314.86]  he's on it right
[2314.86 --> 2315.62]  I am armed
[2315.62 --> 2316.52]  with uh
[2316.52 --> 2318.20]  oh oh no
[2318.20 --> 2319.32]  my two factor
[2319.32 --> 2320.92]  my two factor
[2320.92 --> 2321.38]  is going to
[2321.38 --> 2322.40]  slow me down
[2322.40 --> 2323.98]  the slowest
[2323.98 --> 2324.52]  version of
[2324.52 --> 2324.92]  two factor
[2324.92 --> 2325.54]  it's going to
[2325.54 --> 2326.24]  slow me down
[2326.24 --> 2326.80]  yeah we can't
[2326.80 --> 2327.38]  talk about it
[2327.38 --> 2328.14]  but our two factor
[2328.14 --> 2328.76]  is like
[2328.76 --> 2329.66]  dank AF
[2329.66 --> 2331.10]  it's secure
[2331.10 --> 2331.90]  yeah
[2331.90 --> 2333.14]  it's defs
[2333.14 --> 2333.74]  secure
[2333.74 --> 2335.94]  it's definitely
[2335.94 --> 2336.42]  that
[2336.42 --> 2337.82]  but it's uh
[2337.82 --> 2338.90]  oh bloody hell
[2338.90 --> 2339.56]  I don't I don't
[2339.56 --> 2339.92]  remember
[2339.92 --> 2340.34]  can you
[2340.34 --> 2341.08]  I think that's
[2341.08 --> 2341.72]  the wrong one
[2341.72 --> 2342.10]  isn't it
[2342.10 --> 2342.70]  yeah no no
[2342.70 --> 2343.18]  this is the
[2343.18 --> 2343.62]  right one
[2343.62 --> 2343.98]  for that
[2343.98 --> 2344.36]  account
[2344.36 --> 2344.80]  okay
[2344.80 --> 2345.82]  but it's the
[2345.82 --> 2346.54]  do you remember
[2346.54 --> 2346.82]  it
[2346.82 --> 2347.54]  I think so
[2347.54 --> 2347.92]  oops
[2347.92 --> 2348.34]  no
[2348.34 --> 2348.70]  no
[2348.70 --> 2349.20]  it's just
[2349.20 --> 2350.00]  very laggy
[2350.00 --> 2350.88]  oh there's
[2350.88 --> 2351.44]  still a character
[2351.44 --> 2353.18]  in uh
[2353.18 --> 2353.94]  what did you do
[2353.94 --> 2354.50]  oh I don't even
[2354.50 --> 2354.82]  know what you

[2356.62 --> 2357.44]  factoring this
[2357.44 --> 2358.48]  this biatch
[2358.48 --> 2360.14]  your two step
[2360.14 --> 2360.52]  coat
[2360.52 --> 2361.66]  two factor
[2361.66 --> 2362.62]  is such a
[2362.62 --> 2363.56]  pain in the
[2363.56 --> 2364.18]  patoot
[2364.18 --> 2365.50]  a good
[2365.50 --> 2366.50]  worth it
[2366.50 --> 2367.30]  valuable
[2367.30 --> 2368.08]  pain in the
[2368.08 --> 2368.40]  patoot
[2368.40 --> 2369.58]  but it is
[2369.58 --> 2370.78]  still technically
[2370.78 --> 2371.32]  a pain in the
[2371.32 --> 2371.56]  patoot

[2695.62 --> 2696.42]  okay Ryzen
[2696.42 --> 2696.80]  yeah
[2696.80 --> 2698.24]  video this is from
[2698.24 --> 2699.54]  digitaltrends.com
[2699.54 --> 2700.30]  oh wait what
[2700.30 --> 2700.96]  oh
[2700.96 --> 2702.34]  so it shows kind of a
[2702.34 --> 2704.14]  oh yep sorry
[2704.14 --> 2706.48]  it shows kind of a code name
[2706.48 --> 2708.20]  uh when you look at it in
[2708.20 --> 2709.32]  like the benchmark
[2709.32 --> 2710.20]  it says AMD
[2710.20 --> 2714.94]  2D3151A2M88E
[2714.94 --> 2715.66]  but like
[2715.66 --> 2717.16]  and that's not here anywhere
[2717.16 --> 2718.46]  if it's performing that well
[2718.46 --> 2719.36]  then whatever
[2719.36 --> 2720.04]  no worries
[2720.04 --> 2722.04]  apparently it has
[2722.04 --> 2723.98]  168.7%
[2723.98 --> 2725.30]  uh performance
[2725.30 --> 2727.12]  of the provided
[2727.12 --> 2728.24]  core i5
[2728.24 --> 2729.56]  6600k
[2729.56 --> 2730.30]  ah
[2730.30 --> 2731.06]  so
[2731.06 --> 2732.68]  that would put it
[2732.68 --> 2733.92]  like well above
[2733.92 --> 2735.82]  a 6700k
[2735.82 --> 2736.86]  apparently only the
[2736.86 --> 2738.22]  6900k is shown
[2738.22 --> 2738.90]  performing out
[2738.90 --> 2739.56]  uh
[2739.56 --> 2740.56]  outperforming the Ryzen
[2740.56 --> 2740.76]  chip
[2740.76 --> 2742.52]  so the 6900k
[2742.52 --> 2743.46]  is uh
[2743.46 --> 2744.24]  an 8 core
[2744.24 --> 2745.30]  no 6 core
[2745.30 --> 2746.80]  can't remember
[2746.80 --> 2747.96]  i think it's 8
[2747.96 --> 2749.02]  i'm just
[2749.02 --> 2749.48]  i think it's 8
[2749.48 --> 2751.06]  i'm just terrible at all this stuff
[2751.06 --> 2751.48]  pretty sure
[2751.48 --> 2752.44]  see i'm pretty sure it's an 8 core
[2752.44 --> 2752.72]  yeah
[2752.72 --> 2753.52]  it's an 8 core right
[2753.52 --> 2754.20]  yeah i think so
[2754.20 --> 2754.92]  like i'm
[2754.92 --> 2756.10]  i'm rather certain
[2756.10 --> 2756.42]  that it's 8 core
[2756.42 --> 2756.76]  okay good
[2756.76 --> 2757.52]  i was right the first time
[2757.52 --> 2761.04]  so that's a 3.2 to 3.7 boost
[2761.04 --> 2763.70]  with a max boost of 4 gigahertz
[2763.70 --> 2766.04]  140 watt TDP 8 core
[2766.04 --> 2766.98]  from intel
[2766.98 --> 2768.04]  that uh
[2768.04 --> 2769.70]  AMD Ryzen
[2769.70 --> 2772.14]  is not able to beat
[2772.14 --> 2773.16]  mind you
[2773.16 --> 2774.80]  that's a thousand dollar chip
[2774.80 --> 2775.92]  so if AMD were to come in
[2775.92 --> 2777.32]  even at like 599
[2777.32 --> 2779.10]  which would get them
[2779.10 --> 2779.96]  a pretty good return
[2779.96 --> 2780.78]  on their investment
[2780.78 --> 2781.44]  in the silicon
[2781.44 --> 2782.56]  um
[2782.56 --> 2784.52]  we could be looking at
[2784.52 --> 2786.36]  an actual race
[2786.36 --> 2787.02]  and that's
[2787.02 --> 2787.56]  and that's like
[2787.56 --> 2788.40]  for the first time
[2788.40 --> 2789.34]  in a very long time
[2789.34 --> 2789.86]  a big
[2789.86 --> 2791.92]  TDP benefit too
[2791.92 --> 2793.08]  which is not something
[2793.08 --> 2793.92]  that uh
[2793.92 --> 2795.94]  AMD usually gets
[2795.94 --> 2796.84]  over intel
[2796.84 --> 2797.72]  well see i hate it
[2797.72 --> 2798.62]  when people do this
[2798.62 --> 2800.02]  i hate generalizations
[2800.02 --> 2801.42]  you can't say
[2801.42 --> 2802.58]  AMD usually
[2802.58 --> 2804.60]  because you have to
[2804.60 --> 2806.44]  evaluate product by product
[2806.44 --> 2808.10]  because there have been
[2808.10 --> 2809.34]  times in the past
[2809.34 --> 2811.02]  when AMD's
[2811.02 --> 2811.48]  thermal
[2811.48 --> 2811.84]  yeah
[2811.84 --> 2813.14]  but if it's more often
[2813.14 --> 2814.42]  than usually does apply properly
[2814.42 --> 2814.76]  okay
[2814.76 --> 2815.70]  but that's more like
[2815.70 --> 2817.52]  historically than usually
[2817.52 --> 2821.48]  i think they both work
[2821.48 --> 2823.36]  so historically
[2823.36 --> 2826.22]  AMD has not been known
[2826.22 --> 2827.88]  for their superior performance
[2827.88 --> 2828.54]  per watt
[2828.54 --> 2829.00]  yeah
[2829.00 --> 2829.98]  versus intel
[2829.98 --> 2830.26]  yeah
[2830.26 --> 2831.34]  okay
[2831.34 --> 2833.04]  but
[2833.04 --> 2835.16]  okay
[2835.16 --> 2836.08]  so how do i explain
[2836.08 --> 2837.56]  usually versus historically
[2837.56 --> 2838.44]  i'm sure twitch chat
[2838.44 --> 2839.08]  doesn't care
[2839.08 --> 2839.72]  um
[2839.72 --> 2840.74]  but you know what
[2840.74 --> 2841.82]  okay fine
[2841.82 --> 2842.36]  fine
[2842.36 --> 2843.66]  the point is
[2843.66 --> 2845.08]  generalizations are bad
[2845.08 --> 2846.14]  you have to look at
[2846.14 --> 2846.84]  every product
[2846.84 --> 2848.96]  as an individual product
[2848.96 --> 2850.12]  in the tech space
[2850.12 --> 2851.50]  because it is not as simple
[2851.50 --> 2852.00]  as like
[2852.00 --> 2853.98]  Nvidia cards run hot
[2853.98 --> 2855.92]  AMD drivers are bad
[2855.92 --> 2858.40]  Intel chips are overpriced
[2858.40 --> 2859.10]  but i didn't say that
[2859.10 --> 2859.52]  i know
[2859.52 --> 2860.90]  but
[2860.90 --> 2862.20]  this is a word of warning
[2862.20 --> 2862.86]  to everybody
[2862.86 --> 2864.76]  these kinds of generalizations
[2864.76 --> 2866.00]  are what lead to fanboyism
[2866.00 --> 2866.76]  because
[2866.76 --> 2867.96]  at some point
[2867.96 --> 2868.98]  in history
[2868.98 --> 2870.44]  every single one of those
[2870.44 --> 2871.34]  statements i have made
[2871.34 --> 2871.92]  has been reversed
[2871.92 --> 2872.60]  has been true
[2872.60 --> 2873.86]  or has been not true
[2873.86 --> 2875.82]  every single one of them
[2875.82 --> 2879.12]  i did put a lot of care
[2879.12 --> 2879.78]  onto the word usually
[2879.78 --> 2880.64]  one other thing
[2880.64 --> 2881.54]  do we look better today
[2881.54 --> 2882.26]  is that a new lens
[2882.26 --> 2884.18]  no it's just the lighting
[2884.18 --> 2885.12]  is borked
[2885.12 --> 2885.58]  do you notice
[2885.58 --> 2886.22]  there's no light
[2886.22 --> 2886.78]  in front of us
[2886.78 --> 2887.96]  but we look better
[2887.96 --> 2888.58]  depth of field
[2888.58 --> 2889.40]  than we normally do
[2889.40 --> 2889.78]  do we not
[2889.78 --> 2890.80]  you look sharper
[2890.80 --> 2891.68]  i think it's just the
[2891.68 --> 2892.38]  the fact that there's
[2892.38 --> 2893.24]  lighting in the background
[2893.24 --> 2894.04]  oh maybe
[2894.04 --> 2894.70]  so it comes off the back
[2894.70 --> 2895.60]  of our heads like this
[2895.60 --> 2896.24]  maybe
[2896.24 --> 2897.02]  yeah it's like
[2897.02 --> 2898.52]  yeah no the lighting
[2898.52 --> 2898.92]  is broken
[2898.92 --> 2899.32]  yeah
[2899.32 --> 2900.80]  anyway
[2900.80 --> 2901.90]  so so
[2901.90 --> 2903.62]  the power consumption tests
[2903.62 --> 2904.26]  show this chip
[2904.26 --> 2905.84]  pulling 93 watts
[2905.84 --> 2906.82]  an AMD claimed
[2906.82 --> 2907.94]  a 95 watt TDP
[2907.94 --> 2908.72]  at their launch event
[2908.72 --> 2909.66]  which are
[2909.66 --> 2910.38]  which would be
[2910.38 --> 2911.20]  very competitive
[2911.20 --> 2913.28]  with the 140 watt rated
[2913.28 --> 2913.74]  TDP
[2913.74 --> 2915.32]  of Intel's chip
[2915.32 --> 2916.34]  with that said
[2916.34 --> 2917.50]  Intel's TDPs
[2917.50 --> 2918.54]  are a big load
[2918.54 --> 2919.46]  of bollocks
[2919.46 --> 2920.30]  because
[2920.30 --> 2921.94]  all they do
[2921.94 --> 2922.84]  is say
[2922.84 --> 2923.66]  okay well
[2923.66 --> 2924.42]  this is a thermal
[2924.42 --> 2925.50]  design envelope
[2925.50 --> 2927.32]  like that is the maximum
[2927.32 --> 2928.56]  for this entire
[2928.56 --> 2929.74]  range of CPUs
[2929.74 --> 2930.46]  that go all the way
[2930.46 --> 2930.86]  from
[2930.86 --> 2931.64]  like
[2931.64 --> 2932.60]  six cores
[2932.60 --> 2934.42]  to ten
[2934.42 --> 2935.54]  and
[2935.54 --> 2937.04]  they're all 140 watt
[2937.04 --> 2937.70]  don't worry about it
[2937.70 --> 2939.00]  so we'll see
[2939.00 --> 2940.24]  thermals
[2940.24 --> 2940.76]  and power
[2940.76 --> 2941.68]  when we test it
[2941.68 --> 2941.96]  in-house
[2941.96 --> 2942.24]  yeah
[2942.24 --> 2944.24]  again you have to
[2944.24 --> 2945.36]  evaluate chip by chip
[2945.36 --> 2945.98]  in those cases
[2945.98 --> 2946.90]  not just read off
[2946.90 --> 2947.80]  of Intel spec sheet
[2947.80 --> 2948.50]  because everything
[2948.50 --> 2950.50]  from the 6800k
[2950.50 --> 2952.46]  to the 6950x
[2952.46 --> 2954.02]  has 140 watt TDP
[2954.02 --> 2955.40]  but
[2955.40 --> 2956.14]  it's still exciting
[2956.14 --> 2957.30]  and
[2957.30 --> 2958.08]  this is really
[2958.08 --> 2958.76]  really exciting
[2958.76 --> 2959.74]  and
[2959.74 --> 2960.72]  so this was actually
[2960.72 --> 2961.76]  leaked by a Reddit
[2961.76 --> 2962.68]  user from a French
[2962.68 --> 2963.48]  hardware magazine
[2963.48 --> 2964.74]  meaning that
[2964.74 --> 2965.64]  maybe
[2965.64 --> 2966.68]  it's not just
[2966.68 --> 2967.62]  AMD numbers
[2967.62 --> 2968.84]  maybe these are
[2968.84 --> 2969.62]  third party numbers
[2969.62 --> 2970.62]  that are actually being run
[2970.62 --> 2971.42]  and maybe there's
[2971.42 --> 2972.14]  something to this
[2972.14 --> 2972.48]  which
[2972.48 --> 2973.26]  hopefully
[2973.26 --> 2974.08]  and it
[2974.08 --> 2974.88]  it says it in here
[2974.88 --> 2975.30]  but hopefully
[2975.30 --> 2976.18]  it was actually true
[2976.18 --> 2978.22]  the power consumption test
[2978.22 --> 2978.94]  showed the chip
[2978.94 --> 2979.92]  itself only pulling
[2979.92 --> 2980.82]  93 watts
[2980.82 --> 2983.20]  which is not that bad
[2983.20 --> 2984.88]  speaking of
[2984.88 --> 2985.96]  not that bad
[2985.96 --> 2987.00]  if you believe
[2987.00 --> 2987.82]  that fake news
[2987.82 --> 2988.52]  is a problem
[2988.52 --> 2989.18]  which
[2989.18 --> 2991.84]  I would hope
[2991.84 --> 2993.16]  that most people
[2993.16 --> 2994.48]  would agree on
[2994.48 --> 2995.76]  that it's a problem
[2995.76 --> 2996.80]  even if we can't
[2996.80 --> 2998.18]  necessarily agree on
[2998.18 --> 2998.88]  what the correct
[2998.88 --> 2999.66]  solution is
[2999.66 --> 3000.90]  because I can see
[3000.90 --> 3001.54]  a lot of people
[3001.54 --> 3002.18]  going well who's
[3002.18 --> 3003.06]  the fake news police
[3003.06 --> 3003.92]  who decides news
[3003.92 --> 3004.40]  is fake
[3004.40 --> 3005.44]  what's the difference
[3005.44 --> 3006.14]  between fake
[3006.14 --> 3006.86]  and satire
[3006.86 --> 3008.36]  that one's confusing
[3008.36 --> 3008.78]  because like
[3008.78 --> 3009.62]  what happens to
[3009.62 --> 3010.34]  the onion
[3010.34 --> 3011.18]  can an opinion
[3011.18 --> 3011.96]  be false
[3011.96 --> 3015.02]  like you know
[3015.02 --> 3015.72]  if all of a sudden
[3015.72 --> 3016.38]  you just have to
[3016.38 --> 3017.06]  start going
[3017.06 --> 3017.90]  you know
[3017.90 --> 3019.10]  let's put together
[3019.10 --> 3020.26]  an opinion based
[3020.26 --> 3020.70]  you know
[3020.70 --> 3021.52]  news story
[3021.52 --> 3022.74]  in my opinion
[3022.74 --> 3023.60]  you know
[3023.60 --> 3024.82]  Bernie Sanders
[3024.82 --> 3026.30]  slept with a donkey
[3026.30 --> 3027.74]  it's like
[3027.74 --> 3028.64]  is that news
[3028.64 --> 3029.54]  if it's an opinion
[3029.54 --> 3031.08]  would that be allowed
[3031.08 --> 3031.66]  to be posted
[3031.66 --> 3032.68]  as news
[3032.68 --> 3033.16]  what if it was
[3033.16 --> 3033.96]  on a news site
[3033.96 --> 3035.18]  I don't think
[3035.18 --> 3035.72]  that's how you'd be
[3035.72 --> 3036.58]  able to say it
[3036.58 --> 3037.40]  well
[3037.40 --> 3039.18]  but the point is
[3039.18 --> 3039.80]  like there's a very
[3039.80 --> 3041.00]  we can all agree
[3041.00 --> 3042.40]  that the lines
[3042.40 --> 3043.04]  in the sand
[3043.04 --> 3043.86]  are not very clear
[3043.86 --> 3044.64]  is believing something
[3044.64 --> 3045.22]  and having an opinion
[3045.22 --> 3046.04]  something different
[3046.04 --> 3046.62]  because I think
[3046.62 --> 3047.16]  you'd have to say
[3047.16 --> 3048.18]  I believe that he did
[3048.18 --> 3048.80]  not I have
[3048.80 --> 3049.56]  in my opinion
[3049.56 --> 3049.92]  he did
[3049.92 --> 3051.84]  I think
[3051.84 --> 3052.72]  I think there's
[3052.72 --> 3053.48]  sort of two sides
[3053.48 --> 3054.60]  of a very similar coin
[3054.60 --> 3057.52]  so in much the same way
[3057.52 --> 3058.36]  that you would say
[3058.36 --> 3059.00]  allegedly
[3059.00 --> 3060.58]  if S-horse
[3060.58 --> 3061.66]  hasn't been confirmed
[3061.66 --> 3061.96]  yeah
[3061.96 --> 3063.88]  so if everything
[3063.88 --> 3064.54]  was allegedly
[3064.54 --> 3065.14]  you know
[3065.14 --> 3066.34]  allegedly this happened
[3066.34 --> 3067.68]  allegedly.com
[3067.68 --> 3068.90]  yeah who'd you hear it from
[3068.90 --> 3069.68]  like my neighbor
[3069.68 --> 3070.64]  news the fastest
[3070.64 --> 3071.60]  my neighbor who says
[3071.60 --> 3072.78]  whatever I tell him to say
[3072.78 --> 3073.24]  allegedly
[3073.24 --> 3075.02]  anyway
[3075.02 --> 3075.40]  okay
[3075.40 --> 3076.48]  so we can't
[3076.48 --> 3077.90]  it's not simple
[3077.90 --> 3079.84]  how to get rid of fake news
[3079.84 --> 3080.54]  but I hope
[3080.54 --> 3081.78]  we can all agree
[3081.78 --> 3084.26]  that non-factual news
[3084.26 --> 3085.44]  designed to
[3085.44 --> 3086.84]  mislead people
[3086.84 --> 3087.84]  is a problem
[3087.84 --> 3089.08]  that should be addressed
[3089.08 --> 3091.36]  so Germany's solution
[3091.36 --> 3092.42]  is apparently
[3092.42 --> 3093.52]  they're considering this
[3093.52 --> 3094.68]  just to find the trash
[3094.68 --> 3095.20]  out of them
[3095.20 --> 3095.98]  is to
[3095.98 --> 3097.52]  find Facebook
[3097.52 --> 3099.68]  half a million dollars
[3099.68 --> 3101.52]  per fake news item
[3101.52 --> 3102.82]  per day
[3102.82 --> 3103.94]  that they do not
[3103.94 --> 3104.48]  pull it down
[3104.48 --> 3105.20]  from the site
[3105.20 --> 3106.42]  per day
[3106.42 --> 3107.74]  that's awesome
[3107.74 --> 3109.82]  that's a lot of money
[3109.82 --> 3110.28]  yeah
[3110.28 --> 3111.46]  that like doesn't make sense
[3111.46 --> 3112.42]  Facebook can afford it
[3112.42 --> 3114.44]  um
[3114.44 --> 3115.52]  yes
[3115.52 --> 3115.82]  I
[3115.82 --> 3116.46]  yes soon
[3116.46 --> 3117.50]  um
[3117.50 --> 3118.52]  yeah
[3118.52 --> 3118.98]  so
[3118.98 --> 3119.72]  good hand gestures
[3119.72 --> 3120.34]  I like this
[3120.34 --> 3121.24]  do we have any more
[3121.24 --> 3122.56]  any more details about this
[3122.56 --> 3123.48]  so the German government
[3123.48 --> 3124.44]  will consider the bill
[3124.44 --> 3125.00]  next year
[3125.00 --> 3126.06]  and it would allow
[3126.06 --> 3126.92]  both official
[3126.92 --> 3128.06]  and private
[3128.06 --> 3129.06]  complainants
[3129.06 --> 3130.02]  to flag content
[3130.02 --> 3130.72]  that is considered
[3130.72 --> 3132.06]  fake news
[3132.06 --> 3133.32]  that's gonna be a disaster
[3133.32 --> 3134.58]  the law would also
[3134.58 --> 3135.80]  force social networks
[3135.80 --> 3136.44]  to create
[3136.44 --> 3137.94]  in-country offices
[3137.94 --> 3139.94]  focused on responding
[3139.94 --> 3141.38]  to takedown demands
[3141.38 --> 3142.96]  wow
[3142.96 --> 3144.32]  lawmakers believe
[3144.32 --> 3145.88]  they believe
[3145.88 --> 3149.18]  in their opinion
[3149.18 --> 3150.06]  uh
[3150.06 --> 3150.68]  this bill
[3150.68 --> 3151.52]  will help tackle
[3151.52 --> 3152.36]  the possibility
[3152.36 --> 3153.76]  of Russia
[3153.76 --> 3154.60]  meddling in
[3154.60 --> 3155.70]  parliamentary elections
[3155.70 --> 3157.08]  scheduled for next year
[3157.08 --> 3158.60]  this follows
[3158.60 --> 3159.30]  allegations
[3159.30 --> 3160.10]  that the Kremlin
[3160.10 --> 3161.32]  was behind the hacking
[3161.32 --> 3162.06]  of the Democratic
[3162.06 --> 3163.06]  National Committee
[3163.06 --> 3164.16]  that led to the leak
[3164.16 --> 3165.08]  of thousands of emails
[3165.08 --> 3165.80]  by key aides
[3165.80 --> 3166.58]  to Hillary Clinton
[3166.58 --> 3168.60]  fascinating
[3168.60 --> 3173.88]  I guess moving on
[3173.88 --> 3175.34]  yeah I guess so
[3175.34 --> 3176.00]  thermal take
[3176.00 --> 3176.78]  made an RGB
[3176.78 --> 3177.66]  power supply
[3177.66 --> 3178.54]  what is this new
[3178.54 --> 3180.66]  I don't actually think so
[3180.66 --> 3181.62]  but I don't really care
[3181.62 --> 3182.74]  it's adorable
[3182.74 --> 3183.70]  there you go
[3183.70 --> 3185.08]  there's the article
[3185.08 --> 3186.02]  isn't this not new at all
[3186.02 --> 3187.12]  on uh
[3187.12 --> 3188.20]  like maybe this particular
[3188.20 --> 3189.50]  power supply is new
[3189.50 --> 3190.88]  but like
[3190.88 --> 3193.84]  it's fully modular
[3193.84 --> 3196.02]  low ripple noise
[3196.02 --> 3197.42]  smart zero fan
[3197.42 --> 3199.36]  100% Japanese capacitors
[3199.36 --> 3200.18]  and a 10 year warranty
[3200.18 --> 3201.56]  power supplies
[3201.56 --> 3202.58]  with 10 year warranties
[3202.58 --> 3202.78]  man
[3202.78 --> 3203.60]  like can you imagine
[3203.60 --> 3204.56]  using a power supply
[3204.56 --> 3205.36]  today that you bought
[3205.36 --> 3206.26]  in 2006
[3206.26 --> 3208.20]  yeah totally
[3208.20 --> 3208.74]  I do
[3208.74 --> 3210.50]  you do
[3210.50 --> 3210.90]  yeah
[3210.90 --> 3212.18]  2006
[3212.18 --> 3213.54]  that was a long
[3213.54 --> 3214.14]  time ago dude
[3214.14 --> 3214.58]  I think it was about
[3214.58 --> 3215.06]  2006
[3215.06 --> 3215.74]  yeah it's still running
[3215.74 --> 3218.74]  huh
[3218.74 --> 3219.14]  alright
[3219.14 --> 3219.72]  yeah
[3219.72 --> 3222.40]  you know the mineral rig
[3222.40 --> 3224.14]  I still use
[3224.14 --> 3225.04]  all those components
[3225.04 --> 3228.06]  Emma played
[3228.06 --> 3229.04]  Stardew Valley on them
[3229.04 --> 3230.22]  literally last night
[3230.22 --> 3231.50]  that's about 2006
[3231.50 --> 3232.36]  yeah that's in like
[3232.36 --> 3233.76]  an HX 520 or something
[3233.76 --> 3234.54]  like that if I recall
[3234.54 --> 3234.96]  correctly
[3234.96 --> 3236.10]  still works
[3236.10 --> 3237.00]  huh
[3237.00 --> 3238.30]  I don't know if I would
[3238.30 --> 3239.14]  use all of them
[3239.14 --> 3239.74]  for that long
[3239.74 --> 3240.22]  right
[3240.22 --> 3241.06]  but that power supply
[3241.06 --> 3241.68]  seems to have been
[3241.68 --> 3242.38]  rather stable
[3242.38 --> 3243.06]  yeah that's the HX
[3243.06 --> 3243.70]  it was a good power supply
[3243.70 --> 3244.04]  yeah
[3244.04 --> 3246.30]  I wouldn't
[3246.30 --> 3246.70]  I wouldn't
[3246.70 --> 3247.38]  yeah there's a lot
[3247.38 --> 3247.86]  of power supplies
[3247.86 --> 3248.60]  to be clear
[3248.60 --> 3249.22]  that I wouldn't use
[3249.22 --> 3250.00]  for that long
[3250.00 --> 3250.52]  alright
[3250.52 --> 3251.84]  the original article here
[3251.84 --> 3252.96]  is on the verge
[3252.96 --> 3253.76]  and it's exciting
[3253.76 --> 3254.76]  what's the
[3254.76 --> 3258.88]  what's Antec 1000 watt HX
[3258.88 --> 3260.00]  no
[3260.00 --> 3260.84]  wait what
[3260.84 --> 3261.56]  no Antec
[3261.56 --> 3262.74]  what is it
[3262.74 --> 3263.28]  HP
[3263.28 --> 3263.66]  some
[3263.66 --> 3264.76]  uh
[3264.76 --> 3265.74]  oh
[3265.74 --> 3266.42]  high current
[3266.42 --> 3267.10]  HCP
[3267.10 --> 3267.58]  yeah
[3267.58 --> 3267.88]  yeah
[3267.88 --> 3268.72]  that one
[3268.72 --> 3270.24]  the 1200 watt
[3270.24 --> 3270.50]  yeah
[3270.50 --> 3271.28]  is still working
[3271.28 --> 3271.76]  in my system
[3271.76 --> 3273.90]  I thought it died
[3273.90 --> 3274.60]  it was something else
[3274.60 --> 3275.20]  that's not as old
[3275.20 --> 3276.58]  that's like 5 years old
[3276.58 --> 3277.72]  whereas your HX
[3277.72 --> 3278.12]  is like
[3278.12 --> 3279.22]  almost 10 years old
[3279.22 --> 3279.46]  yeah
[3279.46 --> 3279.78]  yeah
[3279.78 --> 3282.16]  Twitter wants to make
[3282.16 --> 3283.32]  tweets editable
[3283.32 --> 3285.52]  but it's complicated
[3285.52 --> 3286.44]  why
[3286.44 --> 3288.38]  why is it complicated
[3288.38 --> 3289.42]  let's find out why
[3289.42 --> 3290.10]  it's complicated
[3290.10 --> 3291.60]  um
[3291.60 --> 3293.04]  so CEO Jack Dorsey
[3293.04 --> 3294.32]  is polling Twitter users
[3294.32 --> 3295.30]  on what features
[3295.30 --> 3295.98]  they'd like to see
[3295.98 --> 3296.62]  from the company
[3296.62 --> 3297.78]  in 2017
[3297.78 --> 3300.00]  he believes
[3300.00 --> 3300.84]  a form of edit
[3300.84 --> 3301.38]  is needed
[3301.38 --> 3302.68]  but not
[3302.68 --> 3304.10]  for everyone
[3304.10 --> 3305.14]  honestly
[3305.14 --> 3306.60]  here's one objection
[3306.60 --> 3307.82]  so strong argument
[3307.82 --> 3309.40]  for allowing tweets
[3309.40 --> 3309.90]  to be edited
[3309.90 --> 3311.02]  I can go against
[3311.02 --> 3311.38]  as well
[3311.38 --> 3312.64]  I can um
[3312.64 --> 3314.86]  I can fix
[3314.86 --> 3315.60]  the uh
[3315.60 --> 3315.90]  sever
[3315.90 --> 3316.96]  uh
[3316.96 --> 3317.56]  typo
[3317.56 --> 3318.00]  in my tweet
[3318.00 --> 3318.50]  last night
[3318.50 --> 3318.90]  yeah
[3318.90 --> 3319.64]  where I referred
[3319.64 --> 3320.56]  to our server
[3320.56 --> 3321.18]  as a sever
[3321.18 --> 3321.94]  which it is not
[3321.94 --> 3322.26]  yeah
[3322.26 --> 3322.96]  I do that kind
[3322.96 --> 3323.14]  of stuff
[3323.14 --> 3323.46]  all the time
[3323.46 --> 3324.60]  the counter argument
[3324.60 --> 3325.52]  is that
[3325.52 --> 3326.08]  you can
[3326.08 --> 3327.00]  say something
[3327.00 --> 3327.98]  start a whole bunch
[3327.98 --> 3328.90]  of crap
[3328.90 --> 3329.50]  with people
[3329.50 --> 3330.12]  responding to you
[3330.12 --> 3330.68]  and then just
[3330.68 --> 3331.18]  change it
[3331.18 --> 3331.52]  and be like
[3331.52 --> 3331.92]  haha
[3331.92 --> 3333.76]  but like
[3333.76 --> 3335.02]  I think the internet
[3335.02 --> 3335.96]  has figured that out
[3335.96 --> 3336.58]  at this point
[3336.58 --> 3337.38]  have they
[3337.38 --> 3338.10]  have they really
[3338.10 --> 3339.78]  because right now
[3339.78 --> 3341.04]  just show edit history
[3341.04 --> 3342.46]  well right now
[3342.46 --> 3343.28]  twitter serves
[3343.28 --> 3343.88]  oh okay
[3343.88 --> 3344.78]  so showing edit history
[3344.78 --> 3345.50]  but if they show
[3345.50 --> 3346.38]  edit history
[3346.38 --> 3347.56]  like what other
[3347.56 --> 3348.76]  platform works like that
[3348.76 --> 3349.32]  like our forum
[3349.32 --> 3350.38]  doesn't show an edit history
[3350.38 --> 3351.00]  you can see that
[3351.00 --> 3351.50]  it was edited
[3351.50 --> 3351.94]  to moderate
[3351.94 --> 3352.78]  moderators yes
[3352.78 --> 3353.60]  you can see that
[3353.60 --> 3354.10]  it is edited
[3354.10 --> 3355.02]  and you cannot
[3355.02 --> 3355.96]  remove the flag
[3355.96 --> 3356.72]  that it was edited
[3356.72 --> 3357.58]  mhm
[3357.58 --> 3358.70]  so like
[3358.70 --> 3361.72]  I think that would
[3361.72 --> 3362.06]  just like
[3362.06 --> 3362.60]  if people start
[3362.60 --> 3363.28]  freaking out
[3363.28 --> 3364.14]  people can just
[3364.14 --> 3364.64]  point out like
[3364.64 --> 3365.28]  yeah it was edited
[3365.28 --> 3365.62]  so
[3365.62 --> 3366.48]  whatever
[3366.48 --> 3367.76]  and then just
[3367.76 --> 3368.26]  if you're tweeting
[3368.26 --> 3369.20]  something super
[3369.20 --> 3369.62]  important
[3369.62 --> 3371.16]  don't edit it
[3371.16 --> 3372.42]  post it
[3372.42 --> 3372.86]  and then if it's
[3372.86 --> 3373.34]  that terrible
[3373.34 --> 3374.02]  delete it
[3374.02 --> 3374.78]  repost it again
[3374.78 --> 3375.32]  because we have
[3375.32 --> 3376.24]  to do right now
[3376.24 --> 3377.44]  fair enough
[3377.44 --> 3378.60]  okay
[3378.60 --> 3379.96]  that makes sense
[3379.96 --> 3381.08]  so basically
[3381.08 --> 3381.70]  there's a series
[3381.70 --> 3382.18]  of tweets
[3382.18 --> 3383.94]  so there's one
[3383.94 --> 3384.98]  asking whether
[3384.98 --> 3385.78]  to fix edits
[3385.78 --> 3386.94]  quick or edit
[3386.94 --> 3387.50]  any time
[3387.50 --> 3388.42]  because that's
[3388.42 --> 3388.84]  something that
[3388.84 --> 3389.22]  you could do
[3389.22 --> 3389.68]  you could allow
[3389.68 --> 3390.20]  it to be edited
[3390.20 --> 3390.78]  in the first
[3390.78 --> 3391.86]  five minutes
[3391.86 --> 3392.22]  yeah
[3392.22 --> 3393.12]  that would fix
[3393.12 --> 3393.92]  the vast majority
[3393.92 --> 3394.96]  of my problems
[3394.96 --> 3395.56]  that I have
[3395.56 --> 3396.04]  me too
[3396.04 --> 3398.56]  apparently there's
[3398.56 --> 3399.36]  a big difference
[3399.36 --> 3400.18]  in the implementation
[3400.18 --> 3401.46]  because allowing
[3401.46 --> 3402.32]  to edit any time
[3402.32 --> 3403.62]  requires change log
[3403.62 --> 3405.70]  as we're often
[3405.70 --> 3406.44]  the public record
[3406.44 --> 3407.24]  so that's a very
[3407.24 --> 3407.76]  good point
[3407.76 --> 3408.66]  and that Twitter
[3408.66 --> 3409.70]  is often
[3409.70 --> 3410.52]  like you look
[3410.52 --> 3411.32]  at all the fact
[3411.32 --> 3412.00]  checking that was
[3412.00 --> 3412.92]  done during the
[3412.92 --> 3413.74]  during the US
[3413.74 --> 3414.60]  election for example
[3414.60 --> 3415.96]  where a candidate
[3415.96 --> 3418.26]  might say something
[3418.26 --> 3419.08]  like I never
[3419.08 --> 3419.78]  said this
[3419.78 --> 3420.88]  and then it was
[3420.88 --> 3421.42]  as simple as
[3421.42 --> 3421.96]  going back and
[3421.96 --> 3422.48]  going well
[3422.48 --> 3423.56]  your Twitter account
[3423.56 --> 3425.86]  which you haven't
[3425.86 --> 3426.98]  said was hacked
[3426.98 --> 3427.94]  at any point in time
[3427.94 --> 3429.16]  says a completely
[3429.16 --> 3429.82]  different thing
[3429.82 --> 3430.64]  so
[3430.64 --> 3432.10]  and with how big
[3432.10 --> 3432.66]  your Twitter account
[3432.66 --> 3433.30]  and following is
[3433.30 --> 3433.66]  and all that kind
[3433.66 --> 3434.20]  of stuff I'm pretty
[3434.20 --> 3434.90]  sure you'd respond
[3434.90 --> 3436.02]  real fast if it
[3436.02 --> 3436.46]  got hacked
[3436.46 --> 3437.04]  yeah
[3437.04 --> 3438.08]  so yeah
[3438.08 --> 3440.64]  not that that
[3440.64 --> 3441.36]  seemed to matter
[3441.36 --> 3442.02]  to most people
[3442.02 --> 3442.38]  no
[3442.38 --> 3444.82]  okay
[3444.82 --> 3446.42]  wow that's really
[3446.42 --> 3447.28]  boring news
[3447.28 --> 3448.60]  and that's really
[3448.60 --> 3449.10]  boring news
[3449.10 --> 3449.48]  we're going to
[3449.48 --> 3449.94]  CES
[3449.94 --> 3450.32]  and we're going
[3450.32 --> 3450.84]  to CES
[3450.84 --> 3451.62]  yeah
[3451.62 --> 3452.60]  and I got some
[3452.60 --> 3453.30]  videos to shoot
[3453.30 --> 3454.04]  before I go to
[3454.04 --> 3454.36]  CES
[3454.36 --> 3454.90]  one of them is
[3454.90 --> 3455.24]  going to be
[3455.24 --> 3456.04]  oh this is
[3456.04 --> 3456.42]  exciting
[3456.42 --> 3458.52]  dongle roundup
[3458.52 --> 3460.82]  so many dongles
[3460.82 --> 3461.96]  which dongle is
[3461.96 --> 3462.98]  the best dongle
[3462.98 --> 3463.62]  whose dongle
[3463.62 --> 3464.44]  will reign supreme
[3464.44 --> 3466.14]  can I dongle you
[3466.14 --> 3467.02]  later
[3467.02 --> 3467.60]  sure
[3467.60 --> 3469.06]  anytime
[3469.06 --> 3470.14]  only if it's
[3470.14 --> 3470.92]  the best dongle
[3470.92 --> 3471.78]  intro
[3471.78 --> 3473.44]  do do do
[3473.44 --> 3473.52]  do do
[3473.52 --> 3473.84]  do we still
[3473.84 --> 3474.30]  not have audio
[3474.30 --> 3474.92]  no we don't
[3474.92 --> 3475.30]  have audio
[3475.30 --> 3476.12]  do do do
[3476.12 --> 3477.54]  why don't we
[3477.54 --> 3478.00]  have audio
[3478.00 --> 3480.60]  why is this
[3480.60 --> 3481.28]  still a problem
[3481.28 --> 3482.78]  can't we just
[3482.78 --> 3483.26]  solve it pretty
[3483.26 --> 3483.64]  easy
[3483.64 --> 3485.58]  sort of yes
[3485.58 --> 3486.42]  it's complicated
[3486.42 --> 3488.22]  it's like
[3488.22 --> 3489.76]  Twitter
[3489.76 --> 3490.44]  it's complicated
[3490.44 --> 3490.90]  come check out
[3490.90 --> 3491.56]  my charity stream
[3491.56 --> 3491.90]  and not wait
[3491.90 --> 3492.18]  too long
[3492.18 --> 3493.68]  fresh books
[3493.68 --> 3495.68]  yay
[3495.68 --> 3498.68]  fresh books
[3498.68 --> 3499.56]  are we set up
[3499.56 --> 3500.22]  to do WAN show

[3500.90 --> 3501.36]  do we have
[3501.36 --> 3501.86]  all the files
[3501.86 --> 3502.22]  and stuff
[3502.22 --> 3502.76]  we should probably
[3502.76 --> 3503.10]  do that
[3503.10 --> 3503.54]  at some point
[3503.54 --> 3504.18]  we probably should
[3504.18 --> 3505.92]  take care of
[3505.92 --> 3507.80]  any from the
[3507.80 --> 3508.16]  you
