the timestamps are wrong, it misses: 16:00 - Linus fapping about thunderbolt

that Ryzen part was ridiculous, cryin about the Ryzen name for 2 minutes and then showing 4-5 AMD slides in rapid fire mode.
No word about the AMD event where they compared Ryzen to the 1100$ Intel 6900k and it was at the same performance.

Well now i know at least i can rule out LTT when it comes to CPU reviews, they are clearly hardcore Intel fanboys.
