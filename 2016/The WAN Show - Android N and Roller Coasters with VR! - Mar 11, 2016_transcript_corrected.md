[0.00 → 1.54] 45 to 5 o'clock.
[2.52 → 3.52] Okay, we're live.
[3.96 → 4.56] We're live?
[4.78 → 5.26] We're live.
[5.44 → 6.82] So we're almost, almost on time.
[7.26 → 8.90] Do you like my new metrics?
[9.18 → 12.16] We're almost pretty late, is how I think of it.
[12.36 → 13.38] Almost pretty late.
[13.50 → 13.78] Yes.
[14.36 → 15.92] Okay, so you go the other way around.
[16.08 → 16.28] Yeah.
[16.30 → 17.26] I'm the optimist.
[17.36 → 26.22] So yeah, I consider, like, if we start at, like, 435 to 445, I consider that a little late.
[26.80 → 27.38] A little late.
[27.38 → 33.62] Yeah, and then if we start from anywhere from kind of 445 to 5 o'clock, that's, like, really late.
[33.96 → 37.02] And then after 5 o'clock is, like, something must...
[37.02 → 37.56] So we're really late.
[37.66 → 38.68] Something was on fire.
[38.92 → 40.36] No, no, it's, we're late.
[40.64 → 41.80] But we're not really late.
[41.90 → 42.66] But it's 450.
[42.74 → 43.14] Oh, yeah.
[43.26 → 44.94] Okay, yes, I would consider that really late.
[45.04 → 45.24] Okay.
[45.42 → 50.88] Yeah, but, like, and then, like, after 5 is just, like, unless something was on fire, there isn't really much of an excuse.
[50.94 → 52.14] I mean, there still isn't an excuse.
[53.08 → 54.38] So yours is based on lateness.
[55.20 → 55.38] Yes.
[55.38 → 56.52] Mine is based on nativity.
[56.62 → 56.82] Yeah.
[56.82 → 58.76] So I'm almost on time.
[58.78 → 59.50] Which is really the same thing.
[59.58 → 59.78] Yeah.
[60.44 → 65.90] It's like saying, it's like the like, oh, yes, I'm 25 years young.
[67.72 → 69.08] Yeah, so you're that guy.
[69.94 → 72.18] Except, yeah, in that situation, I'm not, I guess.
[72.48 → 73.56] So maybe I should be your guy.
[75.10 → 76.10] Because I hate that.
[76.36 → 77.38] So we're really late.
[77.68 → 79.60] That's like measuring phones in millimetres thin.
[80.30 → 80.58] Yeah.
[80.58 → 81.52] See?
[81.52 → 81.56] See?
[82.38 → 84.42] The you're the marketing guy.
[84.80 → 89.50] At the end of all that, it turns out you were, like, the marketing executive.
[89.86 → 90.22] Oh.
[90.22 → 91.22] Wow.
[91.88 → 92.32] Wow.
[92.64 → 93.72] That's the worst.
[93.84 → 94.90] I never even realized.
[95.28 → 95.90] That is the worst.
[95.90 → 97.82] You were such an effective marketing executive.
[97.90 → 98.84] That you didn't even know.
[98.90 → 101.58] I didn't even realize what you've been doing all this time.
[101.58 → 104.84] You didn't know that I planted my phones in your ad spots for $300,000.
[105.48 → 105.78] Wow.
[105.78 → 106.32] In your show.
[106.32 → 109.06] Yeah, why don't we, why don't we get into what topics we have today?
[109.14 → 109.58] Good thinking.
[109.60 → 110.16] Just do it, man.
[110.24 → 114.32] So OnePlus apparently paid $300,000 US dollars.
[114.44 → 114.84] And you know what?
[114.86 → 118.28] This is actually in as a rapid fire topic, but I have a lot to say about this.
[118.34 → 118.58] Sure.
[118.96 → 122.74] $300,000 US dollars to get their phones featured in House of Cards.
[122.92 → 123.14] Yep.
[124.74 → 126.06] What else do we have here?
[126.50 → 129.28] Google releases Android N details.
[129.90 → 131.02] I'm going to have to say it like that.
[131.38 → 132.64] N details.
[132.64 → 133.78] Because that doesn't really sound like M.
[133.78 → 139.32] Maybe you're not super sure about the like micro parts of the words M.
[139.56 → 140.84] The micro parts of the letters.
[140.84 → 142.44] I was finding excuses to say M.
[142.62 → 145.14] What is a micro part?
[145.14 → 150.18] Micro parts is the closest you can get to a sensible thing with an M in it.
[150.36 → 152.16] Well, it had to fit that part of the sentence.
[152.18 → 154.02] Why don't you come up with a Mick?
[159.84 → 160.64] Oh, man.
[160.68 → 161.50] Oh, that's terrible.
[161.68 → 163.12] Madness VR gloves?
[163.30 → 163.68] Madness.
[164.66 → 165.58] It works.
[166.92 → 167.84] What else do we have?
[167.86 → 168.70] Do we have any other topics?
[168.82 → 169.18] Samsung.
[169.50 → 172.84] And Microsoft announces closure of Lion head Studios.
[173.18 → 175.42] Seizes development on latest Fable game, which isn't funny.
[175.72 → 175.98] No.
[176.82 → 177.30] Actually.
[177.54 → 178.20] That's pretty lame.
[178.52 → 181.16] Imagine Nike bought Microsoft and then renamed them Microsoft.
[182.16 → 183.30] I like Mikey better.
[183.56 → 183.84] Mikey.
[185.00 → 186.08] Let's roll the intro.
[186.62 → 187.68] It would be like Mike.
[188.38 → 188.80] Get it?
[189.30 → 190.82] It would actually make sense for Mikey.
[190.82 → 190.90] Mikey.
[190.90 → 195.42] Mikey.
[195.42 → 196.20] Just poo it.
[202.86 → 206.50] Wouldn't that be just like a great tagline for a laxative company?
[206.50 → 208.00] Oh my god.
[208.10 → 209.16] So much should do that.
[209.18 → 209.78] Just poo it.
[209.96 → 211.06] I wonder if Nike would see it.
[212.32 → 212.72] Probably.
[213.48 → 214.46] Probably pretty hard.
[214.56 → 218.72] I mean, it's one of those things where like you could make the argument that it is not
[218.72 → 220.30] Nike's trademark.
[220.30 → 223.48] But I mean, I don't think.
[223.78 → 226.08] But I think that would be like the Model 3 thing.
[226.58 → 226.82] Yeah.
[226.82 → 231.52] That might be one of those things where Nike would kind of be like, yo, here's a letter
[231.52 → 236.24] that's like super friendly, but also super had 16 lawyers writing it.
[236.24 → 243.38] You guys should probably change your slogan because you can't afford to go to court with
[243.38 → 244.84] us for this long.
[247.16 → 247.56] Yes.
[248.30 → 248.74] Yes.
[248.84 → 251.32] Apparently it's Shia LaBeouf's trademark.
[251.70 → 253.12] No, actually it isn't.
[253.24 → 254.76] He says, oh wait, hold on.
[255.48 → 255.74] Yeah.
[255.82 → 257.02] He does say just do it.
[257.12 → 259.10] I thought he sometimes didn't say just though.
[259.24 → 259.58] Do it.
[259.58 → 260.86] He mixed it up a little bit, right?
[261.82 → 263.60] Don't let your dreams be dreams.
[264.62 → 265.36] I don't know if that's what he says.
[265.36 → 266.16] That clip is so awful.
[266.34 → 269.40] Like I actually never did figure out what the story behind it was.
[269.62 → 270.16] If it was.
[270.16 → 271.24] Have you ever watched the full thing?
[271.50 → 272.28] Intentionally bad.
[272.62 → 273.12] I don't know.
[273.32 → 274.42] It was really weird.
[274.54 → 279.12] I wonder like, cause everyone's like, oh, Shia LaBeouf's like super motivational speech.
[279.30 → 280.60] So I was like, okay.
[280.60 → 282.94] And I watched it, and he was just like screaming, do it.
[283.04 → 285.20] And I was like, uh, okay.
[285.54 → 286.02] No, I did.
[286.12 → 286.80] No, I watched it.
[286.86 → 287.88] Did you watch the long one?
[288.02 → 288.86] There's a long one?
[288.86 → 290.68] There's like longer than a few minutes.
[290.94 → 291.24] Oh yeah.
[291.32 → 292.20] It's like half an hour.
[292.40 → 292.76] What?
[292.94 → 293.24] Yeah.
[293.94 → 295.68] You watched that for half an hour.
[295.94 → 296.34] I was.
[296.48 → 299.00] I can't watch Shia LaBeouf for half an hour in theory.
[299.20 → 299.48] I think.
[299.92 → 302.66] Never mind standing in front of a green screen screaming at me.
[302.74 → 306.52] I think I was like scripting something and I had it on the background because I was trying
[306.52 → 307.64] to figure out what it even was.
[307.82 → 308.10] Gross.
[308.52 → 312.58] And it is like, I never understood at no point in time did I understand.
[312.58 → 320.58] I think it felt like he was doing like auditioning takes for like different like styles of himself,
[320.58 → 322.18] I guess is what I'd say.
[322.64 → 326.02] A bunch of people were saying it was an art project, and I was like, when does something
[326.02 → 327.76] go from insanity to an art project?
[327.98 → 329.22] Or are they the same thing?
[329.22 → 331.74] I don't know.
[331.82 → 333.46] There was your Scrapyard Wars computer.
[334.16 → 336.24] That was pretty freaking cool.
[336.40 → 336.62] Okay.
[336.62 → 337.04] Was it cool?
[337.14 → 338.86] So, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[338.88 → 339.50] We don't want to say too much.
[339.50 → 340.32] I got a thumbs up.
[340.36 → 341.16] We don't want to say too much.
[341.20 → 341.88] We don't want to say too much.
[341.96 → 342.16] So.
[343.04 → 343.48] I got a thumbs up.
[343.48 → 345.08] What I will say is this.
[345.08 → 345.62] I got two thumbs up.
[345.66 → 348.82] I've got, I've got people asking me already.
[349.48 → 353.78] When is Scrapyard Wars going to be released?
[353.98 → 354.38] Friday.
[355.08 → 355.56] No.
[355.74 → 357.02] I'm the marketing guy.
[358.62 → 360.72] You're the crappy marketing guy.
[361.34 → 364.14] It's like, just poo it on Friday.
[365.96 → 366.56] Not Friday.
[366.56 → 367.66] Toilet's half full.
[369.86 → 370.90] Not Friday at all.
[371.20 → 372.96] So no, not Friday.
[373.48 → 381.16] It will be on a Saturday, but Ed respectfully requested an additional week.
[381.44 → 382.40] Which is good.
[382.48 → 383.22] Which is good.
[383.32 → 384.22] You want that, actually.
[384.24 → 388.08] Because we are doing this one really differently.
[388.80 → 395.70] So Scrapyard Wars 1 was three parts, with the last part being primarily benchmarking slash judging,
[395.70 → 398.42] and the first two being us running around getting stuff.
[398.42 → 398.82] Yeah.
[399.22 → 406.02] Scrapyard Wars 2, which was the water cooling one, was, I forget.
[406.02 → 406.08] Okay.
[407.46 → 407.86] Okay.
[407.96 → 411.28] Scrapyard Wars 3, with Austin, was a three-way battle.
[411.40 → 413.84] And that ended up being a challenge for a couple of reasons.
[413.98 → 420.98] Number one was with three teams, it was just so much footage.
[420.98 → 422.62] For one person to have to scrub through.
[422.62 → 423.70] For one person to get through.
[423.72 → 424.48] There was no system editor or anything.
[424.94 → 430.82] And the other issue was that it made it really hard to track what was going on.
[431.18 → 436.86] Because there were these three different storylines where the time of day, you can't necessarily
[436.86 → 438.34] go, okay, it's 10 o'clock.
[438.44 → 440.46] Let's check in with what this team and this team are doing.
[440.58 → 441.46] Here's our 10 o'clock update.
[441.46 → 442.56] It doesn't really work that way.
[442.60 → 446.90] Because at 10 o'clock, he might be sitting picking his toes, and I might be out in a
[446.90 → 448.40] car, and Austin might be doing something else.
[448.44 → 450.06] Or we might all be sitting picking our toes.
[450.16 → 450.66] Like, you can't.
[451.16 → 454.62] Or we're all doing something too insane to be covered in a short segment.
[454.82 → 457.48] Or, like, it's just never really going to make a ton of sense.
[457.48 → 459.44] So it was really hard to tell the story.
[460.46 → 465.84] So Scrapyard Wars Season 4, I think Luke and I, not I think, we talked about it already,
[466.32 → 468.26] are 100% in agreement.
[468.46 → 469.12] Oh, it's the best one.
[469.24 → 470.56] Is going to be the best one.
[470.56 → 471.42] It is the best one.
[471.46 → 472.34] Two teams.
[472.80 → 473.48] Two teams.
[473.76 → 474.98] But we've got, it's a team battle.
[475.32 → 479.10] So it's me and one of the BS Mods guys.
[479.56 → 481.26] Luke and the other BS Mods guys.
[481.30 → 484.18] So we've got actual professional case dodders this time.
[484.34 → 484.50] Yeah.
[484.60 → 485.48] Helping us with it.
[485.62 → 487.78] The scoring is going to be done a little differently.
[488.16 → 489.76] It's not going to be just performance.
[490.46 → 492.34] And the filming was different too.
[492.42 → 495.18] So we filmed almost the entire time.
[495.84 → 499.78] Like, my camera was probably rolling a good 60% of the time.
[499.78 → 500.96] Brandon, you think that's about right?
[501.04 → 501.22] Yeah.
[501.46 → 501.86] Yeah.
[501.86 → 502.88] I don't know if ours was.
[503.22 → 505.74] So there's a lot of footage.
[506.72 → 509.12] I mean, was he rolling even 40% of the time?
[510.30 → 511.54] We did a lot of retakes.
[512.30 → 512.50] Oh.
[512.60 → 513.60] He would not be rolling.
[513.90 → 514.72] And then we'd say something.
[514.72 → 515.80] Oh, well, we had to do a fair bit of that too.
[515.80 → 516.26] We do it.
[516.48 → 516.68] Yeah.
[516.68 → 517.80] Yeah, of course.
[518.26 → 519.22] I mean, it is what it is.
[519.30 → 521.64] It's capturing the moment as best you can.
[521.78 → 526.00] Ed is perfect at being completely not noticeable when he's filming.
[526.46 → 528.14] So I don't know how much he filmed.
[528.52 → 528.82] Okay.
[528.82 → 534.32] I realized in one of the stores he had the camera in his elbow, and it was actually running.
[535.08 → 537.04] He's just able to like...
[537.04 → 537.94] He's kind of ninja.
[538.18 → 538.46] Yeah.
[538.60 → 540.48] So I don't know how much he was filming.
[540.62 → 540.92] Okay.
[540.92 → 541.70] Well, you know what?
[541.76 → 542.22] It might have been a lot.
[542.42 → 545.94] What's really cool is we were allowed to film in every store we went into.
[547.42 → 552.12] We were allowed to film in a lot of the stores we went into.
[552.22 → 554.32] We were allowed to film in the most interesting store we went into.
[554.32 → 558.44] So the filming is going to be really complete, which is really cool.
[558.82 → 561.68] And I have finally caved.
[561.88 → 564.44] I have finally caved to Ed.
[564.90 → 567.26] And we will be doing longer episodes.
[568.02 → 572.42] So the plan right now is to have half an hour to 45-minute episodes.
[574.00 → 575.54] That needs to go into inventory.
[576.82 → 579.24] Half an hour to 45-minute episodes.
[579.70 → 583.96] And we are going to limit it to the plan is four right now.
[584.32 → 591.50] So what Ed asked for is a full two weeks to go through everything, document the storyline,
[592.14 → 595.18] and then figure out what the structure is going to be.
[595.24 → 597.08] So this is going to be like the best one yet.
[597.14 → 603.56] We are actually going full on like reality show length, like good reality show length.
[603.92 → 611.24] It's like an hour-long TV episode, about 45 minutes to show you guys as much of the action as possible.
[611.44 → 614.10] So we are DE-webseries-ifying it a little bit.
[614.32 → 618.20] And making it really more like a TV series.
[618.36 → 620.82] So you guys have been asking for that.
[621.16 → 627.56] I was really apprehensive about doing really long form content on YouTube.
[628.18 → 630.52] But you guys won.
[630.98 → 631.82] And Ed won.
[632.08 → 633.16] And we are going to try it.
[633.50 → 635.42] And we are going to see how it turns out.
[635.42 → 640.42] So Dennis is apparently helping me co-host the WAN show now for whatever reason.
[640.68 → 640.78] Okay.
[640.96 → 641.04] Yeah.
[641.04 → 643.78] Was there something that you wanted to share with the audience?
[643.78 → 644.06] Sorry.
[644.88 → 648.38] My day.
[648.82 → 649.44] Share my day.
[650.32 → 650.80] Share what?
[651.58 → 651.92] Sure.
[652.38 → 653.52] I can't stop you.
[654.74 → 655.88] I've been too busy.
[656.24 → 657.24] I don't know.
[658.24 → 659.36] Can't function now.
[659.36 → 662.44] I don't know why I got pulled out.
[662.88 → 665.66] Suddenly I was editing and Luke pulled out of me here.
[666.62 → 668.16] Luke did you say, sorry, Luke pulled out?
[668.84 → 669.98] Pull me out.
[670.00 → 670.88] He never does that.
[671.04 → 671.40] Okay.
[671.62 → 672.20] That's good.
[672.48 → 673.30] That's really polite.
[673.46 → 674.80] I mean, yeah.
[676.80 → 677.28] Okay.
[677.96 → 678.86] What's going on?
[679.32 → 679.72] Nothing.
[679.72 → 681.74] I've just, you're supposed to tell us about your day.
[681.98 → 682.80] Oh, okay.
[684.20 → 687.68] I had my day.
[690.54 → 690.94] Okay.
[692.98 → 694.22] All right, Luke, you can come back.
[694.34 → 695.52] Yes, please save me.
[695.70 → 696.08] I can't.
[696.40 → 697.04] I can't.
[697.74 → 700.80] I'm so failed.
[702.92 → 703.76] I get it.
[703.84 → 705.52] Dennis's brain is kind of fried today.
[705.64 → 706.76] He's had a pretty stressful day.
[706.76 → 709.14] We shot four fastest possibles today.
[709.72 → 711.88] We had some challenges with ingesting the footage.
[713.08 → 715.22] He definitely had his day.
[715.44 → 716.58] That is a true statement.
[716.70 → 717.66] That is a factual statement.
[718.86 → 723.68] So let's get into the Android N details and developer preview.
[723.80 → 724.00] I'm sorry?
[724.10 → 724.82] Is the YouTube video up?
[725.22 → 725.76] Yeah, it is.
[726.12 → 727.38] Yeah, viewership's just really low today.
[727.50 → 728.16] I'm not really sure why.
[728.78 → 729.56] And maybe it's the jacket.
[729.82 → 730.88] I like it, but, you know.
[731.18 → 731.96] Actually, you were getting...
[731.96 → 732.38] No, no, no, no.
[732.38 → 732.70] I'm kidding.
[732.76 → 733.02] I'm kidding.
[733.08 → 734.50] You were getting a lot of compliments on the jacket.
[734.74 → 735.02] Okay.
[735.16 → 735.44] Yeah, no.
[735.44 → 736.36] I was just messing with you.
[736.84 → 738.84] Did you notice how it's LTT orange on the inside?
[738.84 → 742.32] I did not notice that, but it is actually pretty close.
[742.44 → 743.36] It's like really close.
[743.40 → 744.20] It's just glossy.
[744.60 → 745.46] Yeah, hold on a second.
[745.58 → 746.86] Because not...
[746.86 → 748.78] Well, I don't know if I have anything else.
[749.08 → 750.06] That's really dark.
[750.16 → 751.52] Yeah, ours is a little darker.
[751.64 → 752.94] I think this is pretty right.
[754.80 → 755.38] This one.
[755.46 → 756.32] This one's pretty right.
[756.78 → 758.56] So we do have a bit of a darker orange.
[758.64 → 759.94] It is a bit more of a vibrant orange.
[760.06 → 761.70] This is really nice, though.
[761.86 → 762.16] I like it.
[762.16 → 763.06] I was telling you that already.
[763.18 → 763.52] What is it?
[763.58 → 763.98] NASA?
[764.68 → 767.46] It's from Alpha.
[767.46 → 768.04] Feel the zipper.
[769.86 → 770.46] Which one?
[770.56 → 772.24] The one on the jacket or the other one?
[773.50 → 778.36] I think we all know I'm not interested in the zipper so much as what's under it.
[778.72 → 779.28] It's just kind of nice.
[779.30 → 781.52] Yeah, it's like really nicely constructed.
[781.66 → 782.08] It looks good.
[782.12 → 782.58] I like it.
[782.62 → 782.84] Thank you.
[784.74 → 786.42] It's from people that are wondering.
[786.52 → 789.70] It's from the Light Sail project that Bill Nye was heading out.
[790.16 → 790.32] Yeah.
[791.20 → 792.56] Anyway, we've talked about that before.
[792.56 → 793.46] Don't worry about it.
[793.46 → 794.80] All right.
[794.96 → 798.88] So this was originally posted by Asim1999 on the forum.
[798.96 → 799.64] Do you have the link there?
[800.10 → 801.44] Use the Life hacker one.
[801.62 → 807.86] So Google releases Android N details and developer preview and all that good stuff.
[807.86 → 825.80] You know, really the funny thing about this to me is that Android M, it feels like never really reached ubiquity the way that Lollipop did before it.
[826.76 → 827.86] Not even close.
[827.86 → 828.38] Close.
[828.48 → 836.28] Like I've got a handful of Android devices of which I don't know if I'm running Android M on any of them.
[836.34 → 840.00] I think the NVIDIA Shield tablet might be running Marshmallow.
[840.16 → 840.88] My phone is not.
[841.38 → 841.58] Yeah.
[841.72 → 845.32] No, my Z5 Compact is not running Marshmallow yet to my knowledge.
[845.78 → 851.62] I did see a software update not that long ago, but I'm pretty sure it was just another Lollipop tweak.
[851.76 → 855.28] Like I don't think it was actually Android M.
[855.28 → 856.94] I mean, I'm going to check right now.
[857.04 → 857.38] No, yeah.
[857.40 → 858.78] If I'm running 5.1.1.
[859.28 → 861.18] Yeah, well, that's a Nexus device, isn't it?
[861.94 → 862.86] Oh, that's a G4.
[862.96 → 863.62] So G4.
[863.98 → 866.76] So some of the flagship phones have got it.
[866.80 → 869.08] I know that the Galaxy S6 is running it.
[869.60 → 870.82] Nexus devices have it.
[870.94 → 875.94] But it never really took off the way that some of the previous ones did.
[876.06 → 877.28] I mean, KitKat, Lollipop.
[879.44 → 880.36] So I don't know.
[880.44 → 881.52] Very, very interesting to me.
[881.52 → 883.10] And it didn't even have the Life window.
[883.10 → 885.86] Like it wasn't even around that long.
[886.04 → 886.46] No, really.
[886.66 → 887.34] Well, I don't know.
[887.40 → 887.60] Maybe.
[887.68 → 888.88] Maybe I just didn't really notice.
[889.54 → 889.90] I don't think it was around that long.
[889.90 → 891.10] Because it took so long to roll out.
[892.66 → 893.76] Yeah, now I have to look it up.
[893.80 → 895.00] Release date of Android M, yeah.
[895.16 → 896.24] I'm going to search for the announcement.
[896.88 → 900.40] So Android M was announced May 28, 2015.
[900.82 → 902.18] So not even a year ago.
[902.66 → 905.94] And then it really didn't start rolling out until a little bit after that.
[905.94 → 906.70] So it was late May.
[906.80 → 910.08] So it was probably like June, July by the time it was really even rolling out on devices.
[910.22 → 911.70] I mean, that's only like a nine-month window.
[912.00 → 912.74] It was pretty small.
[913.74 → 914.10] Yeah.
[914.28 → 914.60] Anyway.
[915.00 → 915.88] So it's got a...
[915.88 → 916.94] Oh, sorry.
[917.08 → 918.76] I'm still screen sharing here.
[919.10 → 919.54] There we go.
[919.94 → 922.12] So it's got a bunch of new features.
[922.38 → 923.12] This one's cool.
[923.12 → 928.86] So it's got a data saver feature, which allows the operating system to tell applications proactively.
[929.58 → 935.76] And it sounds like it's configurable, though I don't have all the details about all these little things just yet.
[935.82 → 937.48] But it sounds like it's configurable.
[937.58 → 945.32] You can be like, yo, when I'm close to my data limit, make sure that you're telling my video streaming applications to default to the lowest bit rate.
[946.06 → 946.46] That's cool.
[946.46 → 950.12] Or, you know, tell them not to use background data or...
[950.12 → 954.84] My favourite stuff is not even related to that necessarily.
[955.02 → 956.54] It's the notification tray updates.
[957.06 → 958.16] So there are a few different things.
[958.40 → 959.96] They're much more interact...
[959.96 → 966.26] Like, the main thing that they seem to be doing, which was pulled out by Marcus Brownlee, is that they're using the screen real estate more.
[966.54 → 970.24] He brings that up a ton in his video about it, which is actually a very good video about it if you want to check it out.
[971.04 → 974.22] And they use the screen real estate in the settings by...
[974.22 → 979.92] If you see, like, the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth setting, instead of just saying Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, it will say, like, Wi-Fi.
[979.92 → 982.92] And then in small text under that, what one you're currently connected to.
[983.20 → 985.40] And Bluetooth, and then what one you're currently connected to.
[985.62 → 990.62] Or when you look at battery, instead of it just saying battery, it will tell you the battery percentage, what you're currently at, which is nice.
[991.04 → 992.60] And it's similar for notifications.
[992.82 → 995.42] So you pull it down, and then instead of just saying, like...
[995.42 → 996.70] They can't see your phone, but, you know.
[996.78 → 997.26] No, I know.
[997.34 → 997.60] Oh, okay.
[997.60 → 999.90] I'm doing this so that I remember where things were.
[1000.08 → 1000.40] Okay.
[1000.70 → 1008.98] And pulling it down, instead of being able to see, like, maybe one message or being able to pull it out and see, like, a little bit of one message, you can pull it out even more.
[1009.08 → 1010.56] The expansion area is much bigger.
[1010.80 → 1013.08] You can interact with individual ones.
[1013.22 → 1014.22] That's really cool.
[1014.22 → 1020.30] You can archive immediately within notifications individual emails instead of the entire notification.
[1020.56 → 1025.74] So you can open it up and be like, yeah, that's a junk mail, but I do need to read those later and don't want to forget about it, so I want to leave the notification.
[1025.88 → 1026.82] You can do that, which is nice.
[1026.86 → 1029.90] I really wish the default wasn't archive, and I wish you could change it.
[1030.20 → 1030.70] Me too.
[1030.74 → 1032.42] I do not want to archive my junk mail.
[1032.52 → 1032.98] I don't give a crap.
[1032.98 → 1035.06] I actually pay for my Gmail account.
[1035.68 → 1039.36] I actually, like, will have to buy capacity for it when I run out.
[1039.46 → 1040.54] I'm not archiving things.
[1041.02 → 1041.48] Anyway, sorry.
[1041.48 → 1043.22] I have the exact same frustration.
[1044.08 → 1052.30] And then, like, for Hangouts and stuff, you can drag it down even a little bit more and then reply in your notification dropdown without actually pulling away from anything.
[1052.42 → 1058.44] So if you get, like, the short dropdown that comes in, you can click Reply, Reply there without opening the big app, which is very nice.
[1060.06 → 1063.70] They added a lot of just, like, usability tweaks for notifications, which was perfect.
[1064.04 → 1065.90] Apparently the camera was flickering a little bit.
[1066.00 → 1066.40] That's weird.
[1066.56 → 1067.88] I saw it blacked out once.
[1067.94 → 1068.60] Very, very strange.
[1069.06 → 1070.62] We're not dropping any frames in the stream, though.
[1070.62 → 1072.22] Not a lot I can do about it right now.
[1072.28 → 1072.70] Sorry, guys.
[1073.58 → 1075.40] So it's got a multi-window mode.
[1076.16 → 1077.46] Direct-of-plat notification sounds cool.
[1077.58 → 1091.72] I don't know anything about this, but I hope that whatever's coming for Android Wear does a way better job of synchronizing items that you've read, items that you've swiped away, items you've replied to.
[1091.72 → 1104.46] Like, one of my biggest frustrations with my smartwatch right now is when I get a hangout or an email or something and I go, okay, yeah, I'm going to reply by text, blah, blah, blah, et cetera.
[1104.54 → 1105.34] Here's your reply.
[1106.06 → 1108.56] That freaking message is still unread on my phone.
[1108.56 → 1110.82] And it's still unread on my computer.
[1110.94 → 1112.00] I've replied to it.
[1112.72 → 1114.66] Please synchronize this stuff a little bit better.
[1114.74 → 1117.30] So that's been a bit of an ongoing frustration for me.
[1117.48 → 1118.52] I saw another flicker.
[1118.68 → 1119.36] Yeah, I saw that.
[1119.42 → 1121.04] I don't know how much we're going to be able to do about it.
[1121.10 → 1123.28] Like, I can run out and try and, like, tweak the connections.
[1123.28 → 1126.94] But the built-in file manager is a lot more powerful now.
[1127.14 → 1129.34] You can block phone numbers at the system level.
[1129.54 → 1131.30] That is really, perfect.
[1131.34 → 1141.86] As someone whose phone number has leaked a wide variety of times, I am pretty much limited to Android phone makers who have a phone number block feature.
[1142.98 → 1144.44] To not be able to...
[1144.44 → 1144.84] You can get an app.
[1145.38 → 1149.72] You can get an app, but it doesn't necessarily work 100%.
[1149.72 → 1157.84] So, yeah, having that handled at the Android level is definitely a huge thumbs up.
[1157.94 → 1159.66] Like, that shouldn't be an optional feature.
[1160.14 → 1161.96] Like, telemarketers or whoever else.
[1162.00 → 1163.56] Anyone who's calling you and shouldn't be calling you.
[1163.62 → 1166.40] It should be as simple as never hear from this number again.
[1166.76 → 1167.20] Boom.
[1167.52 → 1168.00] Done.
[1168.96 → 1170.18] Night mode is back.
[1170.18 → 1173.18] Moves to a darker theme that you can turn on and off.
[1173.34 → 1173.58] Nice.
[1173.66 → 1175.32] I'll put that on and leave it on permanently.
[1175.60 → 1178.86] No more optimizing apps every time you update.
[1179.72 → 1181.04] Yeah.
[1181.76 → 1183.08] I like night modes for things.
[1183.32 → 1187.78] Like, the forums, like Dark Skin or Night Skin or whatever you want to call it.
[1187.84 → 1188.84] Night theme.
[1189.72 → 1190.50] My favourite.
[1190.84 → 1193.26] They run dark, black, night theme on everything.
[1193.58 → 1194.64] This will be a good one for you.
[1195.60 → 1198.78] You can set Do Not Disturb to automatically end when an alarm goes off.
[1200.04 → 1201.98] No, that's too little too late, though.
[1202.26 → 1203.74] You've got a video coming about that, right?
[1204.92 → 1207.44] I'm waiting on a product that will be a long time.
[1207.62 → 1208.62] It's not just waiting for shipment.
[1208.62 → 1211.72] It's like waiting to finish development, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1211.88 → 1212.16] Oh.
[1212.16 → 1214.68] So it's coming, but don't wait for it.
[1214.74 → 1217.02] But I'm going to do, like, the ultimate alarm setup.
[1217.22 → 1220.32] And one of the alarms might be swapped out because it's not as good as something else.
[1220.44 → 1221.06] Oh, I see.
[1221.36 → 1222.48] It's still, I'm working on it.
[1222.58 → 1224.72] The first piece is definitely what will be in the video.
[1224.94 → 1225.26] Right.
[1225.34 → 1228.10] The second piece could work in the video, but I might try to get a better one.
[1228.20 → 1230.92] And then the third piece still has to show up, and it's being developed.
[1230.92 → 1232.48] Here's something I'd like to know.
[1234.02 → 1236.84] Because, I mean, hold on.
[1236.84 → 1244.20] Like, how married to computer technology are you guys?
[1245.24 → 1250.76] Like, would you want to see a standalone review of, like, a high-tech alarm clock?
[1250.76 → 1256.56] Like, and, like, I'm not going to lead you guys into an answer.
[1256.66 → 1258.92] I want to straight up know what you guys think.
[1258.98 → 1266.06] Because it is no secret at this point that there's not a lot of computer stuff coming out.
[1266.14 → 1267.64] Like, I don't know if you guys noticed or not.
[1267.64 → 1272.88] But, like, okay, there's the Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15.
[1273.08 → 1274.36] Like, those are some pretty cool laptops.
[1275.32 → 1277.68] There's some high-powered gaming laptops out there.
[1277.92 → 1284.46] Like, you know, Sager is usually good for a new laptop, a new high-powered laptop design once a year or so.
[1286.88 → 1289.12] Asus has some cool stuff coming around, Computer.
[1289.20 → 1292.46] But that only really happens, like, once a year when Intel updates their microarchitecture.
[1293.84 → 1296.36] CPUs are happening barely once a year.
[1296.36 → 1298.20] Is it even once a year anymore?
[1298.44 → 1298.84] Not really.
[1299.02 → 1299.90] Not really once a year.
[1299.98 → 1302.82] Graphics cards are happening once every 18 months or so.
[1303.36 → 1304.56] Like, go back and look.
[1304.60 → 1307.88] When the GTX 980 came out, it was a freaking long time ago.
[1308.62 → 1311.96] I can review my crazy alarm clock thing.
[1312.06 → 1312.52] I don't know.
[1312.58 → 1313.40] Like, I was just wondering.
[1313.74 → 1315.04] The noes are pretty high.
[1315.30 → 1319.54] Because there's a lot of technology that's not necessarily a computer.
[1320.22 → 1324.12] Well, that's why I wanted to do my fastest possible on the sous vide card.
[1324.12 → 1325.40] Yeah, and you won that battle.
[1325.40 → 1328.88] And I would still definitely review the sous vide cooker.
[1329.12 → 1331.28] It's, I bought one.
[1331.56 → 1335.02] So, like, when it shows up, I can use it for a while and then make a video about it.
[1335.10 → 1335.34] Okay.
[1335.36 → 1336.20] I'm going to use it anyway.
[1336.46 → 1336.76] So, like.
[1336.82 → 1337.96] Let's do that.
[1339.40 → 1340.50] I want to know.
[1340.50 → 1346.38] The thing that helps me get by with stuff like the sous vide cooker specifically is that
[1346.38 → 1349.58] Gabe Newell is one of the like, backers of it.
[1349.94 → 1355.20] So I can just, like, anytime anyone's like, this isn't computer focused, I just say his name and flop his name around.
[1355.34 → 1357.14] And then everyone's suddenly more okay with it.
[1357.86 → 1359.42] Which is super helpful.
[1359.42 → 1362.30] I'm just going to put that out there.
[1362.42 → 1363.38] You know that's cheating.
[1363.74 → 1364.78] It kind of is.
[1366.50 → 1366.94] All right.
[1366.94 → 1369.16] I want to know who wants to see a sous vide cooker review.
[1370.76 → 1371.12] Okay.
[1371.32 → 1372.68] See, that's better than alarm clock.
[1372.70 → 1373.82] That's better than alarm clock.
[1373.88 → 1374.48] I'll give it that.
[1374.48 → 1375.04] Because I think the problem is.
[1377.04 → 1377.44] Inventory.
[1378.10 → 1378.32] Wait.
[1378.46 → 1379.68] No, just put it back in my area.
[1379.76 → 1380.44] Don't sign it back in.
[1380.44 → 1382.96] We've got a warehouse helper now.
[1383.44 → 1384.98] I think he's kind of awesome.
[1385.80 → 1386.12] Yay.
[1386.32 → 1386.88] Thumbs up.
[1387.46 → 1388.22] Thumbs up.
[1389.10 → 1389.58] Yeah.
[1389.94 → 1390.46] And a foot.
[1390.98 → 1391.34] Anyway.
[1391.98 → 1398.42] So I think something that helps the sous vide cooker is the majority of people can probably get by with just a phone alarm clock.
[1399.60 → 1400.72] And probably don't care.
[1401.28 → 1404.90] And then there's people that sleep like mountains like myself.
[1404.90 → 1415.22] I would argue that a high percentage of our audience compared to the general population would benefit from a stronger alarm clock.
[1416.50 → 1423.78] And I mean, I know these are generalizations, but they're not particularly harmful or particularly likely to be inaccurate ones.
[1424.42 → 1428.70] Gamers stay up later, I would say, than the general population.
[1428.96 → 1429.04] Yeah.
[1429.38 → 1431.56] I mean, you look at how you look at.
[1431.64 → 1434.00] I mean, it's not like I've never pulled an all-nighter gaming.
[1434.00 → 1436.10] You know how many other people are up with me?
[1436.28 → 1437.70] I'm working on planning one right now.
[1438.12 → 1438.16] Lots.
[1438.36 → 1439.00] You know how much time?
[1439.10 → 1442.58] I mean, us West Coast people up at, you know, 12 or 1.
[1442.58 → 1445.28] You can find full servers at 3 a.m. pretty easily.
[1445.32 → 1446.30] On the East Coast.
[1446.52 → 1456.72] So I'm kind of going, you either got up at 5.20, had a shower, had your breakfast, and sat down in front of your computer, or you're still up.
[1456.94 → 1457.08] Yeah.
[1457.62 → 1462.82] So, and when you tend to stay up late, you tend to be a little bit more difficult to wake up in the morning.
[1462.82 → 1472.02] I would make the argument that the gamer, like the gamer grade alarm clock, if you call it that, if you call the video gamer grade alarm clock.
[1472.22 → 1473.04] Question mark?
[1473.14 → 1474.06] Question mark?
[1474.16 → 1474.52] Ha ha.
[1474.56 → 1475.54] Is it worth it?
[1475.56 → 1476.04] Ha ha!
[1476.16 → 1477.92] Top 5 gamer grade alarm clocks.
[1477.94 → 1478.60] Holy shit!
[1478.94 → 1480.80] Which is basically what you were planning to make.
[1480.96 → 1481.18] Basically.
[1481.44 → 1481.62] Yeah.
[1481.62 → 1486.58] Well, no, I was going to do like the three stage, because they're each good, but for different reasons.
[1486.58 → 1486.84] Oh, yeah.
[1486.92 → 1487.36] No, I know.
[1487.44 → 1489.28] But, well, don't ruin it too much.
[1489.52 → 1490.62] But it'll be a good video.
[1490.68 → 1491.18] It'll be a good video.
[1491.26 → 1492.38] The one he's planning to make will be good.
[1492.40 → 1496.86] I was just curious to see what you guys thought of, like, alarm clock coverage or whatever else.
[1496.86 → 1500.48] But what's cool about the sous vide cooker is, like, different use cases that I want to apply for.
[1500.54 → 1502.82] So hopefully people click on the video before they judge it.
[1502.92 → 1504.50] So, like cleaning socks, for example.
[1504.50 → 1509.72] You can set it through your network.
[1510.40 → 1515.02] So if you, like, and it's actually, the heat that it produces is lower than boiling.
[1515.30 → 1515.54] Right.
[1515.74 → 1521.70] So if you, like, set it before you get home, you can have a like, partially prepared meal before you get home.
[1522.04 → 1534.08] Or you could set up a task scheduler on your computer and make it so that, like, oh, you have freshly cooked salmon or chicken or soup or whatever you want for when you wake up in the morning.
[1534.08 → 1535.34] It goes along with your alarm clock.
[1535.96 → 1546.76] Or, like, if you're gaming, you just put something in a Ziploc bag, drop it in there, clip it, leave for an hour and a half and play games, come back and, like, oh, wow, dinner's ready and everything's done for me.
[1546.86 → 1550.58] Like, there's use cases that I think people might not immediately realize.
[1551.72 → 1557.54] It's a way to get perfect food when you don't know how to make perfect food, which is, like, awesome.
[1558.36 → 1563.16] The reason why I wanted to buy it is I'm perfect at cooking chicken but absolutely worthless at cooking fish.
[1563.76 → 1565.26] And I wanted to be able to cook fish.
[1565.30 → 1566.54] So I was like, this thing can solve my problem.
[1566.54 → 1567.92] Yeah, you're, like, the chicken master.
[1568.10 → 1568.34] Basically.
[1568.34 → 1569.80] It's actually kind of remarkable.
[1570.60 → 1576.70] I've hardly, I hardly saw him eat anything but chicken for, like, probably a span of a year.
[1577.16 → 1580.50] It was, like, the same pack of chicken from Costco.
[1580.50 → 1588.60] And every once in a while I would end up eating it because I'd be, like, starving, or he'd, like, make too much, and then it turns out someone didn't come over or whatever.
[1589.26 → 1591.62] And I'd be like, yeah, this is good.
[1591.74 → 1592.62] This is some good chicken.
[1593.62 → 1596.74] I mean, I don't understand why you don't want a little bit more variety in your life.
[1597.20 → 1598.08] But that's fine.
[1598.22 → 1599.34] This is some good chicken.
[1599.38 → 1599.82] I'll give you that.
[1599.84 → 1602.12] It's cheaper to buy an entire trough of chicken at a time.
[1602.56 → 1607.06] And then if you buy two, you just freeze one and more than three quarters.
[1607.46 → 1610.42] And then you take two pieces of chicken and put them in the fridge.
[1610.56 → 1612.44] And you put them in the top left-hand shelf.
[1612.56 → 1622.30] And then every single time that you take one, you take the one that's on the left-hand side, move the one that's on the right over one position, take one from the freezer, put it onto the right-hand side, and then you just keep churning through.
[1622.30 → 1630.60] So what's hilarious about the system you're describing is it's actually very similar to how people who feed their dogs and cats raw diet handle it.
[1630.60 → 1635.06] So you have a deep freeze that has your – so you have a weekly delivery of raw diet.
[1635.18 → 1635.36] Yeah.
[1635.62 → 1637.32] And it's individually portioned.
[1637.32 → 1637.68] Okay?
[1637.76 → 1638.78] So you put that in the deep freeze.
[1638.80 → 1639.40] That's exactly what it is.
[1639.40 → 1640.80] You have a fridge next to the deep freeze.
[1640.90 → 1641.48] You pull that one out.
[1641.50 → 1642.20] That one's for the next day.
[1642.22 → 1644.86] You take one side of the deep freeze, and you prepare it on a daily basis.
[1645.46 → 1650.08] So basically you're saying, yeah, I came up with this great system, pet food.
[1650.88 → 1651.28] Yeah.
[1653.12 → 1653.48] Basically.
[1653.98 → 1655.30] That's actually pretty much it.
[1655.30 → 1655.60] Yeah.
[1656.34 → 1657.96] It's effective.
[1658.68 → 1659.90] It's efficient.
[1659.90 → 1661.64] It's cheap.
[1662.38 → 1663.98] It's economical, I guess I should say.
[1664.32 → 1664.76] Economical.
[1664.84 → 1666.02] Got to keep going with the E words.
[1666.20 → 1666.36] Yeah.
[1666.44 → 1668.66] Mr. Marketing Major over here.
[1670.94 → 1671.42] Yeah.
[1671.74 → 1672.66] So you know what?
[1672.68 → 1677.02] I'm going to take like four seconds, and I'm going to just double-check these connections
[1677.02 → 1678.30] here because they should be fine.
[1678.38 → 1681.70] I didn't touch them, but that's the way it is with the LAN streaming PC.
[1682.32 → 1684.12] It doesn't matter how little you touch it.
[1684.12 → 1687.12] It just is a bit of a flathead.
[1687.22 → 1688.84] Maybe it just wants you to touch it some more.
[1688.84 → 1689.24] Yeah.
[1689.46 → 1693.68] Maybe it just wants a friendly little massage there or whatever.
[1695.02 → 1695.76] All right.
[1696.98 → 1698.54] So what are we?
[1698.56 → 1699.04] So Gear VR.
[1699.56 → 1699.92] Yeah.
[1700.04 → 1701.16] This is cool.
[1703.16 → 1709.70] Gear VR is going to be used on roller coasters at Six Flags in the States, which is pretty crazy.
[1709.70 → 1712.90] So they're going to do crazy stuff like that, which is cool.
[1713.02 → 1714.54] So you could maybe go...
[1715.08 → 1718.88] What could be interesting about this is there are a couple of different ways they could do it.
[1718.94 → 1725.58] One of them could be that, okay, this whole ride is now the Jet Fighter roller coaster.
[1725.58 → 1725.94] Yeah.
[1725.94 → 1734.32] Or it could be that you're on the Jet Fighter roller coaster and your buddy beside you is on the jungle-themed fun park roller coaster.
[1735.16 → 1735.62] Yeah.
[1735.68 → 1736.42] I mean, this is...
[1736.42 → 1737.50] Because you don't necessarily have to do the same one.
[1737.72 → 1745.36] This is fascinating to me because this sort of sits in between...
[1745.36 → 1747.66] That looks like Descent level grab.
[1747.86 → 1749.30] Or like Half-Life 2.
[1749.92 → 1750.96] Half-Life 2?
[1751.60 → 1755.04] I'm thinking that's closer to Half-Life 1 than it is to 2.
[1755.26 → 1755.86] Probably, yeah.
[1756.68 → 1757.84] Wow, that's bad.
[1758.02 → 1759.58] What's fascinating about this...
[1759.58 → 1761.28] Remember, it's running on a phone.
[1761.32 → 1762.68] And you have to tap this.
[1763.58 → 1764.80] Like, okay, when I first...
[1764.80 → 1766.76] Give me a minute.
[1766.88 → 1767.34] I'll let you get there.
[1767.34 → 1767.92] Look at that lightning.
[1768.24 → 1768.98] God, it's bad.
[1768.98 → 1777.94] When I first saw this, what I was thinking was, why didn't you, like, try to embed computers and use an Oculus or a Five?
[1778.04 → 1781.10] And I'm not just saying that because I'm a computer PC fanboy.
[1781.54 → 1784.04] I know, but you're going to have to cycle out and charge phones.
[1784.38 → 1788.10] And then, like, the amount of problems you're going to have with the phones is going to be insane.
[1789.08 → 1790.62] Yeah, that's potentially valid.
[1790.62 → 1793.04] And you could remotely manage the computers.
[1793.42 → 1798.96] And then it would be a lot easier to have, like, just an IT staff making sure the computers are okay than it would be to have, like...
[1798.98 → 1800.10] Cycled out phones all the time and stuff.
[1800.10 → 1801.42] This is a low-hanging fruit, though.
[1802.02 → 1802.92] It is a low-hanging fruit.
[1803.06 → 1804.92] It also looks like ass.
[1805.08 → 1806.46] And you have to use a controller up here.
[1806.64 → 1809.80] If you used a PC, you could, like, integrate a controller into the handlebars.
[1810.14 → 1810.90] Yeah, you could.
[1810.98 → 1812.16] Again, a lot of work.
[1812.84 → 1813.48] I mean, you got to...
[1813.48 → 1814.14] It would be so much better.
[1814.58 → 1815.50] Hey, hey.
[1815.60 → 1816.50] I mean, you got to power.
[1816.62 → 1819.94] You have to power your roller coaster cars at that point.
[1819.94 → 1820.32] Yeah, I know.
[1820.32 → 1821.56] So that's a big issue.
[1822.66 → 1823.32] What's really...
[1823.32 → 1826.88] I was trying to think of, like, delivering power through the rails or something, but then that might be a safety issue.
[1827.10 → 1827.58] Oh, yeah.
[1827.78 → 1828.04] Yeah.
[1828.16 → 1828.52] Definitely.
[1828.98 → 1831.38] I mean, this is really cool.
[1831.50 → 1833.10] Like, this, to me...
[1833.10 → 1834.70] I know it's VR.
[1835.42 → 1839.28] It's VR because it's completely immersive.
[1839.54 → 1840.06] You want AR?
[1840.20 → 1849.00] But, to me, this sort of almost sits between what I would consider to be, like, VR and AR.
[1849.00 → 1862.60] If the idea is that the VR experience is going to be tied so closely to the rails that you're actually flying along and the wind that is actually coming out of your face.
[1862.60 → 1865.56] Because if you're in a jet fighter, you're not going to feel the wind.
[1865.56 → 1870.26] So, I think it's really...
[1870.26 → 1870.38] Yeah.
[1870.50 → 1871.70] Like, it's actually...
[1871.70 → 1872.38] See, I've got...
[1872.38 → 1874.14] People are already debating it in Twitch chat.
[1874.22 → 1874.98] It is VR.
[1875.54 → 1877.44] It falls within VR.
[1877.44 → 1878.38] It is very definitely VR.
[1878.38 → 1888.90] But it sits closer to the edge where it might be closer to AR than just pure VR where you're sitting in a channel thing simulated.
[1888.90 → 1891.84] Basically, all of them are a form of AR.
[1892.60 → 1892.98] Yes.
[1893.28 → 1897.04] So, like, it depends on how exact you want to be with the terminology.
[1897.22 → 1906.84] But how most people say it when they're in conversational tones is that virtual reality is with a screen completely covering your eyes and with no visual input of the outside.
[1907.10 → 1907.24] Yes.
[1907.24 → 1912.34] And augmented reality is placing images on top of what you're seeing out there.
[1912.44 → 1914.34] That's not really 100% how it works.
[1914.34 → 1926.50] And this potentially sits between because using something like the camera on the phone or whatever else, as technology like this develops, I can definitely see it sitting somewhere in between.
[1926.50 → 1937.14] Where you might have elements that are captured by the camera and motion tracked or whatever else that are injected into the virtual reality experience.
[1937.36 → 1938.92] So, really cool.
[1939.20 → 1939.92] Lots of potential.
[1940.56 → 1944.10] It looks a little bit weird right now, but...
[1944.10 → 1945.08] It looks a little bit crappy.
[1945.12 → 1945.90] Yeah, it looks a little...
[1945.90 → 1947.50] Okay, well, I was trying to be nice, okay?
[1947.88 → 1950.26] It looks kind of rubbish right now, but...
[1950.26 → 1951.12] Very cool theory, though.
[1951.18 → 1953.22] They need more power, and I'm a little bit...
[1953.22 → 1959.16] I understand that it's way easier to use the phones because there requires no change to the actual ride at all.
[1959.64 → 1959.88] Yep.
[1959.88 → 1962.46] So, they just have to figure out implementations for the phones, but, like...
[1962.46 → 1963.28] And they just have to...
[1963.28 → 1964.10] Like, they almost...
[1964.10 → 1966.22] You could almost just, like, kind of time it.
[1966.86 → 1967.22] Yeah.
[1967.72 → 1970.04] Because, yeah, roller coaster is going to be...
[1970.04 → 1972.90] Going to be predictable to within, like...
[1972.90 → 1973.98] A pretty small margin.
[1974.22 → 1974.38] Yeah.
[1974.38 → 1977.98] It won't be exactly identical every time, but it'll be a small enough margin that it won't matter.
[1978.24 → 1978.48] Yeah.
[1980.14 → 1980.54] Yeah.
[1980.62 → 1982.76] I just really wish there was more power behind them.
[1983.00 → 1986.20] And whatever that ends up being, Five, Oculus, doesn't matter.
[1986.28 → 1988.86] But I think one of those deserves to be in that position.
[1988.86 → 1990.84] And I think one of those eventually will be.
[1991.38 → 1995.10] I think having a phone powering it isn't really enough.
[1995.10 → 2003.96] At the same time, the like, cheap tricks kind of style of amusement park rides might actually be okay for phones.
[2005.20 → 2010.32] I just hope that it's good enough that people are interested in VR and then want to pursue it after they have that experience.
[2010.42 → 2010.58] Yep.
[2010.58 → 2015.26] And I hope it's not bad enough that people are like, well, that was kind of trash.
[2015.30 → 2016.66] I just want to do the normal roller coaster.
[2017.66 → 2019.80] Because if that happens, then they might not be interested in VR.
[2020.20 → 2020.50] Yeah.
[2020.50 → 2027.00] I mean, it's going to take a long time for VR acceptance to really take off.
[2027.02 → 2028.30] I don't mind it taking a long time.
[2028.36 → 2031.00] I just don't want anything to negatively impact it.
[2031.04 → 2031.26] Right.
[2031.76 → 2031.92] Yeah.
[2032.66 → 2033.34] All right.
[2033.48 → 2035.26] So here we go.
[2035.36 → 2038.72] This is an interesting article posted by C-Girl on the forum.
[2039.48 → 2042.34] And this is looking pretty unfortunate.
[2043.16 → 2046.54] France, to punish companies for refusing to decrypt devices.
[2046.54 → 2050.68] Now, to be clear, this has not passed into law yet.
[2050.90 → 2054.36] But this comes on the heels of France tightening up.
[2058.24 → 2060.22] I've got some people saying there's an echo.
[2064.06 → 2065.10] That's very strange.
[2067.94 → 2068.42] Okay.
[2068.60 → 2070.14] Well, there shouldn't be an echo now at any rate.
[2070.14 → 2079.78] So this comes on the heels of France tightening up, well, really, a lot of the anonymity and encryption laws.
[2079.88 → 2087.70] So they've recently looked into banning the anonymous network Tor and blocking Wi-Fi during special situations.
[2088.50 → 2091.26] They have the lit...
[2091.26 → 2092.16] Hold on a second.
[2093.06 → 2093.80] Go ahead.
[2094.06 → 2096.58] Make your way through this one because I need to figure out what's going on.
[2096.58 → 2101.36] This is like one of the few that I didn't read a ton.
[2102.00 → 2106.64] The latest step in security push was accepting an amendment to a bill that would make companies like Apple,
[2106.74 → 2110.00] who are actively fighting the FBI, or modifying their software to break an iPhone.
[2110.14 → 2112.90] We talked about that not even that long ago.
[2112.92 → 2114.02] To break into an iPhone.
[2114.54 → 2115.24] Yeah, sorry.
[2115.24 → 2121.34] With Mr. McAfee saying that, like, oh, I'll do it in a weekend or whatever it was that he said.
[2121.62 → 2127.00] And then coming back on that claim and then coming back on coming back on that claim and whatever the hell happened.
[2127.98 → 2130.74] But France is looking to be a little bit more aggressive about it.
[2130.84 → 2136.30] So the potential here is that they might be forced to pay a fine, which doesn't sound super horrible.
[2136.30 → 2140.88] But how many times do they have to pay that fine if they don't decrypt one device?
[2140.96 → 2141.46] Is that one?
[2141.52 → 2145.20] But if they don't decrypt $100,000, do they have to pay the fine $100,000 times?
[2145.28 → 2145.70] Who knows?
[2146.28 → 2149.38] Or face five years in jail if they refuse.
[2149.50 → 2150.94] Now, who would face five years in jail?
[2151.32 → 2155.22] I don't think that's extremely clear, but this isn't exactly a thing yet.
[2155.22 → 2156.46] So that's probably fine.
[2158.24 → 2161.98] They're only in the stage of, like, the bill's first reading.
[2161.98 → 2168.90] So this is pretty early on, but maybe people in France should start trying to stop this from happening.
[2169.26 → 2172.80] I would hate to see this be the beginning of terribleness.
[2174.08 → 2174.20] Echo?
[2174.34 → 2175.02] There was no echo.
[2175.32 → 2175.56] Yeah.
[2175.70 → 2176.88] And I didn't change anything.
[2177.02 → 2180.48] I think people started to troll because a bunch of people were also saying there is no echo.
[2181.70 → 2182.12] Ah.
[2182.78 → 2184.14] It could have also been a Twitch issue.
[2184.68 → 2185.14] Or that.
[2186.00 → 2189.80] I mean, let's face it.
[2189.80 → 2192.24] It's not completely an impossibility.
[2192.76 → 2193.10] True.
[2194.24 → 2195.54] So, oh, wait.
[2195.62 → 2196.36] I still have the...
[2196.36 → 2196.90] Oh, crap.
[2196.96 → 2198.86] I forgot to change back to...
[2198.86 → 2199.24] All right.
[2199.24 → 2199.76] So, anyway...
[2199.76 → 2205.64] Another side effect of this might be that companies might not be super happy about doing any amount of business in France.
[2205.64 → 2213.30] Because if jail time and fines are hanging over their heads, if they don't, like, sacrifice their customers' privacy, that might be an issue.
[2213.62 → 2213.84] Yeah.
[2213.92 → 2215.88] I could see just pulling out of France entirely.
[2216.10 → 2216.56] I mean...
[2216.56 → 2219.68] And the thing is, like, who was it that said this?
[2219.72 → 2223.38] Was it Apple or someone else who was basically, like...
[2223.38 → 2224.36] You're leaning away from the mic.
[2224.36 → 2224.52] Sorry.
[2224.68 → 2233.92] If we made this software, or we made this version of an operating system that decrypted everything, you would be able to use that on more than just one phone.
[2233.92 → 2247.68] So, that's scary, too, because if France holds this above people like Apple, then Apple does make that version of the operating system that could easily go to someone else, like the States or whatever other country.
[2248.08 → 2250.50] Because they kind of work together and stuff.
[2251.26 → 2252.06] Not fun.
[2252.06 → 2253.06] Yeah.
[2253.06 → 2254.06] Yeah.
[2254.06 → 2255.06] Yeah.
[2255.06 → 2255.40] Yeah.
[2255.40 → 2258.72] I don't know what the issue is with that, with the capture card.
[2258.72 → 2264.96] But I'm sorry, guys, there is nothing I can do about that other than stopping the stream, diagnosing it, which will be very difficult.
[2264.96 → 2265.54] Is it still a problem?
[2265.54 → 2266.46] No, there's no echo.
[2267.60 → 2269.94] The flicker, there's really nothing I can do about it, though.
[2270.26 → 2270.46] Yes.
[2270.46 → 2277.16] Speaking of flickering, we've got our sponsors.
[2278.26 → 2281.70] Squarespace is the place to go if you feel like...
[2282.52 → 2283.08] You should.
[2283.20 → 2292.30] Build a website, one that is designed for people who want to learn about you or learn about the company that you run or the product you make.
[2292.30 → 2305.00] And whether you want to just simplify your life a little bit in terms of managing the website or whether you want to just keep your website online more often...
[2305.00 → 2305.34] You should.
[2305.44 → 2309.06] ...consider trying Squarespace because they really do make it easy.
[2309.16 → 2311.00] They've got 24-7 tech support.
[2311.34 → 2313.14] It starts at only $8 a month.
[2313.24 → 2314.82] It features responsive design.
[2314.82 → 2321.82] So whether you want to run it on your desktop, your laptop, your mobile phone, or whatever the case may be...
[2321.82 → 2322.84] You should.
[2323.08 → 2327.22] Start a trial with no credit card required and start building your website today.
[2327.64 → 2331.64] And by the way, if you do decide to go ahead and buy Squarespace...
[2331.64 → 2331.98] You should.
[2332.14 → 2336.30] ...use our offer code, which is Linus, to get 10% off your first purchase.
[2336.42 → 2337.76] Okay, I just thought about this.
[2338.04 → 2338.36] Mm-hmm.
[2338.36 → 2345.70] But Squarespace, if they wanted to make like a thrift version of their product...
[2345.70 → 2346.06] Uh-huh.
[2346.16 → 2346.86] If they wanted to do that.
[2346.86 → 2347.98] I don't know what that would be.
[2348.34 → 2349.96] Maybe it's only like a few potential skins.
[2349.96 → 2350.76] Triangle space.
[2351.72 → 2352.60] Line space.
[2352.80 → 2353.46] Spare space.
[2353.64 → 2354.36] Spare space.
[2354.60 → 2360.88] Because you almost screwed up the word and said spare instead of square, but it actually totally would make sense.
[2360.98 → 2361.66] Spare space.
[2361.74 → 2362.40] Spare space.
[2362.40 → 2364.40] It sounds like a cloud storage service.
[2364.90 → 2366.58] Oh, it totally kind of does.
[2366.96 → 2367.32] Yeah.
[2367.32 → 2367.40] Yeah.
[2368.24 → 2374.44] So like if they wanted to make it so that like with your Squarespace account, you get a certain amount of storage that goes along with it.
[2375.22 → 2375.62] Yeah.
[2375.80 → 2378.98] Like you get a website, and you get backup for your business.
[2379.14 → 2379.54] Yeah.
[2379.70 → 2380.78] They could call it spare space.
[2380.88 → 2381.48] Spare space.
[2381.88 → 2382.44] Spare space.
[2382.78 → 2384.88] Spare space.com slash Linus.
[2385.30 → 2385.80] Don't go there.
[2385.84 → 2386.66] I don't know what that is.
[2387.04 → 2387.38] No.
[2388.90 → 2389.60] Probably not.
[2390.84 → 2391.64] Tunnel Bear.
[2391.80 → 2395.02] Tunnel Bear is the easy-to-use VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[2395.24 → 2396.96] The Tunnel Bear VPN lets you tunnel...
[2396.96 → 2397.30] Spare Bear.
[2397.64 → 2400.08] To 20 different countries.
[2400.18 → 2402.56] Allowing you to browse the internet and use online services.
[2402.56 → 2409.06] Whether it's managing your website or whether it's, you know, doing accounting for your small business.
[2409.06 → 2410.68] Whatever the case may be.
[2410.98 → 2412.86] As though you're in a different country.
[2413.04 → 2416.56] They've got easy to use apps for iOS, Android, PC, and Mac.
[2416.66 → 2418.46] They also have a Chrome extension.
[2418.46 → 2420.82] You just select a country in the app.
[2420.82 → 2424.68] And it actually, like, it really is designed to be so easy my grandma can do it.
[2424.80 → 2430.22] Because once it's installed, it actually looks like a physical button.
[2430.46 → 2430.62] Yeah.
[2430.88 → 2433.86] And you just turn the button from on to off or vice versa.
[2433.86 → 2434.36] Whee!
[2434.36 → 2434.86] Yay!
[2434.86 → 2435.36] Yay!
[2435.36 → 2435.86] It worked!
[2435.86 → 2440.10] So your connection gets encrypted at that point and your public IP address gets switched.
[2440.10 → 2443.20] So you show up as if you're coming from somewhere else.
[2443.20 → 2449.40] And Tunnel Bear lets you bypass, speaking of being easy to use, all the annoying details that typically come with a VPN for personal use.
[2449.48 → 2453.06] So port configurations, DNS, or other nonsense like that.
[2453.12 → 2456.56] They've got a top-rated privacy policy, and they do not log user activity.
[2456.56 → 2465.78] So you can try out Tunnel Bear for free with 500 legs of free data with no credit card required over at TunnelBear.com slash when.
[2466.26 → 2473.28] And speaking of, say for example, you were doing your, you know, small business work or whatever else totally anonymously.
[2473.40 → 2477.96] Although I don't really see the point because you're, like, probably...
[2477.96 → 2478.76] Well, I'm...
[2478.76 → 2478.96] Hmm.
[2480.34 → 2484.80] Any benefit to having that encrypted in flight?
[2485.26 → 2485.74] Not really.
[2485.74 → 2486.14] Yeah.
[2486.30 → 2486.72] I don't know.
[2486.86 → 2489.14] Like your small business, you know, receipts.
[2489.76 → 2490.04] Yeah.
[2490.42 → 2490.72] Yeah.
[2490.84 → 2491.58] Well, anyway.
[2491.86 → 2494.26] Because maybe there's a trick to your trade.
[2494.34 → 2500.74] Like my mom, when she was a dog groomer, would buy a specific type of soap and then mix it with water to...
[2501.44 → 2508.30] Because it wasn't actually initially intended for dogs, and she would dilute it, and then it was actually perfect and people really liked it.
[2508.54 → 2510.74] They loved the smell of the dogs when they left the dog grooming shop.
[2511.02 → 2512.84] But that was, like, her trick of the trade.
[2512.94 → 2513.90] So she didn't want to tell anybody.
[2513.90 → 2515.14] Secret sauce, so to speak.
[2515.14 → 2515.72] Yes, exactly.
[2516.14 → 2519.10] So maybe you don't want people to know your secret sauce.
[2519.10 → 2523.06] Or specifically if you're doing cooking stuff, maybe you don't want people to know exactly what's in your...
[2523.06 → 2526.44] I don't know how many dog groomers engage in the kind of corporate espionage that's...
[2526.44 → 2527.24] Who knows, man?
[2527.28 → 2527.90] Who knows?
[2528.22 → 2528.60] Anyway...
[2528.60 → 2530.16] Like, cutthroat field.
[2530.56 → 2535.98] FreshBooks is the easy-to-use invoicing software that helps small businesses look professional and get paid faster.
[2536.06 → 2541.60] So whether we're talking dog grooming business or plumbing or, you know, dance...
[2541.60 → 2542.38] Like who's plumbing, man?
[2542.38 → 2544.38] Dance classes or...
[2544.38 → 2544.76] Yeah.
[2544.76 → 2547.38] I'm just trying to think of other things your parents have done.
[2548.56 → 2550.30] Bag making, clothing making...
[2551.30 → 2551.46] Oh, yeah.
[2551.64 → 2553.06] E-cigarette holder making.
[2553.06 → 2556.44] Knick-knack, building and selling.
[2557.78 → 2559.48] I'm probably missing things.
[2559.64 → 2561.18] I'm sure they've done more.
[2561.18 → 2567.62] Buying, like, discarded stuff and, like, crafting it into something decorative and reselling that.
[2568.02 → 2572.50] So whatever your small business happens to be, FreshBooks makes it easy to manage.
[2572.60 → 2573.76] You can track your expenses.
[2574.08 → 2575.14] You can create invoices.
[2575.32 → 2576.32] You can bill customers.
[2576.50 → 2580.10] You can see that they saw your bill, and they can pay you right through FreshBooks.
[2580.10 → 2591.30] You can take deposits, and it's all done through a mobile app that enables you to spend your time running your business instead of doing accounting, which is a total drag.
[2591.60 → 2597.96] So visit freshbooks.com slash when and enter when in how did you hear about us section when you sign up for the free trial.
[2598.06 → 2599.76] Oh, and they just got a mobile card reader.
[2600.16 → 2602.30] So now you can take credit cards in person.
[2602.62 → 2603.20] That's pretty cool.
[2603.98 → 2604.66] Pretty cool.
[2605.36 → 2605.70] Yeah.
[2606.26 → 2606.68] All right.
[2606.74 → 2608.50] Let's move on to our next topic here.
[2608.50 → 2610.28] The Manu's VR Gloves.
[2610.38 → 2612.20] This was posted by Pigswill.
[2613.28 → 2614.30] Pigswill on the forum.
[2614.34 → 2614.78] Anyway, whatever.
[2614.90 → 2616.94] The original article is from Gadget.
[2617.86 → 2622.50] Use your fingers to play in Five's world with the Manu's VR Glove.
[2623.24 → 2625.32] Goes on sale this year for $250.
[2626.10 → 2626.98] So have you looked at this thing?
[2627.06 → 2636.84] And my friends, my friends, if you thought that the VR headset was unreasonable and expensive
[2636.84 → 2648.06] and gonna break the bank, let me tell you, friend, let me tell you, friend, that is nothing compared to all the accessories.
[2648.72 → 2650.26] You thought Wii was bad.
[2650.66 → 2651.06] Yeah.
[2651.22 → 2652.26] Just wait, man.
[2652.68 → 2653.62] Just wait.
[2653.62 → 2655.82] So this picture is a little bit misleading.
[2657.44 → 2660.00] Now, if I can point with your mouse.
[2661.08 → 2663.36] Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out what the crap people are talking about.
[2663.48 → 2663.80] Okay.
[2664.76 → 2666.24] So I'm gonna point with your mouse.
[2666.24 → 2672.42] So this area right here shows like a little strap thing and then another strap thing.
[2672.58 → 2675.70] But there's nothing under them, which is why this picture is misleading.
[2676.14 → 2681.52] If you scroll down, and we watch this video and then mute it right away and then jump forward,
[2682.08 → 2685.10] you'll see that there is stuff under the strap things.
[2685.26 → 2693.46] And if I pause right here, there, you can see right here there's a big thing coming off of his arm.
[2693.46 → 2700.30] And right here, there's a big thing coming off of his arm.
[2700.70 → 2707.44] Those straps are so that you can strap in the entire Five controller.
[2708.62 → 2713.84] Each one of your back, the tops of your forearms has to have the entire controller straps to it.
[2714.84 → 2716.76] So, yeah.
[2717.66 → 2718.74] Pretty cool.
[2718.74 → 2723.54] But I still think it needs to go a little bit further.
[2723.90 → 2725.50] Because I don't know about having like...
[2725.50 → 2729.86] And in there, it shows the original ones.
[2730.54 → 2734.18] Now, they're actually bigger and have the big ring and all that kind of stuff.
[2734.40 → 2738.72] So they're going to be even a little bit more cumbersome to have strapped to the back of your wrist.
[2738.72 → 2744.94] And in order to have gloves in VR with this setup at 200 and whatever dollars,
[2745.02 → 2746.94] you still need to use the included controllers.
[2747.38 → 2748.06] They're not a replacement.
[2748.56 → 2748.92] Right.
[2749.38 → 2751.60] And they have to be strapped like to your wrist.
[2751.72 → 2753.54] Like you can't like to have them on your hips or anything.
[2753.72 → 2754.98] At least as far as I can tell.
[2755.78 → 2757.48] So, yeah.
[2757.64 → 2759.38] And they show you playing Surgeon Simulator.
[2759.76 → 2762.66] And he has a few times when he's trying to pick something up.
[2762.78 → 2765.24] That being said, the controls in Surgeon Simulator aren't like amazing.
[2765.46 → 2765.74] Right.
[2765.74 → 2767.58] That might actually be the problem, not the gloves.
[2768.18 → 2773.54] And another thing that I thought of was I was trying to think about my experience with the touch controller,
[2773.64 → 2775.90] the Oculus touch controller, and compare it to this.
[2775.98 → 2780.24] One of my frustrations with the touch controller was especially when you're not holding anything,
[2781.06 → 2783.10] having the touch controller in your hand is weird.
[2783.50 → 2786.58] Because you're in the game, you're not holding anything, and you're in real life, and you are holding something.
[2787.16 → 2790.90] And when you go to pick something up, you pick it up with like a couple of your fingers, not all of them,
[2790.96 → 2793.06] because you still have to have the controller in your hands.
[2793.06 → 2799.02] So that's a little weird, because you're constantly holding this thing that you're not actually holding in the game.
[2799.22 → 2800.78] These have the opposite problem.
[2801.10 → 2804.94] When you're not holding anything, they're going to be great, because you're not holding anything.
[2805.34 → 2805.66] Right.
[2805.90 → 2807.78] Virtually or in reality, and that's awesome.
[2807.78 → 2814.24] But the second you go to pick something up, you're now holding an invisible object that doesn't have weight, texture, or feeling at all.
[2814.66 → 2817.16] And you're swinging a sword, and there's nothing in your hand.
[2817.44 → 2820.34] What was really nice about the touch controllers was when I was holding a gun,
[2820.80 → 2825.42] I was holding something that felt like a handle and pulling a trigger, which was cool.
[2826.08 → 2830.60] But then they felt really Derby when I was kind of picking something up or not holding something.
[2830.60 → 2832.56] So they each have their own strength.
[2834.12 → 2836.20] And yeah, I don't know about that.
[2837.22 → 2841.98] I think a cool combination would be like a touch style controller that has triggers and whatnot,
[2842.20 → 2844.64] that you could like holster and gloves.
[2845.22 → 2845.70] Right.
[2846.08 → 2851.24] So it has like really, really, perfect input for your hands, but then you can also hold something.
[2851.64 → 2855.68] And just a game focused around like you always pick stuff up off your holster or whatever.
[2855.68 → 2860.58] And I'm sure we're going to have to wait for something like that.
[2860.72 → 2863.90] Yeah, and I don't want the freaking controller strapped on my wrist because that's ridiculous.
[2864.16 → 2864.42] Right.
[2865.16 → 2869.02] So it's cool, but I don't know.
[2871.38 → 2872.16] Chat's hilarious.
[2872.38 → 2874.34] It's like, what do you guys want me to do?
[2874.56 → 2876.36] You guys troll me half the time.
[2876.48 → 2877.58] I literally checked.
[2877.74 → 2878.92] I watched the stream.
[2879.52 → 2880.66] There was not an echo.
[2883.38 → 2883.86] So...
[2883.86 → 2884.38] Yeah.
[2884.38 → 2886.64] So I don't really know what to tell you.
[2886.68 → 2888.08] And yes, I'm aware of the flicker.
[2888.32 → 2890.84] As we've said before, we should just ban the word flicker.
[2890.98 → 2891.38] I know.
[2891.48 → 2892.60] I know there's a flicker.
[2892.74 → 2894.08] There's literally nothing I can do.
[2894.12 → 2895.84] It probably requires like a restart or something.
[2895.94 → 2898.98] It's probably the capture card being deep or something.
[2899.20 → 2900.48] Capture card of the camera, I think.
[2900.54 → 2901.52] I don't think it's the computer.
[2901.78 → 2902.34] Yeah, I don't think...
[2902.34 → 2905.06] No, it's nothing to do with the computer because we're not dropping any frames or anything like that.
[2905.06 → 2906.22] So it is what it is.
[2906.46 → 2907.64] And there you go.
[2907.74 → 2907.96] Unread?
[2908.98 → 2909.70] All right.
[2909.90 → 2912.72] So let's go ahead and yeah, let's move on to our next topic here.
[2912.72 → 2918.48] Building Living Breathing Supercomputers.
[2918.48 → 2921.22] This is posted by Tyrolean on the forum.
[2921.82 → 2925.22] Original article here is from McGill.ca.
[2925.94 → 2927.30] So that's McGill University.
[2928.44 → 2928.80] Awesome.
[2930.74 → 2931.34] All right.
[2931.38 → 2932.08] I didn't notice that.
[2932.32 → 2932.76] Go McGill.
[2933.56 → 2934.12] Yeah, dog.
[2934.12 → 2936.10] Take out those SSD servers in the racks.
[2936.10 → 2938.90] So sexy.
[2939.86 → 2946.52] Discovery opens doors to the creation of biological supercomputers that are about the size of a book.
[2947.62 → 2948.98] Pretty freaking cool.
[2949.14 → 2951.98] Substance that provides energy to all the cells in our bodies.
[2951.98 → 2954.60] From a reliable source, there is echo when he's screen sharing.
[2954.60 → 2959.28] For the first 20 seconds and then it stops.
[2959.60 → 2961.44] For the first 20 seconds-is and then it stops.
[2961.88 → 2962.94] Which makes no sense.
[2962.98 → 2963.46] No, it doesn't.
[2963.50 → 2967.02] And isn't really something that I can do anything about.
[2967.28 → 2969.08] I think part of the problem might be that...
[2969.08 → 2970.72] Like, I've got this computer muted, actually.
[2970.88 → 2971.54] Thanks, Dirt Breakers.
[2971.68 → 2973.36] Like, you can actually see...
[2974.04 → 2975.90] So it's something glitching out.
[2976.04 → 2978.64] You can see in the bottom corner, this is actually muted.
[2978.80 → 2979.30] It is muted.
[2979.30 → 2983.24] So there's literally nothing that I am doing here that is a thing.
[2983.86 → 2984.30] So...
[2984.30 → 2987.18] It shouldn't be.
[2987.48 → 2989.70] With that said, it may also be related to the flicker.
[2989.70 → 2991.10] And it is very, very subtle.
[2992.14 → 2993.92] So life goes on.
[2994.14 → 2995.10] We are finishing the show.
[2995.34 → 2995.56] Yes.
[2997.28 → 3000.04] Okay, so what else have we got for notes on this one?
[3000.16 → 3003.22] So it relies on adenosine triphosphate, ATP.
[3003.50 → 3005.44] Same thing that provides energy to cells in our bodies.
[3006.12 → 3008.54] And it's an international team of researchers.
[3008.54 → 3013.74] They published an article on the subject earlier this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
[3014.38 → 3018.54] So they're describing a model of biological computer that they have made.
[3018.78 → 3024.90] It's able to process information very quickly and accurately using parallel networks in the same way that large supercomputers do.
[3025.12 → 3026.54] It's largely a proof of concept.
[3027.58 → 3031.38] They've managed to create a very complex network in a very small area, which is sweet.
[3031.38 → 3038.32] And it's kind of like a first step in showing how a biological supercomputer could work.
[3038.84 → 3039.52] But it's...
[3039.52 → 3041.28] Yeah, it's a proof of concept.
[3042.18 → 3045.22] It's very cool, but it's not, like, really a thing yet.
[3045.22 → 3047.90] I don't know what to do about twist shot.
[3047.98 → 3048.74] They're like, you fixed it.
[3049.24 → 3049.86] I did nothing.
[3050.50 → 3051.78] I literally did nothing.
[3052.06 → 3052.20] Yeah.
[3052.28 → 3054.20] So I think it's to do with the flicker.
[3054.34 → 3055.34] I think the camera...
[3055.34 → 3055.42] Probably.
[3055.42 → 3059.62] I think it's probably the camera based on that the flicker seems to be related to the echo.
[3059.62 → 3062.38] And this camera, like, not even way too long ago, didn't it, like, overheat or something?
[3062.60 → 3063.34] No, I don't...
[3063.34 → 3063.78] Well, maybe.
[3063.96 → 3064.84] 50% chance.
[3064.98 → 3067.98] One of them did, but that was, like, once, like, over a year ago.
[3068.06 → 3068.42] So I don't know.
[3068.42 → 3070.96] Oh, no, I thought, like, a few months ago it overheated or something.
[3071.12 → 3071.24] Okay.
[3071.50 → 3071.86] Okay.
[3072.16 → 3073.08] So this is cool.
[3073.62 → 3078.70] You know all those videos I've been doing with Unpaid, where we've been, like, seven gamers,
[3079.02 → 3088.50] gaming NAS, some of the stuff I've shown off with their dual parity, where you can build
[3088.50 → 3092.58] your array, and you can have two parity drives with all the usual benefits of Unpaid.
[3092.58 → 3098.50] Like, for example, even if you were to lose three or four drives in a dual parity setup,
[3098.60 → 3102.50] all the data that's on the remaining drives is actually still there.
[3102.58 → 3103.88] So there's a lot of really cool stuff about it.
[3103.92 → 3106.58] They have finally released...
[3106.58 → 3107.26] DA-da-da-da!
[3107.76 → 3109.88] The 6.2 public beta.
[3110.28 → 3117.64] So all the content that I've done on Unpaid has actually been using pre-beta, like, pre-release
[3117.64 → 3121.98] builds of 6.2 beta since the very start.
[3121.98 → 3126.48] So a lot of the stuff that I've shown, I've had people ask me, like, oh, where's that
[3126.48 → 3128.32] feature, or where's that menu or whatever else?
[3128.92 → 3130.46] It is finally available.
[3130.74 → 3134.24] So if you guys want to try it out, then that is the time to do it.
[3134.26 → 3135.72] People keep telling us to turn off the mic.
[3135.92 → 3138.94] To my knowledge, you cannot turn off the mic on the Black magic Cinema camera.
[3139.10 → 3140.12] Thank you for the suggestion.
[3141.20 → 3142.98] We're done with that conversation now.
[3146.26 → 3147.68] Yeah, I guess that's pretty much it.
[3147.74 → 3151.28] They increased the device limits for the trial, which is pretty cool.
[3151.28 → 3152.52] So you're no longer limited.
[3152.96 → 3153.86] Because, like, that's one of the things.
[3153.96 → 3158.80] I even told them, I was like, why would you have a three device or five device limits or
[3158.80 → 3160.02] whatever it is on your trial?
[3160.14 → 3163.88] Because if I'm running a trial of the software, I want to know if it works.
[3164.26 → 3168.30] And if I have eight drives, then I need to know if eight drives are going to work okay.
[3168.96 → 3170.12] So they increased that.
[3170.20 → 3171.60] They added dual parity support.
[3171.78 → 3173.08] It now has a GUI boot mode.
[3173.08 → 3175.40] So it doesn't only boot to command line.
[3175.54 → 3181.14] So you can actually sit in front of that computer and access the web browser and the web GUI without
[3181.14 → 3183.20] necessarily navigating to it over the network.
[3183.36 → 3187.82] It makes it much easier to diagnose something like a bad network card.
[3187.94 → 3188.10] Yeah.
[3188.50 → 3194.24] Or if Unpaid grabs one of your NIC's and not the other one, and you're trying to find it by
[3194.24 → 3196.68] host name, it's not always the most reliable thing.
[3196.78 → 3197.66] So that's really nice.
[3197.66 → 3200.34] They've made some improvements to Docker.
[3201.22 → 3205.36] So if you're not familiar with it, Docker's not unique to Unpaid, but it allows you to
[3205.36 → 3212.28] run these Docker applications within walled gardens within your operating system, so they
[3212.28 → 3213.68] can't really brick anything else.
[3213.88 → 3215.80] It's better than the old plug-in system.
[3216.78 → 3218.36] Major upgrades to VMs.
[3218.42 → 3220.18] That's like half of the release notes.
[3220.24 → 3222.00] And general storage performance improvements.
[3222.16 → 3226.84] Not to mention that it now, I don't know if they've actually got this in the release notes.
[3226.84 → 3229.44] No, it's not in the release notes, but it has NVMe support.
[3229.84 → 3230.24] Oh, nice.
[3230.42 → 3237.56] So I will be docking around with that, and that will be pretty freaking cool.
[3239.26 → 3240.14] I'm excited.
[3241.18 → 3242.16] What else we got?
[3243.66 → 3244.80] Oh, okay.
[3244.98 → 3245.74] Well, this is good.
[3246.20 → 3250.70] One World Computing, OWN, has finally released an SSD.
[3250.84 → 3252.02] No, this is a thing.
[3252.02 → 3259.10] When I was trying to upgrade an SSD in some Apple thing at some point, and I was blown
[3259.10 → 3263.52] away by the fact that you just couldn't get an SSD.
[3264.22 → 3269.80] So there's finally an upgrade for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air PCI Express SSDs that doesn't
[3269.80 → 3271.78] cost as much as a laptop.
[3272.34 → 3272.94] That's ridiculous.
[3272.94 → 3280.24] So it's $347.99 for the 480 gig drive, and $597.99 for the 960 gig drive, which is still
[3280.24 → 3285.78] very expensive, and doesn't include everything that's included in the upgrade kit.
[3288.58 → 3293.08] But now you can actually get capacities that look like they're greater than what it can
[3293.08 → 3294.32] be configured with from Apple.
[3294.44 → 3297.32] So the MacBook Air can be configured with up to 512 gigs.
[3297.32 → 3300.42] Now you can have 960 gigs and a MacBook Air.
[3300.54 → 3304.16] If you want a MacBook Air, that's worth like $3,500 by that point?
[3304.26 → 3304.82] $3,000?
[3305.40 → 3306.16] I don't know.
[3306.26 → 3312.82] The Canadian rupee has made it very difficult for me to deal with pricing stuff.
[3313.04 → 3313.34] Yeah.
[3314.02 → 3314.84] With anything.
[3315.22 → 3315.42] God.
[3315.76 → 3318.02] Like, living is really expensive right now.
[3318.18 → 3318.42] Yeah.
[3318.62 → 3320.00] Everything has gotten more expensive.
[3320.20 → 3322.86] Fresh fruit, whatever else the case may be.
[3323.18 → 3323.32] Yeah.
[3323.44 → 3325.24] Fresh fruit is like...
[3325.24 → 3326.34] I love people's theories.
[3326.34 → 3328.96] It's his phone headset, which is plugged in.
[3336.48 → 3339.10] It's like, basically, undoubtedly, the camera.
[3339.36 → 3339.52] Yeah.
[3339.58 → 3343.86] I think it's the camera resetting, and it's probably turning the mic on and or off, or glitching
[3343.86 → 3344.50] it out or something.
[3344.88 → 3346.00] I know what it is.
[3346.00 → 3350.14] I've got a couple of guys from my stream that are messaging me.
[3350.32 → 3350.48] Yeah.
[3350.48 → 3356.12] And, like, apparently, the camera will start losing focus right before it goes black.
[3356.22 → 3356.34] Yeah.
[3356.34 → 3358.10] And then there's audio issues close to that.
[3358.18 → 3359.38] So, like, it's all...
[3359.38 → 3363.06] We're getting it down, but, like, don't worry about it for this stream.
[3363.26 → 3364.00] We'll figure it out later.
[3364.10 → 3365.56] There's something going on with the camera itself.
[3365.72 → 3367.20] So, this is pretty crazy.
[3367.32 → 3369.68] This was posted by Aluminum Tech on the Forum.
[3369.68 → 3370.20] Thanks, Martin Tech.
[3370.66 → 3370.94] Sorry?
[3371.32 → 3372.56] I just said thanks to one of the guys.
[3372.56 → 3373.34] Oh, okay.
[3373.60 → 3374.84] Aluminum Tech on the Forum.
[3375.02 → 3383.84] OnePlus apparently paid $300,000 to get their phones into House of Cards.
[3385.08 → 3385.76] Wow.
[3386.34 → 3391.02] I mean, I knew that product placement deals were worth a lot of money.
[3392.14 → 3394.56] We've never gotten a deal...
[3395.72 → 3396.80] Like, I don't actually...
[3396.80 → 3397.58] Have you done product placement?
[3397.80 → 3399.36] We've done a couple of things.
[3399.36 → 3402.56] So, we've done using laptops on WAN Show.
[3403.16 → 3403.44] Okay.
[3403.86 → 3404.56] We've done...
[3404.56 → 3405.56] But that also had a banner.
[3406.10 → 3407.74] Yeah, but it also had a banner.
[3407.88 → 3412.30] I don't think we've ever done just a pure product placement deal.
[3412.60 → 3418.16] Every product placement deal we've done has also been a very blatant sponsorship at the same time.
[3418.16 → 3418.76] That's true.
[3418.76 → 3418.98] As far as I know.
[3419.20 → 3423.38] Because, like, brand for Scrapyard Wars was very clear.
[3423.54 → 3424.22] There was brand integration.
[3424.22 → 3427.34] This episode of Scrapyard Wars brought to you by brand.
[3427.34 → 3429.58] And we happened to be using brand stuff.
[3429.72 → 3429.92] Yes.
[3430.16 → 3431.24] Like, yeah.
[3432.14 → 3432.54] Yeah.
[3432.64 → 3438.96] So, I mean, I knew on some level that product placement was big business.
[3439.40 → 3444.36] I had no idea it could be worth, like, well deep into six figures.
[3444.48 → 3445.90] That is freaking incredible.
[3446.64 → 3447.54] You know what kind of...
[3447.54 → 3449.54] Although, like, if you look at the Jurassic Park...
[3450.54 → 3451.80] Did you watch Jurassic Park?
[3451.90 → 3452.50] Or Jurassic World?
[3452.50 → 3453.16] I never did.
[3453.28 → 3454.10] I need to see it.
[3454.48 → 3455.14] Oh, man.
[3455.22 → 3456.04] There's some, like...
[3456.04 → 3457.58] That's some of the most blatant...
[3457.58 → 3458.68] Worse than Transformers?
[3459.48 → 3460.92] I don't really watch Transformers.
[3461.36 → 3462.38] Did you see the first one, even?
[3463.56 → 3464.54] I think it...
[3464.54 → 3465.54] I remember...
[3466.16 → 3471.22] I've seen the first one, and I think I remember being surprised by the stuff in the first one.
[3471.22 → 3475.76] But, like, Jurassic World was probably the most aggressive brand integration I've ever seen.
[3475.94 → 3476.74] Did you see...
[3476.74 → 3479.08] Like, buildings named after companies, like...
[3479.08 → 3479.28] Oh, really?
[3479.40 → 3479.60] Yeah.
[3479.72 → 3479.84] Oh.
[3479.94 → 3480.06] Yeah.
[3480.24 → 3481.90] Did you see Hotel Transylvania 2?
[3482.60 → 3482.90] No.
[3483.34 → 3483.90] Oh, okay.
[3483.90 → 3488.98] The Sony Xperia phone product placement is kind of hilarious.
[3490.18 → 3493.28] Do they, like, make it funny, or...
[3493.28 → 3495.52] It was pretty well done.
[3495.68 → 3495.94] Okay.
[3496.14 → 3499.36] Like, Dracula does not know how to use phone.
[3499.58 → 3499.66] Yeah.
[3500.32 → 3502.70] Like, they do an okay job of it.
[3502.70 → 3503.32] Like, that's cool.
[3503.62 → 3505.60] The Jurassic World stuff was, like...
[3505.60 → 3509.92] Like, I think if I remember correctly, it was Mercedes is one of their sponsors.
[3510.46 → 3513.50] And, like, one time, like, a Mercedes car is, like, bursting through something.
[3513.50 → 3515.20] And, like, everything's dirty and exploding.
[3515.28 → 3517.66] But you can see the logo, like, nice and shiny right in the middle.
[3517.78 → 3518.66] Like, it's...
[3518.66 → 3520.46] It's pretty rough.
[3520.82 → 3521.02] Right.
[3521.12 → 3522.56] Like, here, let me see if there's...
[3522.56 → 3523.50] There's probably...
[3527.50 → 3531.32] I remember, like, constantly throughout the whole movie, I was just like, wow.
[3531.44 → 3532.32] Yeah, it looks like Mercedes.
[3533.32 → 3538.66] So, they're not the only Chinese company to put product placements in U.S. TV shows and movies.
[3539.06 → 3541.66] Opp partnered with America's Next Top Model last year.
[3541.66 → 3544.32] Vivo Electronics put the X5 Pro in the Martian.
[3544.70 → 3552.66] But the thing that really baffles me about OnePlus doing this is that I thought OnePlus's whole shtick...
[3553.14 → 3553.52] Oh, wow.
[3553.54 → 3553.96] That's awful.
[3554.68 → 3565.62] I thought OnePlus's whole shtick was we save money on marketing and PR costs and pass that to the user.
[3565.62 → 3568.46] I thought that was the whole point.
[3570.46 → 3570.90] Interesting.
[3571.06 → 3577.28] Wasn't it supposed to be, like, oh, we run really lean so that we can provide you with the best phone at the lowest price?
[3577.48 → 3583.46] I mean, it's pretty obvious, based on the OnePlus 2, that that didn't happen the second time around.
[3583.78 → 3584.74] Well, now we know why.
[3584.94 → 3589.02] Because they went, okay, we're only going to get as big as we can get without marketing.
[3589.54 → 3590.94] Marketing works.
[3590.94 → 3592.68] Whether you like it or not.
[3592.86 → 3595.32] So that's, like, I'm willing to bet.
[3595.48 → 3597.48] Actually, I don't know if I can give them credit for this.
[3597.54 → 3598.42] I'm not sure if they're that organized.
[3598.66 → 3607.46] But I'm willing to bet that someone, somewhere within OnePlus had a concept that went, okay, your aggressive loss-leader.
[3608.04 → 3610.18] You gain the mind share amongst the enthusiasts.
[3610.30 → 3611.46] They recommend it to their friends.
[3611.60 → 3613.10] Okay, people have heard of OnePlus.
[3613.32 → 3613.94] That's step one.
[3614.04 → 3614.98] Brand recognition.
[3615.72 → 3617.18] Then you reinforce.
[3617.18 → 3617.36] You reinforce.
[3618.52 → 3619.36] You reinforce.
[3619.58 → 3619.94] You reinforce.
[3620.14 → 3621.12] You have to actually market.
[3621.68 → 3626.10] And you have to make some margin on the product in order to make that happen.
[3627.04 → 3629.02] So there you go.
[3629.14 → 3629.66] That happened.
[3629.84 → 3633.32] Another thing that happened, this was posted by Commandman7 on the forum.
[3633.46 → 3634.84] Original article here is from Kodak.
[3635.92 → 3637.06] This is a super bummer.
[3637.40 → 3644.54] Microsoft cancels Fable Legends, which is, like, kind of drag just from, like, a technical standpoint.
[3644.54 → 3651.72] I mean, Fable Legends was what I was seeing the vast majority of the DirectX 12 demos that didn't look like a pure tech demo done in.
[3651.84 → 3653.60] Like, there were some really cool.
[3653.76 → 3656.10] It was their showpiece for, like, a really long time.
[3656.16 → 3656.38] Yeah.
[3656.54 → 3660.02] I saw some cool DirectX 12 demos that were done in Fable Legends.
[3661.42 → 3662.20] Total bummer.
[3662.20 → 3676.22] And this is also, they mentioned proposed closure of Lion head Studios, which, I mean, you could make the argument Lion head hasn't done much in the last few years.
[3676.22 → 3679.86] There's a lot of Black and White fans out there.
[3680.24 → 3682.28] I personally never got into it.
[3682.36 → 3684.56] I tried really hard to like Black and White 2.
[3684.66 → 3689.30] I bought it, and I just played it a little bit.
[3689.38 → 3690.22] And I was like, okay.
[3690.98 → 3693.54] So it's an RTS, but, like, not quite an RTS.
[3693.70 → 3694.62] It's, like, slightly different.
[3694.76 → 3694.92] Okay.
[3695.56 → 3696.72] Like, I never really got it.
[3696.76 → 3698.72] But I loved Fable 1.
[3699.90 → 3701.36] Never really played much of Fable 2.
[3701.40 → 3702.32] I loved Fable 1.
[3702.32 → 3712.36] I think that's a pretty, and that might spell the ending, too, is a lot of people, when they think about Fable, go like, yeah.
[3712.88 → 3715.16] Fable 1 was a really awesome game.
[3715.18 → 3716.76] A lot of people love Fable 2.
[3716.88 → 3719.56] I know, but most people hark back to Fable 1.
[3719.84 → 3721.98] Fable 1 I really, really enjoyed.
[3725.78 → 3726.94] Oh, that's funny.
[3726.94 → 3730.18] I just got a message just from some random buddy.
[3730.18 → 3733.76] One Plus's phones are invisible in House of Cards.
[3733.84 → 3734.84] I actually haven't watched.
[3734.94 → 3737.22] I own the first season on Blu-ray.
[3737.38 → 3738.82] Like, I'm super stoked to watch it anyway.
[3740.78 → 3742.16] Invisible in House of Cards.
[3742.58 → 3748.66] I actually thought they didn't pay for product placement because I only recognize them because I'm familiar with them.
[3749.28 → 3750.74] That's something that I will say.
[3750.84 → 3754.36] The Hotel Transylvania Sony Xperia integration did really well.
[3754.36 → 3761.30] Like, it didn't bother me because they almost, it almost seemed so blatant that they were just like, you know what?
[3761.72 → 3762.88] It's Sony Pictures, bro.
[3763.48 → 3764.98] You don't want to see a Peria phone?
[3765.06 → 3766.50] Don't come watch a Sony Pictures movie.
[3766.78 → 3767.76] We're desperate, bro.
[3767.76 → 3779.64] And like, there can be something to be said for that because if you're able to make fun of it positively so that it becomes an actually good part of the story, then cool.
[3779.76 → 3780.14] Good job.
[3780.24 → 3780.42] Yeah.
[3780.98 → 3781.34] Winner.
[3781.82 → 3789.54] Whereas if it's just like, if it's almost so subtle that you only notice if you already have a One Plus phone, then I don't really understand what the point is.
[3789.78 → 3790.00] Yeah.
[3790.00 → 3793.12] Um, rumour.
[3793.54 → 3799.54] Because I was actually going to say, I know you jumped on the like, oh, they were supposed to not spend anything, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3799.82 → 3805.22] I think 300 grand to get in House of Cards might not even be that much.
[3805.32 → 3808.08] But it might have cost a lot more to get it actually be noticeable.
[3808.18 → 3808.66] That's what I mean.
[3808.74 → 3813.64] Like, I bet you Mercedes or I think it was Mercedes and Samsung.
[3813.64 → 3824.24] I think Mercedes and Samsung for Jurassic World probably spent way more because I remember throughout the whole movie it was like, wow, that is Mercedes, and it is all over the screen.
[3824.56 → 3826.72] And wow, that is a Samsung phone.
[3826.86 → 3830.44] And they're making it very clear that that is a Samsung phone.
[3830.60 → 3831.32] I think it was Samsung.
[3831.44 → 3832.38] Whatever phone they use.
[3833.34 → 3834.92] Apparently it didn't work on you then.
[3834.96 → 3836.14] Well, I watched the movie a long time ago.
[3836.20 → 3836.40] Whatever.
[3836.64 → 3837.88] Well, it couldn't have been that long ago.
[3838.04 → 3839.76] It came out like months, not years ago.
[3840.12 → 3841.64] How long ago did Jurassic World come out?
[3841.64 → 3845.62] Sometimes I wonder what your concept of time.
[3845.72 → 3846.14] It's bad.
[3846.22 → 3847.22] It's like, yeah, I know.
[3847.46 → 3848.12] It's terrible.
[3849.18 → 3849.58] June?
[3850.18 → 3851.10] Yeah, June.
[3851.56 → 3852.34] That was a while ago.
[3852.58 → 3853.62] It was like nine months.
[3853.90 → 3855.34] Yeah, nine months is quite a while ago.
[3855.36 → 3855.88] So like what?
[3855.96 → 3857.52] Human gestation period is.
[3858.06 → 3859.58] Yeah, basically.
[3859.82 → 3861.08] Luke cannot remember anything.
[3861.08 → 3869.02] So by the time his theoretical wife would have a theoretical child, he wouldn't remember having had sex.
[3869.30 → 3869.90] Wow.
[3869.90 → 3870.20] Wow.
[3871.10 → 3871.54] Okay.
[3871.90 → 3873.04] That's a little aggressive.
[3873.44 → 3874.66] I remember that it happened.
[3874.92 → 3875.28] Oh.
[3877.26 → 3878.56] That's not going to get better.
[3879.46 → 3879.90] Okay.
[3887.80 → 3889.26] Well, that was a close call there.
[3889.26 → 3891.88] Yes, it was Samsung.
[3892.14 → 3892.74] So I was right.
[3897.12 → 3900.10] Yeah, and they called it like the Samsung Innovation Centre.
[3900.32 → 3901.78] And like there was a lot of others.
[3902.08 → 3903.72] Yeah, like it was terrible.
[3903.86 → 3905.00] I really want to watch it still.
[3906.10 → 3906.68] All right.
[3906.76 → 3907.94] So new news.
[3908.02 → 3908.98] Original article here.
[3909.12 → 3909.24] Yeah.
[3909.24 → 3912.26] This happens, so everyone starts recording it on their phones.
[3912.46 → 3912.94] Oh, wow.
[3913.02 → 3914.86] Like it was terrible.
[3915.46 → 3921.80] So our buddies over at PC Perspective, rumour NVIDIA's next GPU called.
[3921.80 → 3924.36] Is that a multi-fan cooler?
[3925.80 → 3926.82] I don't know what's going on.
[3926.88 → 3927.88] Not necessarily.
[3928.12 → 3929.52] That just might be a new bezel style.
[3929.52 → 3933.52] Next GPU called GTX 1080 uses GDDR5X.
[3934.36 → 3937.52] So GDDR5X is that slightly faster GDDR5.
[3938.40 → 3939.20] But not.
[3939.20 → 3942.94] But not HBM2.
[3943.18 → 3943.48] Yeah.
[3943.86 → 3945.48] So what this means to me.
[3945.66 → 3946.42] So the card.
[3946.60 → 3947.26] So here we go.
[3947.28 → 3947.76] Here's the rumour.
[3948.12 → 3950.50] So the rumour source comes from Bench Life.
[3950.72 → 3956.60] And the report claims it will be called the GTX 1080U core with eight gigs of.
[3957.00 → 3958.02] What's called either that.
[3958.32 → 3958.72] Wait, what?
[3961.18 → 3963.02] Oh, I think this is just a typo.
[3963.24 → 3963.78] I think so.
[3963.78 → 3966.30] 1080 or 1800 or something is what the name's.
[3966.44 → 3966.96] But okay, whatever.
[3966.96 → 3971.56] Anyway, apparently we'll have eight gigs of GDDR5X and not HBM2.
[3975.06 → 3976.96] We'll launch on May 27th.
[3977.62 → 3979.96] We'll feature a GP104 Pascal GPU.
[3982.66 → 3984.20] One 8-pin connector.
[3984.60 → 3985.54] One DVI, one HDMI.
[3985.76 → 3985.96] Two DisplayPort.
[3986.80 → 3987.74] That's a weird one.
[3989.94 → 3990.90] Why is that weird?
[3991.62 → 3995.62] So basically what's happening here is the cycle will continue.
[3995.62 → 3996.92] This is the takeaway.
[3997.92 → 4003.00] So if you were hoping that the GTX 1080 or whatever they end up calling it was going
[4003.00 → 4010.58] to be the saviour of high-end VR gamers and, you know, people who want a legitimate upgrade
[4010.58 → 4014.52] from the GTX 980 tie, don't expect that.
[4014.98 → 4019.70] It might be a small upgrade, much like we've seen with the GTX.
[4019.70 → 4023.22] What did they launch first in the 700 series?
[4024.74 → 4027.58] Did they launch the 770 first?
[4028.00 → 4028.62] I can't remember.
[4028.86 → 4034.88] The 780 is significantly worse than the 780 TI or no?
[4035.02 → 4035.56] They're close.
[4035.66 → 4035.78] No.
[4036.08 → 4038.94] No, 780 is big, big Kepler.
[4040.54 → 4040.98] Crap.
[4040.98 → 4041.82] I can't remember.
[4041.82 → 4042.58] I think it is.
[4042.70 → 4043.80] Yeah, because 680, right.
[4043.88 → 4045.92] Because 680 is Kepler architecture as well.
[4045.98 → 4046.10] Okay.
[4046.14 → 4047.64] I'm getting it all sorted out of my head.
[4047.98 → 4054.54] So what we're seeing again is the step-down GPU being marketed as a flagship.
[4054.54 → 4060.44] And we're just going to have to wait until significantly later when, whether it's a Titan or whether
[4060.44 → 4065.96] it's a TI card or whether it's a 1090 or whatever they end up branding it.
[4065.98 → 4067.92] Someone's very mad at you for calling it TI.
[4068.28 → 4069.02] That's legitimate.
[4069.24 → 4071.82] Very specifically saying that you have to say TI.
[4072.20 → 4073.30] No, it's actually not.
[4073.48 → 4074.60] It stands for Titanium.
[4074.62 → 4076.04] It stands for Titanium.
[4076.22 → 4077.90] NVIDIA internally calls it TI.
[4078.08 → 4078.28] Yes.
[4078.34 → 4080.62] At every press event, they tell us to call it TI.
[4080.62 → 4083.76] I usually refuse to call it TI because I think it sounds ridiculous.
[4083.76 → 4085.00] I usually call it TI as well.
[4085.10 → 4086.86] But that doesn't change the fact that it is correct.
[4086.94 → 4090.96] Much like the way I say ASUS is the correct way to say ASUS, even though I think it should
[4090.96 → 4091.36] be ACES.
[4091.40 → 4091.76] ACES.
[4093.58 → 4094.64] So I'm sorry.
[4094.78 → 4095.30] It's TI.
[4095.56 → 4099.46] So whatever they end up calling it, we are not getting a legitimate upgrade to the 980
[4099.46 → 4103.00] TI until we get something else.
[4103.44 → 4109.24] So this is going to be more like the spiritual successor to the 980, which is a small Maxwell,
[4109.24 → 4112.24] well, a medium-sized Maxwell versus a big Maxwell.
[4112.24 → 4115.34] So that's super a bummer.
[4115.52 → 4116.42] I'm super disappointed.
[4116.56 → 4117.16] It makes sense.
[4117.30 → 4120.02] I mean, HBM2 is not ready yet anyway.
[4120.30 → 4124.06] Mass production, I don't believe, is even remotely anywhere near started.
[4124.40 → 4126.12] So it makes perfect sense.
[4126.36 → 4129.88] But yeah, I'm disappointed.
[4130.02 → 4135.14] It means that running a Titan X like I am, I'm not looking at upgrading for many more months
[4135.14 → 4135.50] to come.
[4136.58 → 4136.96] Yeah.
[4136.96 → 4139.06] You're running 980s in SLI, right?
[4139.18 → 4139.42] Yes.
[4139.46 → 4140.22] So you're Bone 2.
[4140.60 → 4140.82] Yep.
[4141.02 → 4141.22] Yeah.
[4141.64 → 4142.88] Because that's the general rule.
[4143.04 → 4145.98] That's the way that it's always, well, I don't want to say always been in the past
[4145.98 → 4147.56] because it's not always the case.
[4147.76 → 4155.42] But the general rule was SLI of last high-end was pretty darn close to a single one of the
[4155.42 → 4155.90] new high-end.
[4155.90 → 4161.96] And that fell off the board a little bit in the 600, 700 series because they were actually
[4161.96 → 4163.68] based on the same microarchitecture.
[4164.44 → 4170.30] NVIDIA just kind of unleashed their big GPU and was like, ooh, new flagship, 700 series.
[4170.76 → 4172.16] But they had no choice at the time.
[4172.22 → 4174.16] We weren't getting any process node shrinks.
[4174.44 → 4176.00] So now we're getting a process node shrink.
[4176.16 → 4181.06] So what you're probably looking at is, since this is a direct replacement card, is about
[4181.06 → 4184.56] the performance of a couple 980s in SLI, assuming non-perfect scaling.
[4184.74 → 4186.30] It's not going to be twice as fast as a 980.
[4186.58 → 4189.20] So probably like 140 to 160% as fast.
[4189.42 → 4192.80] And probably similar in terms of pricing to what the 980 was when it launched.
[4192.88 → 4193.68] That's my assumption.
[4193.98 → 4195.18] We should do that video I was talking about.
[4195.72 → 4196.52] Which one is that?
[4196.98 → 4197.38] I can't.
[4197.62 → 4197.84] Oh.
[4198.20 → 4198.42] Okay.
[4198.48 → 4199.88] Well, yeah, that doesn't help me then.
[4199.98 → 4200.66] The, uh...
[4200.66 → 4203.34] You know that thing?
[4203.74 → 4204.46] We should do that thing...
[4204.46 → 4205.74] I actually thought you might have...
[4205.74 → 4207.94] We should do that thing that you were saying we should do.
[4208.52 → 4210.16] Maybe after when, so when the cameras are off.
[4211.06 → 4214.08] Um, yeah, that's actually not a bad idea.
[4214.18 → 4214.72] It would be pretty funny.
[4215.86 → 4217.72] Um, let's see what else we got here.
[4218.78 → 4219.66] Ba-DA-ba-boom.
[4219.88 → 4220.24] I don't know.
[4220.38 → 4223.50] I think that's pretty much all I have to say.
[4223.92 → 4228.66] Maybe we can spare you guys the flickers pretty quick here.
[4229.22 → 4230.02] Uh, one more.
[4230.14 → 4230.48] One more.
[4230.58 → 4230.78] One more.
[4230.78 → 4231.38] Oh, what do you want to do?
[4231.40 → 4234.50] The Division is Ubisoft's fastest selling game.
[4235.20 → 4235.60] Wow.
[4236.38 → 4238.62] Exact sales numbers not known at this time.
[4238.62 → 4240.50] The original article here is from Game Spot.
[4241.06 → 4242.92] That is pretty incredible.
[4243.10 → 4243.80] Yes, there is one.
[4244.84 → 4245.26] Um...
[4245.26 → 4246.54] Wow.
[4247.26 → 4251.20] Sent digital sales records across the game's available platforms.
[4251.94 → 4256.24] And Ubisoft's managing director said that the studio is, quote-unquote,
[4256.54 → 4259.02] extremely happy with the Division's launch.
[4259.56 → 4262.32] Just solidifying that all they care about is sales numbers.
[4262.84 → 4263.14] Huh.
[4263.14 → 4263.20] Yeah.
[4264.54 → 4265.46] That is incredible.
[4265.46 → 4270.74] How many other games does Ubisoft make that are excessively multiplayer focused?
[4274.28 → 4275.66] Is it like nothing?
[4275.66 → 4284.02] Because everything I can really think of has a very strong leading single-player element.
[4284.02 → 4284.18] Yeah.
[4284.54 → 4286.78] Your Assassin's Creed, your Watch Dogs.
[4286.88 → 4291.16] So most things that they make are not really on a timer in terms of buying it.
[4291.16 → 4299.52] Because a lot of multiplayer games, especially like this, which aren't going to go into a competitive scene in terms of, like, people watching it, are on somewhat of a timer.
[4299.52 → 4301.92] Your friends will buy it, play for a while, and stop playing.
[4302.22 → 4302.32] Yeah.
[4302.32 → 4306.40] So I think one of the reasons why it is their fastest-selling game is everyone's like, are you playing it?
[4306.42 → 4307.00] Are you playing it?
[4307.00 → 4307.50] Are you playing it?
[4307.54 → 4307.74] Yes?
[4307.86 → 4308.92] Okay, let's get it now.
[4309.26 → 4311.06] And then they're going to play it for a while and then drop it.
[4311.06 → 4311.68] Right, and then get bored.
[4311.68 → 4317.96] Instead of a single-player game where it's like, well, I still want to finish the sequel, and maybe if I wait until I'm done the sequel, it's going to be cheaper.
[4318.16 → 4318.78] You mean prequel.
[4319.26 → 4319.78] Prequel, yeah.
[4319.78 → 4320.38] Yeah, yeah.
[4320.62 → 4323.54] Or like, I've got all these games queued up.
[4323.62 → 4325.44] I still haven't played Just Cause 2.
[4326.32 → 4328.30] So I didn't buy Just Cause 3.
[4328.90 → 4329.34] Exactly.
[4330.04 → 4330.44] Yeah.
[4330.56 → 4332.26] I really need to play Just Cause 2.
[4332.34 → 4333.00] I know that.
[4333.38 → 4334.34] But I really don't want it.
[4334.34 → 4335.68] Because it really does.
[4336.22 → 4341.38] If there's one thing that makes a game feel old, it's playing the sequel first.
[4342.68 → 4342.92] Yeah.
[4343.48 → 4349.08] Like, I am going, there are very few games where I'm legitimately going to make my son play the old one first.
[4349.32 → 4353.54] But early Final Fantasies is one of the ones where I'm going to be like, no, I am not.
[4353.64 → 4361.78] You may not turn on an Xbox One, a PlayStation 4, a PlayStation 3, a PlayStation 2 even.
[4362.04 → 4367.76] You may not turn any of those things on until you have played some of the older 2D Final Fantasies.
[4368.46 → 4369.02] End of story.
[4371.68 → 4372.04] Yeah.
[4372.32 → 4378.20] I have an idea for a stream that I want to do eventually, but I don't want to say it right now because I don't want someone to steal the idea.
[4378.30 → 4381.26] But it has to do with playing prequels first and all this kind of stuff.
[4381.44 → 4381.58] But yeah.
[4382.28 → 4382.78] All right.
[4382.84 → 4385.50] Well, thank you guys very much for tuning into the WAN Show.
[4385.60 → 4387.10] We're sorry for the technical difficulties.
[4387.34 → 4391.14] What we'll probably do is just flat out replace that camera for next week and see if that helps.
[4392.56 → 4393.68] It is what it is.
[4393.72 → 4395.06] We've never had that issue before.
[4395.38 → 4397.16] So it's like that every week.
[4397.16 → 4399.14] There's always some brand-new issue we've never had.
[4399.20 → 4399.88] I even said to Luke.
[4399.90 → 4400.90] The computer was good this week.
[4400.90 → 4401.06] Yeah.
[4401.18 → 4407.64] I said to Luke when we set up, all I did was fire it up, plug in my laptop, and I was like, wow, this is working perfectly.
[4409.96 → 4410.28] Yeah.
[4410.72 → 4411.04] All right.
[4411.26 → 4412.08] See you guys next week.
[4412.18 → 4413.98] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[4414.24 → 4415.18] Doing a game stream tonight.
[4416.14 → 4416.50] Sick.
[4417.06 → 4417.42] Nice.
