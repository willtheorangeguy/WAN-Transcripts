[0.00 → 9.44] oh I had like a gas bubble there welcome to the wan show guys it's uh i
[10.88 → 17.60] well i I can't control when a gas bubble comes I mean maybe you have just magnificent gas control
[17.60 → 23.04] but yeah not everyone shares there are multiple chambers along my throat so I can capture it
[23.04 → 29.60] and then hold it for later frog Luke yeah like yeah I'm I'm pretty sure that that's like
[29.60 → 34.96] a breathing thing not like a stomach air thing no yeah it's along my throat it's along your throat
[34.96 → 39.76] yeah I've never noticed this yeah well it's internal I mean I've inspected the internals of
[39.76 → 46.56] your throat you know probed anyway uh sorry what are we talking about uh right we have interesting
[46.56 → 51.60] topics today that don't have to do with throat probing yeah no throat probing uh ad lock plus
[51.60 → 55.92] now bringing you ads a little bit of throat probing a little bit of throat probing yeah
[55.92 → 67.12] get throat probed right there uh the iPhone 7 is it the fastest phone ever google terminates AdBlock
[67.12 → 73.52] plus's AdSense account yeah baby that was a one two punch if I've ever heard of one also
[73.52 → 78.80] you uh nope that one's not as interesting U.S. government issues an official note 7 recall
[78.80 → 86.56] want one the note seven you might say that that whole thing blew up in their faces' oh man I was
[86.56 → 91.36] trying to think of some pun thing you beat me to it yeah something with blue and blow
[98.32 → 106.80] only if you're choking
[108.80 → 122.80] all right
[125.04 → 135.84] all right good job Colton good job all right so the wan oh my keyboard is like see this is
[135.84 → 139.36] something that continues to I think I've ranted about this on wan show before so I'm not going to
[139.36 → 146.56] do it again today, but keyboard input should never lag yeah it should never lag it should be like you
[146.56 → 152.08] know how they have real-time operating systems like the kind that runs your car where it's just like no
[152.08 → 159.28] there is no lag on the abs braking system no we should treat keyboard inputs like abs brakes I mean it's
[159.28 → 166.16] not the same thing no it is not the same I'm aware that the keyboard unless you are playing a driving
[166.16 → 173.28] game, and you bind your e-brake to the space bar then your keyboard is effectively a break
[173.28 → 183.44] oh man and I broke his head oh a little bit his brain is broken now okay the one sorry I just need to do this Facebook post
[185.28 → 187.28] what do we get
[189.52 → 199.28] nothing, nothing sorry we have no topics for you today I was reading the twitch chat forget it yeah someone confused me because they have a new star thing because I guess finally our subscriber thing works
[199.28 → 205.92] oh I think way to go Colton again yeah yeah I think Colton fixed it because he was like
[205.92 → 212.64] Linus did you know that doesn't work and I was like yeah, and he's like are you ever going to fix it I was like
[213.28 → 219.68] no there's so there's there are no benefits at all there's no mod icons and there's no subscriber symbol
[219.68 → 228.08] other than a star, but there will be someone had someone subscribed yeah he's a sub from my own stream
[228.08 → 232.00] oh I see should I change it to sub only mode so we can just talk to him
[232.96 → 233.68] one person
[237.28 → 242.80] I don't even know how what a dick I don't even know how here am I even a mod I don't I don't even know if
[242.80 → 247.84] I'm a mod am I even signed in I don't even think I'm yeah I'm signed in I'm signed in this is my channel
[247.84 → 254.16] I should be able to uh I should be able to change to sub only mode i I don't even understand how this works
[254.16 → 259.92] uh everyone's like pre-recorded oh it is most assuredly not pre-recorded we are definitely we're
[259.92 → 265.52] definitely still working on this all right I'm just going to keep clicking this gear button in the
[265.52 → 271.60] bottom until I can clear chat hide chat edit appearance I don't remember the commit they
[271.60 → 276.80] changed it they changed it they did actually change that's fine I give up okay let's move into our first
[276.80 → 283.68] topic of the day Adblock Plus now bringing you ads the original article here is from ours technical let's
[283.68 → 288.64] go ahead and drop that in the uh let's go ahead and drop that in the twitch chat there
[290.56 → 300.80] Adblock Plus finds the end game of its business model selling ads, so the company is boasting that they
[300.80 → 309.84] have more than 90 million users willing to see pre-white listed ads so in a nutshell you put them
[309.84 → 316.72] in by default that means they're willing yes so they're launching a self-service platform to sell
[317.28 → 323.36] pre-white listed ads that will have to meet its acceptable ads criteria, and we've actually covered the
[323.36 → 329.04] acceptable ads program in the past that other than Adblock Plus basically being a bunch of
[329.04 → 337.76] buttheads at various uh did you put did you turn on subscriber only yeah so what a terrible
[337.76 → 338.16] person
[342.56 → 347.52] I'll turn it off in a second it's only tray and nitro blast
[349.68 → 356.16] okay I'll do it off okay terrible to be clear I do not recommend that you subscribe to
[356.16 → 364.72] the at Linus tech twitch account we only stream once a week for one and a half hours that is
[364.72 → 369.52] not a good value if you're going to subscribe to a twitch channel this is why I haven't really been
[369.52 → 375.12] been chasing you know getting that subscribe button going I know this isn't a great sales pitch
[375.12 → 382.24] as far as like don't subscribe to us driving donations to Linus media group, but there are like
[382.24 → 386.72] other ways that you can contribute where you might actually get oh I don't know maybe like a t-shirt
[386.72 → 393.04] in return or something like that so i I mean do it if you must, but we don't plan to do a lot
[393.04 → 398.08] of subscriber only chat anyway so we've talked a little bit about the only time ever like we've
[398.08 → 404.24] talked about the acceptable ads program in the past um noticing that some things about it are good like
[404.24 → 410.80] the fact that people opting in through their Adblock Plus app or widget or whatever the case may be
[410.80 → 417.92] will be able to contribute ad revenue to the advertisers that willingly adhere to the acceptable
[417.92 → 425.28] ads program but the uh the way that the evil creeps into this is Adblock Plus charging
[425.28 → 431.12] advertisers to be a part of the acceptable ad program to be pre-approved for it
[431.12 → 442.96] so basically the acceptable ad system is now providing um is now providing Adblock Plus with
[442.96 → 451.28] its main revenue source so there you have it and the original article here is from business wire but
[451.28 → 458.56] Adblock Plus enters ad tech with the launch of SSP slash ad platform I wouldn't cut in yeah we are
[458.56 → 466.80] definitely not online right now oh really yes oh that's weird yes we definitely seem to be online
[466.80 → 474.00] yes we do, and we were and nothing noticeably changed, but we are not currently oh well then we'll
[474.00 → 479.36] be right back won't we the whole chat is talking about how we're offline, and it is currently offline for
[479.36 → 493.36] me as well yeah there's now four subscribers in stream I think okay so are we live now where we live at
[493.36 → 498.48] all before uh I still don't see a feed, but it does say we're live and there's a circle spinning in the
[498.48 → 505.12] middle yes my friends we are live oh man that like tripped me out because I was looking at this computer
[505.12 → 509.12] and the mouse is moving here, and it was moving there I'm I'm going to switch out of that view
[509.12 → 516.96] yeah yes we're done with that view so back to Adblock Plus maybe subscriber mode broke it right
[516.96 → 526.48] okay so we should just never do it again okay so they take a cut right Adblock Plus takes a cut
[526.48 → 530.96] from the acceptable ads that's what I've heard i I don't know if I've actually read that in here so
[530.96 → 537.20] they originally introduced the program back in 2011 as a way to allow um websites that wanted to
[537.20 → 543.76] not have intrusive ads with intrusive placements to allow Adblock Plus users to whitelist their sites so
[543.76 → 548.88] they could at least still get some revenue even if they didn't get the big fat beefy CPMs that come
[548.88 → 555.76] along with things like autoplay video so that's or ads with uh sound I don't even know what the
[555.76 → 560.80] metrics are for those, but that's essentially what the line of sexes forum has always done yeah just
[560.80 → 565.84] because we didn't want like when looking at the forum ourselves because neither of us run AdBlock
[565.84 → 571.84] we didn't want it to be a shitty experience yeah so basically more than 90 percent of Adblock Plus's
[571.84 → 576.32] 100 million users apparently chose to allow these respectful and useful ads to display on their
[576.32 → 583.36] favourite websites um I don't remember if it was an opt-out or an opt-in at the beginning so don't
[583.36 → 590.96] quote me on any of that yeah but basically now they have created their this platform that will
[590.96 → 600.32] allow you to actually buy ad space like pre-white listed ad space through Adblock Plus so um and you
[600.32 → 605.92] would yeah you would have to kind of brilliant if you think about it so they're using a go-between
[605.92 → 614.24] company called combo tag to get the ads um yeah I don't know they didn't ask the underlying ad
[614.24 → 622.72] providers about a deal of any kind um google and app nexus are both ending associations with combo tag
[622.72 → 626.56] yeah we should actually that's a separate article here I'm just going to post that which chat here
[626.56 → 630.40] yeah they're very related yeah, so the original article here is from Engadget I'm just going to pull this
[630.40 → 638.00] up but Google has terminated the Adblock Plus AdSense account which is uh you know a little bit of a
[639.04 → 644.00] hard stop in terms of what they were trying to do if the plan was for them to serve Google Ads through
[644.00 → 656.96] it then uh you know yeah yeah that's pretty rough um there's like I don't know this is not very surprising
[656.96 → 662.56] not very interesting in my opinion a lot the whole internet is like freaking out about this
[662.56 → 666.40] I don't use it which is probably why it's not that interesting to me yeah but like the amount of
[666.40 → 671.36] people that basically went like this is the ultimate betrayal you are worse than anything that has ever
[671.36 → 681.60] happened was extremely large um to which uh I don't know running AdBlock is like yeah app nexus said
[681.60 → 687.68] that AdBlock is essentially setting up toll booths on public roads that's brutal taking ad money that
[687.68 → 692.48] should be going straight to the publishers that's brutal that makes me dislike AdBlock more than I did
[692.48 → 700.32] before I mean the thing about the thing about this is that they are saying Adblock Plus is being
[700.32 → 707.28] opportunistic and being buttheads but what they aren't doing is proposing an actual solution to the
[707.28 → 712.56] problem yeah um like i actually it wasn't in any of these articles unfortunately but I was I forget
[712.56 → 717.68] why I was reading it but I was reading about AdBlock use over the last couple of years and the way that
[717.68 → 725.20] it's trending with millions upon millions of new AdBlock users per year and the fact that I mean okay
[725.20 → 731.36] I'm not going to say fact it's a very strong statement but in my mind I believe with the cause of
[731.36 → 738.00] this trend being the intrusive ads that exist that force people to look for an alternative and by
[738.00 → 743.60] intrusive ads I don't even necessarily just mean video ads like I'm talking stuff that downloads files
[743.60 → 749.76] onto your computer like there's some really really terrible ads out there that ad blocking programs
[749.76 → 756.24] do help you circumvent yeah um and there are some web pages that are just actually unusable without some
[756.24 → 762.88] form of blocker so google and uh so google and app nexus are kind of coming at these guys saying
[762.88 → 769.20] they're taking money that should be going to the publishers um, but the fact of the matter is that
[769.20 → 775.36] these publishers even though they are ultimately doing it to themselves in my mind not all of them
[775.36 → 780.72] many of them so we're not in the Adblock Plus program, so our ads on the forum are blocked yes by most
[780.72 → 788.08] people so the bad publishers are doing it to themselves by adding intrusive horrible advertising
[788.08 → 795.60] to their sites and effectively doing it to everyone and no one's really doing anything to fight this and
[795.60 → 803.68] you know you could kind of go well adapt or die but have you noticed that even you know serious
[803.68 → 809.20] you know editorial websites like a perfect example is uh since the perch show perch takeover
[809.20 → 815.52] a non-tech now has those um where are they oh they're there on mobile here hold on let me fire
[815.52 → 825.44] up an article uh where are they here we go oh man they now have like trending today sure casino manager
[825.44 → 830.88] gets fired releases five secrets to beat the house like they now have those like sponsored articles on
[830.88 → 838.64] I mean even very serious like newspaper publications on their websites have that stuff linking to those
[838.64 → 844.64] those like those rabbit hole clickbait sites but the reality of it is that this is now a cycle
[844.64 → 849.44] that is going to continue to snowball until someone does something and I don't have a clear answer
[849.44 → 856.00] it has been continuing to snowball i kind of because it is would be cool if google spearheaded sort of
[856.00 → 863.52] what Adblock Plus is trying to do right and was just really aggressive about it um and basically got a
[863.52 → 869.84] YouTube red style system right where you could pay in and if you wanted to black uh block essentially
[869.84 → 874.24] all the ads you could pay in and then google would distribute a portion of that money depending on how
[874.24 → 877.60] much time they spent on different websites to different publishers I wish I had that article i
[877.60 → 881.52] was reading apparently google red subscriptions have really slowed down as well, and it doesn't look
[881.52 → 886.64] like that's the answer either um people just want to block instead of pay money because
[886.64 → 889.52] basically they're selling something that people are already getting for free
[889.52 → 896.72] um I remember what I was reading it was uh it was an article about is ad blocking illegal and the
[896.72 → 905.12] answer is no but circumventing an anti-ad block mechanism that's in place on a website is depending
[905.12 → 910.96] on where you live and what the applicable local laws are so right but then like so that putting that
[910.96 → 915.76] on your site kills you putting that on your site there's so many people that but like if we put that
[915.76 → 920.88] a lot of executives I think overall traffic would go to like 10 percent right something ridiculous
[920.88 → 926.32] with that said your monetizable traffic would be identical in theory except that the way that you
[926.32 → 933.52] sell advertising space to advertisers is with your overall traffic numbers with your reach um so
[933.52 → 941.36] it's like this it's like this horrible like tar and cigarette butt soup of like if you don't have
[941.36 → 948.48] ads if you don't give in and sell obnoxious video ads question yeah it's obnoxious but because of how
[948.48 → 954.08] people because of the way that people use the way the consumers are behaving you have to do it to keep
[954.08 → 959.04] up, or you can lay off all your staff, or you can, you know stop doing investigative journalism, and you can
[959.04 → 963.44] just kind of repost what you saw from somewhere else that is still managing to keep their traffic
[963.44 → 967.84] numbers up high enough to actually employ a staff looking at YouTube these days just rage and create drama
[967.84 → 971.44] about things and then create a click-based title that lines up with that, and then you'll be very
[971.44 → 979.20] successful yeah so I mean to be clear like i kind of I really enjoy the position that we're in right
[979.20 → 985.28] now with that said the landscape changes so fast online and two years from now I could be lamenting
[985.28 → 990.72] any one of these things um maybe all we'll make are videos about how to make money like the lawn mowing
[990.72 → 996.24] thing yeah who knows yeah who knows what will be in two years okay probably not but for us
[996.24 → 1000.96] being in control of our own ad sales where we and we I mean it's its something that we didn't do
[1000.96 → 1006.56] completely by accident where we consciously try to make our integrated ad spots uh somewhat interesting
[1006.56 → 1013.76] and applicable to our audience um that puts us in a position where we can demand even better CPMs than
[1013.76 → 1019.20] what someone playing you know obnoxious video ads in the middle of a written article can even though a lot
[1019.20 → 1025.68] of the time they're doing as much if not more work than us, it's just it's a function of the medium and i
[1025.68 → 1030.56] ultimately actually can't do anything about it, I just happen to be sitting on the right side of
[1030.56 → 1041.36] that particular um dilemma I don't know what to call it sure yeah I don't know um all right speaking of
[1041.36 → 1049.28] sitting on the right side of things apple seems to be on the right side of performance
[1049.28 → 1061.36] oh is the iPhone 7 the fastest phone ever does anyone care I'm pretty sure people care why what
[1061.36 → 1068.48] do you mean why why why do people care about an iPhone I don't know any fast oh, oh why are you being
[1068.48 → 1075.60] that much faster like I don't want to be a dick but most phone apps right now like I have a very good
[1075.60 → 1080.00] friend of mine that I was best friends with when we were in high school and stuff like that is a
[1080.00 → 1085.84] mobile app developer makes relatively high-end mobile games right his relatively high-end mobile
[1085.84 → 1093.20] games have to be able to scale down to phones that have 500 megabytes of ram right these apps are being
[1093.20 → 1099.76] made for pretty shit phones right once we're sorry intentionally not very good phones intentionally
[1099.76 → 1108.24] um and like my phone which isn't that new at this point z5 premium other than having like glitches
[1108.24 → 1114.64] and bugs with it and the headphone jack is weird and stuff performance wise great I can do like
[1114.64 → 1122.32] whatever I want completely fine with extremely minimal lag if any noticeable at all so I mean I guess
[1122.32 → 1125.60] there are a couple different angles on this number one is do we need faster phones and
[1126.88 → 1129.70] I think on the iOS side of things it's a little bit lesser than
[1129.76 → 1133.52] issue than it is on the android side of things because at least those older phones are running
[1133.52 → 1138.08] smaller screens yeah so especially in the case of gaming they're not going to have to push as hard so
[1138.08 → 1144.40] you could, you can target a large installation base of iPhone users which is a huge concern on the android
[1144.40 → 1149.60] side and why you target these very, very basic specs because the hardware is all over the place so you
[1149.60 → 1155.84] can target a very wide huge installation base of iPhone users without necessarily pandering to the lowest common
[1155.84 → 1160.24] denominator the way that you would on android at the same time tuning that up is a huge amount of
[1160.24 → 1167.12] extra work when you could just build it the same way for both right so you're probably just going to
[1167.12 → 1171.76] build it the same way for both look I'm trying to justify this okay can you just help me out a little bit
[1171.76 → 1177.92] here i just oh like okay I'm never going to say that more performance is a bad thing no just like and
[1177.92 → 1182.72] it's not it's not at all that's not what I'm saying it's great that it's a fast phone that's awesome we
[1182.72 → 1187.36] need to keep doing that there's just so many other things that I would have rather been the main headline
[1187.36 → 1193.52] for this phone I mean it's fast yeah i do still I do still need to get in a unit for review
[1193.52 → 1198.64] I will do a review of it and I'll talk about how it is really, really fast and to be clear the iPhone 6s
[1198.64 → 1204.88] is still noticeably snappier when using it than any android phone that I've used um and that's mostly
[1204.88 → 1210.72] because of the drive right um it's partly due to that partly because the processor is really, really fast
[1210.72 → 1215.20] okay which brings me to the other key point is I don't understand why anyone is making this the
[1215.20 → 1220.40] headline for the iPhone 7 because the iPhone 6s was already arguably faster than any android phone on
[1220.40 → 1227.04] the market so I don't really see how we were expecting um a follow-up it's happened to the a9
[1227.04 → 1235.84] that's that's true, but apple is not AMD, so oh burn sorry AMD sorry, sorry, and you might want to give
[1235.84 → 1242.96] some before people freak out okay, okay I should probably explain um so when they replaced the uh
[1242.96 → 1250.72] their top of the line six core the uh 1090 or 1100t when they replaced their top of the line six core
[1250.72 → 1256.64] with a top of the line eight core FX 8150 if I recall correctly please don't quote me on the exact model
[1256.64 → 1263.36] numbers, but basically there were benchmarks more than one where the new eight cores because of its shared
[1263.36 → 1269.12] resources between the core modules was actually slower than the flagship processor that it replaced
[1269.68 → 1276.96] um not in all in heavily multithreaded benchmarks the eight core uh did perform better if I recall
[1276.96 → 1285.36] correctly um so there you go I wow I gee I really don't know what to say about this other than that it
[1285.36 → 1290.64] is faster, and you'll talk more about this I'm sure geek bench get your review going there's a new geek bench
[1290.64 → 1299.36] hey look we're still reviewing that thing yep promoted stories see what we're talking about how Anne
[1299.36 → 1305.68] Hathaway became the most hated celeb in Hollywood wow take a celebrity name put a screenshot of their
[1305.68 → 1312.24] face put hated or loved or crazy controversial top five crazy things that they did
[1312.24 → 1317.92] yeah yeah yeah wow we really don't have a lot of good topics for Sancho this week nope
[1321.60 → 1329.04] oh the government official uh issues official note 7 recall this stuff has been legitimately insane
[1329.04 → 1334.48] yeah this is from the Washington Post you're already uh copying that yeah okay cool cars lighting on fire
[1335.04 → 1340.64] um there we go like someone I think was at a garage sale or something and like
[1340.64 → 1344.48] left their phone in the car to charge or something like that and then their jeep just completely
[1344.48 → 1351.44] then on fire, and it completely destroyed it um there's been a lot of issues I heard through john
[1351.44 → 1358.96] I don't know but John's usually a pretty good source so it's probably fine um that Samsung issued a patch
[1359.52 → 1366.32] which like capped what the battery could charge to trying to get people to issue the freaking
[1367.04 → 1372.96] uh right not refunds but recalls yep trying to be like hey like your phone sucks now i I think it was
[1372.96 → 1377.12] like 60 or something like that I don't really sorry if I'm quoting you wrong john um but like
[1377.92 → 1381.36] capping their battery percentage which is an interesting thing kind of knowing that they can
[1381.36 → 1386.00] do that um and then trying to get people to bring in their phones for recalls so that they stop
[1386.00 → 1390.80] freaking lighting things on fire and now the US government is like hey guys actually do it so
[1390.80 → 1397.36] hopefully it happens hopefully people do it so, so far there have been 26 reports of burns and 55
[1397.36 → 1403.60] reports of property damage so I'm kind of wondering at this point I haven't seen anything about this it
[1403.60 → 1408.32] could be in the note that would be in the notes I get it um that would be kind of unfortunate if i
[1408.32 → 1415.60] missed it but airlines yeah no I saw that uh who was it uh one of the Canadian airlines basically they
[1415.60 → 1422.56] didn't ban them yet, but they advised their passengers against flying with it yep okay um
[1423.36 → 1430.96] but like that's I would probably want that band I'm really I'm really surprised about I'm surprised that
[1430.96 → 1435.76] so many people are not bringing them in because right now you're in a position where you can bring
[1435.76 → 1442.32] it in for a refund so you actually just get your money back and now that the iPhone 7 is out
[1443.20 → 1449.36] ah you can get one of those um with no headphone jack with no headphone jack did you see okay I don't
[1449.36 → 1453.04] have it right now but I can try to find it but did you see the like the lineup in front of the apple
[1453.04 → 1458.48] store for the phone launch in Denmark no I didn't there's two people waiting oh really they have like
[1458.48 → 1463.04] balloons all around the door and like some guy has like a cannon that shoots out little confetti
[1463.04 → 1468.80] things and the two guys are just like okay like they don't even look excited they might not even
[1468.80 → 1474.32] be there for an iPhone 7 like they might be there to pick something else up oh seriously I'm not sure
[1474.32 → 1481.20] I'll try to here I'll try to find it I don't see it iPhone fans line up for the iPhone 7 for two days
[1481.20 → 1488.88] oh wow yeah no i think it's probably doing fine um maybe it was like a joke maybe it's possible
[1488.88 → 1492.56] possible it was a joke because iPhone 7 released at Apple Store in Denmark
[1496.40 → 1498.40] I mean I'm not sure if that's real
[1501.04 → 1504.24] here hold on oh let me screen share you hi I always forget we can do this
[1506.64 → 1507.60] I can't there we go
[1510.96 → 1518.00] you know what you know what I think I don't think that's an apple store I think that's like
[1518.00 → 1523.76] um there are like chairs like people were waiting but I hear you I see what you're saying yeah i
[1523.76 → 1531.28] think that's like a compote 2000 like simply computing like I think that's like an apple specialty
[1531.28 → 1537.20] specializing just computer store yeah that makes sense because that logo isn't it's a really grainy
[1537.20 → 1542.24] it's kind of funny that it's about the iPhone 7 it's really grainy crappy video yeah um but like it
[1542.24 → 1546.80] that doesn't look like the proper logo and stuff that is interesting though all right Samsung has
[1546.80 → 1551.12] apparently finally stopped airing note 7 commercials in Korea so that's good
[1553.20 → 1558.88] yep they've stopped airing ads for a phone that you definitely shouldn't buy because it might light
[1558.88 → 1566.08] on fire um good job man proud of you Sam what a huge disaster this thing is for them, I mean it's one
[1566.08 → 1571.28] of those things where I'm sure some of some viewers are probably sitting there wondering like why wouldn't
[1571.28 → 1577.44] Samsung want people to just you know hold on to it and if it blows up then just kind of get it
[1577.44 → 1583.76] replaced at that time because a recall is like really, really expensive especially when many of the
[1583.76 → 1593.44] units are supposedly fine and the answer is that Samsung has to pay millions of dollars to issue a recall
[1593.44 → 1600.72] and deal with fixing all of those phones okay Samsung could end up paying millions upon millions of
[1600.72 → 1608.24] dollars if their phone ultimately ends up um you know lighting uh I don't know like a high rise
[1608.24 → 1613.92] building on fire and a few hundred people die oh yeah like that's a much bigger problem so Samsung
[1613.92 → 1619.92] has to even if they on their side are kind of sitting there going okay so you know math numbers the fact
[1619.92 → 1627.44] they've had like 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of uh property damage yeah like holy crap like this
[1627.44 → 1631.68] seems like pretty likely for something terrible to happen so even if Samsung was sitting there going
[1631.68 → 1636.80] okay it's only a few thousand phones that are actually affected even if they kind of did that
[1636.80 → 1645.20] math and what the odds are like pretty darn low still one of those phones if they don't at least look
[1645.20 → 1650.96] like they are doing absolutely everything in their power to get those phones back they are they
[1650.96 → 1655.68] could end up being liable for it someone on a plane has their phone go up, and the plane goes down yeah
[1655.68 → 1663.12] someone on in a car on a bridge phone goes up something crazy like that not good so anyway note
[1663.12 → 1667.52] seven shipments have been suspended for over a week now and some analysts expect that the sales won't
[1667.52 → 1673.92] resume until next month uh when they have time to retool the phones and get them sent back out to
[1673.92 → 1682.40] retailers Geez all right game room has been launched what is this and why do we care
[1683.44 → 1691.84] game room dot me single client for all your pc games uh steam okay automatically imports scans and
[1691.84 → 1696.40] imports games from everything else which doesn't matter steam good old games origin you play
[1696.40 → 1704.56] even the ones you would definitely okay never bothered to install okay uh-huh the only difference
[1704.56 → 1709.12] is crap I don't care because you would still have to launch it through the actual thing when you just
[1709.12 → 1714.16] like how if you have purchased a game through steam that's an Ubisoft game you have to launch it
[1714.72 → 1718.80] if you launch it through steam it then has to open you play anyway and launch it through there
[1718.80 → 1730.40] who put this in the dock colton okay so what does it do so it wants to plug into all clients
[1731.36 → 1736.96] it just aggregates all the games that are on your computer i know I mean didn't they try and
[1736.96 → 1743.52] build that into Windows vista and didn't know one care yeah yeah yeah the game folder i actually kind of
[1743.52 → 1747.36] like the game thing that was pretty I used the game folder, but it was nice because it was built into
[1747.36 → 1753.04] windows yeah well Microsoft decided they didn't care about games any more it wasn't a room no like
[1753.04 → 1759.76] folder it was a folder yeah, but it was games not just game I mean game room another secret feature
[1759.76 → 1763.52] about this app is that it aggregates all the games in your computer and then picks one of them
[1764.24 → 1771.28] and that game goes into the game room yeah that's a stupid feature does it actually do that no, no no
[1774.32 → 1782.64] I did that way too seriously oh man wow this is interesting all right so the original article
[1782.64 → 1790.24] here is from CTV news hp is apparently buying Samsung's printer business for one billion dollars wow
[1792.08 → 1798.88] so basically they're just buying out Samsung having cheap printers that are like kind of okay
[1798.88 → 1805.20] so they can sell more expensive printers that are also kind of okay also Samsung's printer business
[1805.20 → 1813.44] includes more than 6 500 printing patents which is a lot of cool so it will help it go from traditional
[1813.44 → 1819.04] copiers to multi-function printers said the deal will also strengthen its position in laser printing
[1819.76 → 1824.56] wow this is boring the deal is expected to close within a year
[1824.56 → 1835.28] uh Alibaba has fired employees for hacking their way to free moon cakes what the hundreds of holiday
[1835.28 → 1843.44] cakes were purloined through weakness in the internal website so let's say for example that Linus media
[1843.44 → 1849.28] group were to have a moon cake program which is more common than you might think what is it like
[1849.28 → 1856.56] for an Asian company what is a moon cake okay moon cakes are something to do with some kind of Chinese
[1856.56 → 1861.84] something or other it's like a seasonal item it's like it's like a fruit cake I mean it's nothing like
[1861.84 → 1872.24] a fruit cake because they're gross, and they're just full of like egg um yeah it's like I'm okay if you're
[1872.24 → 1877.52] likely to be offended by what I'm about to say yeah then you better tune out and kind of come back in a
[1877.52 → 1886.00] a minute or so that's never a good sign but like Chinese dessert oh no like red bean soup
[1887.20 → 1894.32] it doesn't even it doesn't sound like dessert it doesn't look like dessert and most importantly it
[1894.32 → 1901.76] does not taste like dessert it doesn't have sugar in it is has a grainy ass texture to if it's just
[1901.76 → 1907.28] awful it leaves a wicked bad aftertaste what about mango jelly, and it has beans in it hey that thing
[1907.28 → 1914.40] that we used to get that he'd put on the thing, and then he'd lift it off okay, okay okay yes so
[1914.40 → 1923.04] there are some there are some good Chinese puddings that I can abide but my wife okay she eats what she
[1923.04 → 1931.76] calls Chinese donuts what are those as far as I can tell they are flour and bread deep-fried there's no
[1931.76 → 1938.08] sugar sprinkles there's no sugar in them as far as I can tell again it's like have you ever had a beaver
[1938.08 → 1946.24] tail yeah okay it's like a beaver tail but with no toppings no sugar no cinnamon that sounds really
[1946.24 → 1953.36] unappealing it's just it's just like a deep-fried pastry and I'm sitting here going that is not dessert
[1953.36 → 1959.68] even Chinese jello is awful they have this jello you know um Yvonne's layered jello that uses
[1959.68 → 1966.72] the regular jello and like whipping cream infused jello yeah okay so I got suckered into this Chinese
[1966.72 → 1972.16] jello because it looked like my wife's jello and my wife is Chinese so i kind of put two and two together
[1972.16 → 1977.68] I went this is how my Chinese wife makes jello this is how her Chinese relatives probably make jello they're
[1977.68 → 1983.04] probably the same thing yeah it looked a little different okay like the colours were kind of pastel
[1983.04 → 1988.72] instead of being like dark jello colours okay and then the lighter layers were also light
[1989.28 → 1996.08] so looked quite similar no it turns out it has like rice in it, and it's not sweet I'm just like rice is
[1996.08 → 2003.36] the like why probably as far away from dessert as you could pretty much ever get some rice pudding is
[2003.36 → 2008.88] pretty good okay I can do rice pudding with like a sweetened yogurt added to it, I don't think I've
[2008.88 → 2014.24] had rice pudding okay I'm not like brown sugar enough in this topic to talk about it so I don't
[2014.24 → 2022.48] remember how I got into this right um moon cakes are disgusting, so people got stole people got fired
[2022.48 → 2029.92] for stealing moon cakes you know what they could have had my moon cake i I used to get moon cakes at uh at NCI
[2029.92 → 2035.76] where I used to work and every year I would bring them home and I would give them to my in-laws
[2035.76 → 2042.48] because brownie points, and they're disgusting and I want nothing to do with them and so it was actually
[2042.48 → 2048.56] one it was actually a pretty cool perk but all the other all the other white people who worked there
[2048.56 → 2055.68] would get them, and they'd just be like this is very expensive i sure wish I had something else for
[2055.68 → 2064.72] the money you spent on this oh man cakes that's that's a little sad sorry anyway so oh okay actually
[2064.72 → 2069.76] it looks like all of this information was actually in here so it's the mid-autumn festival which starts
[2069.76 → 2075.28] on September 15th and the holiday is commemorated through the exchange and sharing a salted duck egg
[2075.28 → 2084.64] started by a thin crust wow I'm uninterested so hold on um so a round pastry is filled with lotus seed paste
[2084.64 → 2090.56] or red bean paste and then sometimes the salted yolk of a duck egg surrounded by a thin crust
[2091.20 → 2093.68] if that sounds good to you then
[2096.88 → 2102.32] thumbs up then good have some moon cakes um yeah they're apparently in huge demand leading up to the
[2102.32 → 2109.04] festival and Alibaba offered their employees one moon cake each complete with one Alibaba plush inside
[2109.04 → 2113.92] additionally cakes were sold at cost to employees for friends and family through an internal e-commerce
[2113.92 → 2119.84] page, so four software engineers were able to add software to the system directing extra moon cakes to
[2119.84 → 2124.08] themselves I mean how many moon cakes do you need they found that the four had amassed
[2124.08 → 2132.56] themselves 124 boxes of cakes how are you going to eat 124 lotus seed paste cakes 124 duck eggs I mean how
[2132.56 → 2140.64] many ducks does it take to make 124 duck eggs like not even in the like wow you must eat a lot of moon cakes bro
[2140.64 → 2142.32] but like how is that worth it
[2146.00 → 2150.72] like I can't, I can't imagine that you would honestly think that you wouldn't get caught for that ever
[2152.88 → 2158.00] like what made them think the company doesn't know how many employees they have
[2158.56 → 2162.24] and how many moon cakes they bought like if you're going to steal like one extra one
[2163.28 → 2165.68] it probably doesn't matter you're probably going to get away with it yeah
[2166.72 → 2170.56] they'll just be like what, and then it's probably fine, and you could even you could even you could
[2170.56 → 2176.32] even be like hey I used this loophole to steal one i I like kind of already ate it but like you should
[2176.32 → 2180.96] probably patch that loophole you know you could be like I'll trade you a moon cake for a bug report yeah
[2181.84 → 2187.76] you'd probably get away with that yeah 124 boxes of cakes that's just stupid I stole some micro USB
[2187.76 → 2194.32] cables you can if you want you can, you also told me about them yeah so it's not really
[2194.32 → 2199.12] stealing at that point is it okay it's taking without permission and then
[2201.28 → 2203.20] asking permission after the okay that is kind of
[2207.12 → 2214.48] there we go okay, okay our original oh actually oh original article for our sponsors speaking of

[2461.28 → 2466.56] about your company your products and or how they are related to each other than they do have their
[2466.56 → 2473.28] cover pages feature which lets you get that online in a matter of minutes which I guess is fine should
[2473.28 → 2478.00] you find yourself in a situation where you really don't have a lot of time because you're too busy being
[2478.00 → 2485.12] like a web 2.0 startup, and you're you know sipping your lattes and mocha lattes and grappa lattes and
[2485.12 → 2491.44] whatever it is to spend a lot of time writing out all the copy for your website but should you decide
[2491.44 → 2496.40] to build a more comprehensive website Squarespace has got you covered there too, and it's so simple
[2496.40 → 2502.72] that should you find yourself 30 with no web skills whatsoever and running a tech company where that
[2502.72 → 2510.24] kind of thing is very embarrassing Squarespace can bail you out so should your no i actually that was
[2510.24 → 2515.44] just a pause because I wasn't sure what my transition was going to be so now it's more difficult should
[2515.44 → 2522.32] you um find all of this exciting yes uh you could use offer code when to get 10 off your first purchase
[2522.32 → 2524.72] yes we did it
[2527.28 → 2534.88] oh that's basically okay people, so there's way farther more interesting topics like far below the fold
[2534.88 → 2540.32] oh seriously so they hit up they hid all the interesting stuff on us this week I mean this
[2540.32 → 2546.64] is interesting okay, so apple decided to put a barometric vent in the space where the iPhone 7
[2546.64 → 2554.08] headphone jack would have been so they're saying that uh this feature can measure minor changes like
[2554.08 → 2562.24] climbing a flight of stairs fascinating yeah um so basically it's coming back down to apple wanting to be a
[2562.24 → 2568.48] health measurement device company that seems to be where they're headed I mean it's one thing to sell
[2568.48 → 2573.68] an iPhone for a thousand dollars it's a whole other thing to sell a medical device for ten thousand
[2573.68 → 2581.44] dollars um yay so i can see where the appeal of getting into um, although hopefully we will wreck
[2581.44 → 2588.00] their hopes and dreams coming this hopefully not too long after this November oh are you going to be
[2588.00 → 2592.00] working on that thing should we tease it I don't think anyone else is going to rip off the idea
[2592.64 → 2596.72] sure I sent a follow-up they said they're still down for November so I'm working with a local
[2596.72 → 2601.04] university I'm not going to name who specifically it's a BA university they're awesome though yeah
[2601.04 → 2605.12] so like I'm not just saying that because like I know one person really well who flunked out of it
[2606.72 → 2612.88] who flunked out of it ah really I thought it was a different one nope okay no I went all the way to the
[2612.88 → 2620.32] top before I fell all the way down okay um anyway they're they're awesome they're perfect and i
[2620.32 → 2628.48] hold I hold no ill will I'm going to be working with their sports cardiology department to bench to do a
[2628.48 → 2636.08] benchmark of sorts against fitness trackers yeah like hopefully more than just way I want to see if
[2636.08 → 2639.28] we can do sleep tracking but I don't know if we're going to be able to do that okay I'm just because of like
[2639.28 → 2642.64] um just because of like lab hours and stuff like that but I'm I'm going to try to figure out because
[2642.64 → 2647.92] they do have a mobile thing anyway we'll try to figure it out yeah um but mainly heart rate
[2647.92 → 2654.48] tracking yeah so they have so basically we're going to get him hooked up to the proper gear we're gonna
[2654.48 → 2661.04] get a range as well because heart rate trackers work uh more or less effectively against different
[2661.04 → 2667.84] people so we're going to get like an athlete from that school and myself and like probably the guy
[2667.84 → 2671.36] that's running the program to get like I thought you were going to tell me I thought we were going from
[2671.36 → 2675.84] athlete to you to me and I was going to be like well a dick and b that's probably fine
[2677.36 → 2681.52] oh no your cardio is way better than mine I guarantee it my knees are just mess up I know
[2681.52 → 2686.40] I'm hoping that they're better I can move until I can't move any more right, right yeah
[2687.60 → 2693.44] a whole other thing but yeah so that should actually be really cool that was sprung largely from
[2693.44 → 2698.96] a while ago when we were talking on the wan show when Fitbit was getting like lawsuits for being
[2698.96 → 2704.00] bad things basically not reporting things correctly yeah so we want to look into that more deeply
[2704.00 → 2711.60] um so yeah tracking health things with little tiny devices that aren't very proven yet might not be a
[2711.60 → 2718.72] thing or might yep by the time we do that we should have an eye watch too um so unfortunately a lot of
[2718.72 → 2723.60] the like watches oh my god are going to be slightly replaced by then but dude how many of them did
[2723.60 → 2729.44] we buy a few uh to be fair though a lot was an overstatement I think only two of them will be
[2729.44 → 2733.68] replaced how much were they one of them was the I watch which we didn't buy for it that's true
[2733.68 → 2738.88] that's true so I think it's only one maybe I think I did end up paying for that though we didn't buy it
[2738.88 → 2743.28] for yeah no I bought it to review it though yeah yeah yeah because most of the ones like Microsoft
[2743.28 → 2748.40] hasn't come out with a new one yeah Garmin hasn't come out with a new one everyone's like Apple Watch no
[2748.40 → 2757.44] it is the I watch forever i refuse so anyway, so the barometer is maybe going to be
[2757.44 → 2765.84] useful for cool stuff like measuring altitude which I guess is pretty neat um I don't know I would trade
[2765.84 → 2771.60] a knife I would trade a headphone jack oh yeah for that personally um but at least they did something
[2771.60 → 2777.36] with it, you know what would be interesting if they made a barometer that went exactly flush with the phone
[2777.36 → 2781.36] if it was plugged into your headphone jack you know what would be really cool is if they made a
[2781.36 → 2794.16] barometer that could tell you how big they are what a barometer oh wow wow wow
[2794.72 → 2801.12] logical bought uh sci tech from mad cat logitalk there 's nope they only make phones now
[2801.12 → 2809.44] phones and headsets uh Logitech bought sci tech from mad cats this is awesome yeah I am excited yeah
[2811.04 → 2817.28] you can say why you're excited first um well okay we have a review we both like flight sticks we don't
[2817.28 → 2822.08] have enough time to spend with them but I like all kinds of sticks Jesus I like to put my hands around
[2822.08 → 2827.92] them like this I have a review on the warthog, and you have a review on a sci tech system I don't remember
[2827.92 → 2836.72] exactly which one um x52 and I'm happy because I think Logitech will do more with it
[2837.92 → 2842.72] okay most people just go this way yeah i I mean I didn't I didn't say I was good at this I like them
[2843.44 → 2852.16] right um so anyway so why I'm excited about this is there are things that sci tech the division of
[2852.16 → 2862.24] mad okay there are things that mad cats does well and there are things that sci tech used to do well
[2862.24 → 2868.56] before they were acquired by mad cats like um you know actually making these products for crying out
[2868.56 → 2876.80] loud like actually making joysticks because that's not that I mean it used to be that you know other than
[2876.80 → 2884.80] thrust master and sci tech there were actual brands that Microsoft used to make them yeah Logitech used
[2884.80 → 2892.80] to have them like, and then it just died along with the space sim um along with the space sim and Microsoft's
[2892.80 → 2898.56] flight simulator and like yeah, so there's stuff that sci tech did well and then there's stuff that Logitech does
[2898.56 → 2908.96] well which is make a good idea which is what sci tech had and uh mad cats owned um so take a good idea
[2908.96 → 2913.20] and a product people want to buy and make sure that the quality of it is good and that it lasts for a
[2913.20 → 2920.48] long time so I would be really excited to see what kind of sci tech products we see with some kind
[2920.48 → 2927.28] of care and attention given to making them feel good and last a long time and operate well
[2928.56 → 2937.20] uh this will hopefully line up with like the g 29 and g920 the driving force steering wheels
[2937.20 → 2941.92] which I reviewed a while back were actually like really awesome just saying you should go check
[2941.92 → 2946.40] out that review they're really cool yeah and I told you I brought the but to the office now right
[2946.96 → 2952.08] so the plan I think what Jake wanted to do was uh set it up in the VR room like we might end up just
[2952.08 → 2957.60] taking all the furniture out of there I want it all yeah something like that having one like small bench
[2957.60 → 2964.00] could be helpful yeah or even one couch um like or like a luxury or like one chair or something like
[2964.00 → 2967.28] that I think would be pretty cool because having a viewer for whatever you're doing is nice
[2967.28 → 2973.12] yeah, but we don't need to like that giant thing yeah um and having the but in that one like nook corner
[2973.12 → 2978.24] thing yeah is would be awesome that'd be perfect so I'm I'm super excited about this I'm not a Logitech
[2978.24 → 2984.16] fanboy I just have a certain amount of respect for building products that are designed to last and
[2984.16 → 2990.24] Logitech seems to generally care about that for the most part yeah um all right Google Maps can show
[2990.24 → 2999.36] how much you are speeding, so the original article here is from ours technical and users report that a
[2999.36 → 3004.48] speed limit sign is showing up in the bottom corner of Google Maps it's about time because this has been
[3004.48 → 3012.24] a feature on other GPS programs for quite some time and is something that I personally am often curious
[3012.24 → 3019.28] about and don't understand why I need to like look at signs for anymore in the modern digital age very
[3019.28 → 3027.68] cool that's probably about all we got to say for that there's no like uh it's just random user reports
[3027.68 → 3032.08] apparently nothing official so google hasn't stated anything this is not surprising they do this all
[3032.08 → 3036.40] the time they're probably a blog post once it's much more ubiquitous across their platform you probably
[3036.40 → 3040.96] only roll it out to a very small percentage of so it's a server side switch uh, but the code started
[3040.96 → 3047.44] showing up in Google Maps 9.35 yeah so yeah I'm excited I wish it would also tell you how fast
[3047.44 → 3052.24] you're going but I understand why they don't do that like uh I don't know you probably haven't been
[3052.24 → 3057.68] driving long enough but uh when I first started driving those uh those radar things those displays
[3057.68 → 3061.84] on the side of the road that tell you how fast you're going when you're in a construction zone or a
[3061.84 → 3066.88] school zone or whatever else they didn't have a cap on them, so people would blow past them to clock
[3066.88 → 3074.56] themselves um yeah so now when you're going no I definitely remember that okay that was a thing
[3074.56 → 3081.84] now when you're going more than 20 over it just says too fast slow down yeah um so I understand why
[3081.84 → 3087.36] they don't necessarily want to put that in because for the same reason that they don't build in
[3087.36 → 3094.88] tools to like to tell you how much you beat the original estimated time by um I think my record
[3094.88 → 3100.96] is like 15 minutes on a 55-minute drive or something like that, but you have to do it manually you have to
[3100.96 → 3104.64] do it yourself if you want to know things like that um, but that's why they don't build that in because
[3104.64 → 3112.72] they don't want to encourage people to speed um yeah oh well here's and here's an interesting uh
[3113.28 → 3119.44] here's an interesting article oh yeah Microsoft crashes google's the latest chrome battery life claims
[3120.16 → 3125.36] dun dun dun dun, so this is a video that they actually um ran a little while ago and that
[3126.40 → 3130.64] uh I'm still working on it and I can talk about it openly right now okay that we are working on
[3130.64 → 3137.04] replicating to find out if this is actually true or not there are problems with this whole deal and a lot
[3137.04 → 3143.60] of them revolve around Windows 10 just being like a little this might be the wrong word for it
[3143.60 → 3152.16] I'm getting so predictable yeah crazy it'll just do like outsold things dr Jekyll Mr Hyde yeah um like
[3152.16 → 3157.84] we've got four identical machines yeah we have tried to run these tests I like tweeted about it at some
[3157.84 → 3164.56] point and basically Luke's run into everything under the sun so many different problems and like these are
[3164.56 → 3171.12] all the same machine all running at the same time with the same software installed the same settings
[3171.12 → 3175.68] everything wow you're like channelling Dennis there a little bit yeah, and they'll be different by
[3176.56 → 3183.12] many hours with the same browser doing the same thing so that's the thing is we're trying to do just
[3183.12 → 3190.08] the control yeah I'm all running the same browser many hours different same laptop same browser exactly
[3190.08 → 3195.20] same load they'll be watching a YouTube video same programs installed same things running which is
[3195.20 → 3200.96] like essentially nothing one of them will ask for like I think I was doing Google Chrome but not this
[3200.96 → 3205.12] update of it, and it's not the exact same load that they have here, and it's not the exact same laptop
[3205.12 → 3209.04] so don't worry too much about comparing it to the numbers that we just saw but I think it was like
[3209.04 → 3214.24] three and a half hours two of them lasted for about three and a half hours yeah and then two exactly the
[3214.24 → 3219.60] same laptops as the other ones we were just looking at would last for like five hours and 15 minutes it's just like
[3220.24 → 3228.08] what is going on yeah I'm I'm picturing the Jackie Chan meme but like my head is full of yeah yeah
[3228.08 → 3236.24] yeah exactly i just what I don't know I'm going to do like full reformats on all of them and I think
[3236.24 → 3240.80] what I'm going to have to do is like completely disable all like windows defender and firewall and like
[3241.76 → 3248.24] everything that windows can properly have there been a problem lately where if you had sound enhancements
[3248.24 → 3255.36] enabled um even if none of the boxes were checked if you had none of the sound enhancements
[3255.36 → 3262.64] on, but you had the sound enhancements enabled it could take up like 20 of your CPU at a time
[3262.64 → 3272.08] or some crap like that like oh my god so uh yeah I don't know it's a nightmare right now but hopefully
[3272.08 → 3279.12] we will have our own benchmarks of that eventually great British scientists have developed a cheaper
[3279.12 → 3286.80] unbreakable touchscreen for smartphones the original article here is from news.com.au have you posted I have
[3286.80 → 3292.56] not got it I have not posted a thing so I already hate it I hate it so much I think they're stupid
[3292.56 → 3300.16] and liars and I'm angry cool it's an unbreakable I'm getting exhausted of this crap it's really
[3300.16 → 3307.28] starting to piss me off oh our device is waterproof uh yes you do a bunch more research and find
[3307.28 → 3314.16] from like a third party that's like ip67 it's not waterproof it's not the right word so much anger
[3314.16 → 3319.68] unbreakable is bullshit I guarantee you if the US was like yep we'll nuke it, it wouldn't be there
[3319.68 → 3328.48] any more god stop it I just like someone in the chat said triggered yes I think these words are
[3328.48 → 3332.32] literally getting to the point where they're starting to like mentally trigger me whenever
[3332.32 → 3335.92] I see someone that's like oh yes our battery bank is waterproof I'm just like
[3337.36 → 3342.96] like I think they should like be fined fairly significant amounts of money because it's actually
[3342.96 → 3346.64] just completely bullshit maybe that's why he doesn't take pictures of you because you do that
[3348.64 → 3354.32] he's very unhelpful unbreakable why are you taking all these pictures around the oh you're reviewing
[3354.32 → 3359.76] that camera yeah oh it's kind of cheating to take all of your pictures in like a studio with studio
[3359.76 → 3363.92] lights you're not just doing that when he was in my office and took a picture that's definitely not
[3363.92 → 3368.96] studio lights but anyway okay I think they should actually genuinely be fined because they're uh misleading
[3368.96 → 3372.40] information about their products I think so to the problem they're lying about their products the
[3372.40 → 3377.60] problem is who's going to oversee this it's there are organizations for this in the states
[3377.60 → 3381.92] they're just not doing it they're just not doing it yeah they have like bigger fish to fry yeah so
[3381.92 → 3385.76] basically they're underfunded and undermanned but if they could figure out a way to actually get these
[3385.76 → 3390.08] fines going a bunch of like not as well paid employees that just hunt these like
[3390.08 → 3396.64] asshole battery companies and shit like that and just wreck all of them until they all just stop and then that
[3396.64 → 3402.40] would be good because like I'm I'm exhausted of it your battery bank is not waterproof twitch chat
[3402.40 → 3409.12] is just like triggered triggered I am though it's oh man it pisses me off all right
[3409.12 → 3417.28] so it's reportedly a fifth of the cost of current touch screens and then I have no idea what this is
[3417.28 → 3426.48] supposed to oh 14 Australian dollars compared to 70 Australian dollars a square meter for indium tin oxide
[3426.48 → 3431.44] and this technology could be rolled out as soon as 2018. So currently the electrodes and touch screens
[3431.44 → 3436.16] are made from indium tin oxide, but the supplies are slowly running out because that's what humans do
[3436.16 → 3440.48] and so they're searching for the next electrically conductive material that could be used by manufacturers
[3440.48 → 3444.80] until we use up all of that so scientists in Britain have been looking at hybrid materials that can
[3444.80 → 3451.52] conduct electricity and using a simple and inexpensive method they're producing hybrid electrodes from silver nanowires and graphene
[3451.52 → 3459.04] so okay once if this gets released anything can we get it and can I do like a tech racks level
[3459.60 → 3465.44] video where I just destroy the thing and then just like end it with like screw you and then just like
[3465.44 → 3470.48] move on I feel like if I agree to this now you're going to remember, and you're going to actually do it i
[3470.48 → 3478.72] will it's up to you okay no, no nothing is ever up to me oh straw poll it is up to the viewers because I okay
[3478.72 → 3483.36] so to explain a little bit I'm going to go back in conversations that Microsoft web browser test
[3483.36 → 3487.84] thing the reason why we're doing it is that I want to start a video series where we I don't
[3487.84 → 3492.08] remember exactly what it's called I think we were going to call it ship manufacturers say yeah going
[3492.08 → 3497.92] back to like memes from a long time ago yeah um but I'm old it was basically testing claims of
[3497.92 → 3503.44] manufacturers and the reason why I thought of doing this kind of thing was making my battery bank videos
[3503.44 → 3511.04] in Mexico because I think every single brand except for Cairo lied right which is like insane
[3511.04 → 3515.84] and it brings back that same thing from before where like everyone uses clickbait because everyone
[3515.84 → 3520.48] has to use clickbait right because they wouldn't be able to sell because everyone else is lying yeah and
[3520.48 → 3525.44] Cairo saying water-resistant looks worse than the other people saying waterproof right even though the
[3525.44 → 3533.44] other people are lying okay well apparently no one thinks that I'm right or five percent all right you
[3533.44 → 3541.20] win so go ahead you get to break the first uh bone in 2018 or whatever whenever it actually happens yeah
[3541.20 → 3547.04] whenever it actually happens maybe you could put an arrow through it sweet no it's been done Marcus did
[3547.04 → 3554.00] it with the uh sapphire glass okay is that his name Marcus yeah yeah it's Marcus or Marquez
[3554.00 → 3561.84] Brownlee yeah oh i thought you're talking about tech rack oh no yeah okay no Marcus okay yeah
[3564.32 → 3564.64] um
[3567.44 → 3571.12] yeah I don't know i just that stuff really pisses me off this is great
[3571.76 → 3578.72] FBI director cover up your webcam with a piece of tape love is original article here
[3578.72 → 3583.84] if you have a c920 they sell a little plastic flip cover things for it that are actually pretty nice
[3584.00 → 3589.28] check that out oh do you have one uh I'm it's literally been ordered already but I don't have
[3589.28 → 3596.56] it yet interesting so uh James Comey defended putting a piece of tape over his personal laptop's webcam
[3596.56 → 3603.60] claims the security step was a common sense one that most should take many Asus laptops have um slide
[3603.60 → 3610.16] covers the little you've seen that right yep it's like a mechanical switch, and you like I don't think they
[3610.16 → 3615.20] have them anymore really yeah I think it's because your old one has it right yeah yeah I think it's
[3615.20 → 3621.76] less common now yeah um so there you go yeah mom and dad that laptop that you know have used the little
[3621.76 → 3626.24] thing, so the quote is there are some there are some sensible things you should be doing and that's one
[3626.24 → 3631.04] of them you do that so people who don't have the authority don't look at you, I think that's a good thing
[3631.04 → 3643.52] fair enough man cool um uh apparently someone from an oil company the quest integrity group tried to
[3643.52 → 3655.60] impersonate Elon Musk by making an email account Elon tesla at yahoo.com and then emailed tesla's CFO
[3655.60 → 3666.16] asking for non-public information like company sales and financial projections what the hell
[3669.36 → 3673.84] oh yeah this will totally work I'll make it Elon tesla at yahoo.com
[3675.20 → 3678.24] I mean you can tell he's old because he uses yahoo
[3678.24 → 3685.60] yeah but oh man that's hilarious
[3689.36 → 3697.76] come on it's like just a random email from Elon hey yeah could I get some uh you know some uh
[3697.76 → 3703.44] financial projections that would be good if you can just email those to me right now if you could is you
[3703.44 → 3710.32] could email them at yahoo yeah then uh yeah you know I don't want to use the Google because uh yahoo
[3710.32 → 3717.28] sounds more credible somehow yeah it says Elon Musk says Elon Musk that's wonderful uh oh this is a
[3717.28 → 3727.36] rumour, so the original article here is from overclock3d.net there are leaked supposed GTX 1080 ti specifications
[3727.36 → 3733.12] dun dun dun don't dun so hypothetically it'll be somewhere between the 1080 and the titan x
[3733.76 → 3740.64] uh it'll be very close to the titan x, and it will have uh slightly fewer Cuba cores slightly fewer SMS
[3741.28 → 3750.48] uh it'll have uh blah blah blah 384 bit bus 12 gigs ram no DDR no DDR oh interesting well
[3750.48 → 3754.32] there's where a lot of the cost savings is coming from I wonder if that's a big part of the reason why
[3754.32 → 3762.96] titan x is so expensive mm-hmm 1080 is also a lot more expensive than 1070, and it's like 12 gigs of
[3762.96 → 3767.36] it ah no maybe not that probably math probably doesn't work for that anyway apparently it is
[3767.36 → 3775.84] clocked higher though and has the same TDP so we can expect then that much like with the original titan x
[3775.84 → 3783.04] and the 980 ti that the titan XP and the 1080 ti are actually going to end up performing very
[3783.04 → 3788.00] similarly because if it's clocked if it has fewer functional units, and it's their able to clock
[3788.00 → 3791.84] it a little higher out of the box it'll probably boost a little higher too um so it wouldn't
[3791.84 → 3798.88] surprise me if basically anyone who bought a titan x is going to be crying um once the 1080 ti gets
[3798.88 → 3803.84] released but I mean that's the price you pay for being on the bleeding edge like I get it um and you
[3803.84 → 3810.32] should get it too yep that's kind of how that goes i think I brought something up about that
[3810.96 → 3815.60] in the titan XP review but I don't remember I don't remember either that was a very blurry
[3815.60 → 3822.00] time in my life it was with the whole workcation and like people hating it I have a new idea for
[3822.00 → 3827.84] a Christmas bonus this year titan XP that doesn't involve going I have heard yes it's cool um
