[0.00 → 5.00] Funny story to start the show.
[5.00 → 7.00] Is this going to be nipple related?
[7.00 → 8.00] No, it's not.
[8.00 → 10.00] Oh, that's a shame.
[10.00 → 11.00] Right?
[11.00 → 17.00] Anyway, when I came back from Taiwan, I came into YVR, the airport that is near us.
[17.00 → 19.00] Don't worry about it.
[19.00 → 20.00] Statue with nipples.
[20.00 → 22.00] No, no, unfortunately not.
[22.00 → 24.00] Are you going to work nipples into this at some point?
[24.00 → 25.00] No, actually.
[25.00 → 26.00] None.
[26.00 → 27.00] Crap.
[27.00 → 29.00] Okay, so you came to the Vancouver airport.
[29.00 → 30.00] I'll try.
[30.00 → 31.00] I'll see if I can do it.
[31.00 → 32.00] Which is in Richmond, by the way.
[32.00 → 33.00] Vancouver International Airport, not in Vancouver.
[33.00 → 34.00] Yes.
[34.00 → 35.00] It's in the Greater Vancouver area.
[35.00 → 36.00] That's true.
[36.00 → 40.00] Or Greater Vancouver Regional District, as it's actually called.
[40.00 → 42.00] The GTA is the Greater Toronto area.
[42.00 → 44.00] The GVRG, sucker.
[44.00 → 46.00] Okay, my bad.
[46.00 → 50.00] Anyway, the Wi-Fi network there does one of those things where you have to approve your
[50.00 → 53.00] login thing through a portal and whatever.
[53.00 → 56.00] I was trying to do it, and it wasn't working, and I needed internet at that point in time,
[56.00 → 59.00] so I was like, whatever, and turned my Wi-Fi off.
[59.00 → 61.00] Didn't really think about it.
[61.00 → 67.00] A little while later, using my phone, and it's like, oh, your Wi-Fi, your data has been
[67.00 → 69.00] turned off because you're at your maximum.
[69.00 → 73.00] My warning didn't come through, or I swiped it without realizing it because I hate it when
[73.00 → 76.00] notifications load while you're in your notification bar.
[76.00 → 79.00] I might have swiped it without actually seeing it.
[79.00 → 86.00] So my data is dead, and I think I'm like six days into the month or something.
[86.00 → 88.00] So that sucks.
[88.00 → 90.00] I have a dumb phone for a while.
[90.00 → 93.00] Well, your smartphone, just a dumb user.
[93.00 → 95.00] Yeah, that's fair.
[95.00 → 99.00] So I guess, yeah, I failed to work nipples into that.
[99.00 → 100.00] Yeah, you did.
[100.00 → 103.00] That's okay because I can work nipples into anything.
[103.00 → 109.00] People are asking us to turn the mic up, but I just did a test recording, and it was fine.
[109.00 → 113.00] So I guess I had the volume a little high.
[113.00 → 115.00] Actually, I don't even know why that worked at all.
[115.00 → 120.00] What I just did in terms of testing, maybe I could load up the stream and see if people
[120.00 → 121.00] are messing with me in the meantime.
[121.00 → 124.00] Why don't you let them know what fantastic topics we have for them today?
[124.00 → 133.00] So we have the whole catastrophe around TeamViewer, all the accounts being hacked into or passwords
[133.00 → 136.00] being known or whatever because those aren't really the same thing.
[136.00 → 138.00] But anyway, we'll talk about that later.
[138.00 → 142.00] Gawker has officially filed for bankruptcy and is saying some other stuff.
[142.00 → 149.00] Sony officially confirms the 4K-ready PlayStation, but I believe it's not being announced at E3 or something.
[149.00 → 154.00] And I don't actually know a fourth topic that's interesting.
[154.00 → 156.00] You sound wonderful to me, by the way.
[156.00 → 157.00] Do I?
[157.00 → 160.00] Yeah, I'm at like 38% on my system volume.
[160.00 → 162.00] So, I'm...
[162.00 → 164.00] Okay!
[164.00 → 165.00] Space mining!
[165.00 → 166.00] Space mining.
[166.00 → 167.00] What?
[167.00 → 168.00] I don't know.
[168.00 → 169.00] I didn't see that.
[169.00 → 170.00] Alright, space mining.
[170.00 → 171.00] We might not talk about that one.
[171.00 → 172.00] Yeah, we may not get to that.
[172.00 → 173.00] Yeah.
[173.00 → 174.00] Intro time!
[174.00 → 175.00] Cool!
[179.00 → 206.00] Tune your Wi-Fi back on for a week.
[206.00 → 211.84] back on for a week or maybe not gross maybe it's like hot oh if you're into that sort of thing
[211.84 → 218.50] like phone spit yeah that's probably not good all right apparently the intro is loud well you know
[218.50 → 225.10] what you guys there is only so much I can oh there's only so much I can do Jim's address says
[225.10 → 233.10] ow and also that it's pre-recorded I think no it's not pre-recorded all right so let's get into some
[233.10 → 240.68] topics first up we've got and I actually have no idea whether um whether Luke said that this was
[240.68 → 247.94] going to be one of our one of our main topics for this week yeah gawker is no more at least in its
[247.94 → 254.80] current form maybe someday it will reach its final form but that won't be its current form uh they
[254.80 → 261.92] filed for bankruptcy and have said that they will sell the company uh the headline says to riff Davis
[261.92 → 268.24] or someone else that I don't think it's necessarily gawker saying they're going to sell to riff Davis it's
[268.24 → 274.08] that riff Davis has an offer in on them for somewhere to the tune of 90 to 100 million dollars you know
[274.08 → 275.62] maybe I should just buy gawker
[275.62 → 283.68] what yeah I know you know for a fact that I can't that's not gonna work and afford that also just
[283.68 → 290.94] doesn't sound like a good idea yeah why would we do that if we could just like life hacker I said a
[290.94 → 294.00] tweet about this earlier I was like I don't really care about the rest of it but if life hacker
[294.00 → 299.48] survives that would be cool yeah if we could just consume like just them I'd be down with that i
[299.48 → 303.10] mean theoretically we could use some of the upstairs office space for that make them all Canadians
[303.10 → 309.94] theoretically they could sell individual publications so uh, so gawker is uh life hacker
[309.94 → 320.48] Jezebel dead spin gawker.com Gizmodo Kodak Salonika uh and yeah Jezebel and uh dead spin I don't know if you said that
[320.48 → 325.94] yeah no you said dead spin actually, but you know good job um you said it twice which is important
[325.94 → 333.74] for people who didn't hear you the first yeah um so out of all of those yeah I think life hacker i
[333.74 → 339.58] I didn't use to mine Gizmodo but I can't remember the last time I went on that site I liked them i
[339.58 → 346.86] think when I was like 16 yeah let's see if that lines up no how old were you in 2009 19 you were
[346.86 → 353.66] 19 or well 18 for most of it 18 okay so I was close very close I was actually quite close okay so um
[353.66 → 361.42] um basically yeah they're filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy um actually yeah I think so
[361.42 → 366.98] excellent it was right around there yes um so they're they're they've announced their chapter
[366.98 → 374.06] 11 filing uh basically that puts them in protection from creditors for the time being while they
[374.06 → 380.92] sort of entertain offers to buy the company um gawker and nick Denton have said that they will not
[380.92 → 387.28] pay Hulk Hogan and peter Thiel the 140 million dollars they have told their employees that they
[387.28 → 393.56] still plan to fight the case and to operate the publishing business while they do so um
[393.56 → 400.30] but riff Davis has come out and said there's uh let me just see if I can bring up the uh the article
[400.30 → 405.88] here, so this was in an internal memo it does say for less than 100 million dollars yeah like I'm
[405.88 → 410.90] assuming not a ton less there are conflicting reports so this particular one on recode.net says
[410.90 → 415.86] for around 100 million, but it should be noted that they may end up paying more because this is
[415.86 → 422.66] just their initial bid for it and actually nothing to do necessarily with um how much it'll end up
[422.66 → 427.78] selling for someone else could make a counteroffer yep it could end up being a bidding war over
[427.78 → 435.86] Jezebel yep which I guess someone wants apparently um I didn't know that these sites as a whole were
[435.86 → 446.58] still that big I had no idea online written media publications were still worth like tens of millions
[446.58 → 452.50] of dollars each I mean I guess it's sort of enormous amounts of traffic um this is a perfect clip
[452.50 → 459.14] with nick Denton basically saying um nope I stand by the decision to publish that even in light of
[459.14 → 464.98] everything that has happened um he's expressed a lot of frustration with peter Thiel basically
[465.62 → 474.34] public basically funding this lawsuit as a way to um I think i I forget I was reading some article
[474.34 → 478.66] about it but the quote from him was something to the effect don't quote me on this that's a quote of
[478.66 → 485.62] a quote that's not an accurate quote but sick um so the so something to the effect of that it's not
[485.62 → 492.58] vengeance, but it's more of like a cautionary sort of like it's more of a deterrent I think was some
[492.58 → 500.34] something close to the word that was used um against publishing articles that are basic that basically
[500.34 → 507.22] amount to bullying so that was sort of how he interpreted the Hulk Hogan article where this
[507.22 → 514.42] sort of this individual was being bullied by a publication that uh published an article and indeed a
[514.42 → 523.06] sex tape video of him um banging to use the term that the kids use these days I think uh a friend's
[523.06 → 530.18] wife did they say that yeah banging still a thing cool still a thing really you have to throw that in at
[530.18 → 535.62] me yeah well I guess that's still a thing if you're an old man well like how long has banging been around
[535.62 → 542.50] for I don't know a long time I'm sure my dad is like well versed with that term the term or what are we
[542.50 → 551.30] talking about I'm here so probably both just being honest it's almost Father's Day you got nine days
[551.30 → 558.82] to figure it out to figure out if he's your father or well maybe that could be the situation
[558.82 → 567.54] okay so Luke's parents aside, and they're whatever they don't still watch Sancho do they probably do
[567.54 → 577.86] oh that's a shame hi mom and dad um so it'll be a court supervised auction and uh basically the
[577.86 → 584.66] lawsuit one way or the other will have to be resolved before nick uh before excuse me riff Davis is going
[584.66 → 592.18] to have any interest in taking uh taking possession of it and uh yeah that's basically how it went down
[592.18 → 598.50] um, um would this make you think twice about publishing a sex tape on Linus tech tips
[604.26 → 608.98] why why would we publish a sex tape online i I didn't say we I said you so
[608.98 → 614.98] okay no we should do this, but we should do it with like uh like computer components
[614.98 → 621.14] oh man we should like to make a fake Hulk Hogan
[624.66 → 632.74] no I want and have it water cool someone else's computer I want no part I want no part of
[632.74 → 638.50] this I just want we've got people asking for us to review a sex bot
[638.50 → 647.06] okay let's talk hold on our robots let's turn does our robot yeah but Taryn wouldn't know what to do
[647.06 → 656.02] with the sex so let's talk let's talk seriously again for a minute would you do an objective review
[657.62 → 665.78] of a sex robot uh okay I mean we'd have to be careful what we show in b-roll and not in b-roll
[665.78 → 671.14] right but would you benchmark it and host the video i think like
[672.58 → 678.98] the journalistic side of me is like yeah and then there's like I'm in a relationship no
[680.10 → 687.86] so but what if the I think is it cheating if it's a robot probably is it like because I mean they're
[687.86 → 692.74] not that sophisticated at this point yeah at this point I think basically they just do pre-programmed
[692.74 → 698.02] you are attempting to because this ties into another conversation which is like
[699.06 → 702.90] is porn okay while you're in a relationship and this is like stuff you need to decide in
[702.90 → 707.30] your relationship yeah I'm not saying as a general statement I mean with you and your partner yes
[707.30 → 713.38] it's porn okay and then on top of that is VR porn okay because they're actually pretty different
[714.02 → 722.10] right yeah VR porn is very much putting you in that scenario yeah with like uh directional audio
[722.10 → 725.30] so you feel like you're there and like if the person's talking to you, you can hear where it's
[725.30 → 729.78] coming from like all that like crazy stuff yeah which is like on another level, and then you're
[729.78 → 734.26] stepping up again you think so I think each one of those will reduce the amount of people that are
[734.26 → 740.82] okay you don't think actually i i would argue I would argue the other way so I think porn is
[740.82 → 745.54] where it is so we both lets establish that porn is a baseline okay, and you know your baseline could
[745.54 → 748.90] be it's like super okay and mine could be it's super not okay or the other way around whatever
[748.90 → 753.62] it doesn't matter let's call two-dimensional porn the baseline sure and let's talk like two
[753.62 → 758.10] dimensional is like on a screen let's talk let's talk like straight guy on girl if you're a straight
[758.10 → 765.14] person like like like vanilla porn like sure not like animals or whatever because I wasn't really
[765.14 → 772.02] okay like I'm thinking like two two-dimensional like just kind of vanilla porn whatever fits in your
[772.02 → 777.06] preferences yeah like whatever would be vanilla for you everyone's vanilla can be a little different you
[777.06 → 782.90] know chocolate strawberry vanilla we're talking vanilla okay so that's our baseline okay I would
[782.90 → 793.86] make the argument that a robot is actually less akin to a real life sexual experience than I see where
[793.86 → 799.38] you're coming from with that, but you also have problems where and certainly less than uh than toy
[799.38 → 806.26] assisted VR toy assisted VR toy assisted VR is way up there um with the robot though you are directly
[806.26 → 814.34] trying to replace the person in the actions that they do, and it is possible to get somewhat emotionally
[814.34 → 823.30] attached to a robot so like you are actually attempting to replace the functionality of the partner yeah
[823.30 → 830.82] which is also why VR toy assisted would probably would that top the robot for you, I don't know
[831.62 → 837.78] they're both like, so these are both like no zone for you this is really awkward uh
[838.74 → 843.78] well remember we're talking when you're in a relationship and remember your no zone can be
[843.78 → 848.74] sort of what you're comfortable with someone else engaging in while you're in a relationship like it
[848.74 → 855.30] goes a two-way street yeah yeah so are both of this gray area at the very least to say okay
[855.30 → 864.02] would need like a discussion blah blah blah okay, okay interesting see i how did we get here I don't know
[865.46 → 874.90] but i i i I wholly disagree okay I think that the robot and then okay i and I'm saying inanimate object
[874.90 → 880.82] I understand that not all of them are completely inanimate um some of them like blink and stuff
[881.30 → 888.58] oh okay yeah yeah um but I would make the argument that an inanimate object is less like a real
[888.58 → 897.62] experience than an actor on a screen uh, but it's not happening directly to you
[899.78 → 904.34] that's true but nothing's happening to you, I mean let's face it you're doing all the work in either
[904.34 → 911.38] scenario that might be true in relationships as well though wow shots fired not even sorry to hear
[911.38 → 918.18] that bro no, no that's not true at all but I'm saying for some people that is a reality it's its
[918.18 → 925.06] I'm sorry but like it is okay sure fair enough people are saying next topic, and they're probably
[925.06 → 932.42] right there yeah yeah um what is next topic Sony officially confirms the 4k ready PlayStation excellent
[932.42 → 939.22] so original article here is from the verge confirms a PS4 console upgrade, but it won't
[940.26 → 944.18] be at e3 which raises the question of what will be at e3
[947.78 → 952.42] don't know people were asking me like at computer and stuff they're like you've done e3 before are you
[952.42 → 958.90] going this year I was like nope like oh why not it's because we're not well you know what's funny is we
[958.90 → 965.22] missed a year when e3 was like the yeah, and then we were like okay we'll do it next year but the
[965.22 → 971.06] problem is that we're not in the console mindset like we don't even understand what qualifies as
[971.06 → 977.30] like a big e3 for console people because it's all just kind of e3 yeah so it's like yeah all the consoles
[977.30 → 984.02] are launching this year we don't go the next year all the consoles launched last year we go, and it's like
[984.02 → 989.38] here's some game with games with some tessellation or something the problem is even if we did go the
[989.38 → 995.78] previous year it was probably just keynotes wasn't it just keynotes like I'm pretty sure we just
[995.78 → 1001.14] watched those in the office I remember like talking to you because we were both scripting and half
[1001.14 → 1007.62] watching at the same time as we basically more or less went just virtually not to tie back to the
[1007.62 → 1014.34] previous conversation yeah I mean on that subject man I went to uh I think two keynotes yeah two
[1014.34 → 1019.46] keynotes at computer this year I went to one let's just not do them anymore yep they are the worst thing
[1019.46 → 1026.98] ever yep there is nothing that I can learn in a keynote that I can't learn and like by yeah I don't know
[1026.98 → 1033.30] the most valuable thing I think we could do from a keynote um and the keynote that I went to
[1033.30 → 1039.14] was an NVIDIA one and what I did was I just periscope live-streamed the whole thing which like
[1040.34 → 1044.90] I did that because I don't think it was being live-streamed right the stream that I did uh
[1044.90 → 1049.46] twitch stream of at the NVIDIA event when I didn't have a table and was like crammed in these tiny
[1049.46 → 1054.34] freaking seats in the back trying to hold my camera up while supporting my laptop was horrible I don't
[1054.34 → 1059.54] even really know why people watched I tried to like I tried to even get reactions from like jay and
[1059.54 → 1063.62] the other people that are sitting beside me and I turned the camera and the HDMI cable would disconnect
[1064.90 → 1070.26] because it wasn't a very stable connection um, but there's like live tweets, but then we don't have to
[1070.26 → 1080.42] be there in order to do that right I don't know um, so this is actually this is actually sort of uh an
[1080.42 → 1087.86] ongoing an ongoing scandal so I don't know if some of you have seen it but source fed is claiming that
[1087.86 → 1094.34] google manipulated search results um in favour of Hillary Clinton it's actually a very well
[1094.34 → 1099.78] constructed video a very compelling sounding argument for uh for how big this has become I'm
[1099.78 → 1104.18] surprised it doesn't have way more views yeah it's actually only got about a quarter million views let's
[1104.18 → 1111.22] go ahead and pop that up on our screen here so they basically say okay look uh here's the popularity
[1111.22 → 1118.82] of certain um search terms for example Hillary Clinton indictment and Hillary Clinton India you
[1118.82 → 1125.62] can see indictment is much more popular than India according to google's own interest over time and
[1125.62 → 1132.90] they point out that when you actually enter Hillary Clinton IND into google search it comes up with Indiana
[1132.90 → 1141.14] India independent voters Indiana campaign absolutely nothing about indictment as a suggested search with the
[1141.62 → 1150.82] argument being made by source fed being that you should be suggesting search topics based on autocomplete
[1150.82 → 1159.62] based on what people are actually searching for that would start with those letters um, so this is this
[1159.62 → 1166.50] is very quickly turning into they also showed like I think it was yahoo and bing typing the exact same thing
[1166.50 → 1173.86] and yahoo and bing reacted the exact same way that they would have expected yeah, so indictment was the top uh
[1173.86 → 1179.94] suggested with that said I wouldn't use bing search as an indication of what is relevant necessarily
[1179.94 → 1184.74] although they make again a good point it's very well constructed video actually I watched the whole thing
[1184.74 → 1192.02] start to finish I was like wow that was very cogent um anyway so they make the argument that if there's
[1192.02 → 1195.30] three people in a room and I think it went something along don't quote me on this again
[1195.30 → 1200.74] three people in a room and one of them says I'm in a room and two of them say I'm on the room's on fire
[1200.74 → 1204.98] you know you should probably go with the two people who are saying hey the room's on fire and not the
[1204.98 → 1212.02] person that it's what's relevant information I guess is the point um now the defence up on the verge
[1212.02 → 1218.98] already google denies oh and there 's's like there's like a whole like um Illuminati thing about
[1218.98 → 1227.22] how um Larry Page uh funded or owns a company that I think that's actually no, no it's true yeah yeah
[1227.22 → 1233.22] yeah yeah I mean to be clear I'm not saying Illuminati confirmed like you know uh Mr peanut on
[1233.22 → 1240.50] the peanut butter jar the American dad not the Illuminati yeah it's this like tech-based company
[1240.50 → 1247.06] that Larry Page is funding that is helping Hillary's campaign that is being uh contracted
[1247.06 → 1253.78] by Hillary's campaign something to the tune of 177 000 177 000 in a quarter which sounds like a lot
[1253.78 → 1260.10] of money to normal people like you and me, but this is important right now in the context of Larry Page
[1260.10 → 1265.70] that means nothing he probably keeps that amount of money in every pair of shoes in the event that he
[1265.70 → 1271.46] gets robbed, and he needs to you know grab some money for walking around out of somewhere that
[1271.46 → 1280.98] the robber wouldn't have gotten it from yeah that sucks it's right here then, and we're back Illuminati
[1280.98 → 1288.42] freaking confirmed you were waiting on that the whole time right Hillary Clinton showed up outside the door
[1288.42 → 1296.74] of our warehouse walked in with like armed guards behind her dressed in black and told us well not
[1296.74 → 1303.22] us told our computer yeah you blue screen right now, or we are not walking out of this place yeah
[1304.42 → 1311.38] and it did it happened josh was there okay, so the last thing happened our computer blue screen I'm not
[1311.38 → 1315.94] really sure what the deal was with that something to do with attempted switch from DPC
[1315.94 → 1319.62] which is something to do with maybe a real tech wireless driver we don't have any real tech devices
[1319.62 → 1324.42] in this computer mini card it seems to be like one of those catch-all dump don't we don't have any of
[1324.42 → 1330.18] those that's that's for sure so let's get back into um into what I was talking about what the hell
[1330.18 → 1339.46] was I talking about before okay um so right uh medium doc where was I going with this okay, so the verge has
[1339.46 → 1344.90] uh the verge has a good uh follow-up that basically says google denies altering search suggestions for
[1344.90 → 1352.02] Hillary Clinton and points out that some of the examples that source fed sites uh for example uh
[1352.02 → 1359.78] Hillary Clinton cry doesn't come up with crime in fact apply across the board google avoids auto
[1359.78 → 1370.10] completing the word crime or criminal um so that they can avoid um making disbarring comments about people
[1370.10 → 1376.18] who may not have actually committed a crime or may not be a criminal in fact they do so they've
[1376.18 → 1382.42] pointed this out this is uh who's this guy Matt cuts is the currently on leave from his position as
[1382.42 → 1390.74] head of Google's web spam team um so they do this for everyone else including people that have actually
[1390.74 → 1397.30] been charged and convicted very interesting um he also points out that those looking for negative
[1397.30 → 1403.62] stories don't necessarily type Hillary's last name they actually mostly search apparently for I don't
[1403.62 → 1409.14] really entirely know why he would know this if he's on leave no you might still well you might still know
[1409.14 → 1415.14] enough about the inner workings to come up with some examples that demonstrate the opposite well okay
[1415.14 → 1420.34] the first part totally the part where they're all looking for Hillary not Hillary Clinton is like
[1420.34 → 1425.46] what well you can look for that though um like you can search for relevance like you can search for
[1425.46 → 1434.02] um how hot it showed yes they did people were searching for that so basically um oh and so another
[1434.02 → 1439.06] thing they pointed out is that many results pop in when you type in Donald Trump racist but results
[1439.06 → 1449.30] also appear for Hillary Clinton racist um so there you go so basically the conclusion in the verge article
[1449.30 → 1453.38] here is they're likely trying to walk the line between providing as much information as they can
[1453.38 → 1459.38] and not stepping into a sort of gray legal area by say suggesting that someone could be a criminal
[1460.02 → 1466.58] um so here's a state a spokesperson's full statement on the matter google autocomplete does not favour any
[1466.58 → 1473.06] candidate or cause claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how you type in Donald Trump RAC yeah
[1473.06 → 1477.62] it comes with Donald Trump racist if you type Hillary Clinton RAC it comes with
[1477.62 → 1485.06] Rachel race issue Rachel Maddow race 2016. oh, that's interesting I wonder if that is a regional thing as well
[1487.14 → 1493.06] yeah Donald Trump RAC racist SNL racist commercial racist articles racist rally it's all racist
[1493.06 → 1500.02] I don't know that racism is necessarily a hot button topic for Hillary I doubt it I'm just saying
[1500.02 → 1504.34] that was said in their yeah that's very interesting doesn't seem true so here hold on we should
[1504.34 → 1509.94] probably do the demo live if we're going to uh if we're going to talk about this so Hillary I don't
[1509.94 → 1516.66] even necessarily know because like so there you have it uh so racist costume is my sixth fifth
[1516.66 → 1523.54] suggestion all right mine only goes down to four browser things probably oh no, no I'm actually on the
[1523.54 → 1529.46] resolution thing or like uh, uh zoom thing I'm actually on Google's website to you're doing the
[1529.46 → 1539.06] browser suggestions okay so there you go oh okay so no, no yep no look at so that's a browser thing yeah
[1539.06 → 1546.02] because I'm in Firefox here in chrome oh yeah okay there you go so age email young news
[1548.18 → 1554.50] news twitter wife Donald glover okay let's help it out a little bit of news twitter wife net worth so
[1554.50 → 1559.78] there's nothing particularly incriminating there, but it looks like as you continue to dig in and find
[1559.78 → 1568.98] examples you can find stuff that um appears to be a bit of an issue, so there is an article
[1568.98 → 1576.18] over on medium.com that appears to have been done without help from Google so here we go um search
[1576.18 → 1580.18] trends are a significant factor in how autocomplete works isn't the entire basis for source friends
[1580.18 → 1585.14] claiming yet according to their logic google must be favouring Donald Trump as well because they've got
[1585.14 → 1593.22] Donald Trump RA completely leaves out the quite common search term Donald Trump rape um which was the
[1593.22 → 1600.66] whole alleged thing with uh Ivana Trump where she eventually took back the statement, but she claimed
[1600.66 → 1608.90] that he raped her so I guess I didn't follow that closely enough yeah so Donald Trump la okay so we've
[1608.90 → 1614.74] got Donald Trump lawsuits and Donald Trump laughing what does it come with latest news latest last
[1614.74 → 1620.82] night laughing so at this point you're probably thinking this is a great point at this point you're
[1620.82 → 1625.06] probably thinking to yourself whoa you're just choosing random words and searching them, and he's
[1625.06 → 1630.74] like yeah that's right I'm doing exactly what totally makes sense yeah which does make sense so I can
[1630.74 → 1636.34] definitely see how source fed came to the conclusion they did because you right there sitting
[1636.34 → 1640.82] we're like well hold on a second what about this conflicts with that remembering that we're in
[1640.82 → 1646.82] a different region and I know that google does specifically target suggestions region by region
[1646.82 → 1652.98] uh so outside America you might get very, very different types of suggestions to do with any of
[1652.98 → 1663.30] the presidential candidates um versus someone who's actually in the U.S. so do I believe that google is 100
[1663.86 → 1670.58] ethical no do I believe that they would be stupid enough this might not be a targeted thing to do
[1670.58 → 1679.54] something this blatant right um no i i I think this would be really dumb I also have a really hard
[1679.54 → 1685.46] time believing that Hillary Clinton is necessarily the candidate that like googles as a whole would have
[1685.46 → 1694.74] decided is like ideal um so I mean she seems pretty impressionable better than trump I guess
[1694.74 → 1702.90] uh yeah that's such a yeah that's a can of worms actually this is interesting I had um sort of
[1702.90 → 1710.74] changing topics I had dinner uh at computer with uh like a self-professed like die-hard trump supporter
[1711.38 → 1718.18] and um basically the conversation went something along the lines of people are like where's the tech
[1718.18 → 1723.14] talk this is tech by the way just saying the Google stuff yeah yeah the Google stuff and what I'm telling
[1723.14 → 1729.54] you about right now was a conversation I had at computer tech is right in there um so basically
[1729.54 → 1735.14] he like was just out of absolutely nowhere we were talking about something to do with AMD's
[1735.14 → 1740.18] strategy for fire pro cards and distribution channels or something like that legitimately tech conversation
[1740.82 → 1746.18] and then he goes something something something you know my boy Donald something something something
[1746.18 → 1752.50] and my boy, and then he's like well, and we were like oh okay so you're a trump supporter
[1752.50 → 1756.90] like as if it was not obvious at that point, and he goes yeah you know blah blah blah blah blah of
[1756.90 → 1763.14] course I am and why what are you like well Canadian he's like oh you're socialist then like well you
[1763.14 → 1773.62] know what a not necessarily yeah uh for one thing and b um who cares because at a business dinner the
[1773.62 → 1781.06] last thing that I'm going to be talking about is socialism for Donald Trump that is like completely inappropriate
[1782.50 → 1788.90] so, so yeah but uh hey he's not afraid to speak his mind just like his boy Donald so I'll give him that
[1790.58 → 1798.66] um however inappropriate or appropriate it might be beenn't we supposed to be talking about the 4k
[1798.66 → 1806.50] ready PlayStation yeah I have no, no idea how we got how did we I think we stopped no I think we stopped I think we were done
[1806.50 → 1813.14] no, no no we never made it past the headline we talked about e3 and no because I saw this
[1813.14 → 1818.10] over here and I realized it wasn't on the dock yeah we never got there I'm going through what we did
[1818.10 → 1822.82] talk about we talked about three we talked about going to e3 and why we don't any more yeah we suck at
[1822.82 → 1828.34] that so we said it won't be at e3 which was in the headline yeah, and then we're like we won't be at e3
[1828.34 → 1834.82] either yeah okay so let's talk about the PlayStation 4 console upgrade to be clear there doesn't seem
[1834.82 → 1840.50] to be any indication that this is an upgrade in the sense that you can upgrade your existing console
[1840.50 → 1846.98] it looks like there will be an upgraded PlayStation 4 that will include a faster processor 4k resolutions
[1846.98 → 1855.70] oh man I got such a kick out of the endless PlayStation fanboys back at the time of launch that
[1855.70 → 1863.54] were like yeah 4k support is coming actually it's not actually it isn't because actually the
[1863.54 → 1871.46] HDMI port on the PlayStation it's not going to output it so there's that um yeah so technically
[1871.46 → 1875.94] 4k support is coming to PlayStation yes if you buy a completely new device just not yours um
[1876.82 → 1883.30] it'll offer 4k resolution support and improved graphics presumably it will also have support for
[1883.30 → 1890.50] PlayStation VR although I don't know if PlayStation VR is going to be supported on the existing
[1890.50 → 1896.90] PlayStation 4 do you know this no I don't know this that has been an interesting why are your things
[1896.90 → 1901.70] like off your screen that's weird I don't know if that's a known thing
[1904.90 → 1911.30] yeah i i actually don't know so 500 headbands to display blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1911.30 → 1917.30] upcoming virtual reality headset for the PS4 console but what's interesting is that the only
[1917.30 → 1922.58] confirmation that we have is that there will be an upgraded PS4 they're not actually calling it
[1922.58 → 1929.62] something else yeah so if they said PSV is for the PlayStation 4 I mean if this is like an oh man
[1929.62 → 1934.90] because there has been some confusing stuff that's gone on in console generations before you know mini
[1934.90 → 1941.70] versions, and you know cooler running versions and halo versions and all kinds of different
[1941.70 → 1946.34] different stuff that actually in some cases can have very different hardware and software limitations
[1946.34 → 1950.82] I mean early PlayStation 3s had backwards compatibility with hardware you can install Linux on
[1950.82 → 1954.90] them they're actually still really cool and then that completely got kicked in the ass those things
[1954.90 → 1960.34] are worth money one bay they are because you can make them computers like there's an isn't there like a military
[1961.30 → 1966.82] data centre or server or something that's PlayStation 3s i I think it's like defunct now but I'm sure but
[1966.82 → 1972.02] like okay it was a thing wasn't there I mean um might have just been experimental that's also very
[1972.02 → 1978.10] possible anyway the console will be priced higher than the current 350 dollars for the existing PS4
[1978.10 → 1982.98] and it will be better um so there you go and speaking of things that will be better
[1982.98 → 1993.62] all of our talking points for Squarespace yay so we are no longer allowed to say you should or build
[1993.62 → 1999.94] it is beautiful so we need a moment of silence yeah

[2026.26 → 2031.62] type crafts or um you know fish or whatever the case may be I'm not actually going to say anything
[2031.62 → 2033.46] I'm just trying to keep it the same
[2037.46 → 2039.62] you know what we could probably make this work
[2040.82 → 2047.46] and if you should no, no you're not supposed to say it and if is no hold on but
[2049.30 → 2053.78] no I can't, I can't, I thought maybe I could make it so that the should, could be implied but
[2053.78 → 2061.86] the sentence would actually work without it but I don't think I can right oh I'm like sad now yeah
[2062.58 → 2067.38] cover pages I was trying to do like the thing so that like we would only take part of it away from
[2067.38 → 2072.50] them, and then we could like slowly wean it off over time cover pages is a feature that allows you to
[2072.50 → 2078.34] set up a beautiful one-page online presence in minutes you can start a trial no credit card required

[2086.26 → 2093.30] to get 10 off your first purchase so uh thanks to Squarespace for supporting the wan show
[2094.50 → 2095.62] you should keep doing it
[2098.34 → 2107.62] there we go uh also in the lineup today is I fix it I fix it is probably the sponsor the actual legitimate
[2107.62 → 2113.94] sponsor that actually sponsors the show there are closer ones if you're looking for a kit they're
[2113.94 → 2122.10] like right there's an entire bin of them right there I fix it is probably the sponsor who
[2122.10 → 2129.54] actually sponsors the show that I get accused of like discreetly working in product placements
[2129.54 → 2136.82] for more often than any other because I legitimately use our I fix it stuff all the time I fix it.com is
[2136.82 → 2142.10] your complete DIY electronics repair solution from there yeah over there that's what I said see he's
[2142.10 → 2147.30] going over there now from their 19 000 free step-by-step repair guides to their huge inventory
[2147.30 → 2152.58] of replacement parts and tools we've used I fix it stuffs for everything from screwdrivers for taking
[2152.58 → 2160.10] stuff apart to suction cups for taking stuff apart to um well like more better screwdrivers for taking
[2160.10 → 2164.82] stuff apart to lots of different bits for the screw these are actually this is like an old kit too but
[2164.82 → 2170.02] we've got like tons of its funny the old kit is the one we have here because I took the new one home
[2170.02 → 2175.30] it's got more driver bits it's got the one I was looking for yeah better spiders it's got the wrong
[2175.30 → 2180.34] one more suction cups it's just generally like super awesome uh we've ordered replacement parts from them
[2180.34 → 2186.98] for putting the iMac uh the 5k iMac that I reviewed back together after I opened it up in order to take
[2186.98 → 2191.06] it apart for some reason why did I think that was a good idea anyway I took it apart and put it back
[2191.06 → 2196.98] together and all their tools are backed by I fix it lifetime warranty the pro tech toolkit the good
[2196.98 → 2203.70] one that I can't show you because it's at home is 69.95 and the best part is you can get 10 bucks oh
[2203.70 → 2210.34] nope ah my talking points are wrong five bucks off on a purchase of ten dollars or more my talking points
[2210.34 → 2216.42] are exactly correct I just saw the 10 and I jumped the gun there speaking of jumping the gun
[2216.42 → 2222.90] I have a link to the cooler master store here that I am supposed to follow
[2223.46 → 2232.74] ah yes my friends so cmstore-usa.com has all kinds of interesting stuff everything from cooler master
[2233.22 → 2239.06] and uh basically yes everything from cooler master a lot of it's their free form modular stuff expected
[2239.06 → 2246.26] to find that like if you saw the cooler master uh video from uh computer you would have seen some of
[2246.26 → 2251.22] these things already, so those things are made by primo chill actually yeah, so these are a little like
[2251.22 → 2257.78] you can change the look of the front of your case and the uh power supply basement area to this like
[2257.78 → 2263.70] crazy blue thing if that's not your style there's a bunch of other stuff you can do you can get official
[2263.70 → 2269.22] stuff from cooler master too which includes like the crazy handle on the top of the case this
[2269.22 → 2275.70] actually ties in really well to the thing that I was criticizing about Asus's concept pc that they had
[2275.70 → 2283.38] at the show that that one that all assembles with hard PCBs um and the problem is that they were like
[2283.38 → 2290.26] oh yeah we'll have like modular upgrades for uh rear Io so that an older motherboard could have like USB
[2290.26 → 2294.74] type c, and you would just have this module that you slot in and I was like well by the time the
[2294.74 → 2299.70] distributor and the retailer and the shipper remember you have to get it to a distributor then to a
[2299.70 → 2304.10] retailer then to the customer all take their cut these things are going to be inordinately expensive
[2304.10 → 2308.58] you might as well just buy a new motherboard wouldn't you need a controller for that too um the controller
[2308.58 → 2312.98] is actually in the like upgrade module that's what I'm saying so it's going to be really expensive yeah so
[2312.98 → 2318.34] well okay so the product manager for the claims it wasn't but I was like yes it sure um
[2318.34 → 2326.66] um so cooler master by stocking because that's been a big problem for cases too I bought a windowed
[2326.66 → 2337.70] side panel for an adtech p160 so that was 12 years ago um anyway so I did that it took like five weeks
[2337.70 → 2344.18] to special order because there was like one in the entire country and that's the way it was then and
[2344.18 → 2350.10] that's the way it is today when it comes to accessories for computer cases because you just
[2350.10 → 2355.54] can't stock enough of them in all the right distribution areas in order to have timely
[2355.54 → 2359.94] fulfillment of those orders be possible and that was a windowed side panel I mean it's a relatively
[2359.94 → 2366.26] common thing we're not talking like a freaking you know like slashed like front panel thing
[2366.26 → 2373.46] so I actually see cooler masters cooler master store as an interesting solution to that problem
[2373.46 → 2378.42] because cooler master themselves is handling this doesn't have to stock a ton of them yeah they can
[2378.42 → 2383.86] just say okay let's stock five it doesn't matter or ten does it is they buy the things from the
[2383.86 → 2390.02] makers and then resell them too which is pretty cool so you know that like who a master is tracking
[2390.02 → 2394.50] their stock and like all this other kind of stuff which actually makes sense so I think it's pretty
[2394.50 → 2400.02] cool so the other thing we're supposed to mention I guess is the um uh the master case maker five
[2400.58 → 2407.06] so make it what you will, I know Luke you especially had a lot of skepticism in your brain and in your
[2407.06 → 2412.26] heart and probably in your pants about cooler masters whole maker branding and there are still some
[2412.26 → 2416.10] products here we're still doing a cooler master sponsor spot but I'm not afraid to criticize them
[2416.10 → 2420.26] during a sponsor spot there are still some cooler master products that I look at the maker branding and i
[2420.26 → 2426.26] just go like what exactly is maker about this but I've got to give them the vision for the case at
[2426.26 → 2429.86] CES they announced that they were going to have this store here we are six months later they have
[2429.86 → 2436.42] products in it so they are working on it, they are trying to make it actually like maker in some way
[2436.42 → 2444.50] yeah I don't understand how like uh beautiful honestly looking power supply uh happens to be maker but
[2444.50 → 2449.78] I do appreciate that they did follow up on the store thing i I like it probably would have helped
[2449.78 → 2453.94] if I said it in the original video but the first time I covered their free form modular system stuff
[2453.94 → 2460.26] yeah was last computer not the most recent one and I gave them like a year or whatever and I talked
[2460.26 → 2466.10] to you about it not that long ago yeah like where is that where is that store thing because it's not
[2466.10 → 2471.94] here yet, and then it showed up like three weeks or a month before computer or something and I was like all right
[2471.94 → 2477.86] okay, okay all right you made it not by much, but you made it, but we'll give you that one cooler master
[2477.86 → 2485.38] you made it get it yep you made it I got it yeah yeah yeah make it beautiful
[2487.38 → 2492.74] maker is beautiful all right let's talk about beautiful community interaction the original article
[2492.74 → 2503.22] here is from Engadget riot used League of Legends chat logs to spot bad staff apparently looking
[2503.22 → 2508.58] closely at what employees say online it's a good thing I don't do that or ed probably wouldn't have a
[2508.58 → 2516.90] job any more, so Riot Games looked at employees chat logs and found a correlation between their behaviour in
[2516.90 → 2522.82] and out of game they worked with Google's work staff analytics team and picked through the last 12
[2522.82 → 2531.06] months of each staffer's League of Legends gameplay records and chat logs they found that a quarter of
[2531.06 → 2538.74] the people they had fired in the last year so they had fired prior to knowing had shown unusually high
[2538.74 → 2545.78] levels of toxic behaviour in game armed with this information riot used it to proactively address the
[2545.78 → 2552.26] problem with remaining staff so they singled out 30 employees all of whom were actually fairly new to
[2552.26 → 2557.30] the company and gave them two options those who got a stern warning and those who should be let go
[2558.10 → 2562.34] and then during the meetings many employees expressed regret at how they behaved in game
[2562.34 → 2568.74] they received essays from employees vowing to change their ways and the report ended with riot's
[2568.74 → 2574.98] intention to request League of Legends usernames from all future hires for similar analysis
[2575.78 → 2588.42] so yeah like social media investigation by potential and current employers just got real very
[2588.42 → 2594.18] real like I wouldn't be, and you know what it's its funny because if you'd asked me yesterday
[2595.06 → 2601.86] what is social media I would have said I don't know Twitter Facebook YouTube um and a lot of people
[2601.86 → 2606.50] don't even think of YouTube like I only think of it because YouTube is my primary social platform
[2607.06 → 2612.98] um yeah yeah I guess because you are yeah okay a lot of people watch a video I mean what percentage leave
[2612.98 → 2618.58] a comment under the video it feels more like a TV viewing thing yes instead of an intercommunication thing
[2618.58 → 2625.06] like yes, but it absolutely is yeah it is a social media platform um I'm not saying it isn't I would
[2625.06 → 2636.10] not have said the game I played last Saturday night boom so let's get a straw poll going on here like
[2637.86 → 2641.94] oh straw poll is what riot did okay
[2641.94 → 2651.38] oh and I'm not putting in turnip because I've this is like the requesting kind of a big deal here
[2652.98 → 2659.62] seems a little weird does it not for future employees okay so before we get into
[2659.62 → 2665.70] the answer to that question um let me say this when I applied at NCI
[2665.70 → 2674.10] I actually went out of my way to include my forum username yeah so they could review
[2674.90 → 2681.78] my posting history on their site I'm not going to say who but uh certain people on like the forum
[2681.78 → 2686.58] and certain people that I know through twitch and stuff yeah I've included their handles for the
[2686.58 → 2691.86] Linus tips forum for certain jobs that they have gotten and that has been part of it so i
[2691.86 → 2697.78] really for other jobs yeah i I actually do totally see does one of them have the initial cc
[2700.42 → 2707.22] fairly prominent member real initials' oh uh I'll talk to you later oh okay, okay I'm just I'm idly
[2707.22 → 2712.18] curious yeah yeah I'll talk to you later no problem telling you but I'll talk to you okay um and like
[2712.18 → 2718.50] it's worked, and it's helped them and I understand the voluntary giving of those things yeah and like
[2718.50 → 2725.54] having riot be like it's a good thing if you give us your username is probably i just I think it's
[2725.54 → 2728.74] because aren't there certain legal requirements about what you're even allowed to ask for like
[2728.74 → 2736.34] you can spin it both i I sincerely doubt a gamer handle is even covered but I could see right
[2736.34 → 2742.42] spinning it both ways because they could spin it to every candidate this way if you give us your league
[2742.42 → 2752.02] of legends username it enables us to help you the good candidate get a job but the implication the
[2752.02 → 2761.30] implied back side of that story is that it helps weed out potential jackasses during the interview
[2761.30 → 2767.14] process so some questions that you can't ask is what is your real religious affiliation are you
[2767.14 → 2772.26] pregnant what is your political affiliation what is your race colour or ethnicity although if you're
[2772.26 → 2778.98] in an interview uh anyway sometimes it's not obvious sure most people think my wife is uh I think
[2778.98 → 2785.78] I get a lot of people saying she might be Filipina, but she's not sure um that's a good point how old
[2785.78 → 2791.86] are you disabled are you married do you have uh children or plan to uh are you in debt do you
[2791.86 → 2800.98] you drink or smoke socially I guess um so in that social drink yeah so in that sense
[2802.74 → 2809.46] if riot asks for your username they could very indirectly get the answer to like everything
[2809.46 → 2814.34] there they could get the answers to pretty much all of that especially because that probably includes
[2814.34 → 2820.10] whispers what if it doesn't though let's say it doesn't let's assume let's assume let's let's give
[2820.10 → 2824.02] the benefit of the doubt let's say it doesn't include whispers right okay so let's say it only
[2824.02 → 2832.34] includes public chat but by the time you post that information on a public server have you
[2833.46 → 2838.18] yeah have you put that information on your forehead no because there's also implied anonymity
[2839.22 → 2845.62] through your username you're not playing as minus Sebastian right you're playing as whatever I do
[2845.62 → 2851.30] because I give up but sure yeah but like okay you know what I mean though yeah yeah yeah I give up too
[2851.30 → 2857.94] um I don't actually use my real but yeah yeah I give up uh I twitch stream what am I supposed to do
[2857.94 → 2864.98] um but yeah like I don't know okay so let's let's hear from the viewers this is split pretty much right
[2864.98 → 2873.62] down the middle I saw that we've got 53 of you saying it's okay riot has the right to know what you and
[2873.62 → 2879.06] you know what it might be in their EULA somewhere riot has the right to know before you work for them
[2879.06 → 2886.18] that's our neighbour what you posted on their privately owned servers which is an interesting
[2886.18 → 2894.26] point riot probably has terms in their EULA that entitle them to ownership of everything that gets posted
[2894.26 → 2899.30] in much the same way that infotech tips.com owns anything you post on it sure through the end user
[2899.30 → 2903.86] license that doesn't have to do with you forfeiting the information of your username right but you
[2903.86 → 2911.22] knowingly and willingly posted that with maybe you figured you were anonymous, but you weren't
[2911.22 → 2917.78] according to the end user license agreement you willingly and knowingly posted that publicly yeah yeah
[2917.78 → 2923.38] but so it's still it's still not forfeiting your username because you could falsify your personal data
[2923.38 → 2929.06] that's true signing up but if the EULA says you're not allowed to do that EULA's also
[2929.06 → 2938.02] don't hold up like ever that's true they don't but if riot's company policy is that all employees
[2938.02 → 2944.50] subject to termination if they fail to comply need to follow the EULA but can you go around
[2944.50 → 2949.94] let's say if there was I'm going into theoretical here yeah if that list of stuff that I just said
[2949.94 → 2957.46] included gamer tag for whatever reason would circumvent that by saying that they have to follow the
[2957.46 → 2963.06] EULA is that legal I guess john and it I don't think it comes down to legality or not legality
[2963.06 → 2972.26] because ultimately you can control what an employee posts on your privately owned servers as
[2972.26 → 2977.78] a company yeah it's not about control though this is reading the last 12 months right so going back
[2977.78 → 2982.34] yeah I'm looking at it well ultimately because there could be a code of conduct within the company where
[2982.34 → 2987.86] you have to act a certain way yeah like Costco has a code of ethics yeah they have like an entire
[2987.86 → 2993.46] handbook it's like this thick it's like here's uh you know here's the value up to which you can accept
[2993.46 → 3001.30] a dinner from someone here's this that that and that um you know what's funny is I have
[3001.30 → 3011.78] actually kind of talked myself into it, you're also uh an employer no but even outside of that because
[3012.42 → 3017.94] while i because we've talked about this before yeah and I don't remember what stance I took but
[3018.50 → 3027.06] you know whatever well we have uh to give some insight we have uh not necessarily changed opinions but
[3027.06 → 3031.86] but added information to what we thought about a person that was going through an interview process
[3031.86 → 3038.34] with us by looking at their social media yes oh long time ago you were in on that did I was it
[3038.34 → 3044.26] it was their Twitter account yeah okay, okay, so this was a long time ago did they tweet at us, i I think
[3044.26 → 3050.26] the Twitter account was given to us okay so it was given to us yeah okay, but we clearly have no problem
[3050.26 → 3056.82] looking at social media for things now with that said I personally don't really like this the
[3056.82 → 3062.90] reason why I don't really like this is because of the implied anonymity of your username if you post
[3062.90 → 3069.38] something on Twitter or to a public Facebook account that is very searchable and is directly attached to
[3069.38 → 3073.86] your name I think of course that's searchable by your employer I don't think you have to forfeit
[3073.86 → 3082.58] those accounts, but they're under your name and are searchable so whatever so I don't like
[3082.58 → 3093.30] the idea of creeping something that wasn't provided yeah especially if it's a third party so if riot was
[3093.30 → 3097.22] saying you have to provide your Facebook username because I've heard of employers demanding this
[3098.18 → 3104.34] you have to your have to you know what's your Facebook yeah, and we intend to look at it like if
[3104.34 → 3111.62] they demanded that that's one thing and that to me is actually very different from demanding to know
[3111.62 → 3115.38] what potential employees or current employees because they only did this for current employees
[3115.38 → 3119.62] and then the potential employees is moving forward now so they did this for current employees yeah
[3119.62 → 3123.78] what your current employees are posting on a server you own yeah I was just going to say that's also a
[3123.78 → 3130.02] different thing because it's their platform and I could definitely see this might change my
[3130.02 → 3136.10] opinion a little bit because it's their platform that's like how they are treading on your turf
[3136.10 → 3142.34] yeah it's how they are representing your brand I was applying this to like any gamer tag right so
[3142.34 → 3148.18] like if you played wow and League of Legends they would want to have both of them you know what i
[3148.18 → 3152.34] mean yeah, but that's not what they're asking no I know because they wouldn't have the ability to do
[3152.34 → 3160.10] that anyway right so but I think that would be more wrong anyway yeah I think so too I think what an
[3160.10 → 3165.54] employee on your turf wanting to know your stuff for your own servers i actually totally see that if is
[3165.54 → 3168.74] someone wanted to apply to work here, and we're on the forum I would want to know what their account
[3168.74 → 3172.90] was and I would want to see how they conducted themselves on the forum I wouldn't ask for their
[3172.90 → 3178.66] other accounts so i actually I guess I do agree with it, I just don't agree with it as a gamer tag in
[3178.66 → 3186.82] general a gamer tag in general feels like it should just be this is my escapism land yeah that's what i
[3186.82 → 3190.74] was trying to defend it's your anonymous area you should just and sometimes you role-play
[3190.74 → 3200.66] role playing is a thing how I behave as a gamer tag shouldn't necessarily be the be all and end all
[3200.66 → 3205.86] of someone how it's how someone interprets who I am and what I am as a person but I also see where
[3205.86 → 3212.74] riot's coming from which is if your role-playing an asshole they to the community of our paying
[3212.74 → 3218.50] customers who you're trying to apply for and will be representing in some way or another yeah who you're
[3218.50 → 3223.54] ultimately serving at your like freaking day job that we're paying for right is going to want someone
[3223.54 → 3229.78] who uh well like compared to a negative person they would want someone who's trying to make the
[3229.78 → 3236.66] community better because that's the exact same kind of deal as the person in the interview uh who is
[3236.66 → 3243.54] actively trying to find ways and offer up ways that they could improve the company and who have
[3243.54 → 3248.34] pre-thought about these things like the standard thing like if you're applying for a
[3248.34 → 3253.86] social media position being like oh I have these ideas for improving your social media situation
[3253.86 → 3257.14] because I've already looked at what you're doing and analyzed what you're doing and thought about
[3257.14 → 3261.94] it and tried these practices and whatnot that's a very good thing to bring to that interview um
[3262.66 → 3268.34] bringing to that interview that you obviously didn't care and are contributing to a toxic environment
[3268.34 → 3272.82] just not twitch place Pokémon says someone was role-playing at me real hard in an overwatch match
[3272.82 → 3280.18] I played last night we're not saying that role playing an is okay we're just saying that
[3281.46 → 3286.02] I think we specifically didn't yeah it might not necessarily be who you are as a person yeah
[3286.66 → 3295.70] um okay team viewer confirms number of abused user accounts is significant uh so your original article
[3295.70 → 3303.38] here is from bleeping computer.com they apologize, but they still say they were not compromised which
[3303.38 → 3311.14] is something that has yet to be actually proven even though Redditors and some blogs out there have
[3311.78 → 3319.06] offered up some evidence that looks fairly compelling to suggest that they were indeed compromised so uh
[3319.86 → 3325.06] what well they were definitely compromised the question is whether team viewer
[3326.02 → 3332.18] was compromised like their records that that's the compromise yeah um but team viewer accounts
[3332.18 → 3338.98] were definitely we're definitely compromised so the suggested course of action it right now is to
[3338.98 → 3344.02] protect your accounts with secure passwords that are frequently changed have reliable anti-malware
[3344.02 → 3348.34] and security solutions in place at all times and enable two-factor authentication that's what team
[3348.34 → 3354.18] viewer is suggesting um there's other stuff that you can do uh the way that I was once compromised
[3354.18 → 3360.66] well not me personally I've never been compromised I'm not compromising not I don't know what I'm
[3360.66 → 3365.30] talking about anyway the way the Linus tech tips channel was compromised was through a keylogger
[3365.30 → 3370.98] um where I did not have two-factor authentication enabled because I don't remember if it was available
[3370.98 → 3376.90] yet I doubt it was back then it was a long time ago anyway um so through a keylogger so one of the
[3376.90 → 3381.86] other ways that you can avoid getting your password sniped by a keylogger is by having something like
[3381.86 → 3386.74] a password keeper like LastPass that's one thing that people are questioning is they're saying
[3387.94 → 3390.42] I had a two-step enabled, and they still got in
[3392.18 → 3395.14] we don't have any confirmations of these things but hearing that is bad
[3395.78 → 3402.90] um one thing that I'm going to say is uh not to bring this up again but quite a while ago we had a
[3402.90 → 3412.18] breach on the line of sectors forum which is super mega sucked um and even if that wasn't our fault
[3414.02 → 3420.10] you still have to kind of uh be a little more proactive you should probably consider this is
[3420.10 → 3426.02] an exploit that's going against your software sure their breach isn't your fault, but it's still an
[3426.02 → 3433.46] exploit that is widely significantly going against your software you should probably inform your
[3433.46 → 3439.54] users yep that this could be a problem suggest password changes proactively through an email
[3439.54 → 3445.30] suggest two-step they have my email address one thing that can't reach me was like busted our email
[3445.30 → 3450.66] reputation by making sure that we hammered emails out as fast as we could to all of our users to let
[3450.66 → 3454.90] them know which actually hurt us in the longer term no one from hot no one at a Microsoft domain got an
[3454.90 → 3460.74] email from us for months for a very long time including password reset emails yeah which was a
[3460.74 → 3465.14] nightmare thanks Microsoft we were just trying to help people, and then they ignored us for months
[3465.14 → 3472.02] with trying to get anyway anyway um so pretty much the way the attack works is people are breaking into
[3472.02 → 3478.34] your team viewer into your computer with team viewer, and then they are using presumably saved passwords on
[3478.34 → 3485.06] your computer please don't do that um for example if you have a password keeper I don't understand why
[3485.06 → 3489.46] this isn't a default option but actually while you're in your next security audit can you run around and
[3489.46 → 3494.74] make sure everyone has it set to time out after a very short period of time make sure your password
[3494.74 → 3500.66] keeper times out like for the love of everything that is valuable to you time out your password keeper
[3500.66 → 3505.70] that's the whole point so what they're doing is they're going into whether it's you're using chrome to save your
[3505.70 → 3510.02] password which by the way is really stupid um or Firefox save your passwords which by the way is even
[3510.02 → 3515.86] super stupider because it saves it in plain text in a file in like data roaming local whatever it is
[3516.42 → 3522.34] um what was I oh yeah so than they're using your safe passwords to drain your bank account and your
[3522.34 → 3528.50] PayPal which there's not a lot that um anyone can do about once it's done if the action was
[3528.50 → 3538.10] effectively done by you um right we've got a lot of topics left some of which I like really did want
[3538.10 → 3551.38] to uh like what talk about real quick here um where'd it go um, um where did it go
[3551.38 → 3559.78] how about maybe up no I've had like I had something I really wanted to do like tied into the team viewer
[3559.78 → 3564.18] one I had like a segue and everything, and it's completely not in my mind anymore this
[3566.26 → 3576.50] no okay no it was cool this no that's cool too but not as cool um oh well
[3576.50 → 3584.34] oh this no oh that ties in yeah no and no it was like something else like it might not have
[3584.34 → 3589.70] actually oh this is a doc uh oh yeah wait no, no this oh this apparently got rejected
[3590.90 → 3598.90] I don't know I don't know why uh why did that get rejected um I don't know I actually don't know
[3598.90 → 3609.78] oh um oh okay well I don't know why it was rejected so I'm not going to go too far into it but uh
[3610.42 → 3615.78] twitch troll donates fifty thousand dollars to streamers PayPal allegedly refuses to refund
[3615.78 → 3620.50] maybe we don't actually have confirmation on whether PayPal is refunding it or not
[3620.50 → 3626.34] ah yeah okay nick nick is filling it in for me conflicting reports okay so I was going to try and
[3626.34 → 3630.34] tie that and well I think that pretty much wraps it up for the LAN show I do want to do a call-out
[3630.34 → 3636.90] for nerd sports guys if you haven't already uh check it out over on vessel they offer a seven-day free

[3649.54 → 3655.62] creators, and it should also be noted that nerd sports uh all five episodes of which are up there
[3656.34 → 3662.98] and for whatever reason not particularly searchable there it is one word apparently uh all five of
[3662.98 → 3669.86] which are watchable curling ice hockey dodgeball lacrosse and volleyball where we the keyboard
[3669.86 → 3675.06] warriors take on real athletes in the sports of their choosing the curly one was funny you guys suck
