[0.96 → 12.00] okay welcome to the wan show this a beautiful Friday and i uh well it's hot that's true it's like
[12.00 → 18.64] super hot like look I'm flush i have done very little today and i am flush that's because we're
[18.64 → 23.76] in like a warehouse like the most really have ventilation the most exercise that i got today
[23.76 → 29.60] actually was closely related to the most important news from today which is that Malaysia's lee Chong
[29.60 → 38.32] Wei finally made it past china's Lin Dan in the so cheering was your most exercise yeah um yep so i
[38.32 → 45.28] was I was up early this morning watching uh watching that match oh man absolutely epic
[45.84 → 50.00] absolutely epic lee Chong way finally passed Lin Dan if you don't care about badminton you'll have
[50.00 → 54.40] no idea who either those people are but trust me they're great I've never watched badminton i know
[54.40 → 62.56] both of these people okay that's not fair i have watched badminton when you have showed me like
[62.56 → 67.04] a specific clip on your phone okay well tell you what i will show you important because xyz i will
[67.04 → 72.08] show you another specific clip because it's very important very, very important lee Chong way's third
[72.08 → 79.60] match point okay yeah Lin Dan makes probably the most epic save that i have seen at that level, and it's
[79.60 → 85.04] it's incredible and uh then he goes on to win it so it's great my man lee Chong way all the way
[85.04 → 88.88] through anyway sorry i will talk about technology now at some point do you want to do
[88.88 → 96.72] want to go through topics okay so basically we have AMD zen, and then we have oh my god AMD stock price
[96.72 → 105.36] in a good way this time which is good um there was the id for intel developer forum and even more intel
[105.36 → 109.60] developer forum stuff basically we're going to be talking about processing chips a lot, and we'll
[109.60 → 117.04] probably also talk about NVIDIA's launch of their 10 series notebook graphics cards there's no m for
[117.04 → 119.84] mobile, but there could be an n for notebook wasn't that last week
[119.84 → 135.28] oh no that was this week i just saw it last week okay oh you're awful
[138.80 → 144.48] you have to rub it in their face like that i didn't even oh it's like aren't all these
[144.48 → 148.48] pre-release products that I'm always playing with just like old news and boring
[153.84 → 159.52] it's like aren't you just like a total piece of crap to our loyal viewers all like yeah see this is
[159.52 → 163.92] your face i got my head on the back of your neck and this is like the better position that I'm in all
[163.92 → 173.68] the time and this is like yeah yeah you like that um all right so let's wait did someone just tell me
[173.68 → 178.72] there's no couch in the intro oh well there's no oh he means there's no couch any more wow it took you
[178.72 → 187.92] just over a year to notice yes there has it has definitely been a long time since uh since
[187.92 → 193.92] that all right so why don't we jump right into our first topic here the original article is from pc
[193.92 → 200.96] perspective, so this is a significantly more credible source than last week did you post this in the chat
[200.96 → 206.96] already no that's fine because I'm done oh dang you just got you just got schooled son
[208.56 → 214.80] yeah son that's what rappers do right i mean sometimes yeah sure like this right i think
[214.80 → 218.80] you're like reversing the 80 20 rule here oh i don't know you're putting in 80 of the effort and
[218.80 → 226.40] getting 20 of the results is that not how it works all right speaking of 80 of the effort and 20 of the
[226.40 → 234.48] results AMD all right no, no good things yes they are doing good things and when they do good things
[234.48 → 240.64] we will notice that they do good things yes and the good thing that they did this time is talking about
[240.64 → 247.28] actually doing a demo, so this comes right on the heels of the CCF tech leaked benchmarks from last week
[247.28 → 255.36] doing a demo where they showed off working zen silicon running a benchmark i mean we're talking
[255.36 → 261.84] a benchmark we are not talking many benchmarks across a know the variety of different use cases
[262.88 → 271.12] up against a Bradwell e-chip an unnamed Bradwell e-chip with eight cores and 16 threads running at
[271.12 → 279.12] three gigahertz it is speculated that this is a fixed clock 6900k though it wouldn't really matter
[279.12 → 285.76] if it was a Leon at three gigahertz because they are the same thing it's just easier to do it with a
[285.76 → 294.48] k chip because you can control the clock speed hooray processors uh so they had identical speeds and
[294.48 → 298.80] claimed comparable configurations now they didn't talk about like what motherboards are being run they
[298.80 → 302.00] didn't talk about what GPUs were being run they didn't talk about any of that kind of stuff just
[302.00 → 308.32] yeah comparable configurations eight core 16 threads for zen eight core 16 threads for Bradwell e both
[308.32 → 313.04] running at three gigahertz that's all we know like boosts or turboboosts or anything like that
[313.76 → 320.80] it looks like has been left out of the picture, and then they only ran blender and the zen processor was
[320.80 → 326.96] faster than the Bradwell e-chip in blender by one to two seconds is and there was no official score
[326.96 → 332.24] screen shown okay I'm assuming because there would be other information on the score screen that they
[332.24 → 336.64] don't want to show yep so that probably makes sense so there's i mean there are a number of reasons for
[336.64 → 342.40] that they wouldn't want to show the intel processor because then that constitutes like a performance
[342.40 → 347.20] claim relative to a real competitor there's going to be all kinds of like legal is going to want to
[347.20 → 351.36] look that up down and sideways make sure that they're not saying anything that they can later be
[351.36 → 358.08] sued for by intel in case you've ever wondered why you know car companies will be like competitor f
[359.04 → 366.48] and competitor b it's really not to go on too much of a tangent but like Sendai right now is like
[366.48 → 374.16] attacking Honda super hardcore and being like our car has this very specific car from Honda doesn't
[374.16 → 378.72] have this and like it's weird because usually companies don't do that usually they shy away from
[378.72 → 384.88] that now my understanding is competitors yeah competitors or they would make it like
[384.88 → 389.20] my favourite is when they have like competitors, and they put like the first letter and like the last
[389.20 → 394.24] letter and like asterisk the ones in between where it's obvious, but it's kind of like the way that we
[394.24 → 400.08] censor on Linus tech tips yeah where we're not we're not really trying to obscure the meaning yeah we're
[400.08 → 405.92] just you know trying to make it so that i don't get angry emails yeah parents of kids who watch the show
[405.92 → 411.36] yeah we'll be like no, no we bleeped it we just bleeped not even an entire letter yeah we did our
[411.36 → 419.92] due diligence okay um like my understanding is it's actually pretty rare for that to turn into an
[419.92 → 427.92] actual like defamatory statement lawsuit however AMD is showing unreleased hardware and even internally at
[427.92 → 436.80] AMD okay dr sue who is different from Dr. Seuss by the way uh Lisa sue AMD sue yeah uh dr sue
[437.76 → 444.96] probably doesn't know exactly what configuration zen will ship in so let's say they discover at the
[444.96 → 452.56] last second that their yields will not allow them to hit a TDP that is competitive with Bradwell yet
[452.56 → 457.60] that clock speed they have to lower the clock speed then if someone points back and says hey you showed
[457.60 → 461.68] official score screens that have like model numbers you said you were faster you're not
[461.68 → 466.96] faster in the shipping product now they got a problem so i can understand their hesitance to be
[466.96 → 474.48] too upfront about any of this um now zen to jump back to the technology discussion is doing a hyper
[474.48 → 481.92] threading is thing it's obviously not called hyper threading intel tm yeah yeah yeah so it's called
[481.92 → 488.88] simultaneous multi-threading which is the generic that's the tissue paper to the Kleenex
[488.88 → 495.60] yeah sort of comparison yeah smt it makes me think a lot of SMP anyway don't worry about it
[495.60 → 501.36] um it utilizes high bandwidth and low latency caching systems in a 14 nanometre process from global
[501.36 → 508.88] foundries, and they're claiming it has a 40 increase in IPC over excavator at equal energy per cycle
[508.88 → 517.20] consumption, although we were both going there yeah it's a little old now i mean if intel
[517.20 → 523.12] hadn't upgraded their processors in the last five years they could claim they have a 40 improvement in
[523.12 → 530.08] sky lake performance yeah over the last thing that they did because it's been so long i would hope
[530.08 → 537.04] that there would be a very significant increase in IPC over excavator so I'm happy that there is
[537.04 → 544.48] yeah a lot of this is coming down to i don't personally like AMD no because that's what our
[544.48 → 551.92] viewers seem to really yeah pre-release stuff and rumour stuff and i am very excited actually genuinely
[551.92 → 557.12] very excited to get this in office and like try it against things because of AMD if these things are
[557.12 → 562.64] true and especially on the slightly lower end or if this thing is considerably cheaper and can actually
[562.64 → 567.76] fight really well that is so good for markets in so many different ways wrap your brain around this
[567.76 → 576.32] what okay let's say you and i like got together we had a meeting okay and the meeting was like okay
[576.88 → 586.00] let's figure out what our next build blog is going to be or like build guide okay get this we go wow AMD has
[586.00 → 591.84] a great value gaming chip that's really efficient and like has all the latest features let's do that
[593.52 → 598.24] it hasn't happened in so long i know right the reason why we haven't included AMD chips and things
[598.24 → 605.60] for so long is because where are they there's its where are they and it's the 8350s were like super cool
[605.60 → 612.64] like a while ago it's the sex appeal too like it's the fact that whether whether the vocal
[612.64 → 619.52] minority likes it or not if our goal over here is to be kind of like the top gear of pcs then
[620.96 → 627.04] there's really there's really not many opportunities for us to feature AMD pcs you'll see them on things
[627.04 → 633.44] like um value builds so we've done that in the last couple of years featuring AMD processors uh you'll
[633.44 → 641.12] see them in things like um let's see retro builds so i rebuilt my first gaming machine and i used an AMD
[641.12 → 646.64] processor for that but the reality of it is that if the idea is to be kind of like a top gear
[646.64 → 650.88] you show off the best of the best you show the halo stuff you show the jaw dropping stuff that's
[650.88 → 656.80] like just straight cool factor, and you might show like a junker from time to time which is exactly
[656.80 → 660.40] what we would do on something like a scrapyard wars where we take like ancient hardware from
[660.40 → 664.48] AMD NVIDIA or intel we don't care it's like its old stuff and we kind of have fun with it
[664.48 → 670.80] and then there's really not much room for that like Paris you know yeah yeah yeah the
[670.80 → 677.76] the economical you know hey it's got the better on board graphics than the competitor
[677.76 → 682.40] um, but you know this is a is a building that literally doesn't have a single machine in it that
[682.40 → 688.32] isn't a laptop that has on board graphics um so it doesn't give us many opportunities even
[688.32 → 694.56] then they're technically on board but like they're usually separate but this is exciting because
[695.12 → 700.80] we as much as the Paris doesn't excite me much i could get pretty amped up about something like
[700.80 → 704.24] uh oh I'm going to try and come up with something comparable and I'm not a car person so that makes
[704.24 → 710.64] it really toughs i can get excited about a Prius okay where we can go okay it's not like the cheapest
[710.64 → 716.96] possible thing to get you down the road, but it's like fuel economy economical, and it's got like some cool
[716.96 → 723.92] features, and it's a good value yeah i can get excited about that so I'm i am looking
[723.92 → 731.12] forward i just like it even from raw a competition standpoint having good competition is a very good
[731.12 → 738.40] thing and like intel i love you guys, but you're getting a little lazy i wouldn't call it lazy i would
[738.40 → 746.00] call it refocused yeah okay refocused on the desktop market yeah uh and i understand why not a lot of
[746.00 → 749.68] inspiration there's basically nothing in it for them to keep innovating what are they going to do
[749.68 → 754.88] go from 80 whatever high percent market share or whatever it is that they're at right now it's
[754.88 → 760.08] something ludicrous are they're going to get another one percent yeah like if they double their r d what
[760.08 → 766.32] are they going to get for it nothing whereas if AMD comes back claws away some market share and makes
[766.32 → 771.76] intel fight for it to the point where it's like okay we're increasing our r d spending by 60 we need to
[771.76 → 779.52] improve the clock speed or IPC of the next generation or two generations away core processor by 30 in
[779.52 → 785.52] order to smack down this upstart like that's where innovation comes from because you have to understand
[785.52 → 794.80] that no one here is like just doing things out of love money turns the wheel any publicly traded
[794.80 → 803.04] company ultimately answers to its shareholders and so if intel doesn't have a single good reason on paper
[804.16 → 808.96] to really change much of anything other than making sure that they're leading the technology charge which
[808.96 → 813.76] improves their uh which improves their margin which improves their sales like they'll, they'll keep
[813.76 → 818.64] refreshing the products they'll keep improving, but they don't have a reason to like heavily invest and
[818.64 → 825.04] completely reinvent the wheel unless AMD gives them one yeah so good competition is this looks
[825.60 → 831.92] hopeful yeah and as much as we tease them honestly it's easier for me to tease them now
[832.80 → 839.36] in a situation where it really looks like it, we the light is visible at the end of the tunnel totally
[839.36 → 845.12] and it's not an oncoming train yeah with that said they've hurt me many times before and uh
[845.12 → 849.52] i don't with that said at the same time they've also done great things they have it's just been
[849.52 → 856.48] a long time yeah so one of my easily favourite computers I've ever owned that was an Athlon x2
[856.48 → 862.72] like have I made the battered wife analogy on when show before where it's like AMD and i had the good times
[863.92 → 869.84] but then there's just they just kept they just kept beating me up they promised to bring you to
[870.40 → 875.04] Disneyland, and then they didn't, and then they didn't they promised me that Disneyland would be full of
[875.04 → 880.00] you know venom 2 overclocking, and it wasn't they told you that the coolest thing ever was
[880.00 → 886.56] coming, and then it was a rebranded SSD that's right there's been some disappointing times this
[886.56 → 890.88] will hopefully not be one of them did we even take a video about that thing i don't think so
[890.88 → 896.32] who was the actual hold on who was the actual maker of the AMD SSD i feel like it was patriot or
[896.32 → 907.44] something a patriot or Oct or something uh AMD SSD wow for a long time yeah hold on uh oh man i
[907.44 → 912.00] really wish i could remember what it was I'm just going to google it instead of checking out the chat
[912.00 → 918.40] is going to tell us yeah someone will tell us Oct okay yeah where without like it's hilarious when
[918.40 → 923.28] companies do this it's like this seems like a very first world problem I'm sure but from time to time
[923.92 → 928.80] we'll have companies that instead of reaching out to us asking if we want to do a review
[929.60 → 934.96] they'll just kind of put it in the mail and when it'll time it so that like basically the moment
[934.96 → 942.56] that it's arriving they'll like call, and we'll be like hi they'll be like yeah so you've got the latest
[943.28 → 949.68] the greatest freaking unbelievable thing, and we'll be like what this, and they're like yeah so for your
[949.68 → 955.20] review are you going to do this and that I'm like I'm not reviewing this this is the least
[955.20 → 960.88] exciting SSD on the face of the earth yeah out of all the unexciting SSDs that have ever existed this
[960.88 → 965.68] is probably the least exciting one all you've done is put a sticker your AMD for crying out loud you
[965.68 → 970.72] can't just put a sticker on things you are a design hardware don't put a sticker on
[970.72 → 976.16] something you didn't design especially a SSD they didn't even rewrite the firmware what like it just
[976.16 → 981.04] the whole thing made absolutely no sense i don't know if these do these still exist let's have a
[981.04 → 985.60] look maybe they do hold on let's let's find out in real time look at that they still do man and people
[985.60 → 991.60] buy them which is great i mean there's nothing wrong with it that is really cheap wow
[991.60 → 996.96] then again SSDs are just like cheap now so that's a thing but um, but the point was not that it was a
[996.96 → 1002.64] bad product it was just the world's least interesting product and they and they resorted to pulling tricks
[1002.64 → 1008.24] like us already having it and just being like well now you've already got it hype train too
[1008.24 → 1012.72] yeah it was a real hype train not in the ram too i think the ram was pre-lab
[1012.72 → 1020.96] um so i was actually at NCI when we got briefed on like AMD's exciting bold strategy for rebranding
[1020.96 → 1026.08] patriot memories too i remember getting these at the old studio here hold on I'll share your screen okay
[1026.08 → 1033.44] were these patriot yeah okay so that's where i got that confusion yeah yeah built by partner xyz
[1033.44 → 1039.04] built by partner xyz so in the case of the ones that i had anyway it was uh it was patriot memory
[1039.04 → 1042.08] i thought we might have even still had some of these lying around but i went looking for them
[1042.08 → 1047.12] the other day and i couldn't find them oh interesting anyway so solid we actually use them
[1047.12 → 1052.32] in like a fair amount of stuff so I'm approaching this tentatively I've said this before but i feel like
[1052.32 → 1056.96] I'm going to be saying it on when show every week until zen launches so get used to it, I'm approaching
[1056.96 → 1062.96] it tentatively but i feel like he might really take me to Disneyland this time maybe it does kind
[1062.96 → 1068.08] of feel like it right it does kind of and like it really feels it's really different this time
[1068.08 → 1074.08] he's going to take me to Disneyland oh it's like what's that mark on your arm this is our last trip to
[1074.08 → 1083.36] Disneyland oh i really hope it's true and like the thing is this time instead of it being like
[1083.36 → 1088.72] a mystery exciting product it's like they're telling us what it is they have some confidence
[1088.72 → 1094.56] and they're like telling us stuff about it instead of just being like it's great hooray Chris 771 on
[1094.56 → 1101.84] twitch chat says AMD soon to rebrand NVIDIA GPUs oh no that was rude oh that's not nice hey there
[1101.84 → 1108.00] graphics cards are doing perfect right now 1v1 rust 9 says uh decide is it zed or is it z
[1108.88 → 1115.04] it's both because we're Canadian which means that we have no culture yep we just borrow from the
[1115.04 → 1118.48] south, and we borrow from the Brice, and we don't know who we borrowed what from
[1120.64 → 1124.72] it's kind of true sorry it is what it is i don't make the rules my friends my favourite thing was
[1124.72 → 1130.96] playing wow because there was a raid in an instance and i called one of them ZG and i called the
[1130.96 → 1137.60] the other one ZF and like but that made sense to me and that's that was their names and that's how
[1137.60 → 1145.44] it went we just go with whatever sounds like better whatever yeah yeah yeah so it's Oct for me
[1145.44 → 1152.32] and it's uh w x y and z because it rhymes because now i know my abc's fun fact it's the same tune as
[1152.32 → 1160.40] twinkle twinkle little star oh it is and there's something else too um i can't remember what it is
[1160.40 → 1165.68] row row row your boat no, no not that one uh abc twinkle twinkle little star and there's like one
[1165.68 → 1174.56] other one other like super yeah i can't remember, but it's actually not terribly important
[1174.56 → 1180.96] anyway it sounds like other people have confident that confidence that we're actually going to
[1180.96 → 1188.72] Disneyland this time too because AMD's stock has just absolutely skyrocketed so i think in the last
[1188.72 → 1200.64] day it's gone up 11 and this year it's gone up 330 booms which is insane that is so much i remember when
[1200.64 → 1206.48] AMD was trading at like a buck or two yeah i was actually even thinking about at the time i was like
[1206.48 → 1213.44] realistically it couldn't go any lower maybe i should just buy a bunch but i mean Oct became a
[1213.44 → 1220.80] penny stock before they went under so i was like i don't know although Oct whatever um
[1221.76 → 1226.32] it's probably a little bit more of a volatile position than AMD is yeah yeah that's true and i
[1226.32 → 1232.64] knew enough about the inner workings of Oct to know that like that was well enough deserved at the
[1232.64 → 1241.12] time that that happened yeah so like that's also really cool because they need that really badly
[1242.32 → 1247.28] they can't just have a perfect product launch they also need investor confidence yeah and the fact
[1247.28 → 1252.08] that the investor confidence is coming before the perfect product launch okay of zen i guess our
[1252.08 → 1256.48] graphics cards are doing super well as well yeah they just don't really have that many of them
[1256.48 → 1262.00] right now and the asps are kind of low and um sorry I'll let you finish but i have another comment
[1262.00 → 1268.16] on the graphics cards you think you just butt into people's conversations because you're old now it's
[1268.16 → 1274.96] not a conversation you're sitting there talking out into the dark no because there's twitch chat they
[1274.96 → 1281.12] didn't ask you about this that's not a conversation just saying things that it is not conversation by that
[1281.12 → 1288.56] logic i am an excellent conversation so wait you can't have a conversation unless someone asks you about a topic
[1288.56 → 1292.00] well there has to be a back and forth that's a conversation, but they can respond
[1292.72 → 1297.20] yeah, but they won't yes we did someone just said yes we did yes we did you know what you know what nick says
[1297.20 → 1304.00] how does this show have sponsors says nick light i don't know it's his job to get them i don't know how he does it
[1304.00 → 1313.20] um see look uh the sequester says Luke i asked you don't worry see he's got my back all right so i
[1313.20 → 1320.48] want to move on to AMD's success uh with GPUs and into something that could have a significant impact
[1320.48 → 1327.04] on that reason success so you had you've tested the Rx 480 you've tested the Rx 470 thoughts so far
[1327.76 → 1332.24] we're giving it the thumbs up definitely definite thumbs up great the price differential between
[1332.24 → 1337.92] those two cards is a little weird it does seem like a very crowded product yeah doesn't it yeah
[1337.92 → 1343.76] but especially when you have partners that are trying to attack like it's the usual thing right
[1343.76 → 1350.08] where VGA is the worst defender here they've had I've seen them have up to like nine super clocked for
[1350.08 → 1361.92] the win KO super super clock super clock plus it is freaking super clock ACX too it is freaking
[1361.92 → 1367.60] endless with those guys yeah and when you have separate GPUs like architecturally different
[1367.60 → 1374.00] well not architecturally okay but like um actual like chip design different GPUs because they're the
[1374.00 → 1379.92] same architect 30 or 40 bucks of each other there's not a lot of room for sapphire to go like yeah it's
[1379.92 → 1386.00] the nitro plus Rx 460, and it costs like as much as a Rx 480 because then it's like okay well I'm just
[1386.00 → 1393.52] going to buy the better one yes so like there's yeah um any anyway so other than that looking pretty
[1393.52 → 1400.32] good-looking pretty keen you know but NVIDIA went and dropped a bomb this week if you want to actually
[1400.32 → 1405.36] post this one in the chat i just kind of skipped ahead to it yeah i don't know NVIDIA releases GeForce
[1405.36 → 1416.56] GTX 1060 3 gig in a move that i personally find a little bit um misleading and confusing because
[1416.56 → 1425.76] the GTX 1060 while it is based on the same GPU or excuse me the GTX 1060 3 gig yeah while it is based
[1425.76 → 1432.88] on the same GPU as the GTX 1060 you might want to drop that in chat which has six gigs of ram but is
[1432.88 → 1442.24] called the GTX 1060 yeah not the GTX 1060 6 gig yeah wait i see now i don't even know what I'm talking
[1442.24 → 1447.68] about any more it's not quite the same it's not as fast they've done slightly slower they yes they've done
[1447.68 → 1457.68] more than just take away some of the memory like we saw before with the 8800 GTS 320 and 8800 GTS 640
[1457.68 → 1465.92] Meg which were actually identical cards other than the difference in frame buffer the reason presumably
[1465.92 → 1471.36] this is just my guess that they've done this is because otherwise there would be pretty much no
[1471.36 → 1478.96] reason for people to buy a GTX 1060 brackets 6 gigabytes uh then the reason for that being that
[1478.96 → 1486.08] the GTX 1060 is really not targeting 4k gaming or like ultra-wide 1440p gaming or anything like that
[1486.08 → 1493.36] and if you're gaming at 1080p or slightly above three gigs of ram is going to pretty much do you until it's
[1493.36 → 1500.00] time to upgrade to your next GPU something that people who buy that bang for the buck 199 graphics card
[1500.00 → 1507.04] typically do which i guess leads us pretty well into what makes the GTX 1060 3 gig somewhat scary for
[1507.04 → 1515.44] AMD it comes in a MSRP of 199 yeah so it does have a VRAM disadvantage, but it is based on the same
[1515.44 → 1520.96] architecture as the 1060 now NVIDIA is not seeding us a review sample um but i don't know have we reached
[1520.96 → 1525.84] out to anyone about getting one yet are we going to have a look at this we have not I've been there's okay
[1526.72 → 1531.68] but at lower okay before we go on for a little bit what the hell GPU launches
[1532.80 → 1539.36] yeah i know stop i mean we've had viewers complain we've had conversations like we sat down for
[1539.36 → 1545.12] like a monthly review meeting, and we're going like there are too many GPU videos, and it's like well
[1545.12 → 1552.72] and like i get it, but then there's this and i need to do like VRAM testing to show that this thing's okay
[1552.72 → 1557.68] and then there's a 460 that we like i think we have one, and it's like oh my god i have to make
[1557.68 → 1561.60] a review of that because then people are going to be like oh your name you're an NVIDIA fanboy because
[1561.60 → 1566.32] you didn't make a 460 review and if you do it three months from now no one will care no but then like
[1566.32 → 1573.12] there are too many videos oh and then there's dx12 and falcon and i need to make that make sense but
[1573.12 → 1578.24] those are confusing oh actually that's a pretty exciting video that should be coming pretty soon we've been
[1578.24 → 1584.40] we actually had an entire hour-long meeting on how to make an analogy to make the new pi new APIs
[1584.40 → 1590.00] kind of make sense, and we never got there but Luke says he has a new solution yeah yeah stay tuned
[1591.04 → 1597.52] anyway if the 1060 in spite of its slightly fewer functional units so I'm going to go ahead and pull
[1597.52 → 1602.80] up the non-tech article here again thanks, thanks Mr Ryan smith for compiling this wonderful chart that i
[1602.80 → 1606.88] am outright taking from you so that i can show it to my viewers, but it's okay you can get more
[1606.88 → 1612.00] information from Mr smith's article so you should go over there i did link it in the chat so aside
[1612.00 → 1619.12] from having fewer Cuba cores fewer texture units um it is clocked the same it has the same memory
[1619.12 → 1625.92] buds bus width uh it has the same as I'm interested in testing this very close so if this thing over
[1625.92 → 1634.88] clocks yeah like a GTX 1066 gig the 10 performance advantage that NVIDIA quoted to us over Rx 480 could
[1634.88 → 1644.24] stretch out significantly at the same time there's a pretty big flop difference yep and like the
[1644.24 → 1650.00] more than 10 percent eight fewer texture units is actually pretty large and like the amount of
[1650.00 → 1655.60] Cuba core difference is actually fairly substantial so like it's going to be an interesting test i don't
[1655.60 → 1660.88] know i really wish they had called it something else this is very frustrating for me, it and it really
[1660.88 → 1668.24] or that should have been the 1060 and then the 10 like okay it should have been a ti yeah the 1066 gig
[1668.24 → 1674.96] should have been a 1060 ti so what i was just going to say was this smacks of one of two things intentional
[1674.96 → 1683.68] deception or complete disorganization, and you know how you and i were discussing our theory or your theory
[1683.68 → 1689.44] i won't take credit for your theory that the event in London uh the NVIDIA event in
[1689.44 → 1698.88] London was intended to launch the uh 10 series notebook uh GPUs as well as titan x and possibly
[1698.88 → 1704.00] this but that they just jumped the gun that was kind of the theory that you had thrown at me because
[1704.00 → 1710.56] okay think about it that that talk at Stanford like look at pictures of that room that's a pretty random
[1710.56 → 1715.36] talk like the people in there are important and the fact that that conversation happened is good
[1715.36 → 1722.64] and important but why launch a GPU there it's really weird and like i got the email that titan x
[1722.64 → 1727.68] launched like while i was driving to go get food and the subject line was like surprise
[1730.24 → 1738.64] what where did this come from so i have confirmation from NVIDIA that is not the case okay uh the email
[1738.64 → 1743.84] it was a one word doesn't make it less weird one word email no actually no i think there was another
[1743.84 → 1750.88] line it was like no that was never the plan or something okay it's like okay but i still i
[1750.88 → 1756.08] still don't really understand it is still just feels kind of disjointed and distort disorganized because i
[1756.08 → 1761.68] don't like i don't understand and why are you launching this now you have everyone talking about
[1761.68 → 1768.64] the hype of all the mobile but without m awesome new GPUs and laptops thing that just happened
[1769.84 → 1779.20] and ah and i don't think NVIDIA is ill-informed enough to be reacting to Rx 480 with this like i
[1779.20 → 1787.84] think this because it's actually okay if this was just a GTX 1060 card with less ram on it and a
[1787.84 → 1793.92] tweaked firmware to address less ram than i might go oh this is a reaction move, but this is a different
[1793.92 → 1800.56] bin this is a different bin of the GPU yeah, so this was planned months ago so if they're
[1800.56 → 1804.72] going to do that well we've known because there's been rumours of a six gig for a while now versus a
[1804.72 → 1810.56] three gig you mean yeah sorry no there's been rumours of a three gig sorry yeah, yeah like it's this
[1810.56 → 1817.04] isn't a new concept it's been floating around the internet for a bit so it's just it's very frustrating um
[1818.24 → 1824.64] that this is confusing and i feel like I'm turning into a broken record but it feels
[1824.64 → 1832.16] like the more i criticize companies whether it's uh racer or whether it's um actually i take a shot at hp
[1832.16 → 1839.04] in my upcoming spectre video yeah because they actually have a product called the hp um
[1839.04 → 1845.20] uh shoot what was the hp envy spectre from 2012 and I'm like
[1848.72 → 1854.48] yes this is slightly different but it's really frustrating as just a person who consumes
[1854.48 → 1860.80] technology like i was trying to look up an fixity teardown guide of the new spectre so i search for hp
[1860.80 → 1867.68] spectre teardown or hp spectre disassembly hp spectre internals, and it's all the old one because
[1867.68 → 1873.20] that's how SEO works like something that's been well established to be important sits at the top of the
[1873.20 → 1882.40] search ranking titan x just call it something else please it is not a lot for me to ask, and it feels
[1882.40 → 1889.52] like the more i go drone on and on about this the worse it's getting i actually was apparently and
[1889.52 → 1894.32] this is quite an honour I'm very excited about it, i was apparently just invited to join uh
[1894.32 → 1901.20] racer CEO mining tan on stage at pax i actually have no idea what it's about other than that i think
[1901.20 → 1906.72] it's something to do with blade yeah which makes sense because well it's its okay oh do we know
[1906.72 → 1910.96] what it's about like is it like should we be talking about it though or is it a surprise i
[1911.52 → 1919.12] think we can let's just not anyway the point is I'm I'm joining him there because i love the product
[1919.12 → 1925.04] but i i I'm saying it right now I'm saying it right now heads up to the world i plan to criticize
[1925.04 → 1930.96] the blade naming scheme while I'm on stage with him because if i don't keep trumpeting this
[1930.96 → 1935.76] message then no one will hear it i think he does it at this point just to spite me personally
[1938.32 → 1943.84] maybe knowing that guy yeah that's what i wasn't going to say that part, but that's exactly what i
[1943.84 → 1954.24] thought all right let's do our first uh I'm so shiny it's really it's ready right now uh let's do our
[1954.24 → 1960.96] first uh IDF coverage here, so this is from the original article here is from pc purr I'm going to go
[1960.96 → 1966.32] ahead and drop this in the twitch chat here boom let's pull up the article our good buddy Ryan shroud
[1966.32 → 1975.12] over there is talking about intel's project alloy that promises to make my idea for how to make VR better
[1975.12 → 1982.24] completely obsolete because apparently they're a bunch of butt holes mean people they're taking my
[1982.24 → 1988.80] my whole idea and making it completely irrelevant because their idea is better and designed by actual
[1988.80 → 1995.76] engineers who know what they're doing so it's called project alloy, and it is meant to enable a completely
[1995.76 → 2006.56] untethered VR experience it utilizes you guessed it intel processors and sensors, and it moves all the
[2006.56 → 2013.04] necessary compute into the headset including enough battery to power the device for a typical session
[2013.68 → 2020.64] the goal is to remove the need for a separate pc now this is not the first time that a chipmaker has
[2020.64 → 2027.44] demonstrated a working prototype of something like this and uh the first example was the AMD salon q
[2028.24 → 2034.40] so let's go ahead and pull that up uh okay the article that we have here is from ours technical
[2036.88 → 2044.80] come on ours you can do it there you go that's the salon q that had like an AMD what was in that
[2044.80 → 2054.56] thing uh FX processor so FX APU with r7 grade graphics so eight gigs of ddr3 it was terrible why are they
[2054.56 → 2063.12] doing this um well they're doing this because i guess the idea is that while my idea of converting the
[2063.12 → 2068.64] three wire tether into a single thin cable and moving some of the battery power for the headset
[2068.64 → 2075.28] as well as the media converter for thunderbolt to um for thunderbolt to HDMI and USB uh well my idea
[2075.28 → 2083.60] is probably better for now i don't know 10 years from now maybe sure assuming war's law holds up yeah
[2084.48 → 2092.64] but like i feel like a wireless communication system while still talking to a separate processing unit
[2092.64 → 2098.16] is going to be so much better because like okay i have used the salon q it was actually i didn't know you
[2098.16 → 2104.80] actually tried it a disgustingly horrible experience huh like terrible remember salon's cortex
[2105.92 → 2111.52] that's that company cortex remember when i went to CES i think it was in 2015 and i was all
[2111.52 → 2115.84] excited about this one company and i was going to go see them first and i was super stoked because they
[2115.84 → 2120.88] were another competitor in the VR scene right that was that scene feels like it was forever ago it was
[2120.88 → 2126.40] this was an advancement this was an advancement okay, but it was a horrible experience to the point
[2126.40 → 2131.92] where they told me to come back because what i was describing to them sounded like bugs and then i
[2131.92 → 2134.96] came back and tried it again, and they're like yeah it's all fixed everything's good and I'm like no
[2134.96 → 2142.88] this is broken this is such a terrible experience and the CEO is there being like oh and I'm like how
[2142.88 → 2148.96] are you guys going to compete against oculus and five well five at the time was not really a thing it was
[2148.96 → 2155.36] pretty crap but then came out, and now it's the better one so anyway um just to frame that yeah
[2155.36 → 2161.68] original five had a lot of problems originally he didn't talk to me about five no at all no, no yeah
[2161.68 → 2167.28] that that took over that that came later but I'm I'm I'm following the horse that's running the race so
[2167.28 → 2173.28] anyway intel demonstrated using your hands and other real world items to interact with the world using real
[2173.28 → 2181.68] sense so the salon uses a leap sensor cool and this is an interesting this must be a comment
[2181.68 → 2185.52] from the article or something current implementation that was shown during the keynote has promise
[2186.24 → 2193.60] but is currently this is great i love this shroud can be so tactful sometimes but is currently
[2193.60 → 2199.92] clunky and less than what pc per expected from the company interesting the current prototype headset
[2199.92 → 2207.20] looks and this is another quote pretty heavy pretty bulky so here's the problem hashtag disappointed
[2207.20 → 2216.56] here's the problem though with trying to move with trying to use wireless communication to a base station
[2217.76 → 2227.04] the the the gigabytes per second there's a problem of data unless you are using some kind of very
[2227.04 → 2234.88] sophisticated compression which would be highly visible very noticeable on a screen that's supposed
[2234.88 → 2242.64] to be the size of your entire field of vision like until the compression and decompression technology can be
[2242.64 → 2249.28] done instantly which right now we're not even close like even GPU accelerated compression like the
[2249.28 → 2255.20] best that NVIDIA and AMD and intel can develop right now uh that you're using for technologies like steam and
[2255.20 → 2261.84] home streaming is not anywhere near low latency enough for VR so we're talking uncompressed data streams
[2262.56 → 2269.52] huge amounts of data, and you have to somehow beam it wirelessly without everyone in the house getting
[2269.52 → 2276.16] cancer yeah that's an important part and i get all that which is why i understand why they might not be
[2276.16 → 2283.84] going that direction at least now and that's fine move the processing onto your chest or your back or your hips
[2283.84 → 2291.36] I'd be interested to see more like a suit yeah like an entire wearable suit yeah because you can make
[2291.36 → 2301.04] a decently powerful computer that's like eight pounds yeah okay you heard it here first you heard it here first
[2301.04 → 2309.12] okay PCI Express bridge around the back to like the GPU that has direct open access to cooling yeah and stuff
[2309.12 → 2316.56] yeah motherboard mounted on the front with CPU power supply like battery packs around the thighs
[2316.56 → 2320.56] yeah because you could have layering you know those stupid orange pants i have that everyone comments on
[2320.56 → 2326.56] in every video yes i do you could have this kind of like lots of pockets and stuff on the side and have
[2326.56 → 2332.00] them loaded with rechargeable batteries this could be a very interesting project you know what's really
[2332.00 → 2339.76] funny is like i posted a picture on Twitter a little while ago saying like stay tuned for my VR backpack this
[2339.76 → 2346.08] is unlike anything you've ever seen so many of the comments are like corridor digital did a video like
[2346.08 → 2354.96] that okay listen carefully this is unlike anything you've seen means that they didn't
[2354.96 → 2365.36] so there are a lot of different ways there's a lot of different takes on a VR backpack boom yeah yeah
[2366.48 → 2372.24] and i think this take this is what i would prefer this is what I've wanted people to kind of work on
[2372.24 → 2380.48] because putting everything on your head is so unnecessary yeah, and you get the Sullana cortex where
[2380.48 → 2384.72] like okay the q is beyond that and whatever, but it's the same concept and there's a lot of
[2384.72 → 2390.80] weight it's big in the front, and it's big in the back, and it doesn't work very well and like this
[2390.80 → 2397.92] is some pretty grade nine physics lesson stuff here but the further the weight gets away from your body
[2397.92 → 2404.88] the much, much worse that weight becomes where your neck whereas if you can take the weight, and you can
[2404.88 → 2413.92] get it in nice and tight like in a vest type form factor i mean we could be looking at a very, very usable
[2413.92 → 2421.52] experience and like okay so with it on your where was I going with this i had it for a second uh
[2422.72 → 2429.52] with it on your head there's the pain, and it has to be a contained experience, so there's weight pain
[2429.52 → 2432.56] all that kind of stuff contained experience it doesn't feel very good you're not going to be able
[2432.56 → 2439.36] to pack in as much hardware for one because you could go like crazy like the left side of my back has
[2439.36 → 2444.40] one graphics card the other side of my back has another graphics card like ridiculousness or you
[2444.40 → 2450.00] could just go with one doesn't matter like you could do either um what you could like what I'm
[2450.00 → 2454.32] saying is you're not that why don't we water cool it while we're at it okay why not let's do it uh what
[2454.32 → 2459.12] I'm saying is you're not that limited in the hardware that yeah probably could yeah, but you could you
[2459.12 → 2463.28] could put more stuff there which is great because you're dealing with like atom processors or smaller
[2463.28 → 2467.52] stuff or whatever yeah when it's going on your head that sucks, and you're not going to get the performance
[2467.52 → 2472.88] that people actually want right now in VR some people are concerned about heat but i think with
[2472.88 → 2480.00] a sky lake processor like a core i5 6400 or something like that you whatever intel might say about that
[2480.00 → 2487.36] you've got enough power to run VR games it's just fine um and that's like oh no you get something like
[2487.36 → 2496.24] a 6600t 35 watt TDP desktop chip and like to build a channelling thing there's a different word for that
[2496.24 → 2500.48] i screwed that up but build a channelling thing like 3d print something a shroud there we
[2500.48 → 2505.68] go uh to go over your CPU so it pushes all the air like down yep then it won't be hot in front of
[2505.68 → 2511.36] you it's not going to blow up into your face keep it away from you um you can use uh yeah oh man
[2512.56 → 2518.72] solar style GPUs can shoot down your back an it motherboard is actually not that big yeah no
[2518.72 → 2524.48] it's not big at all like seriously not that big like there you go okay, okay well we are going to uh
[2524.48 → 2529.12] we're going to give this some more thought offline but there you have it folks you heard it here
[2529.12 → 2534.72] first um but anyway sorry one more thing before we move on the thing that really sucks about it
[2534.72 → 2539.52] is the coolest thing about oculus right now is the headset is really nice yeah, and it's light
[2539.52 → 2545.04] small, and it's light and that's perfect, and it's very noticeable between the two yep going to
[2545.04 → 2552.00] something where it's all stored up there is so backwards oh anyway sorry all right speaking of
[2552.00 → 2558.40] things that are backwards we usually do our Squarespace sponsorship spot first and today

[2665.20 → 2673.12] so your website will look great on a square screen on a wide screen on a tall screen on a small screen
[2673.76 → 2678.80] or on a nothing at all screen sorry i was reading Horton here's a who last night so I'm like i was
[2678.80 → 2682.48] going to be like well technically it wouldn't technically it wouldn't look great on that, but you could feel
[2682.48 → 2688.00] great about it even if you weren't looking at a screen yeah they've got 24 7 support via live chat
[2688.00 → 2693.28] and email to help you get set up if you're not a super techie person, and you can actually customize
[2693.28 → 2698.48] your site further if you happen to be a bit more of a techie person the templates all look great and
[2698.48 → 2703.68] whether you want a complete website with like directions to your restaurant and a menu and like
[2703.68 → 2707.60] you know customer testimonials in a gallery or whether you just want one of those
[2707.60 → 2714.80] goofy one-page web presences that are popular with web 2.0 companies i mean i realize it's not
[2714.80 → 2718.72] in my talking points to criticize one of the services that Squarespace offers I'm not saying
[2718.72 → 2726.56] Squarespace does a bad job those sites do work well for mobile okay I'm not talking about the ones that
[2726.56 → 2732.08] scroll a long way and actually do contain information I'm talking about the ones that just have like an
[2732.08 → 2739.04] inspirational picture and like a company name and a slogan and like a contact us yeah or something
[2739.04 → 2745.84] you know what don't even have a web page or if you do use Squarespace because if you do, you can try it
[2745.84 → 2750.72] out for two weeks for nothing with no credit card required and then when you decide you like it, you can
[2750.72 → 2756.00] go to squarespace.com slash when and use offer code when to save 10 and if you need help because you're
[2756.00 → 2760.32] like all we had before was a picture this isn't hard, and then you're like oh I'm a little lost on making
[2760.32 → 2765.60] my website they have 24 7 email live chat support which i already said, but that's okay it's still
[2765.60 → 2770.48] important anyway it's doubly important Squarespace it's doubly important
[2775.52 → 2778.96] if they're not going to let me use their old slogans I'm going to make up my own
[2780.08 → 2785.20] so every week we have to come up with our own custom Squarespace slogan yeah Squarespace doubly
[2785.20 → 2795.92] important double portents double port nation oh man okay hopefully our rep isn't watching this one
[2797.92 → 2801.12] nick is probably just literally crying upstairs right now probably
[2802.48 → 2807.12] why do i even do this you know what's funny last week when he was on the show he was participating in
[2807.12 → 2813.36] the sponsor spot shenanigans turns out it's just part of the show it kind of is you get sucked into
[2813.36 → 2823.20] this show you know like the show sucks we try to make it not suck all right next up another CCF tech
[2823.20 → 2830.64] article intel baby lake desktop lineup has been leaked dun dun dun dun dun
[2830.64 → 2833.04] 77700k
[2835.04 → 2839.84] that was difficult to predict I'm sure as heck didn't see that you know what sometimes it is
[2839.84 → 2847.76] that's true with things that is true i did not see i did not see 6950x coming yeah at 1700 dollars
[2848.64 → 2849.84] you got me intel
[2853.44 → 2861.92] good job you pulled it over on me that time i didn't see that one coming oh and speaking of which
[2861.92 → 2868.32] we do have a video for the people that asked for it which was a few um on a computer that's cheaper than
[2868.32 → 2873.84] a CPU yeah which is really easy to do when the CPU is 1700 that's right we should have done a
[2873.84 → 2882.72] computer cheaper than a CPU with uh my 22 core Leon for the 44 000 454 000 CPU yeah not 40 yeah yeah
[2882.72 → 2888.64] like you could have a computer and a laptop and a new phone cheaper than a CPU all your electronics
[2888.64 → 2894.56] cheaper than a CPU you know people give us a lot of crap for clickbait but like to trust me if we wanted to
[2894.56 → 2902.40] clickbait we could clickbait i actually have a great clickbait video coming very soon oh my double
[2902.40 → 2909.52] triple or quadruple your internet speed oh yeah no that's actually except you actually can see yeah
[2909.52 → 2916.80] that's we try to keep our clickbait where like it's actually true usually and or where if there's a
[2916.80 → 2922.24] question mark the answer isn't always no because there's that thing where like when news articles do
[2922.24 → 2925.52] something with a question mark the answer is always no, but we try to make it so that it's not
[2925.52 → 2934.08] always no so oh Geez what i will say about this is that while the video most assuredly contains
[2934.08 → 2939.44] a reference to Theo Joe he's actually offered to provide me with a custom video clip for it oh Geez
[2939.44 → 2944.96] it is not a Theo Joe video it is a legitimate way well isn't he doing actual tech stuff now
[2946.00 → 2951.60] like not troll text i don't I think he has another channel which is like actual text okay i hadn't
[2951.60 → 2959.84] Theo Joe tech Theo Joe and i think this is like actual legitimate serious things okay, okay yeah
[2960.48 → 2967.52] okay yeah it looks like these are real things, and it's actually got content Xbox One S unboxing like
[2967.52 → 2973.28] he's actually doing real things with that said he definitely hasn't uh he definitely hasn't given up
[2973.28 → 2977.36] on the whole complete nonsense seven hours ago how to make money without working
[2977.36 → 2987.04] oh how to get an Xbox One S for free uh probably my favorite one of his that I've ever
[2987.04 → 2991.52] looked at although i haven't looked at many is this one how to get free cable with all the channels
[2992.48 → 3001.68] it involves um taping blank CDs to your coax cable being careful of the spacing because like science
[3001.68 → 3015.52] so be sure to do it exactly like this i mean oh Geez what the hell yeah probably my favourite thing
[3015.52 → 3020.96] about his videos is not his videos but reading the comments under his videos of people who are like
[3020.96 → 3025.20] actually i have reason to believe this wouldn't work
[3028.72 → 3035.44] no really hey are those the headphones you're looking for uh no i found them Brandon did have
[3035.44 → 3040.88] them though he had two pairs he had one pair signed out, and he had the other pair on his desk he's like
[3040.88 → 3047.04] oh yeah i noticed i had two so I'll put one on my desk it's just like how that one day when we were all
[3047.04 → 3051.04] going to like compete over that mouse, and then he just noticed that it happened to be plugged into his
[3051.04 → 3058.08] computer already and just took it yeah the MX master yeah i still have one on my desk because i was gonna
[3058.08 → 3064.16] review it is has literally never been plugged in oh what yeah i just i keep meaning to like to review it but
[3064.16 → 3073.84] i really like i actually get i get the i get that really worrying feels freezing but hot uh
[3073.84 → 3085.84] sensation in my wrist if i use almost anything but a corsair um m40 or m45 wow even the additional
[3085.84 → 3091.60] weight of the m65 even though it's the same shape um it seems like it might be a combination of the
[3091.60 → 3097.04] weight and the fact that i have to avoid the snipe button makes it less comfortable for me like i
[3097.04 → 3103.60] haven't had wrist issues since i started using that mouse so I'm just gonna stick with it, I'm like
[3103.60 → 3109.52] I'm like Baron this way i actually have literally a pile that has a label next to it that says Linus's
[3109.52 → 3116.96] do not touch of m45s on the shelf corsair was kind enough when i was like yo i noticed the m45 is
[3116.96 → 3124.56] discontinued this is a big problem for me do you have any left they basically gathered everything
[3124.56 → 3130.32] that was in the office put in a box and sent it to me, i was like look this is in your best interest
[3130.32 → 3137.12] because my mouse whether on purpose or by accident appears on camera all the time it is in your best
[3137.12 → 3143.52] interest for it to be your mouse but i can't have them if they don't exist anymore please send me more
[3143.52 → 3147.36] yeah so they did it all right let's talk about the uh let's talk about the baby lake rumours
[3148.16 → 3153.76] there are 10 skews detailed in the leak uh the mainstream desktop chips will be slightly delayed to early
[3153.76 → 3160.72] 2017 with mobile processors set to arrive as soon as possible and the mainstream chips will use LGA
[3160.72 → 3169.44] 1151 the same soccer to sky lake which is actually cool um it is revealed that the mobile chips are
[3169.44 → 3177.76] already shipping to OEMS oh wow um, and it is revealed that baby lake x so the h-e-d-t high
[3177.76 → 3186.88] h-e-d high-end that's right high-end desktop yeah high-end desktop will utilize LGA 2066
[3187.52 → 3197.12] the same as sky lake x um there's some like specific processor spec stuff there's a lot of it so chipset
[3197.12 → 3201.76] will change to 200 series there will be no compatibility with older generation motherboards
[3201.76 → 3209.76] uh and the core i7 7700k will be yet another quad-core with a 95 watt TDP compared to 91 watts a higher
[3209.76 → 3217.92] base clock so 4.2 versus 4.0 gigahertz with boost to 4.5 versus 4.4 plus the presumable uh architectural
[3217.92 → 3223.28] improvements though this is still not exactly like the world's most doesn't seem like leaps and bounds
[3223.28 → 3228.64] exciting thing ever um the core i5 7600k will be a quad-core with no hyper threading didn't see that one
[3228.64 → 3235.92] coming um the 7700 will actually have a significantly lower base clock than the k variant this time
[3235.92 → 3241.68] around at 3.6 allegedly, although it'll have a much lower TDP so they're actually going mainstream with
[3241.68 → 3247.04] the not k one yeah, and they are giving enthusiasts a significant performance bump for being enthusiasts
[3247.04 → 3251.04] and buying a k whether they're overclocking or not although another way of looking at that is that
[3251.04 → 3259.92] they are taking away how close the 6700k was to the uh 6700 and making it not as close anymore yeah so
[3259.92 → 3265.76] that more people will buy the more expensive one yes um because money the t chips are going to have 35
[3265.76 → 3272.24] watt TDPS apparently uh i actually just recently worked on a pretty cool what intel CPU to buy
[3272.88 → 3277.20] article so that's coming up soon, and it looks like the t chips while they're all going to be within
[3277.20 → 3283.44] that same TDP range um are going to be significantly higher clock speeds are going to be available with
[3283.44 → 3286.64] significantly higher clock speeds although i don't know anything about boost clocks right now
[3287.60 → 3292.00] it is speculated that we'll see the usual five to ten percent per core performance improvement over
[3292.00 → 3300.48] the previous generation with key features to include 30 hertz 5k support on one display and 5k 60 hertz with
[3300.48 → 3309.60] dual interface um with dual interfaces um with dual interfaces HEVC 10-bit hardware decoding um 4k blah blah
[3310.08 → 3316.80] support for thunderbolt 3 etc so not necessarily the most exciting thing nope, but it'll be faster and
[3316.80 → 3323.68] it'll be like the same price as the outgoing chips so you'll buy it and this is why we need zen to do
[3323.68 → 3331.44] really well yeah all right the Logitech g pro gaming mouse designed with and for professional
[3331.44 → 3337.60] esports player i always get a kick out of this when this is like the headline from a gaming peripheral
[3337.60 → 3346.00] company designed in collaboration with professional esports designed for professional gamers but Logitech i
[3346.00 → 3350.00] actually had a conference call with them about this i decided not to do a review because i am just
[3350.00 → 3358.32] straight up not qualified to test it um well ed's not doing it ed kind of went yeah this is a
[3358.32 → 3365.76] legitimately good product by the look of things, but he doesn't think that it's uh that it gets
[3365.76 → 3371.92] a spot on the review calendar right now because it's not like anything fundamentally new basically what
[3371.92 → 3379.60] they've done is they've taken a shape that professional gamers loved uh which is what is it the g
[3379.60 → 3387.68] uh g uh g303 or whatever it is, or it's g100 something whatever they've taken a shape a g100s there we
[3387.68 → 3393.60] go that's the one sorry i was struggling because it's all just g's and numbers so they've taken a
[3393.60 → 3402.88] shape that gamers love the g100s, and then they've put their uh BMW 3366 sensors the same one that's used in
[3402.88 → 3411.12] the g502 and the g900 inside it, they've optimized the weight making it basically a good shape top of
[3411.12 → 3419.84] the line sensor like final mouse competitor ultra light mouse 69 bucks 69 bucks for the top of the line
[3419.84 → 3424.56] sensor hyper lightweight i should make a video on like all the best products at 69 dollars
[3425.68 → 3431.20] actually that's a kind of because actually okay there's the p400 immature buyer's guide yeah can you
[3431.20 → 3437.60] build a computer with all products that cost 69 dollars and how good is it could you probably
[3437.60 → 3445.36] could ram would be doable drive case motherboard case mouse intel has CPUs in that range AMD does too
[3447.04 → 3451.36] i mean monitor would be tough so with GPU you could get a monitor you could get a video card for
[3451.36 → 3456.16] 69 dollars it just wouldn't be very good well same with monitor yeah you might actually be able to
[3456.16 → 3461.76] get a 1080p monitor for 69 bucks, and you could enjoy all the 1080 penis should I do this should I
[3461.76 → 3465.84] actually do that's actually like not the worst idea we've ever had this is a good Sancho we're like
[3465.84 → 3471.28] coming up with some pretty good video ideas here um, so basically this is the mouse this is like the
[3471.28 → 3477.60] mystery mouse that a handful of pro gamers have been actually using to compete and on streams for quite
[3477.60 → 3484.32] some time but haven't been able to talk about um looks like the bomb looks like it's going to sell a metric
[3484.32 → 3489.68] butt ton and uh kudos to Logitech for listening to their listening to their customers and listening
[3489.68 → 3494.40] to their pro gamers because as much as I'm mocking them a little bit here for advertising you just
[3494.40 → 3500.64] like helping co-design my poker Logitech actually does seem to take that seriously and they actually
[3500.64 → 3505.20] do seem to do it so when i was when i was there checking out the g900 there was a lot of like
[3505.20 → 3513.92] like you know if we wanted to do this thing but then like so-and-so from the sponsored team was
[3513.92 → 3518.64] like no it has to be this way and then like they pushed us to do this thing or that thing and these
[3518.64 → 3525.12] were the engineers talking where honestly usually when i go talk to different companies the way that
[3525.12 → 3529.04] i get like the insider information that the PR guys don't want to talk about is just talk to the
[3529.04 → 3534.24] engineers because they don't really have a greatest filter usually they just kind of say
[3534.24 → 3540.72] stuff which is great that's perfect for me so like i don't know they actually do seem to care which is
[3540.72 → 3551.20] good all right um global foundries to skip 10 nanometers we're getting into our rapid fire topics here
[3551.20 → 3560.16] to skip 10 nanometre and jump straight to 7 nanometers so they are i guess that's pretty much all there is
[3560.16 → 3567.20] to say about it, they're currently operating on 14 nanometre fine and they in 2015 they acquired
[3567.20 → 3572.96] semiconductor manufacturing assets from IBM and is using them to fast track their 7 nanometre progression
[3573.84 → 3580.40] 69 monitor is possible i should totally do that build guide 1080p 19 inch widescreen from view sonic
[3580.40 → 3591.28] ultimate 69 pc i have to spray paint like a blue six and a pink nine on the side of it terrible
[3591.28 → 3594.80] all right speaking of terrible uh Indiegogo campaign the oh
[3596.88 → 3605.60] dun dun dun oh okay that's probably it uh okay oh okay
[3610.40 → 3619.52] you're welcome all i did was click a link okay all right oh yeah I'm trying to get one of these oh
[3619.52 → 3620.24] really yeah
[3622.64 → 3631.04] vi live the smart shorts that boost your manhood well we have actually covered something very similar to
[3631.04 → 3639.44] this on the land show before that one was an insertion device that was for female keel exercises well
[3639.44 → 3644.24] pelvic floor exercises for males are pretty much the same thing i don't know if they're still called
[3644.24 → 3651.28] keels i think they are but basically yes you squeeze you know yeah squeeze there, and they're trying to
[3651.28 → 3659.12] gamify it to improve sexual performance and sexual health for men, and you can back this if you want to
[3659.68 → 3664.88] have one of these blood flow to the region is just good for your overall health even if it's not for
[3664.88 → 3669.84] sexual reasons just to clarify yeah i wonder if it makes me look like this guy
[3673.84 → 3680.48] so it comes with an instructional app a wireless tracker and sensor embedded shorts these shorts may
[3680.48 → 3685.28] actually improve your sex life says the Huffington Post these smart shorts will make your soda bottle
[3685.28 → 3692.88] explode says the verge great someone was having fun uh someone was having fun writing those uh writing
[3692.88 → 3700.72] those quotes so there you go anytime anywhere by live v helps you monitor your pelvic fitness this
[3700.72 → 3707.76] part of their video when he's driving the beaver is hilarious i just have to say that they have a
[3707.76 → 3712.88] whole video, and he's he has this beamer and the lights keep on doing this like super suggestive
[3712.88 → 3721.44] thing it's hilarious all right so there you go i don't know what a review of that'll look like or if
[3721.44 → 3726.72] it'll how safe for audience members under 13 it'll be, but it can't be any worse than the how-to
[3726.72 → 3729.68] hide your porn video so i green-lighted that i guess I'm green-lighting this
[3729.68 → 3736.48] hide your porn video was literally your idea i think so wasn't it, but it was like back
[3736.48 → 3743.60] to like the NCI it was very long time ago but i think it was your idea you know what for all the
[3743.60 → 3748.32] hate on that video okay we were talking about how i really like true crypt back in the day and then you
[3748.96 → 3752.80] brought up the idea of actually for all the hate on that video it's the second hit for how to hide
[3752.80 → 3759.52] your how to hide your porn on Google and has over a million views now it has been like the
[3759.52 → 3764.40] and like the like to dislike bar used to be horrible yeah, and now it's bad, but it's not
[3764.40 → 3768.80] nearly as horrible i just almost reported our video that's not oh my don't pull it Colton no i
[3768.80 → 3776.32] meant to uh i meant to look at the statistics um yeah look at that like it is gets jumps in views
[3776.88 → 3783.28] what that must be where it hit that search ranking okay that's probably it i wonder if it coincides with
[3783.28 → 3791.28] like seven years of time have been spent watching you basically around suggestively on camera seven
[3791.28 → 3792.56] years of human life
[3795.04 → 3800.32] people really like porn and on that note thank you very much for tuning into this week's
[3800.32 → 3808.88] wans show uh we will see you guys again next week same bat time same bat channel have fun what a show
[3812.24 → 3813.28] have fun in your box
[3818.16 → 3820.24] oh
[3820.24 → 3834.24] I've been waking up that
[3839.12 → 3846.80] yeah, but you could do them in the morning right but i never trust myself and i don't know when I'm
[3846.80 → 3851.04] actually going to be done so like if it's oh i go to bed at six, and then it's three hours before work
[3851.04 → 3854.72] yeah so theoretically if i just don't do this tonight and i do it in the morning it's all good
[3855.20 → 3860.00] but what if it takes more than three hours exactly you can stay up all night you can't stay up all
[3860.00 → 3862.72] morning yeah
