[0.00 --> 7.10]  privacy anyways oh crap I just realized I never actually I never actually checked to make sure
[7.10 --> 13.06]  that that test file worked okay hey so how's your day going so that's a thing I don't know
[13.06 --> 17.82]  if we're continuing this stream or not but we're but we're we're here we're possibly live possibly
[17.82 --> 23.44]  audible and possibly you might be able to hear on the internet I don't know definitely on the
[23.44 --> 29.88]  internet if they can't hear us whether or not it's I'm just gonna work on poses oh that's
[29.88 --> 35.30]  the broken file from before that one that one is very loud I'm not even in twitch chat I think I
[35.30 --> 40.32]  think we are I guess I could just check we are literally destroying the eardrums yeah I think
[40.32 --> 45.32]  it works of everyone I think people are saying it's working just fine you think people are saying
[45.32 --> 50.50]  it's working yeah well it's twitch chat so so basically it's completely meaningless
[50.50 --> 57.34]  the signal to noise ratio is like one to a billion
[57.34 --> 65.46]  we love you twitch chat you guys are great except when you're super duper annoying
[65.46 --> 75.36]  yeah it seems to be working fine what happened at dongers I don't know well that was some twitch
[75.36 --> 82.98]  streamer that was like doing a thing and being obnoxious I think it's kind of like um uh uh reptile
[82.98 --> 88.46]  army leaf alike like it just kind of disappeared like I haven't seen a reference to that since
[88.46 --> 95.78]  that 72 hours when the entire internet thought they were cool because of it and then that was that
[95.78 --> 104.94]  so um oh the feels the feels from saying we love twitch chat or from me saying I love twitch it was
[104.94 --> 111.62]  ironic he doesn't love twitch chat I do love twitch well I don't love twitch chat you know
[111.62 --> 117.00]  it's both you aggressively love twitch chat and aggressively hate twitch chat I brought aggressively
[117.00 --> 123.34]  back yeah I see that you did it very aggressively um the thing about twitch chat is twitch chat is
[123.34 --> 127.62]  more than the sum of its parts or rather less than the sum of its parts because individually
[127.62 --> 135.12]  the people that make up the twitch chat are real people with with real feelings and emotions and
[135.12 --> 141.10]  and likable qualities but as a whole there is there are a whole unless it's just a whole
[141.10 --> 147.12]  anger and trolling those are the two emotions of twitch chat when twitch chat is small enough
[147.12 --> 152.14]  like when I'm uh like when I do my personal streams it can actually be pretty good they aggressively
[152.14 --> 159.58]  love you too by the way aggressive love there we go yes um but when you get like that critical mass
[159.58 --> 165.18]  yeah it just turns into insanity like remember it becomes critical yeah remember star wars launch
[165.18 --> 172.52]  oh that was awful that was insane that entire stream was insane yeah like I yeah I'm pretty sure
[172.52 --> 179.74]  there are still literally hundreds of people banned from our twitch chat for star wars force awakens spoilers
[179.74 --> 186.82]  actually hundreds literally hundreds that so many people didn't believe that it was happening so
[186.82 --> 191.80]  would do it just like check if it was working and then got perma banned and we do not unpack no
[191.80 --> 201.10]  like just to be really really clear you know I do wonder because when show has grown both live and on the
[201.10 --> 206.06]  VOD over the entire time you can check how many members you've banned can you yeah go to your uh
[206.06 --> 214.70]  somewhere you're not streaming right yeah okay so go to ah where is it stats maybe it might not be in
[214.70 --> 221.34]  technically the dashboard it might be in your like profile settings or something oh okay um so like
[221.34 --> 229.80]  profile or uh maybe uh I doubt it uh let me try to find it sure yeah if you try and find it so I know you
[229.80 --> 234.34]  can find the list I don't know if it tells you a total give me a sec so we have been sort of
[234.34 --> 241.32]  gradually growing both live and in the video on demand that we upload to youtube and uh and vessel
[241.32 --> 250.58]  but something that I've wondered about is because we ban so um let's see a word other than aggressively
[250.58 --> 256.52]  proactively proactively from our chat it's like it's like minority report basically it's like
[256.52 --> 261.60]  oh this guy had a bad thought or gal had a bad thought they're you know they might they might
[261.60 --> 268.78]  say something about gone dongers or raising them or who dies or whatever so uh let's just go ahead
[268.78 --> 275.34]  and boom bam bam ban and I think a lot of people stop watching channels that they're banned from the
[275.34 --> 280.88]  chat of especially if they're people who actively engage in the chat um especially if the reason that
[280.88 --> 286.14]  they like to engage in the chat is trolling because I mean why else would you watch a channel
[286.14 --> 291.24]  you know if if what you get out of it is trolling the chat why would you tune in to a channel where
[291.24 --> 299.04]  you can't troll the chat so I do wonder if our numbers particularly on twitch get impacted because
[299.04 --> 306.62]  we ban people because we ban people because my my sort of my perception of most of the twitch channels
[306.62 --> 311.42]  that I've watched based on what's going on in their chat unless they've got it in sub mode
[311.42 --> 316.70]  they don't really bet is that it's pretty much a wretched hive of scum and villainy and
[316.70 --> 322.26]  there there's there doesn't seem to really be any moderation going on so you can get the list of
[322.26 --> 327.52]  everyone but you it doesn't total it for you and I don't think that's complete this is mine this is
[327.52 --> 333.78]  mine oh that's yours yeah okay so where is it settings channel uh so if you go to I think so
[333.78 --> 340.06]  yes so if you click on settings and then channel and videos sure so you have to go to uh settings
[340.06 --> 346.34]  yeah yes well it's not going there there we go channel videos there we go scroll down okay so let's
[346.34 --> 351.62]  let's have a look let's have a look at uh how many times the ban hammer look at this look at this you
[351.62 --> 358.40]  guys I mean this this this is what we're dealing with here it says video player so that's one of the
[358.40 --> 363.58]  things we do on this channel and it also says banner that is one of the other things we do on this
[363.58 --> 366.86]  channel we are banners oh god and also players
[366.86 --> 374.20]  and video is involved somehow there's no way that's complete no there's no way there's absolutely
[374.20 --> 379.24]  no way this is not even this is like this is like 24 you know I think this is like a couple minutes
[379.24 --> 385.50]  of the star wars stream this is to it this is a top 100 this is 100 names I'm pretty sure oh yeah
[385.50 --> 389.68]  so I think that's probably the 100 most recent or something like that there's no way that's complete
[389.68 --> 394.90]  yeah so um that's unfortunate yeah yeah that's unfortunate it'd be kind of cool to be like kill
[394.90 --> 402.36]  count if we had like a counter yeah you can't have most people have like donation or whatever you just
[402.36 --> 409.00]  have like kill count it's like people from whom we will never get a donation
[409.00 --> 414.94]  because we made them super mad you know it's one of the things that's been a challenge with any sort of
[414.94 --> 422.08]  community initiative like the number of people that get mad because we ban them or like uh give
[422.08 --> 425.14]  them warning points on the forum or whatever else and they're like yeah I'm not gonna watch your
[425.14 --> 430.56]  videos anymore it's just like is this even worth it yeah sometimes because a lot of times it's not
[430.56 --> 435.30]  something we did it's something they did and they don't like what we did as a result of what they
[435.30 --> 440.10]  did and it's like it reminds me of that time when I was a student or like a teacher aide back in
[440.10 --> 445.68]  high school and there's this there's this girl in the class who's like just you know if she was
[445.68 --> 449.90]  watching she probably knows I'm talking about her because there's only one person on earth who could
[449.90 --> 455.34]  possibly be this stupid um like basically maybe she might not know you're talking about her every
[455.34 --> 460.98]  time every time she opened her mouth it was a question like you know uh I do have to change the
[460.98 --> 466.78]  teacher's name to protect the identities of the people okay so mr douglas then um you know
[466.78 --> 472.62]  oh oh oh what if the earth ran out of water would we all die
[472.62 --> 483.24]  and I would love to believe that this was trolling but it wasn't and this is a grade nine class and
[483.24 --> 490.60]  yeah I'm all for you know respecting each other and and and all that but when you when you
[490.60 --> 496.76]  disrespectfully interrupt the class without raising your hand to ask a question that you could have
[496.76 --> 503.92]  probably found out through at least I don't know four seconds of deductive reasoning um I don't
[503.92 --> 512.38]  have a lot of patience for you so anyway this this individual would just do and say just a prank bro
[512.38 --> 518.56]  no no I actually no because even when I wasn't her teacher aide anymore and stuff like I just
[518.56 --> 527.20]  I'm sure um this individual would do or say obnoxious thing and things and then and then
[527.20 --> 531.50]  that one's a little brutal I usually defend people that like try to ask questions or whatever
[531.50 --> 535.16]  not putting up your that's not what I'm talking about not putting up your hand no no I'm talking
[535.16 --> 539.82]  about like like anything like like throwing something or dropping something intentionally
[539.82 --> 543.98]  just generally being an obnoxious little individual little individual okay um asking
[543.98 --> 548.40]  questions is one thing asking questions without putting up your hand or like asking at the right
[548.40 --> 555.10]  time is annoying generally generally very very very very very dumb and very obnoxious individual so
[555.10 --> 561.04]  do something obnoxious and then you know when you kind of go hey you can't do that it would be
[561.04 --> 568.92]  like it would be like like like like hens don't pick on her you're being mean to her it's like no
[568.92 --> 574.62]  I'm actually not because you have to understand that your actions have consequences me telling you don't
[574.62 --> 582.50]  do that is not me being mean if you are making a bunch of noise or if you are looking at someone
[582.50 --> 589.52]  else's test in the middle of an exam I'm not being mean I'm not persecuting you I am just having a very
[589.52 --> 593.80]  reasonable response to you doing something that you very clearly know then again if you don't know
[593.80 --> 598.72]  that running out of water means you'll die then maybe you maybe you don't know but if I've already
[598.72 --> 604.02]  told you twice then you know the third time where I'm impatient and I kind of go okay well then you're
[604.02 --> 607.66]  gonna have to turn in your exam now or whatever else even if you're not finished I mean it's not
[607.66 --> 612.02]  like it's not like if you're a third of the way through an exam and you've got literally zero answers
[612.02 --> 616.72]  written down that the other two-thirds of the exam time was gonna result in some kind of a difference
[616.72 --> 624.14]  anyway um I don't remember it was a very passionate story I don't remember what it was about yeah
[624.14 --> 628.00]  don't don't remember it was about twitch chat yeah I don't remember what aspect
[628.00 --> 638.64]  we were talking about ban lists and kill counts and then oh yeah people being upset because we
[638.64 --> 643.52]  banned them because they were bad because they broke the rules and then people like oh on the forum
[643.52 --> 649.74]  yeah yeah yeah we got we came full circle and people who people who defend those people and like
[649.74 --> 653.70]  oh you're being mean to them like the whole defending someone who's clearly wrong just because
[653.70 --> 658.72]  sometimes the in defense of some of the people in the forum sometimes they genuinely don't know what
[658.72 --> 663.16]  happened that's true and it'll be their friend that just got banned and they're like yo like he was
[663.16 --> 669.70]  a cool guy why did he get banned I'm like well sometimes I explain what happens sometimes I don't if it
[669.70 --> 673.32]  was like a very public if it was something that happened in a PM I never explain what happened yeah
[673.32 --> 677.38]  I'm like sorry I can't discuss this whatever it was posted publicly on the board I might tell the
[677.38 --> 682.20]  person what happened I might not depends on if it like judgment call well yeah exactly yeah well they
[682.20 --> 687.62]  called someone this random massive list of explicits and basically just pooped on their entire day
[687.62 --> 692.84]  multiple times we told them not to then they did it a consecutive five times after that
[692.84 --> 697.76]  after us warning them every single time and then we permanently banned them usually they're like oh
[697.76 --> 705.26]  okay not everyone takes that philosophy because like I I remember having a conversation I think it was
[705.26 --> 714.64]  with uh it was either with a family member or it was with a friend and his wife um or both actually I
[714.64 --> 718.54]  think and it was something along the lines of like oh well if your wife's wrong you have to support her
[718.54 --> 724.36]  anyway I'm like no actually I don't if my wife's wrong I'm gonna tell her she's wrong and she should
[724.36 --> 730.42]  probably revise her I think you can I think you can probably take like a maybe more delicate route
[730.42 --> 734.24]  you don't have to like attack the person for being wrong no of course not you can have a discussion
[734.24 --> 740.06]  but there but in my opinion agreeing with someone who is wrong does absolutely nothing to develop
[740.06 --> 745.32]  you are actively making the the general population of the world less intelligent and not less
[745.32 --> 750.32]  intelligent but perhaps less well you know less not you are wrong about more things yes so less
[750.32 --> 756.66]  knowledgeable certainly yeah and uh less correctly and less well trained well and I don't mean training
[756.66 --> 762.74]  in the sense of like you know good boy clicker clicker you know like click training I just mean like
[762.74 --> 768.28]  like I I science training math training exactly knowledge about sewing training it doesn't matter
[768.28 --> 774.26]  training just means like creating an environment where the people understand people around you
[774.26 --> 777.72]  understand how to interact with you and you understand how to interact with them like when
[777.72 --> 784.46]  I say nail remover on bread and then eating it a good idea no that's training and so I train my wife
[784.46 --> 789.34]  in exactly the same way that she trains me we train each other how to deal with each other and the
[789.34 --> 794.44]  reality of it is growing together it's a very beautiful thing the reality of it is is that pretending
[794.44 --> 800.76]  that someone is that someone is right or that someone is justified is not helpful to them in the
[800.76 --> 805.58]  longer term especially if that is someone that someday is not going to be young and beautiful
[805.58 --> 812.18]  anymore and that I'm going to have to deal with when 60 I'm going to be ugly not you you'll never be
[812.18 --> 818.06]  ugly or you'll be ugly much more gradually I mean the thing about the thing about certain
[818.06 --> 824.08]  how do I how do I go about this certain ethnicities is that they have very different aging curves
[824.08 --> 833.08]  so like everything's going to be great until 60 and like I'm going to be like I feel so old and
[833.08 --> 837.62]  then all of a sudden I'm going to be the one who looks young so we both have to be ready for each
[837.62 --> 842.60]  other to not be young and appealing anymore and we're going to have to get along pretty darn well
[842.60 --> 848.18]  if our relationship is going to survive at that point so then you'll have AR anyways and everyone's
[848.18 --> 853.70]  like everyone's like oh you know Linus this is brutal I hope she's not watching I've said every word
[853.70 --> 858.76]  of this to her face multiple times I have no problem saying it to her face because that's
[858.76 --> 863.56]  important too you have to be able to say to someone's face exactly what you're thinking if
[863.56 --> 869.50]  you can't do it you should not be married period I kind of agree with that philosophy
[869.50 --> 874.92]  someone's like Linus please stop okay okay okay we'll get on to some tech dudes we haven't rolled the intro yet
[874.92 --> 878.74]  oh yeah intro and the show begins
[878.74 --> 891.60]  so many people in the chat Yvonne is a nice person she's a nice person I think she's great
[891.60 --> 894.88]  he's not saying that people don't understand
[894.88 --> 900.22]  oops
[900.22 --> 905.54]  hold on I have a plan
[905.54 --> 906.50]  oh
[906.50 --> 911.56]  apparently that oh dear
[911.56 --> 913.04]  did I crash it
[913.04 --> 917.04]  um I don't think so there you go
[917.04 --> 917.86]  drag
[917.86 --> 918.22]  hey
[918.22 --> 918.66]  hey
[918.66 --> 919.50]  tunnelbear
[919.50 --> 920.66]  woo
[920.66 --> 921.66]  it's Christmas
[921.66 --> 924.60]  I fix it
[924.60 --> 927.32]  I fix it
[927.32 --> 931.58]  so I fix it is like our metal sponsor
[931.58 --> 932.12]  metal sponsor
[932.12 --> 933.04]  hey it kind of is
[933.04 --> 937.96]  unintentionally working out
[937.96 --> 945.12]  I mean what's an unintentional workout when you laugh too hard and your abs get sore
[945.12 --> 945.42]  yeah
[945.42 --> 949.24]  anyway
[949.24 --> 950.62]  um
[950.62 --> 951.38]  so
[951.38 --> 952.10]  so
[952.10 --> 955.48]  this may be the worst show we've ever done
[955.48 --> 959.26]  we're literally 15 minutes in and have covered nothing
[959.26 --> 959.84]  nothing
[959.84 --> 961.44]  nothing at all
[961.44 --> 967.10]  and I've had so much of this water I'm gonna have to pee before the end of the show for sure
[967.10 --> 968.38]  I need to pee right now
[968.38 --> 972.56]  well that's good maybe that'll make the show last longer
[972.56 --> 973.16]  oh
[973.16 --> 977.74]  anyway
[977.74 --> 978.60]  anyway
[978.60 --> 981.50]  uh devblogs.nvidia.com
[981.50 --> 984.82]  uh nvidia kind of had a big event this week
[984.82 --> 985.92]  pascal
[985.92 --> 989.00]  has been unveiled
[989.00 --> 992.46]  this uh in the form of the tesla p100
[992.46 --> 995.68]  so nvidia has even gone as far now
[995.68 --> 999.66]  as to do away with introducing their new big gpus
[999.66 --> 1002.22]  as a quadro card
[1002.22 --> 1009.36]  and now they have skipped straight to the uh the cards that only sell to the big boys
[1009.36 --> 1012.80]  um and they've gone straight to the enterprise cards
[1012.80 --> 1017.68]  and everyone else workstation and desktop is going to have to wait
[1017.68 --> 1022.32]  quite some time for a pascal architecture graphics card
[1022.32 --> 1028.80]  with that said we do get to have a lot of details about pascal that we wouldn't have
[1028.80 --> 1035.10]  if they hadn't released anything based on it because contrary to what a lot of people seem to think
[1035.10 --> 1043.78]  nvidia does not completely re-engineer a micro architecture for an enterprise you know machine learning
[1043.78 --> 1051.62]  processor versus like a workstation you know 3d modeling processor versus a desktop gaming processor
[1051.62 --> 1058.32]  in fact i would say the vast majority of the time that i'm aware of it is the same silicon
[1058.32 --> 1071.64]  pretty much maybe they've made some tweaks you know cut off a thing here or bin for a lower tdp there it's all just a binning process and then which features they want to enable through the hardware and through the drivers
[1071.64 --> 1077.08]  in order to make it suited for the particular task that is built for so what that means
[1077.08 --> 1080.44]  re-engineering that every time would be excessively expensive and totally not worth it
[1080.44 --> 1085.64]  yeah i mean look at how long it takes them to build one of these yeah um so so this is cool because it tells
[1085.64 --> 1092.12]  us it gives us some idea of what a titan there are no cool letters left anymore
[1092.12 --> 1097.56]  they already used z they already used x they already used black like what are they going to call it
[1098.92 --> 1107.00]  titan omega like yeah you can get into like old like god style names titan that's where that kind
[1107.00 --> 1110.76]  of comes from right right the titans but yeah you can't have the titan zeus because then it would be
[1110.76 --> 1118.44]  like fighting itself that's what you could call their like dual gpu card each one has its own unique power
[1118.44 --> 1122.76]  even though they're the same and when the sli doesn't scale at all it's because they're fighting
[1122.76 --> 1132.60]  each other it means one of them won yeah um so what this tells us is what a next generation titan
[1132.60 --> 1140.04]  might look like so we're looking at about seven billion transistors in 600 millimeters squared we're
[1140.04 --> 1149.32]  looking at uh it's built on a 16 nanometer process it contains 3840 cuda cores and 240 texture units
[1149.80 --> 1157.16]  um they could call their like uh their high-end but still consumer cards like savage or something
[1158.36 --> 1165.56]  that's um savage i think someone's done that i think savage video card is a thing like uh savage video
[1165.56 --> 1171.48]  card huh savage garden s3 savage yeah yeah so sorry you've been you've been beaten to the punch on
[1171.48 --> 1184.28]  that one um okay so uh 246 64 stream multi-processors sorry i have to say 7 billion 150 billion transistors
[1184.28 --> 1190.60]  sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry uh 5.3 teraflops of performance so yeah we definitely got a die shrink
[1190.60 --> 1199.40]  this time around which is nice and five miracles miracles i hated that i watched the stream and he's
[1199.40 --> 1204.36]  like yeah five miracles came together in order so i'm like no that was engineering don't call like
[1205.00 --> 1211.40]  some engineers extremely hard work miracles i'm gonna back up logitech on this one they're like
[1211.40 --> 1220.28]  science wins whatever campaign yeah super cool miracles not super cool miracles win no like stop um and
[1220.28 --> 1225.32]  like someone worked really hard on like some of the miracles i i don't even i don't even really
[1225.88 --> 1234.60]  get like one of the miracles is extreme performance equals powering high performance computing
[1235.40 --> 1244.60]  deep learning and many more gpu computing areas like what what i think we need to look up miracle here
[1245.40 --> 1253.16]  miracle are we missing something miracle a miracle is an event not explicable by natural or scientific
[1253.16 --> 1258.20]  or scientific laws you had engineers and scientists working on this you're saying like nope everything
[1258.20 --> 1266.44]  they did is just nope forget it and not explain not only that but the first miracle is better performance
[1266.44 --> 1274.92]  something you've literally done like clockwork since your company was founded and you would have
[1274.92 --> 1280.12]  needed to do so or else you would fail and to be clear i'm not down on that and i'm not saying that's
[1280.12 --> 1285.72]  not a big deal i'm not saying i'm not saying that but it's a feat of engineering the engineers and the
[1285.72 --> 1290.92]  scientists and the and the business units you could have called it like five great feet and and the sales
[1290.92 --> 1296.12]  i'm not saying that every business unit of nvidia didn't work hard and kick ass to get there i'm
[1296.12 --> 1302.76]  just saying it's not a miracle so it's a whole lot of hard and kicking such an event may be attributed
[1302.76 --> 1310.52]  to a supernatural being oh magic a miracle worker a saint or a religious leader and this this is something
[1310.52 --> 1316.36]  that really bothers me about this when apple does it and when nvidia watches apple's keynotes too closely
[1316.36 --> 1323.88]  yeah and tries to replicate them is that that jacket it's like the the jobs reality distortion
[1323.88 --> 1329.48]  field as it as it's called was unique to that individual it is not something that you can can
[1329.48 --> 1334.12]  and it is not something that you can reproduce no matter how no matter i mean it's it's it's
[1334.12 --> 1338.76]  the hilarious thing about it is nvidia is a company full of engineers like like pretty much to a man
[1338.76 --> 1345.80]  uh and woman and like it's it's almost like watching that segment it's almost like they reverse
[1345.80 --> 1351.32]  engineered like yeah how to do a keynote unfortunately poorly unfortunately well
[1351.32 --> 1355.48]  like sometimes reverse engineering goes very well you can't engineer charisma yeah
[1357.24 --> 1363.40]  well they're gonna try to with robots yeah they're gonna try um so the next miracle is envy link this
[1363.40 --> 1369.40]  is really cool they've been talking about this for a while this is a replacement for pci express a
[1369.40 --> 1375.40]  faster higher bandwidth interconnect a lower latency interconnect between gpus and i
[1375.80 --> 1380.68]  and i can't i don't even know if i can call them gpus because they're not even it's not even for
[1380.68 --> 1384.84]  graphics at this level but anyway i'm gonna call them gpus because it's a lot more convenient than
[1384.84 --> 1391.08]  trying to call them uh but but uh nvidia pus or whatever they're gonna start they're probably gonna
[1391.08 --> 1396.20]  they're probably gonna pull an amd and like start calling them something else it's like no ours are apus
[1396.20 --> 1403.24]  yeah it's like well hold on a second i mean you do know they're cpus calculating processing yeah you do know
[1403.24 --> 1410.28]  that intel also has cpus with graphics on them right yeah they don't call them apus so what do you use
[1410.28 --> 1413.48]  why are you talking about processing yeah i don't know what they're gonna call them so envy link
[1413.48 --> 1421.40]  really cool hbm2 but this is this is this is not an nvidia miracle this is like this is like an
[1421.40 --> 1424.20]  an evolutionary improvement to a technology that is
[1426.04 --> 1431.32]  better that's not a miracle it's not a miracle someone worked really hard on like the theory and then
[1431.32 --> 1436.36]  bringing the theory to life and then like getting it into like mass producing it testing it making
[1436.36 --> 1441.88]  sure that there is low failure rates like this went through a lot of work next is unified memory and
[1441.88 --> 1447.72]  compute preemption so significantly improved programming model i feel very bad for engine any
[1447.72 --> 1452.12]  engineers that worked on any of the things that are now being called miracles and if you did i'm sorry
[1452.12 --> 1457.88]  you're great yeah you're doing a good job like you your efforts are wrecking and 16 nanometer fin
[1457.88 --> 1465.80]  fat manufacturing process which is a not a miracle again and be totally not new um i mean intel's had
[1465.80 --> 1478.84]  processors based on 14 nanometer in your computer potentially for like a year so yeah um which isn't
[1478.84 --> 1484.20]  to say again is which is not to say that it all isn't like great and impressive and that i'm not
[1484.20 --> 1492.12]  looking forward to a new generation like a true generational leap in video card performance i just
[1493.08 --> 1498.84]  really i just i've gone on about this for too long someone said the fact that this show still exists
[1498.84 --> 1503.96]  is a miracle that's maybe that's possibly a miracle that probably did involve some kind of divine
[1503.96 --> 1511.80]  intervention yes um the fact that 5 700 people are watching it is definitely a miracle yeah i love
[1511.80 --> 1518.28]  you guys i had no yeah all right so there is some more cool stuff here this is neat this was original
[1518.28 --> 1522.76]  actually hold on do i have an op for the last one i don't so the op for this one is leapfrog
[1522.76 --> 1528.44]  master race on the forum and the original article here is wow i can choose between cnet and yahoo
[1528.44 --> 1534.52]  good luck i'm gonna go with yahoo they need all the help they can get um well they own other companies
[1534.52 --> 1543.08]  nvidia's drive px they're in a lot of trouble nvidia's drive px2 to be used in autonomous race cars
[1543.08 --> 1553.80]  for the robo race championship this really raises a lot of questions for me um number one is like
[1553.80 --> 1561.00]  like how cool is this because being the cars are going to be identical the way this is actually
[1561.00 --> 1570.12]  going to be initially uh set up is as um i forget what it's called e something e formula or something
[1570.12 --> 1577.80]  electric it's going to be like uh like a um like an opening act for formula e for formula e um and what
[1577.80 --> 1584.28]  they're going to do is they're going to have all identical cars with these little deep learning
[1584.28 --> 1593.08]  capable brains that are like the size of a lunchbox that are based on pascal gpus and these cars are
[1593.08 --> 1601.08]  going to race each other getting better as time goes on meaning that feasibly fee uh that feasibly
[1601.08 --> 1608.84]  these these brains these car brains could get better enough than each other that even though
[1608.84 --> 1616.04]  they have exactly the same base hardware both in the box and around it in the car there could be like
[1616.04 --> 1624.44]  one that's noticeably better than the other ones isn't that cool but then how they're intaking data
[1624.44 --> 1628.60]  because if they're all literally intaking the exact same amount of data without some randomization they
[1628.60 --> 1633.56]  would actually all come to the same they would have a slightly different perspective like if it was
[1633.56 --> 1640.36]  just cameras and sensors and they didn't have like like external whatever it's just what your car can
[1640.36 --> 1647.64]  in itself pick up do not know do not know that but assuming that they made them race as though they
[1647.64 --> 1654.12]  were a driver then feasibly well because the reason why i said external is because if it's a race and it's
[1654.12 --> 1660.36]  although they are a driver they probably have pit crew that can talk to them yeah i see what you
[1660.36 --> 1665.40]  mean so like like kind of like spot for them like you would with binoculars so you would be able to
[1665.40 --> 1669.64]  like tell them what's going on but if they're contained within their car they wouldn't be able to see the
[1669.64 --> 1674.68]  other things so if you're actually in first and by a fair amount you might be getting no information
[1674.68 --> 1678.84]  for a long time and some of the car behind you might get more intelligent eventually pass yeah and then
[1678.84 --> 1684.76]  then you'd be out of which could be very interesting they need to go for like a while but the other
[1684.76 --> 1692.04]  question that this raises is who could possibly care because i don't know about you guys and maybe
[1692.04 --> 1696.04]  maybe we can get a straw poll going on this you want to want to hit me with hit me with the straw poll
[1696.04 --> 1703.96]  let's get a straw poll going would you care about a sporting event if there was no uh storylines to
[1703.96 --> 1710.28]  follow about the people involved yes and take a moment and think about this because one of uh it's
[1710.28 --> 1715.16]  actually rather interesting one of the reasons why people don't really care that much about a lot of
[1715.16 --> 1721.48]  current space travel is because they're sending robots this is like very trackable you can very
[1721.48 --> 1727.00]  much figure this out they send a person up sorry i said christ that field yeah yeah remember they send
[1727.00 --> 1731.72]  a person up everyone's like whoa wow and then they send a robot up and they're like hopefully it doesn't
[1731.72 --> 1737.56]  crash i guess i'm gonna do something else um like this is a very consistent thing across a lot of
[1737.56 --> 1746.84]  different realms so just remember that so would you have cared about the miracle on ice if it was a
[1746.84 --> 1755.32]  bunch of tesla p100s versus a bunch of other tesla p100s yeah would that have had an emotional impact on
[1755.32 --> 1762.20]  you as a human being i think i think this is i think this is a very valid discussion um yeah yeah
[1762.20 --> 1768.04]  go ahead and wow did they change they changed their font or something straw poll looks different yeah
[1769.16 --> 1774.04]  it does look different yeah okay can you fire that over to me through like hangouts or something so i can
[1774.04 --> 1779.48]  now it looks normal oh weird i have no idea what just happened i i blame anything i was just gonna post it
[1779.48 --> 1784.28]  in chat any compute yeah i want to show the results on screen oh right i could also look at the chat and i
[1784.28 --> 1792.92]  could see it that way oh oh it is so fast no i got this i got this i got this yeah all right um so
[1792.92 --> 1800.84]  let's go ahead and start start bringing in those results here so will you care about really okay so
[1801.72 --> 1806.28]  because honestly like i'll tell you i'll tell you something like when uh for example you know vancouver
[1806.28 --> 1814.92]  canucks you know the local sports team um when they make a lot of roster changes over the offseason
[1814.92 --> 1821.80]  i actually find it a lot harder to pick up on the new season and like care about what's going on because
[1822.44 --> 1830.52]  i i i i haven't i haven't watched the development and struggle of you know the sadine sisters turning into
[1830.52 --> 1835.48]  two of the top players in the league over the course of their long and you know illustrious career
[1835.48 --> 1841.64]  the way that everyone called them made of glass and then actually one of them ended up holding the nhl iron
[1841.64 --> 1846.60]  man streak for the most consecutive games played like like that kind of stuff those kinds of storylines
[1846.60 --> 1853.00]  are what make the sport because i don't play hockey i can't play hockey i'm which you'll know well enough
[1853.00 --> 1858.12]  if you if you uh are subscribed on vessel very soon um i can't either just to like yeah
[1859.00 --> 1863.80]  that's not what i'm saying yeah he's not just giving me crap this is this is a company-wide struggle
[1863.80 --> 1870.12]  play ball hockey yeah put me on skates it's a different story um so so following those storylines
[1870.12 --> 1876.20]  is what makes it interesting to me it's what makes it's what makes it human because i can't watch hockey
[1876.20 --> 1881.48]  and kind of go oh yeah i can appreciate exactly how difficult that shot was to make the same way that i
[1881.48 --> 1887.56]  can watch badminton badminton i don't care who's playing like i do have my personal favorites again
[1887.56 --> 1893.00]  due to storylines the struggles like you know every time lee chong way takes on lin dan it's like
[1894.52 --> 1900.92]  does he redeem himself this time he lost two gold medal olympic matches to the guy in a row in the
[1900.92 --> 1904.68]  third set the second one went to deuce if you guys play racket sports you'll know what that means
[1904.68 --> 1911.32]  means you have to win by at least two points and just like he comes from malaysia so like just
[1911.32 --> 1918.76]  completely way smaller talent pool is basically a a national hero there whereas i'll feel to be
[1918.76 --> 1922.52]  to be fair lindan is basically a national hero because badminton's sort of a big deal in china
[1922.52 --> 1928.28]  too but team china wins everything and when team malaysia gets to stick it to team china even in
[1928.28 --> 1934.60]  the smallest possible way it's it's very it's it's a big deal in that sport so but with that said i can
[1934.60 --> 1939.00]  watch any high level players play badminton i can really appreciate it because i'm like wow i really
[1939.00 --> 1943.32]  understand the finesse that it took to to make that shot or whatever but hockey is not about that
[1943.32 --> 1949.56]  for me so i it surprises me that 43 of you are saying that you will care about machines racing
[1949.56 --> 1957.72]  each other in competitions uh without without that human aspect of it what do you think will you care
[1957.72 --> 1963.32]  i mean you don't follow sports anyway no um i would probably watch it just because i'm interested in ai
[1963.32 --> 1971.24]  and then get very bored very quickly as what i expect to happen probably happen where the first
[1971.24 --> 1975.80]  bit's kind of a mess and then it kind of sets in and just sits there because you'll watch football but
[1975.80 --> 1980.76]  that's all that i'm aware of that you'll like sit and watch and enjoy even football i'll watch the super
[1980.76 --> 1986.84]  bowl with my family because it's a thing and that's about it i love playing sports watching a sport just
[1986.84 --> 1991.40]  makes me want to play the sport it doesn't necessarily want to make me want to watch more of the sport
[1991.40 --> 1995.80]  right you know what i mean yeah like if i watch football i'm like damn i really wish there was
[1995.80 --> 2001.72]  more like casual men's teams that i could play football again if i watch hockey i'm like man i
[2001.72 --> 2007.00]  wish there was a men's league in bc that wasn't literally just fighting um if i watch anything else
[2007.00 --> 2011.16]  i'm just like i want to go out there and do the thing like watching a sport and then immediately going
[2011.16 --> 2017.64]  outside and playing it afterwards cool so this is an interesting point uh the twitch chat moves too fast
[2017.64 --> 2023.16]  for me to for me to figure out who it was but they said you know what about you know robot robot wars
[2023.16 --> 2031.08]  like robot battles that a lot of i'm into that but again if you watch the show was it literally
[2031.08 --> 2036.92]  called robot wars i don't remember what it was called battle bots or whatever a lot of that if you
[2036.92 --> 2042.84]  watch the show was actually talking about the controllers and the people and the people yeah and
[2042.84 --> 2047.72]  that's like the controllers isn't the people controlling right but but an ai version of that
[2048.52 --> 2053.64]  would you be into that i don't know i would watch it because i like ai stuff okay but like like
[2053.64 --> 2058.84]  traditionally throughout media if there isn't a person attached to something it's not really followed
[2058.84 --> 2064.60]  as much because i could i could get i could get into that especially if you have people or teams of
[2064.60 --> 2071.48]  people designing the battling robots whereas this car thing is however many identical cars with identical
[2071.48 --> 2075.32]  brains and identical programming programming to me that's not interesting like you might as well
[2076.20 --> 2083.24]  it's like it's like horse racing if the horses were machines maybe one time yeah and then forever
[2083.24 --> 2089.96]  after that it would have to be like here's our car it's designed in our way maybe there's requirements
[2089.96 --> 2095.48]  like it's like a big sponsorship from microsoft and like a sponsored team from google and yes
[2095.48 --> 2100.04]  apple sponsor team like i could get into that yeah yeah like it has to have a working door it has to
[2100.04 --> 2105.96]  take x amount of passengers i mean you know what i mean sorry i'm about to totally go off on a tangent
[2105.96 --> 2115.88]  here you think about how fanatical people already get about companies like apple microsoft google
[2117.48 --> 2126.28]  imagine this imagine if they played sports the way people get fanatical about sports teams and the way
[2126.28 --> 2133.24]  they get fanatical about cell phones or game consoles can you imagine can you imagine sony versus
[2133.24 --> 2140.76]  microsoft baseball yeah okay yeah and then baseball game company baseball teams apple apple versus google
[2140.76 --> 2145.96]  it started and started world war four the mobile the mobile phone we skip three playing soccer or
[2145.96 --> 2149.88]  football or whatever you want to call it or if microsoft was involved it would start world war one
[2152.76 --> 2153.00]  rough
[2156.76 --> 2164.28]  everyone that's what someone in chat says it's pretty accurate apple versus fbi right
[2166.60 --> 2171.24]  no offense to apple but i think a whole lot of engineers versus a whole lot of at least some of
[2171.24 --> 2176.04]  them are probably in good shape federal agents i'm going with the federal agents oh you mean like
[2176.04 --> 2181.72]  literally sports with people i thought these were representatives of like robots no oh wow no i
[2181.72 --> 2189.24]  actually mean tim cook hitting a baseball oh wow okay that'd be really fun apparently nintendo already
[2189.24 --> 2195.96]  owns an nlb team yeah doesn't even surprise me yeah and they're like uh who is it remember
[2195.96 --> 2206.60]  let's see who can google it first seattle dale the seattle man shut up yeah really i remember it
[2206.60 --> 2208.28]  like it's it was a pretty prominent team
[2211.40 --> 2216.76]  they are one of three baseball teams under corporate ownership i had no idea rogers communications on the
[2216.76 --> 2224.60]  toronto blue jays fascinating well there you go i i do not follow baseball very closely because i have
[2224.60 --> 2229.72]  i like the the most the most up-to-date baseball player i know is like ken griffey jr because he
[2229.72 --> 2235.80]  was on the cover of my like snes baseball game that's about as up-to-date as i am on baseball
[2235.80 --> 2241.08]  although i do know that the uh that the what are they called again not the maple leafs the uh blue
[2241.08 --> 2245.72]  jays thank you i do know that the blue jays are like good now or something so that's cool are they
[2245.72 --> 2250.44]  because there had to be one team in canada that wasn't any good at anything that's cool um yeah i don't
[2250.44 --> 2256.20]  think any canadian teams are going to make the nhl playoffs this year out of like six
[2257.64 --> 2261.96]  or however many there are our players just go and play for the states sevens or whatever it is
[2261.96 --> 2266.12]  you look at like demographics of players it's not even that simple anymore because up until
[2266.12 --> 2272.28]  up until this year the dollar was basically par so it didn't matter um so as long as you're as long
[2272.28 --> 2276.60]  as your revenues were coming in from ticket sales in which case the canadian teams had a significant
[2276.60 --> 2281.48]  advantage you could pay those us salaries and with the south in the salary cap era especially
[2281.48 --> 2286.36]  the teams that do really great sales like toronto who jacked up their prices in spite of the fact that
[2286.36 --> 2290.68]  they've made the playoffs i think they made the once in like the last 10 or 15 years or something like
[2290.68 --> 2295.80]  that um they still jack their prices every year because the revenues are great so in the salary cap
[2295.80 --> 2302.76]  era as long as you have decent ticket sales you can afford anything it's all strategic now and
[2302.76 --> 2308.92]  honestly it seems to me that like being in a crappy city is way more important now than having enough
[2308.92 --> 2313.96]  money like if you're in some city that nobody wants to live in then it's going to be harder to attract
[2313.96 --> 2320.28]  talent yeah straight up yeah um interesting but it's much much deeper than that as well like there's a lot
[2320.28 --> 2328.44]  of there's a there's a lot of um basically just politicking that goes on yeah there wouldn't be much
[2328.44 --> 2342.68]  politicking in robo races anyways real topics um yeah sure um i mean we have one more jeez we've got
[2342.68 --> 2348.68]  what two more nvidia things oh this one's really cool so i lost the talk i'm gonna skim through nvidia's
[2348.68 --> 2358.76]  new ai brain has eight pascal gpus seven terabytes of solid state memory and uh it takes 3200 watts which
[2358.76 --> 2364.04]  is exactly why you do not need that 2000 watt power supply put it down stop looking at it yeah i got a
[2364.04 --> 2369.16]  message on the forum today of some dude asking if he needed a 2000 watt power supply because he was
[2369.16 --> 2374.04]  getting like two graphics cards or something and he's like i need to double it like no you're fine
[2374.92 --> 2381.80]  everything is fine except your wallet yeah if you buy that don't like i literally ran seven gaming
[2381.80 --> 2391.08]  computers off of a 2000 watt no that was a 1600 watt don't worry about it you're fine anyway so we've got
[2391.08 --> 2401.48]  nv link links between these eight gpus a couple deons and uh it's a 3u chassis that has a 3200 watt power
[2401.48 --> 2408.20]  supply and nvidia is boasting that it is uh so the chips are arranged in a hybrid cube array which
[2408.20 --> 2412.28]  allows them to communicate with each other independently and offload tasks in a more
[2412.28 --> 2418.84]  coordinated way they claim the memory has as much throughput as 250 x86 servers although they don't
[2418.84 --> 2424.92]  clarify exactly what sort of x86 servers those are um it wouldn't surprise me though based on the fact
[2424.92 --> 2434.60]  that they're using hbm memory which is already way faster than the quadist channelist of memory that
[2435.32 --> 2441.16]  that intel could possibly strap onto a cpu at this point um already available for pre-order and it's
[2441.16 --> 2448.12]  going to cost you a mere 129 000 us dollars i literally just made a video complaining about the
[2448.12 --> 2454.84]  speed of high-speed pc tech stations that's probably fine i can afford that yeah you know what 80 bucks
[2454.84 --> 2460.20]  too expensive it's uh it's really interesting to see people's reaction i actually posted a screenshot
[2460.20 --> 2466.60]  from uh the creator studio where i showed that on the thousand dollar htmi cable we made back our money
[2466.60 --> 2475.40]  on it um and a surprising number of people actually shoot right right so sorry i got to this because you
[2475.40 --> 2480.60]  were saying that um you know you were based on making a video around it you could probably afford that
[2480.60 --> 2488.04]  most no no that's not what i was saying oh high speed pc tech stations like the tech benches i made
[2488.04 --> 2492.92]  a video complaining about how expensive they were oh i totally misunderstood i'm saying like and i said
[2492.92 --> 2499.32]  in the video we have some at work but for personal use spending like 140 on a like us literally two
[2499.32 --> 2506.68]  platforms of plastic yeah yeah yeah yeah okay well sorry i'll i'll finish that story anyway i i had thought
[2506.68 --> 2514.04]  because it's uh the the capture is 2200 on the video that we spent a thousand dollars just on the
[2514.04 --> 2520.76]  product itself to make and i was surprised because i expected people to kind of go we don't normally
[2520.76 --> 2526.92]  make 2200 yeah it's got well that's something i wasn't expecting people to to know um i was expecting
[2526.92 --> 2532.68]  people to kind of like like pile onto it and just be like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2532.68 --> 2560.68]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 1.6 million views in a span of about 15 days oh um yeah yeah yeah yeah
[2560.68 --> 2576.12]  um yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the same one that's the whole global
[2577.60 --> 2577.92]  um yeah yeah yeah yeah right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right
[2578.16 --> 2580.52]  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah the Neither PPEs
[2580.52 --> 2583.06]  That we do that really have a more understanding of our e-endo
[2583.06 --> 2584.80]  everything not to be��고sted to routine 좋
[2584.80 --> 2585.94]  Wow YEAH
[2585.94 --> 2591.20]  So me putting out that number was just, it was basically meaningless other than to say,
[2591.20 --> 2598.70]  hey, for all the people who were concerned that we threw away our money to take one for the team,
[2598.96 --> 2603.50]  hey, we made it back because thanks to people sharing the video and people watching it,
[2603.60 --> 2606.32]  we were able to make enough on the AdSense to cover it.
[2606.52 --> 2612.32]  A surprising number of people, other than Facebook, got that and even understood
[2612.32 --> 2616.40]  that we didn't necessarily then make $1,200 on the video
[2616.70 --> 2622.62]  because there is an entire organization of people that goes behind creating these daily videos
[2622.62 --> 2627.00]  and a building and equipment and an internet connection that is not cheap
[2627.00 --> 2630.46]  but really does make all those other things operate more smoothly anyway.
[2631.58 --> 2632.92]  Yeah, so I just, I don't know.
[2632.98 --> 2636.34]  I just, I thought it was pretty cool that most people got it,
[2636.86 --> 2641.30]  that what we do is expensive and that was like, that was like an exception.
[2641.30 --> 2642.48]  That was just kind of a neat thing.
[2643.04 --> 2648.12]  One thing that I didn't know, and Nick kind of linked me to this later,
[2648.26 --> 2655.32]  it looks like posting specifically that may have skirted around the rules, sort of it's a gray area,
[2655.56 --> 2660.84]  but you're not actually allowed to share, which I thought was the case before,
[2661.04 --> 2663.60]  but then I had thought wasn't the case anymore.
[2663.86 --> 2668.10]  And now Nick has helpfully gone into the terms of service
[2668.10 --> 2670.54]  and highlighted the appropriate areas and sent it to me
[2670.54 --> 2673.30]  because he knows that's the only way to get me to read anything these days.
[2674.32 --> 2675.06]  So there you go.
[2675.38 --> 2676.70]  Did you take it down or something?
[2677.52 --> 2680.32]  No, no, I left it because it looks like it's probably fine.
[2681.06 --> 2684.06]  But I wouldn't, I'm not going to make a habit of that
[2684.06 --> 2685.34]  because I don't want to get in trouble.
[2685.56 --> 2685.82]  Yes.
[2685.82 --> 2693.00]  Like I don't want to lose my AdSense over, yeah, not over like telling other people what it is.
[2693.50 --> 2694.80]  What do I look like, Tai Lopez?
[2695.22 --> 2695.54]  No.
[2695.90 --> 2696.10]  Who?
[2696.80 --> 2697.32]  Knowledge.
[2700.32 --> 2702.46]  I forget whose video it was.
[2702.50 --> 2703.98]  I feel really bad because it was great.
[2703.98 --> 2707.94]  Where they, where it's like just the most sarcastic,
[2708.48 --> 2712.88]  just troll video that I've seen in quite some time,
[2712.88 --> 2718.42]  where they basically prove that the house that he supposedly owns is just...
[2718.42 --> 2718.72]  So it was H3H3.
[2719.06 --> 2720.06]  It was H3H3?
[2720.20 --> 2721.62]  Good job, H3H3.
[2721.68 --> 2722.34]  It was awesome.
[2722.78 --> 2724.30]  And they just...
[2724.30 --> 2725.28]  How can you make it real?
[2726.32 --> 2726.76]  Sorry?
[2726.88 --> 2727.08]  Nothing.
[2727.08 --> 2733.82]  And they just, they help you find the conclusion on your own as subtly as possible.
[2734.40 --> 2734.88]  Not subtle.
[2735.88 --> 2737.74]  That he has just rented that house.
[2737.84 --> 2742.04]  It's just a rental house that just has a listing on like a house rental service
[2742.04 --> 2745.30]  that he just used to film that day.
[2745.38 --> 2747.68]  And he's like, yeah, you know, this is my pool and this is my...
[2747.68 --> 2748.94]  Yeah, you're...
[2748.94 --> 2749.60]  Frickin' guy.
[2750.14 --> 2751.66]  I shouldn't even have to know his name.
[2752.08 --> 2754.32]  Like that, the fact that you can buy...
[2754.32 --> 2755.56]  But at least it's knowledge.
[2755.56 --> 2757.92]  The fact that you can buy fame in that way.
[2758.34 --> 2758.74]  Lamborghinis?
[2759.66 --> 2760.06]  Yeah.
[2760.78 --> 2761.82]  What about all these books?
[2762.34 --> 2762.66]  The books.
[2762.78 --> 2764.84]  Do you think he rented the books?
[2765.08 --> 2765.70]  I don't know.
[2766.74 --> 2768.12]  That was one thing I always wondered.
[2768.44 --> 2770.06]  He had that giant house and he's like,
[2770.14 --> 2772.90]  I installed all these bookshelves in the garage.
[2774.56 --> 2776.98]  Despite having a mansion, literally.
[2777.48 --> 2778.84]  I put them in the garage.
[2779.74 --> 2781.96]  Well, he wants to learn close to his cars.
[2781.96 --> 2782.24]  Cars.
[2783.54 --> 2785.54]  Reading while you're driving should probably be more...
[2785.54 --> 2786.50]  More legal than texting.
[2787.04 --> 2787.76]  I just...
[2787.76 --> 2788.92]  I don't know.
[2789.36 --> 2791.72]  I'm going to take this entire book and put it in front of my face.
[2791.80 --> 2792.56]  Is that illegal?
[2792.82 --> 2793.44]  Reading and driving?
[2793.50 --> 2793.74]  Yeah.
[2793.86 --> 2794.34]  I don't know.
[2794.42 --> 2794.76]  I don't know.
[2795.28 --> 2796.40]  Operating a phone is.
[2796.52 --> 2800.04]  But like if you had a newspaper open on your steering wheel, like is that...
[2800.04 --> 2800.94]  I have no idea.
[2800.98 --> 2803.74]  I guess it would probably fall under general distracted driving laws.
[2803.88 --> 2804.12]  Right.
[2804.32 --> 2804.46]  Yeah.
[2804.54 --> 2804.64]  Yeah.
[2804.64 --> 2805.82]  Okay.
[2805.82 --> 2812.56]  So speaking of distracted driving, if you find yourself driving towards a website that
[2812.56 --> 2820.10]  is region locked and you can't access due to a countrywide firewall or a regional restriction,
[2820.60 --> 2821.32]  tunnel pair!
[2821.32 --> 2825.90]  Or if your firewall is incorrectly set up.
[2826.34 --> 2826.64]  Yes.
[2827.24 --> 2827.52]  What?
[2829.20 --> 2829.64]  Oh.
[2831.02 --> 2831.50]  Yeah.
[2831.96 --> 2832.96]  Does that work?
[2833.22 --> 2833.42]  Yeah.
[2833.58 --> 2836.92]  You were able to get around our incorrectly configured firewall.
[2837.08 --> 2837.68]  Damn it, Johnny.
[2837.74 --> 2838.18]  Is he here?
[2839.00 --> 2840.88]  I've been meaning to hit him.
[2840.88 --> 2842.70]  He came and talked to me like right when he came in.
[2842.78 --> 2843.50]  He's figuring it out.
[2843.54 --> 2844.22]  Oh, okay.
[2844.22 --> 2846.22]  It's weird that it's only hardware websites.
[2846.92 --> 2847.48]  That's what I was trying to do.
[2847.48 --> 2848.60]  No, I've hit other stuff.
[2848.60 --> 2848.82]  Really?
[2848.94 --> 2848.98]  Okay.
[2848.98 --> 2851.02]  I think we just mostly browse hardware websites.
[2851.02 --> 2851.22]  That's true.
[2851.32 --> 2852.68]  I think that has more to do with it.
[2852.84 --> 2853.10]  Yeah.
[2853.20 --> 2858.62]  So anyway, so TunnelBear, which we use to get around our...
[2858.62 --> 2860.20]  Allowed me to get to Tom's hardware.
[2860.20 --> 2864.46]  Broken network lets you tunnel to 20 different countries.
[2864.62 --> 2869.36]  It encrypts your connection and browse the internet and use online services privately as though you're
[2869.36 --> 2870.24]  in a different country.
[2870.24 --> 2875.32]  It makes it so that that website thinks that you're someone else from somewhere else.
[2875.54 --> 2876.46]  People are being mean to Johnny.
[2876.56 --> 2877.16]  I love Johnny.
[2877.24 --> 2878.28]  He's a beautiful human being.
[2878.38 --> 2879.30]  Stop being mean to Johnny.
[2879.82 --> 2881.82]  And if he wasn't beautiful, looks aren't everything.
[2882.04 --> 2882.52]  That's true.
[2882.92 --> 2885.16]  Well, I meant beautiful as in like the whole...
[2885.16 --> 2885.76]  On the inside?
[2885.94 --> 2886.16]  Yeah.
[2886.16 --> 2886.60]  And both.
[2886.82 --> 2887.32]  And every...
[2887.32 --> 2887.62]  Both?
[2887.86 --> 2888.02]  Yeah.
[2888.22 --> 2888.38]  Okay.
[2888.92 --> 2893.76]  TunnelBear lets you bypass all the annoying details that typically come with a VPN for personal use.
[2893.84 --> 2899.00]  No port configurations or DNS or IT guys that have to come in every other week
[2899.00 --> 2902.06]  because they're fixing the thing they screwed up last time all the time.
[2902.06 --> 2908.40]  And you can try TunnelBear for free and get 500 megabytes of data simply by going to TunnelBear.com
[2908.40 --> 2909.86]  slash WAN.
[2909.98 --> 2914.52]  Then, if you decide to sign up for an unlimited plan, you can save 10% at that link.
[2914.90 --> 2917.30]  So check that out.
[2918.12 --> 2919.94]  Speaking of things that...
[2919.94 --> 2920.86]  You should.
[2920.96 --> 2921.54]  Check out.
[2921.86 --> 2922.38]  Squarespace.
[2922.38 --> 2922.78]  Squarespace.
[2922.94 --> 2929.10]  Squarespace lets you build a simple, powerful, beautiful website that if...
[2929.10 --> 2929.44]  You should.
[2929.52 --> 2935.82]  Find yourself in a situation where you don't have the know-how or the ability to find a networking
[2935.82 --> 2939.90]  or website building guy that's anywhere near competent...
[2939.90 --> 2940.20]  You should.
[2940.56 --> 2945.96]  You should use Squarespace because that will allow you to do it pretty much on your own.
[2945.96 --> 2953.38]  They have 24-7 support via live chat and email, and it's only $8 a month to start, but...
[2953.38 --> 2953.70]  You should.
[2954.82 --> 2957.76]  I was going to say, but there's a bonus.
[2958.26 --> 2961.50]  If you sign up for an entire year, then...
[2961.50 --> 2961.82]  Oh, no.
[2961.88 --> 2962.74]  I screwed up the...
[2962.74 --> 2963.78]  Oh, now I've broken it.
[2964.06 --> 2969.62]  All their templates feature responsive design, so they look great on any device.
[2969.62 --> 2972.94]  And if all this sounds good, then...
[2972.94 --> 2973.26]  You should.
[2973.30 --> 2977.36]  Start a trial with no credit card required and start building your website today.
[2977.80 --> 2980.98]  When you decide to sign up for Squarespace on a more permanent basis...
[2980.98 --> 2981.24]  You should.
[2981.28 --> 2984.66]  Use offer code Linus to get 10% off your first purchase.
[2984.98 --> 2987.56]  Thanks to Squarespace for supporting the WAN show.
[2987.76 --> 2988.06]  You should.
[2988.08 --> 2993.18]  Keep doing it because otherwise, how would we keep producing this fantastic show that it
[2993.18 --> 2994.22]  is a freaking miracle?
[2994.26 --> 2995.26]  You should keep producing this show.
[2995.26 --> 2996.24]  Even watch it.
[2998.52 --> 2999.04]  Squarespace.
[2999.04 --> 3000.82]  I was too fast for you that time.
[3000.82 --> 3000.84]  Build it's beautiful.
[3001.12 --> 3001.58]  You were.
[3001.70 --> 3002.00]  You were.
[3002.12 --> 3003.34]  You're never too fast for me.
[3003.44 --> 3003.68]  Oh.
[3004.42 --> 3004.90]  Oh.
[3005.36 --> 3009.42]  Speaking of things that you should do, if you have a project, this is hilarious.
[3010.54 --> 3017.96]  Ifixit actually had a sponsorship spot coming up on a regular LTT release, not on WAN show.
[3018.66 --> 3023.12]  And I specifically was in the middle of doing a random video.
[3023.40 --> 3025.30]  I didn't even know they had a spot coming up.
[3025.30 --> 3031.30]  And I was using an iFixit toolkit because I do that.
[3031.36 --> 3031.60]  Yeah.
[3031.60 --> 3036.18]  And I started going into a sales pitch about it.
[3036.18 --> 3037.30]  And I was like, I'm just joking.
[3037.40 --> 3038.34]  They're not the sponsor of the sales.
[3038.72 --> 3039.40]  Turns out they are.
[3042.48 --> 3043.68]  That's kind of funny.
[3044.00 --> 3044.24]  Yeah.
[3044.46 --> 3044.94]  So...
[3044.94 --> 3045.86]  Is that going to end up in the thing then?
[3045.86 --> 3046.26]  It's in the...
[3046.26 --> 3046.86]  It's a live...
[3046.86 --> 3048.38]  It's the live disassembly.
[3048.92 --> 3050.94]  So it's like, I'm not reshooting it.
[3051.68 --> 3051.86]  Like...
[3051.86 --> 3053.58]  That's pretty funny.
[3053.58 --> 3055.58]  I'm going to tell the editor to just do like a...
[3055.58 --> 3056.18]  Like a...
[3056.18 --> 3062.50]  We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this message that actually they are the sponsor
[3062.50 --> 3063.34]  of this episode.
[3063.90 --> 3064.38]  Anyway.
[3064.60 --> 3065.12]  I just didn't know.
[3065.58 --> 3066.26]  It's funny.
[3066.54 --> 3070.26]  iFixit is probably the actual sponsor.
[3070.68 --> 3074.12]  Like, not companies that don't actually sponsor us, like NVIDIA.
[3074.58 --> 3081.54]  Like, the actual sponsor of our actual show that I get the most false positives about
[3081.54 --> 3082.32]  from viewers.
[3082.92 --> 3083.22]  Because I'll...
[3083.22 --> 3083.54]  False positives.
[3083.64 --> 3083.84]  Yeah.
[3083.94 --> 3087.02]  Like, I'll tweet a picture of like a phone that I'm...
[3087.02 --> 3090.32]  Like, I recently replaced the home button in my old iPhone 4.
[3090.68 --> 3092.30]  Because I still use it as an MP3 player.
[3092.56 --> 3094.52]  And everything but the home button about it works great.
[3094.62 --> 3095.56]  Like, why throw it away, right?
[3096.68 --> 3099.88]  And I had all my iFixit crap, like, behind it.
[3099.90 --> 3101.38]  And I was like, hey, I'm repairing the home button.
[3101.46 --> 3103.46]  And people were like, oh, that product placement.
[3103.46 --> 3104.16]  Dad's sponsorship.
[3104.34 --> 3105.30]  I'm like...
[3105.30 --> 3106.84]  No, I'm just actually doing the thing.
[3106.84 --> 3108.48]  No, I'm just using it because it's a really good screwdriver.
[3108.86 --> 3109.06]  Yeah.
[3109.74 --> 3111.46]  And it happens, like, all the time.
[3111.54 --> 3114.38]  Like, people called me on it in the video card painting guide.
[3114.64 --> 3118.24]  Anytime I'm taking a part or putting together anything, they're like, Dad, I've iFixit
[3118.24 --> 3118.64]  sponsorship.
[3118.92 --> 3119.40]  No, no, really.
[3120.04 --> 3120.90]  Great tools.
[3121.46 --> 3122.34]  Great guides.
[3122.60 --> 3123.72]  I use them all the time.
[3123.86 --> 3124.48]  I use them.
[3124.64 --> 3128.76]  I paid for their products before they became a sponsor of the show.
[3128.86 --> 3131.28]  We reached out to them because we love the products.
[3131.28 --> 3136.10]  And they've got an all-new ProTech tool kit that is even better than before.
[3136.20 --> 3141.26]  It replaces the 54-bit driver kit with a 64-bit driver kit so you can have more than 4 gigs
[3141.26 --> 3141.72]  of RAM.
[3142.00 --> 3143.48]  It comes with a more durable case.
[3143.66 --> 3144.38]  That's a joke.
[3144.50 --> 3146.30]  It comes with a more durable case.
[3147.64 --> 3148.12]  It's got...
[3149.24 --> 3150.36]  That's pretty good.
[3150.36 --> 3152.38]  The screwdriver kit attaches via magnets.
[3153.12 --> 3155.78]  It comes with more, like, prying tools.
[3155.86 --> 3156.70]  The prying tools are better.
[3156.80 --> 3157.48]  This is crazy.
[3158.12 --> 3158.42]  They are.
[3158.54 --> 3159.66]  No, they really are.
[3160.10 --> 3161.42]  No, the new ones are way better.
[3161.50 --> 3161.84]  No, I know.
[3162.08 --> 3163.72]  Did Darius show you what he does to his?
[3164.48 --> 3168.70]  The last show that I was on with my brother, they were a sponsor, and I raved about that
[3168.70 --> 3169.08]  mainly.
[3169.40 --> 3169.72]  Oh.
[3170.10 --> 3171.12]  They're so much stronger.
[3171.26 --> 3172.10]  I didn't even know.
[3172.10 --> 3172.14]  No.
[3172.30 --> 3176.08]  He took them and folded them completely in half, and then, like, put it back.
[3176.66 --> 3179.84]  And the plastic wasn't even, like, pale on one side from bending.
[3180.00 --> 3180.48]  Yeah, I haven't seen that.
[3180.50 --> 3182.26]  No, he showed me that, and I was like...
[3182.26 --> 3182.70]  That's crazy.
[3182.90 --> 3183.74]  I didn't even know that.
[3183.90 --> 3188.84]  My thing was the old ones, they're great, I've used them a million times, but the little
[3188.84 --> 3191.36]  ends just get chewed up.
[3191.52 --> 3191.70]  Yep.
[3191.82 --> 3192.16]  Yeah, they do.
[3192.18 --> 3195.56]  And over time, it'll just not really be useful anymore, and that's just kind of how
[3195.56 --> 3196.08]  it was.
[3196.30 --> 3201.28]  So, it includes the new prying tools, a wider variety of opening and prying tools, and the
[3201.28 --> 3203.06]  price is $69.95.
[3203.38 --> 3208.36]  It's backed by their lifetime warranty, and if you go to ifixit.com slash Linus and use
[3208.36 --> 3214.42]  code WAN at checkout, you can save five bucks on your purchase of, my notes say $10 or more,
[3214.48 --> 3216.48]  but I'm fairly certain it's $50 or more.
[3216.54 --> 3221.44]  So, basically, if you buy a kit, you get five bucks off, and the kit pays for itself after,
[3221.44 --> 3223.34]  like, one repair project.
[3223.56 --> 3227.62]  So, to me, it was a no-brainer back when I bought one, and it's a no-brainer today.
[3227.62 --> 3227.66]  Okay.
[3230.52 --> 3232.94]  Surely, we have, like, other topics to talk about today.
[3232.94 --> 3233.30]  Nope, nope.
[3233.30 --> 3234.70]  I even gave Colton a hard time.
[3234.72 --> 3235.66]  Oh, no, this is really cool.
[3235.74 --> 3237.02]  Okay, last NVIDIA topic.
[3237.60 --> 3239.36]  The original article is on...
[3239.36 --> 3240.28]  No, this one's really cool.
[3240.36 --> 3240.72]  You'll love it.
[3240.74 --> 3241.10]  I know, I know, I know.
[3241.10 --> 3243.02]  It's posted by Aming on the forum.
[3243.14 --> 3245.04]  This is by far the most interesting to me.
[3245.84 --> 3246.20]  Prototype?
[3247.12 --> 3248.52]  1700 hertz.
[3249.32 --> 3251.26]  Quote, unquote, zero latency display.
[3251.34 --> 3254.04]  Now, to be clear, zero latency is not zero.
[3254.04 --> 3256.44]  It is 0.56 of a millisecond.
[3256.86 --> 3258.06]  That's pretty sweet, though.
[3258.12 --> 3259.56]  Which is basically zero.
[3259.74 --> 3261.70]  So, what they're doing is they're actually...
[3261.70 --> 3263.32]  Yeah, I'm looking at this a little closer.
[3263.78 --> 3264.54]  Okay, shut up.
[3265.04 --> 3267.78]  So, basically, they are moving...
[3268.46 --> 3269.98]  Dang it.
[3271.86 --> 3272.56]  Dang it.
[3272.90 --> 3273.78]  What are you doing?
[3273.88 --> 3274.36]  Dang it.
[3274.48 --> 3274.64]  Here.
[3275.14 --> 3275.40]  Okay.
[3275.40 --> 3281.28]  So, you can see them vigorously shaking this thing around it.
[3281.40 --> 3284.36]  And the NVIDIA logo, which is actually on the display.
[3284.52 --> 3286.20]  So, that is being run on a display.
[3286.46 --> 3288.92]  Is staying completely stationary.
[3290.34 --> 3292.48]  Very freaking cool.
[3292.64 --> 3298.46]  What that means is that with the appropriate, also very low latency tracking sensors,
[3298.96 --> 3302.86]  a head-mounted display could have an image stay completely static.
[3302.86 --> 3308.14]  Even when you're whipping your head around, whipping your gun around, and exploring virtual environments.
[3309.48 --> 3309.96]  Maybe...
[3309.96 --> 3311.60]  Do you have anything to elaborate on that, Liv?
[3312.20 --> 3313.10]  One of the...
[3313.10 --> 3314.68]  Yeah.
[3314.98 --> 3315.42]  I don't know.
[3315.60 --> 3316.72]  Running that will be interesting.
[3317.80 --> 3318.22]  Well, yeah.
[3318.28 --> 3319.40]  I think it's going to be...
[3319.40 --> 3319.58]  Yeah.
[3319.58 --> 3320.76]  Run at 1700 frames.
[3320.86 --> 3321.06]  Yeah.
[3321.42 --> 3323.26]  I think it's going to be a while until we see this.
[3323.92 --> 3325.08]  One of the things...
[3325.08 --> 3325.40]  Yeah, sure.
[3325.68 --> 3326.36]  One of the...
[3326.36 --> 3329.58]  Just to talk about VR for a moment, because I could talk about VR for another...
[3329.58 --> 3329.68]  Forever!
[3330.26 --> 3330.48]  Yeah.
[3330.82 --> 3331.06]  Yeah.
[3331.06 --> 3332.34]  Um...
[3332.34 --> 3333.34]  It's...
[3333.34 --> 3338.36]  Some people have been a little bit less than enthused, I guess I would say, with some
[3338.36 --> 3339.00]  of the launches.
[3339.26 --> 3340.84]  We don't have any of the headsets yet.
[3342.62 --> 3344.94]  Don't really have any other way to tell you that.
[3345.26 --> 3348.10]  I contacted Palmer forever and a half ago.
[3348.52 --> 3350.06]  Some of you might remember the tweet.
[3350.06 --> 3356.94]  He did end up tweeting me back in a DM, but then the response times have been like months
[3356.94 --> 3358.92]  instead of hours or days.
[3359.04 --> 3359.30]  Anyways.
[3359.62 --> 3363.00]  So we don't have our headsets yet, and we don't have our Vive yet either.
[3363.16 --> 3366.02]  But some people have been disappointed because of the games.
[3366.38 --> 3370.96]  And one thing that has been very commonly said is it kind of feels like you're just playing
[3370.96 --> 3377.24]  a Wii U in terms of quality of graphics, and then the games feel like demos instead of full
[3377.24 --> 3381.34]  games despite costing like $40 a pop, and then you just have a screen on your face.
[3381.62 --> 3382.24]  Which is...
[3382.24 --> 3383.24]  Cool.
[3383.24 --> 3384.24]  Cool.
[3384.68 --> 3386.14]  But people want more than that.
[3386.24 --> 3389.34]  I'm not that surprised or right at the beginning of the launch, yada yada yada yada.
[3389.64 --> 3395.40]  But one of the many reasons why it kind of looks like you're playing Wii U style graphics
[3395.40 --> 3403.68]  is because it's really hard to make games for a lot of people that can run at 90 FPS at
[3403.68 --> 3404.32]  these resolutions.
[3405.14 --> 3406.26]  And that's only 90.
[3406.86 --> 3408.58]  And this thing is way more FPS than that.
[3408.58 --> 3410.36]  That was freaking you!
[3410.36 --> 3413.50]  Way to go, Brandon.
[3413.84 --> 3414.20]  Rude.
[3415.38 --> 3416.18]  Sorry, what were we talking about?
[3416.18 --> 3417.50]  I think we need another Brandon Appreciation Day.
[3417.62 --> 3418.96]  A Brandon Appreciation Day?
[3419.08 --> 3419.62]  When is it?
[3421.28 --> 3422.64]  Oh, I just realized...
[3422.64 --> 3423.42]  Isn't it in the summer?
[3423.48 --> 3423.62]  I think it's coming up.
[3423.62 --> 3424.54]  That shortened to bad.
[3425.08 --> 3425.66]  Oh, wow.
[3426.98 --> 3427.42]  Ass.
[3427.56 --> 3428.70]  Have a bad, bad day.
[3428.84 --> 3429.54]  Badass day.
[3429.66 --> 3430.70]  Bad, bad...
[3430.70 --> 3431.82]  Because Brandon's an ass?
[3432.04 --> 3432.40]  No.
[3433.16 --> 3435.50]  Because you like his attitude?
[3435.50 --> 3435.64]  Maybe.
[3435.64 --> 3436.64]  Badass day.
[3436.64 --> 3437.64]  Badass day.
[3437.64 --> 3438.64]  Badass day.
[3438.64 --> 3439.64]  Badass day.
[3439.64 --> 3440.64]  Badass day.
[3440.64 --> 3443.00]  This was originally posted on the forum by Goodbytes.
[3443.00 --> 3444.66]  Original article is from The Verge.
[3444.66 --> 3451.28]  The Spectre 13 is HP's attempt to out-design Apple.
[3451.28 --> 3455.02]  Which apparently means make it thinner.
[3455.02 --> 3457.56]  Wow.
[3457.56 --> 3461.56]  Now, to be clear...
[3461.56 --> 3462.52]  I could not care less.
[3463.24 --> 3465.78]  The Spectre 13 looks pretty sexy.
[3466.30 --> 3467.38]  Uh, it's got...
[3467.38 --> 3467.72]  What?
[3467.84 --> 3468.16]  Really?
[3468.42 --> 3469.16]  Look at those hinges.
[3469.56 --> 3470.08]  I think they're cool.
[3470.08 --> 3471.36]  That thing looks super derp.
[3471.60 --> 3471.98]  I know.
[3472.06 --> 3474.04]  I think they're kind of, like, classy looking.
[3474.70 --> 3475.08]  I don't know.
[3475.14 --> 3476.04]  That thing looks weird.
[3476.32 --> 3477.28]  The bezel's big.
[3477.82 --> 3479.04]  The hinges are wonko.
[3479.04 --> 3480.54]  You're being such a hater right now.
[3480.56 --> 3481.16]  No, I'm like...
[3481.16 --> 3481.36]  You're doing it on purpose.
[3481.74 --> 3483.10]  Oh, it looks so beautiful.
[3483.94 --> 3485.26]  I like the new logo.
[3486.12 --> 3487.08]  That looks pretty sick.
[3487.08 --> 3488.22]  Did you read about that?
[3488.40 --> 3488.92]  Yeah, I did.
[3489.06 --> 3490.64]  Yeah, I actually do really like the new logo.
[3490.72 --> 3491.42]  I think it looks great.
[3491.50 --> 3493.06]  I think they should have used it before.
[3493.36 --> 3493.66]  Wow.
[3493.94 --> 3494.26]  Okay.
[3495.52 --> 3496.72]  You don't like the hinge?
[3496.72 --> 3497.32]  I don't know.
[3497.92 --> 3499.10]  It's not doing it for me.
[3499.28 --> 3501.52]  Like, quite literally, I'm not just trying to, like, devil's advocate.
[3501.68 --> 3502.48]  Like, I don't know.
[3502.64 --> 3503.26]  It doesn't look...
[3503.26 --> 3503.56]  Okay.
[3503.86 --> 3504.12]  All right.
[3504.14 --> 3506.26]  Like, up close, it doesn't look too bad.
[3506.42 --> 3508.92]  On the big picture, it doesn't really seem to fit in.
[3509.26 --> 3513.70]  Like, everything else is this, like, awkwardly flat, like, straight-line thing, and then
[3513.70 --> 3514.18]  it's like...
[3514.18 --> 3515.80]  I don't know.
[3515.94 --> 3516.62]  So most of the body...
[3516.62 --> 3520.88]  I would expect, like, if it had, like, that Lenovo, like, chain hinge kind of thing, do
[3520.88 --> 3522.04]  you know that one on the yogas?
[3523.08 --> 3523.58]  Oh, yeah.
[3523.58 --> 3524.00]  I know the one.
[3524.00 --> 3525.72]  I think that would suit it really well.
[3526.22 --> 3529.92]  Like, one of those, like, back hinges that wrap around instead of, like, up and through
[3529.92 --> 3530.28]  the middle.
[3530.90 --> 3532.60]  It does feel awkward to hold, though.
[3533.08 --> 3533.38]  Do they?
[3533.50 --> 3533.82]  Yeah.
[3533.82 --> 3533.86]  Yeah.
[3534.28 --> 3535.24]  I think I know the one.
[3535.48 --> 3536.08]  It's...
[3536.08 --> 3536.28]  It's...
[3536.28 --> 3538.08]  It's on the yogas.
[3538.08 --> 3538.10]  Yeah.
[3538.10 --> 3540.38]  If you can find a picture of it, that might be helpful.
[3541.08 --> 3543.32]  So most of it's made from dark gray aluminum.
[3544.12 --> 3548.24]  Bottom is lighter carbon fiber or some nonsense like that.
[3548.24 --> 3553.50]  That weighs 2.45 pounds, which...
[3553.50 --> 3555.90]  The interesting thing about that is...
[3555.90 --> 3556.78]  Oh.
[3557.08 --> 3558.46]  No, I'm not familiar with that hinge.
[3558.46 --> 3558.72]  Really?
[3559.00 --> 3559.32]  Yeah.
[3559.68 --> 3559.90]  Okay.
[3559.90 --> 3560.88]  No, these look pretty cool.
[3561.06 --> 3561.28]  Okay.
[3561.32 --> 3562.08]  That does look very cool.
[3562.42 --> 3562.64]  Yeah.
[3562.64 --> 3564.28]  Um...
[3564.28 --> 3568.26]  And the interesting thing about that weight, and this is why, like, the first thing that
[3568.26 --> 3573.44]  bothers me about this story is that out-engineering Apple just means, what, thinner?
[3574.06 --> 3574.62]  Lighter?
[3574.70 --> 3574.94]  That's lame.
[3574.94 --> 3582.64]  That is not all there is to it, because 2.45 inches, or 2.45 pounds is only 0.3 of a pound.
[3582.90 --> 3587.80]  So we're talking 0.115 or something kilograms.
[3588.02 --> 3592.44]  We're talking, like, 115 grams versus the razor blade stealth.
[3593.62 --> 3596.02]  Who cares at that point?
[3596.62 --> 3603.64]  If the stealth is going to give me an RGB keyboard, it's going to give me a 1440p display, if it's
[3603.64 --> 3606.80]  going to give me any other benefits.
[3608.10 --> 3613.22]  It's got Bang & Olufsen audio, which is one of those things where it's, like, maybe meaningful,
[3613.58 --> 3615.10]  but usually not.
[3615.32 --> 3621.08]  It's been overused on cheap, not very well implemented situations, so now it doesn't
[3621.08 --> 3621.74]  really mean much.
[3621.74 --> 3628.76]  And not even those, but even on not cheap, but just from an engineering standpoint, completely
[3628.76 --> 3630.46]  impossible situations.
[3630.46 --> 3639.18]  Like, you know, if you were to tell me, oh, the speaker on your iPhone SE has Bang & Olufsen
[3639.18 --> 3643.28]  audio speaker in the bottom, it's like, well, this thing is only so big.
[3643.64 --> 3647.92]  You can only put so much driver and so much speaker in here.
[3647.98 --> 3649.08]  It could be a well-engineered one.
[3649.08 --> 3652.86]  Yeah, it could be a well-engineered one, but it's not going to be anything special or earth-shattering.
[3653.90 --> 3657.06]  So whether that's good or not remains to be seen.
[3657.18 --> 3659.00]  I am trying to get a review unit.
[3659.10 --> 3660.04]  I am working on it.
[3660.36 --> 3665.08]  And just because I am hating on this race to be the thinnest...
[3665.08 --> 3670.04]  We should have you wear gloves, so you can't really tell from texture which one is which.
[3670.62 --> 3671.50]  And see if it matters.
[3671.50 --> 3674.00]  And see if in a blind taste test you can even tell which one's heavier.
[3674.00 --> 3679.46]  What I will tell you is the LG Gram is noticeably lighter.
[3679.82 --> 3682.26]  I don't remember how much that one weighs, though.
[3683.32 --> 3686.76]  So that's their 14-inch Ultra... 15-inch?
[3687.38 --> 3687.68]  I don't know.
[3687.68 --> 3689.06]  Is this the one I saw?
[3689.76 --> 3691.28]  I don't even know if that's right.
[3691.34 --> 3696.84]  I'm trying to get a unit of that, too, because that one was impressively light and very noticeably
[3696.84 --> 3700.54]  lighter than anything else I had ever touched.
[3700.54 --> 3706.12]  That one's 2.16 pounds, and it is a 15-inch.
[3706.88 --> 3707.78]  980 grams.
[3708.40 --> 3709.18]  That is ridiculous.
[3709.50 --> 3709.72]  Yeah.
[3710.50 --> 3712.94]  So there is a threshold.
[3713.14 --> 3713.56]  So that is a...
[3713.56 --> 3714.58]  I just don't care.
[3714.78 --> 3716.96]  It's beyond the point where it matters at all.
[3717.02 --> 3718.52]  That one might surprise you.
[3719.14 --> 3719.76]  Well, no, okay.
[3719.80 --> 3721.10]  It's beyond the point where it matters to me.
[3721.28 --> 3725.18]  The Blade Stealth is already light enough that I can't really tell if it's in my backpack or not.
[3725.18 --> 3725.36]  That's what I mean.
[3725.36 --> 3725.92]  Yeah.
[3725.92 --> 3733.12]  Like big gaming laptops, if one's like, I have the same performance, but I weigh a little
[3733.12 --> 3735.78]  bit less, that's kind of cool, because those actually weigh a fair amount.
[3736.12 --> 3739.12]  These things are below the threshold of weight where I care at all.
[3739.86 --> 3742.64]  So I forget what I was saying anymore.
[3743.02 --> 3743.52]  Someone might care.
[3744.56 --> 3745.94]  Aluminum carbon fiber craftsmanship.
[3746.76 --> 3748.98]  Edge-to-edge Corning Gorilla Glass display.
[3749.34 --> 3750.20]  Love to see that.
[3750.20 --> 3751.82]  Piston hinge design.
[3752.12 --> 3754.28]  Promises up to nine hours of battery life.
[3754.28 --> 3756.44]  Here's the thing that drives me crazy.
[3756.56 --> 3764.80]  Why doesn't anyone have the balls to make that device, but like three and a half millimeters
[3764.80 --> 3771.64]  thicker and another, you know, 300 or 400 grams with like a 20 hour battery?
[3772.82 --> 3776.24]  Why doesn't nobody do it?
[3777.68 --> 3780.82]  Someone, please do it.
[3780.82 --> 3784.18]  Now that you're saying this, and not just because of that, but now that a lot of people
[3784.18 --> 3787.16]  have said this too, someone's going to do it.
[3787.46 --> 3788.78]  And it's going to be a commercial failure?
[3789.50 --> 3792.46]  Well, that's going to be their entire pitch.
[3792.80 --> 3796.20]  And it's going to be the only thing that matters about whatever device it is, whether it's a
[3796.20 --> 3797.36]  phone or a laptop or whatever.
[3797.58 --> 3799.58]  The rest of it's going to be junk.
[3799.58 --> 3807.46]  And then the whole industry is going to blame that thing, not succeeding very much on the
[3807.46 --> 3810.40]  fact that they went with that angle instead of the fact that they did a terrible job with
[3810.40 --> 3810.92]  everything else.
[3811.22 --> 3811.62]  Yeah.
[3811.62 --> 3812.50]  That happens a lot.
[3812.86 --> 3813.04]  Yeah.
[3813.04 --> 3820.58]  So anyway, in spite of all the negativity that I, you know, have about the whole race
[3820.58 --> 3823.70]  to zero thing, I'm super excited to check this thing out.
[3823.74 --> 3827.60]  And I would love to review one because it does look pretty sexy to me, whatever you might
[3827.60 --> 3828.02]  think of it.
[3828.58 --> 3830.32]  We don't all have to have the same taste.
[3830.56 --> 3835.74]  I just, if it was just a normal out of the nowhere laptop, I'd be like, okay.
[3835.74 --> 3840.80]  But when they're like, oh, yeah, competing with Apple for design, this is a beautiful, like,
[3840.80 --> 3842.48]  no, I don't see it.
[3846.12 --> 3851.08]  Yeah, I guess for me, part of it is I just don't really, I don't really know what's left
[3851.08 --> 3853.78]  to do with the clamshell form factor.
[3855.36 --> 3859.50]  I think Microsoft really tried with the Surface Book.
[3859.74 --> 3866.40]  I haven't, I haven't heard anything about Surface Book since I reviewed it.
[3868.26 --> 3868.98]  That's interesting.
[3869.06 --> 3870.08]  I don't watch TV though.
[3870.08 --> 3872.08]  Like, I think there's like commercials and stuff.
[3872.44 --> 3872.64]  Maybe.
[3873.42 --> 3875.40]  But I have not seen one.
[3875.56 --> 3876.96]  I have not heard of one.
[3877.10 --> 3878.48]  I haven't seen a thread on the forum.
[3878.62 --> 3880.82]  Like, hey, I'm thinking of buying a Surface Book.
[3880.90 --> 3881.94]  Which config should I get?
[3882.00 --> 3882.60]  Like, nothing.
[3883.68 --> 3884.08]  Interesting.
[3885.26 --> 3887.18]  Do you see a lot of laptop news though?
[3888.42 --> 3888.78]  Sure.
[3888.88 --> 3890.08]  If it's like about Apple.
[3890.84 --> 3891.50]  Or new ones.
[3891.62 --> 3892.40]  Yeah, or new ones.
[3892.56 --> 3893.22]  So fair enough.
[3894.30 --> 3897.20]  Speaking of new ones, this is more than new.
[3897.20 --> 3900.54]  This is basically rumor mill at this point.
[3900.64 --> 3901.48]  But pretty exciting.
[3902.12 --> 3906.94]  AMD Zen 8 core engineering sample runs at 3 gigahertz.
[3907.94 --> 3909.72]  I think that's pre-boost as well.
[3910.36 --> 3910.70]  Yeah.
[3910.70 --> 3912.76]  Any form of anything.
[3912.76 --> 3914.76]  Yeah, we don't know anything about...
[3915.76 --> 3916.82]  This is interesting.
[3916.96 --> 3918.20]  Availability in 2016?
[3918.74 --> 3920.60]  I'll be surprised if...
[3920.60 --> 3922.12]  I'll be surprised if that's a thing.
[3922.76 --> 3929.26]  So these stepping A0 samples are that of the previously rumored 95 watt 8 cores Zen CPU.
[3929.26 --> 3932.68]  Pretty darn impressive.
[3933.16 --> 3936.26]  I had seen numbers before where they were claiming...
[3936.26 --> 3941.32]  I think it was a 40% IPC improvement over their previous CPUs.
[3941.32 --> 3944.00]  Which basically haven't changed in the last four years.
[3944.58 --> 3947.16]  I don't even remember how long it's been since they haven't changed.
[3947.16 --> 3948.16]  But...
[3948.16 --> 3954.44]  Exciting.
[3955.88 --> 3956.80]  Very exciting.
[3957.40 --> 3959.34]  I mean, this really doesn't tell us much.
[3959.42 --> 3961.32]  We don't know how much that processor will cost.
[3961.42 --> 3963.36]  We don't know how much the motherboards will cost.
[3964.52 --> 3965.16]  We don't know...
[3965.72 --> 3972.16]  Yeah, we don't know what it will boost up to in single threaded workloads.
[3972.16 --> 3974.48]  We really don't know much of anything.
[3975.06 --> 3978.32]  But we do know that, according to the latest leak,
[3978.74 --> 3982.84]  it's progressing well enough that the engineering samples have been distributed to partners for testing.
[3983.00 --> 3987.44]  Which also means that AM4 motherboards are going to be sampled as well.
[3988.98 --> 3989.98]  Interesting.
[3990.50 --> 3992.16]  I am hoping.
[3992.60 --> 3994.58]  Hoping beyond hope.
[3995.40 --> 3996.16]  That like...
[3996.94 --> 4000.66]  Because do you know how many clicks we will get on a video?
[4000.66 --> 4002.66]  That's like...
[4002.66 --> 4007.12]  Intel NVIDIA versus AMD Top Gaming System Showdown.
[4007.54 --> 4009.30]  Do you have any idea?
[4009.48 --> 4011.62]  It would be so fun for there to be competition again.
[4011.76 --> 4012.76]  We don't...
[4012.76 --> 4014.94]  We don't want it to be a blowout.
[4015.40 --> 4015.64]  No.
[4015.72 --> 4016.70]  That's not fun.
[4017.14 --> 4018.18]  That's not exciting.
[4018.36 --> 4019.32]  To be completely honest,
[4019.56 --> 4020.66]  if AMD...
[4022.02 --> 4024.26]  Completely crowns everything and just wrecks,
[4024.84 --> 4025.84]  that would still be fun.
[4026.22 --> 4027.24]  That would be really fun.
[4027.36 --> 4027.98]  Of course it would be fun.
[4027.98 --> 4029.50]  Because then AMD would have to be like...
[4029.50 --> 4030.54]  Or Intel would have to be like,
[4030.62 --> 4030.94]  shit!
[4031.08 --> 4031.90]  And get back on it.
[4031.90 --> 4032.20]  Well, yeah.
[4032.30 --> 4033.32]  In the next two years,
[4033.46 --> 4036.56]  we would see a response from Team Blue and Team Green
[4036.56 --> 4038.44]  that would make the whole thing exciting again.
[4038.58 --> 4043.92]  If Team Red loses by a relatively significant amount,
[4044.72 --> 4045.58]  that's not fun.
[4045.62 --> 4046.84]  It might still be okay.
[4047.24 --> 4048.44]  Because even if they...
[4048.44 --> 4049.44]  Even if they...
[4049.44 --> 4051.40]  Even if they perform by less.
[4051.92 --> 4052.26]  By...
[4052.26 --> 4053.38]  Like significantly less.
[4053.38 --> 4054.50]  Let's say 10% less.
[4055.16 --> 4056.38]  Then all of a sudden,
[4056.48 --> 4057.60]  the story of...
[4057.60 --> 4058.48]  Yeah, but it's...
[4058.48 --> 4058.64]  You know,
[4058.70 --> 4060.78]  the boards are 20% cheaper.
[4060.98 --> 4061.34]  It costs...
[4061.34 --> 4061.72]  Yeah, no...
[4061.72 --> 4062.86]  And the CPU is 20% cheaper.
[4062.86 --> 4064.48]  When I'm talking wins or loses,
[4064.58 --> 4066.10]  I'm talking like the whole equation.
[4066.20 --> 4066.98]  Yeah, like if we can...
[4066.98 --> 4068.52]  And price performance is a very big part of that equation.
[4068.56 --> 4069.88]  If we can make more than like
[4069.88 --> 4071.84]  a budget value argument for it.
[4071.90 --> 4072.94]  Like if we can make like
[4072.94 --> 4074.78]  a value gaming argument for it.
[4074.78 --> 4076.42]  Like this is still high-end gaming.
[4076.66 --> 4076.98]  Yes.
[4077.48 --> 4078.70]  Maybe not quite as high-end,
[4078.74 --> 4080.00]  but still very high-end gaming.
[4080.06 --> 4080.38]  So we're talking...
[4080.38 --> 4081.10]  ...and considerably cheaper.
[4081.10 --> 4082.18]  Athlon XP days.
[4082.42 --> 4082.64]  Okay?
[4082.74 --> 4082.90]  Yeah.
[4082.94 --> 4084.24]  Where the board was cheaper.
[4084.76 --> 4086.50]  The CPU was cheaper.
[4087.42 --> 4089.66]  AMD gave you unlocked multiple...
[4089.66 --> 4089.96]  In fact,
[4090.44 --> 4092.48]  this could be a total reset
[4092.48 --> 4094.86]  to Athlon XP versus Pentium 4.
[4094.96 --> 4095.10]  Which,
[4095.44 --> 4096.26]  because of a video
[4096.26 --> 4097.92]  that I'm going to be releasing soon,
[4098.16 --> 4100.52]  I've actually dug back into
[4100.52 --> 4101.68]  a fair bit more.
[4101.68 --> 4104.50]  Where AMD was not the performance leader
[4104.50 --> 4105.34]  at the time,
[4105.50 --> 4108.08]  but they had unlocked multipliers,
[4108.24 --> 4109.98]  something Intel wasn't willing to do.
[4111.10 --> 4112.58]  They were less expensive,
[4113.10 --> 4117.22]  and they were like pretty darn good.
[4117.66 --> 4119.00]  Very close.
[4119.18 --> 4119.66]  That would be cool.
[4119.82 --> 4120.22]  Competitive.
[4120.34 --> 4120.74]  That would be cool.
[4121.70 --> 4122.14]  Yeah.
[4122.62 --> 4124.16]  That would be great.
[4124.36 --> 4125.66]  I am super stoked on that.
[4126.30 --> 4127.16]  No, I'm not.
[4127.30 --> 4128.38]  I'm not going to let myself
[4128.38 --> 4129.20]  get stoked on that.
[4129.34 --> 4130.42]  They've hurt me too many times.
[4130.42 --> 4134.08]  This was posted on the forum
[4134.08 --> 4135.48]  by Nobel Harvards.
[4136.20 --> 4138.02]  Original article is from PC World.
[4138.10 --> 4139.14]  I'll let you handle this one.
[4139.24 --> 4141.24]  This looks interesting.
[4141.52 --> 4142.70]  Working on posting the thing,
[4142.78 --> 4143.48]  but I'll go off memory
[4143.48 --> 4144.48]  for the first little bit.
[4144.60 --> 4144.80]  So,
[4144.92 --> 4146.90]  a co-founder of Mozilla
[4146.90 --> 4148.76]  is making his own
[4148.76 --> 4149.56]  kind of browser.
[4149.94 --> 4150.52]  I'm guessing
[4150.52 --> 4151.56]  he's breaking off
[4151.56 --> 4152.22]  and making his own
[4152.22 --> 4152.78]  kind of browser.
[4152.94 --> 4153.12]  No.
[4153.38 --> 4153.80]  Thank you.
[4153.80 --> 4155.00]  I've worked there for a while.
[4155.38 --> 4155.60]  Yeah,
[4155.66 --> 4156.42]  probably not.
[4156.42 --> 4157.16]  I mean,
[4157.24 --> 4158.10]  breaking off on like,
[4158.18 --> 4158.32]  I mean,
[4158.38 --> 4158.94]  in terms of like,
[4159.54 --> 4159.70]  yeah,
[4159.74 --> 4160.22]  don't worry about it.
[4160.26 --> 4161.02]  I didn't mean from Mozilla.
[4161.26 --> 4161.58]  Anyways,
[4162.06 --> 4163.98]  it was first announced in January.
[4164.16 --> 4166.06]  It has ad blocking built in.
[4166.38 --> 4167.46]  It's called Brave.
[4169.50 --> 4169.98]  Yeah,
[4170.24 --> 4171.88]  it's going to eliminate ads
[4171.88 --> 4174.38]  and then inject its own
[4174.38 --> 4176.70]  and give some of that money
[4176.70 --> 4178.62]  to participating websites
[4178.62 --> 4180.88]  and will give some of that money
[4180.88 --> 4182.02]  to viewers
[4182.02 --> 4183.78]  or users.
[4183.78 --> 4185.32]  And it will pay you in Bitcoin
[4185.32 --> 4187.58]  to replace like,
[4188.00 --> 4188.84]  crappy ads
[4188.84 --> 4190.42]  with safe ads.
[4190.88 --> 4191.48]  Yeah.
[4195.00 --> 4197.74]  And higher performance ads
[4197.74 --> 4200.26]  so that you don't have to wait around
[4200.26 --> 4201.34]  for your page to load
[4201.34 --> 4202.96]  because of a slow,
[4203.12 --> 4204.74]  slow ad server.
[4205.64 --> 4206.12]  So,
[4207.16 --> 4208.60]  advertisers will pay
[4208.60 --> 4211.08]  for X number of impressions.
[4212.14 --> 4214.26]  Brave aggregates those payments
[4214.26 --> 4215.00]  into a sum.
[4215.32 --> 4217.36]  The websites that participate
[4217.36 --> 4219.72]  get 55% of the money.
[4220.04 --> 4221.02]  Then they divvy up
[4221.02 --> 4221.94]  the remaining Bitcoin
[4221.94 --> 4223.04]  between itself,
[4223.56 --> 4224.98]  the ad matching partner.
[4225.48 --> 4225.82]  So,
[4226.00 --> 4227.68]  that would be a service like,
[4227.68 --> 4229.74]  like Google AdSense,
[4229.82 --> 4231.54]  but obviously not Google AdSense.
[4232.42 --> 4233.68]  And the users,
[4234.06 --> 4236.34]  each getting a 15% share.
[4236.34 --> 4241.90]  Wait, what?
[4242.96 --> 4243.36]  Yeah.
[4243.36 --> 4244.16]  One, two,
[4244.16 --> 4245.58]  so three,
[4245.66 --> 4246.76]  each getting 15%.
[4246.76 --> 4246.94]  Yeah,
[4247.10 --> 4248.44]  so 45 plus 55.
[4248.86 --> 4249.44]  I just,
[4249.58 --> 4250.96]  how aggressive is this going to be?
[4251.04 --> 4251.80]  Is it we're going to place
[4251.80 --> 4253.44]  absolutely every ad,
[4253.98 --> 4254.74]  yada, yada, yada,
[4254.74 --> 4256.00]  because if it is doing that,
[4256.06 --> 4257.12]  that's a little rough.
[4257.12 --> 4261.52]  It will map users browsing histories,
[4261.52 --> 4262.56]  but vows,
[4262.80 --> 4264.00]  that's a great word,
[4264.42 --> 4265.78]  vows not to track users
[4265.78 --> 4268.58]  through unique or persistent identifiers.
[4269.54 --> 4271.76]  And users will also have an option
[4271.76 --> 4273.38]  to block all ads
[4273.38 --> 4275.74]  and pay websites directly through Brave.
[4275.74 --> 4278.28]  Very interesting.
[4278.62 --> 4280.06]  The free web is dying.
[4280.64 --> 4280.92]  Yeah.
[4281.52 --> 4281.84]  I mean,
[4281.94 --> 4283.78]  I don't necessarily think this will work,
[4284.36 --> 4285.50]  at least not today,
[4286.12 --> 4288.84]  but the free web is,
[4288.90 --> 4289.68]  is in a very,
[4289.82 --> 4291.52]  is in a very dangerous place.
[4291.60 --> 4292.20]  Now, again,
[4292.32 --> 4293.12]  to be clear,
[4293.54 --> 4295.70]  like I was in my ad blocking
[4295.70 --> 4296.74]  fastest possible
[4296.74 --> 4298.14]  on the Tech Quickie channel,
[4298.76 --> 4301.14]  I am not,
[4301.28 --> 4303.26]  I'm not telling some sob story
[4303.26 --> 4304.02]  about boo-hoo,
[4304.12 --> 4304.72]  woe is me.
[4304.72 --> 4305.12]  People,
[4305.74 --> 4306.92]  because of ad blocker,
[4306.98 --> 4308.12]  I can't feed my family.
[4308.74 --> 4309.64]  I figured it out.
[4309.80 --> 4310.36]  I'm okay.
[4310.64 --> 4312.20]  My business model allows me
[4312.20 --> 4313.80]  to bake ads into the videos,
[4314.38 --> 4316.08]  to stream on Twitch,
[4316.32 --> 4316.60]  to,
[4316.72 --> 4317.52]  to like,
[4317.52 --> 4319.04]  to sell shirts,
[4319.16 --> 4320.36]  to have contributors
[4320.36 --> 4321.20]  through our forum.
[4321.80 --> 4323.86]  We have early access on Vessel.
[4324.16 --> 4327.94]  We have significantly diversified
[4327.94 --> 4329.18]  our revenue streams
[4329.18 --> 4331.10]  to account for
[4331.10 --> 4333.94]  that from one day
[4333.94 --> 4334.74]  or week
[4334.74 --> 4335.22]  or month
[4335.22 --> 4336.48]  or year to another.
[4337.06 --> 4338.58]  One might outperform another.
[4338.72 --> 4339.42]  Things like
[4339.42 --> 4341.18]  Amazon affiliate revenue,
[4341.28 --> 4341.94]  just from people
[4341.94 --> 4342.82]  using our link
[4342.82 --> 4343.78]  whenever they happen
[4343.78 --> 4344.76]  to be shopping on Amazon.
[4345.04 --> 4346.34]  All those kinds of things
[4346.34 --> 4346.88]  make us
[4346.88 --> 4348.72]  much less reliant
[4348.72 --> 4350.26]  on just straight
[4350.26 --> 4351.56]  Google AdSense
[4351.56 --> 4352.36]  than we otherwise
[4352.36 --> 4353.12]  would be,
[4353.36 --> 4353.52]  which,
[4353.66 --> 4354.32]  to be clear,
[4354.36 --> 4354.74]  it is still
[4354.74 --> 4355.60]  very,
[4355.86 --> 4356.54]  very helpful.
[4356.54 --> 4358.08]  and paid for that
[4358.08 --> 4358.80]  HDMI cable.
[4361.72 --> 4362.40]  But,
[4362.78 --> 4364.64]  not everyone
[4364.64 --> 4366.10]  is set up
[4366.10 --> 4367.40]  in such a way
[4367.40 --> 4369.56]  that they can do that
[4369.56 --> 4371.40]  and ad blocking
[4371.40 --> 4373.08]  does hurt
[4373.08 --> 4375.02]  their monetization.
[4376.08 --> 4376.30]  So,
[4376.66 --> 4378.22]  this is a response.
[4378.22 --> 4380.24]  Some places
[4380.24 --> 4381.08]  are doing those
[4381.08 --> 4381.82]  like stupid,
[4381.98 --> 4383.78]  annoying ads
[4383.78 --> 4384.64]  that are
[4384.64 --> 4386.44]  aggressive pop-ups
[4386.44 --> 4388.40]  or they play
[4388.40 --> 4389.04]  audio.
[4389.28 --> 4389.64]  I don't remember
[4389.64 --> 4390.24]  what website
[4390.24 --> 4390.62]  I was on
[4390.62 --> 4391.28]  not that long ago,
[4391.34 --> 4391.86]  but it very much
[4391.86 --> 4392.42]  surprised me
[4392.42 --> 4392.82]  that they had
[4392.82 --> 4393.66]  a hidden ad
[4393.66 --> 4394.60]  that was playing audio.
[4394.82 --> 4395.08]  God,
[4395.14 --> 4395.68]  that was annoying.
[4395.92 --> 4396.90]  Holy crap.
[4397.76 --> 4398.20]  Or,
[4398.32 --> 4399.30]  they're moving
[4399.30 --> 4399.70]  or,
[4400.10 --> 4401.00]  there's tons of
[4401.00 --> 4401.44]  different ways.
[4401.44 --> 4401.84]  something.
[4402.56 --> 4402.96]  What?
[4403.56 --> 4403.82]  Yeah.
[4404.22 --> 4405.08]  There's so many
[4405.08 --> 4406.36]  annoying things
[4406.36 --> 4406.88]  that you can do
[4406.88 --> 4407.46]  with an ad.
[4407.60 --> 4408.52]  We all know that.
[4408.76 --> 4409.00]  But,
[4409.08 --> 4409.86]  the people that are
[4409.86 --> 4410.78]  trying not to be
[4410.78 --> 4411.20]  that annoying
[4411.20 --> 4411.78]  with ads
[4411.78 --> 4412.48]  and are getting
[4412.48 --> 4413.98]  like companies
[4413.98 --> 4414.86]  to support them
[4414.86 --> 4415.82]  with direct sponsorship
[4415.82 --> 4416.48]  to put ads
[4416.48 --> 4417.02]  on their website,
[4417.54 --> 4417.78]  like,
[4418.18 --> 4419.54]  small community
[4419.54 --> 4420.64]  tech forums
[4420.64 --> 4422.18]  that like,
[4422.38 --> 4423.36]  get computer
[4423.36 --> 4424.12]  hardware companies
[4424.12 --> 4424.90]  to sponsor them
[4424.90 --> 4425.46]  to put stuff
[4425.46 --> 4426.28]  on their page
[4426.28 --> 4427.32]  so that it's like,
[4428.24 --> 4428.72]  you get,
[4428.84 --> 4429.76]  you get more money
[4429.76 --> 4430.06]  for it.
[4430.08 --> 4430.82]  That is the reason
[4430.82 --> 4431.46]  why some of these
[4431.46 --> 4431.98]  forums are able
[4431.98 --> 4432.54]  to exist.
[4432.80 --> 4433.46]  If they just had
[4433.46 --> 4433.96]  Google ads,
[4434.02 --> 4434.44]  they wouldn't make
[4434.44 --> 4434.98]  as much money
[4434.98 --> 4435.60]  as if they had
[4435.60 --> 4436.60]  directly targeted ads
[4436.60 --> 4437.26]  from hardware vendors,
[4437.38 --> 4437.62]  whatever,
[4437.78 --> 4438.08]  et cetera.
[4438.52 --> 4439.54]  That removes
[4439.54 --> 4440.24]  the possibility
[4440.24 --> 4440.96]  to do that.
[4443.24 --> 4443.68]  Right.
[4443.94 --> 4444.58]  And if you work
[4444.58 --> 4445.12]  with Brave,
[4445.20 --> 4445.96]  if you partner up
[4445.96 --> 4446.48]  with Brave,
[4447.22 --> 4448.00]  what does that mean?
[4448.10 --> 4448.94]  Are you agreeing
[4448.94 --> 4449.46]  to,
[4450.78 --> 4451.52]  how does that work
[4451.52 --> 4452.30]  in terms of like?
[4452.96 --> 4453.32]  So,
[4453.38 --> 4453.86]  you're agreeing
[4453.86 --> 4454.42]  that users
[4454.42 --> 4455.58]  of the Brave browser
[4455.58 --> 4457.60]  will have the ads
[4457.60 --> 4458.54]  blocked
[4458.54 --> 4459.84]  and you will,
[4459.98 --> 4460.68]  since that was going
[4460.68 --> 4461.48]  to happen anyway
[4461.48 --> 4462.46]  as far as I can tell.
[4462.46 --> 4462.68]  So when you're counting
[4462.68 --> 4463.56]  impressions and trying
[4463.56 --> 4464.56]  to sell to other vendors,
[4464.56 --> 4465.06]  you'll at least get a payment.
[4465.32 --> 4466.00]  You have to X out
[4466.00 --> 4467.02]  everyone using Brave?
[4471.70 --> 4472.48]  I don't know.
[4472.68 --> 4472.92]  So.
[4472.92 --> 4473.82]  It's an interesting idea.
[4474.10 --> 4474.80]  I'm interested to see
[4474.80 --> 4475.50]  how it plays out.
[4475.58 --> 4476.50]  Posted by Tim Q
[4476.50 --> 4477.12]  on the forum,
[4478.26 --> 4479.20]  the rumored,
[4479.30 --> 4479.54]  wow,
[4479.72 --> 4481.04]  is the entire WAN show
[4481.04 --> 4481.92]  NVIDIA this week?
[4482.44 --> 4482.66]  Well,
[4482.68 --> 4483.60]  they have their conference thing.
[4483.70 --> 4483.98]  Right.
[4484.10 --> 4484.44]  Okay.
[4484.72 --> 4484.96]  Yeah,
[4485.08 --> 4485.52]  I guess.
[4485.52 --> 4486.22]  This is just,
[4486.32 --> 4486.74]  we're just looking
[4486.74 --> 4487.16]  out of picture.
[4487.98 --> 4488.38]  Rumored,
[4488.98 --> 4489.70]  revised,
[4490.08 --> 4491.24]  finally,
[4492.36 --> 4493.30]  cooler design
[4493.30 --> 4494.70]  for the GTX
[4494.70 --> 4496.22]  1080 and 1070.
[4496.22 --> 4496.90]  We don't actually know
[4496.90 --> 4497.18]  what they're going
[4497.18 --> 4497.58]  to be called.
[4498.04 --> 4499.02]  Graphics cards.
[4500.90 --> 4502.30]  So,
[4502.52 --> 4505.68]  they've changed it
[4505.68 --> 4505.96]  a little.
[4506.18 --> 4506.70]  I was just going
[4506.70 --> 4506.96]  to say,
[4507.06 --> 4507.84]  you got all excited
[4507.84 --> 4508.52]  for revised.
[4508.84 --> 4509.92]  I've seen that picture.
[4510.40 --> 4511.60]  It's not that different.
[4511.60 --> 4514.94]  We're going to add angles
[4514.94 --> 4517.04]  and probably stop
[4517.04 --> 4517.62]  about there.
[4518.26 --> 4519.12]  I actually don't
[4519.12 --> 4519.98]  like it better at all.
[4520.42 --> 4520.74]  Nope.
[4522.70 --> 4523.70]  Looking at this,
[4524.30 --> 4525.40]  I think we should
[4525.40 --> 4526.00]  do a video
[4526.00 --> 4528.00]  on modding
[4528.00 --> 4529.64]  your GTX 1080 cooler
[4529.64 --> 4531.54]  to put a Titan X
[4531.54 --> 4532.10]  cooler on it.
[4532.10 --> 4532.36]  Oh.
[4532.62 --> 4533.02]  Because I think
[4533.02 --> 4533.80]  the Titan X cooler
[4533.80 --> 4534.54]  is the best one.
[4535.28 --> 4536.20]  Just put a Titan X
[4536.20 --> 4536.78]  cooler on there,
[4536.84 --> 4537.36]  call it a day
[4537.36 --> 4538.16]  because that thing
[4538.16 --> 4539.22]  is just dog ugly.
[4539.38 --> 4540.60]  Buy a broken Titan X
[4540.60 --> 4541.04]  or something.
[4541.04 --> 4541.32]  Yeah.
[4541.48 --> 4542.34]  You can usually
[4542.34 --> 4543.22]  get coolers on eBay
[4543.22 --> 4544.12]  for like 40 bucks.
[4544.26 --> 4544.82]  And let's face it,
[4544.84 --> 4545.96]  if you bought a GTX 1080,
[4546.10 --> 4546.96]  you've got 40 bucks
[4546.96 --> 4547.38]  to spare.
[4548.70 --> 4550.10]  And some paint.
[4550.46 --> 4551.24]  It should be no problem.
[4551.68 --> 4552.24]  And some time
[4552.24 --> 4553.04]  to watch my video
[4553.04 --> 4553.74]  on how to do it
[4553.74 --> 4554.72]  if I can figure out
[4554.72 --> 4555.18]  how to do it
[4555.18 --> 4555.84]  without making
[4555.84 --> 4556.72]  a total disaster
[4556.72 --> 4557.10]  out of it
[4557.10 --> 4557.76]  with nail polish
[4557.76 --> 4559.82]  live on the WAN show.
[4565.40 --> 4565.76]  Yeah.
[4565.92 --> 4566.02]  So,
[4566.08 --> 4566.48]  there you go.
[4566.78 --> 4567.36]  You know what?
[4567.54 --> 4567.74]  Hey,
[4568.16 --> 4569.06]  let's straw pull that.
[4569.06 --> 4570.10]  Let's straw pull that.
[4570.10 --> 4571.48]  Straw pull.
[4571.72 --> 4572.12]  Are you on it?
[4572.28 --> 4572.56]  Yeah,
[4572.64 --> 4573.08]  I'm on it.
[4573.14 --> 4573.60]  I'm on it.
[4573.64 --> 4573.96]  All right.
[4574.72 --> 4576.14]  Do you like
[4576.14 --> 4577.72]  the new one better?
[4578.42 --> 4578.82]  Yes,
[4578.94 --> 4579.32]  no.
[4580.86 --> 4581.26]  Well,
[4581.26 --> 4581.68]  you can't even
[4581.68 --> 4582.40]  really see it.
[4584.54 --> 4585.58]  You can't see it?
[4585.94 --> 4586.42]  Not that well.
[4586.42 --> 4586.68]  Oh,
[4586.84 --> 4587.34]  come on.
[4587.38 --> 4588.34]  If you have an ounce
[4588.34 --> 4589.12]  of imagination,
[4589.32 --> 4590.46]  I'm pretty sure you can
[4590.46 --> 4591.50]  figure out
[4591.50 --> 4591.52]  what it's going to look like.
[4591.52 --> 4593.30]  I'm going to see the fan area.
[4593.46 --> 4593.84]  And like,
[4593.92 --> 4595.08]  these leaks are,
[4595.18 --> 4595.94]  I'm not going to say
[4595.94 --> 4596.62]  that this is what
[4596.62 --> 4597.86]  the 1080 will look like,
[4598.38 --> 4599.38]  but what I will say
[4599.38 --> 4600.36]  is that these leaks
[4600.36 --> 4601.16]  are usually
[4601.16 --> 4602.32]  fairly accurate.
[4602.58 --> 4602.70]  Like,
[4603.34 --> 4604.02]  no one,
[4604.12 --> 4605.42]  no one goes out
[4605.42 --> 4607.26]  and does a fake
[4607.26 --> 4608.96]  like this.
[4609.42 --> 4609.78]  Like,
[4609.82 --> 4610.90]  with a crappy
[4610.90 --> 4612.72]  camera phone flash
[4612.72 --> 4614.18]  that like,
[4614.38 --> 4614.62]  like,
[4614.66 --> 4615.48]  are they in a closet
[4615.48 --> 4616.00]  or something?
[4616.08 --> 4616.24]  Like,
[4616.28 --> 4617.20]  what is this?
[4617.62 --> 4618.72]  What is this tubing?
[4619.38 --> 4619.70]  Like,
[4619.76 --> 4620.38]  it looks like
[4620.38 --> 4621.12]  they kind of like
[4621.12 --> 4622.22]  ran off to a closet
[4622.22 --> 4622.64]  somewhere,
[4622.76 --> 4623.36]  took a picture,
[4623.72 --> 4624.48]  and then like,
[4624.68 --> 4625.64]  ran back to where
[4625.64 --> 4626.48]  they're supposed to be
[4626.48 --> 4627.10]  polishing them
[4627.10 --> 4627.54]  or whatever.
[4628.42 --> 4628.70]  So,
[4629.42 --> 4629.78]  yeah.
[4632.18 --> 4633.16]  Looks pretty credible
[4633.16 --> 4633.68]  to me.
[4634.96 --> 4635.74]  Let's go ahead
[4635.74 --> 4636.22]  and have a look
[4636.22 --> 4637.32]  at that straw pool there.
[4637.58 --> 4638.20]  Because it's bad.
[4639.14 --> 4640.32]  It's a great version of that.
[4640.32 --> 4640.72]  I
[4640.72 --> 4642.32]  hate
[4642.32 --> 4643.84]  the Apple Watch.
[4645.88 --> 4646.36]  Turnip.
[4646.72 --> 4647.50]  Everyone's voted
[4647.50 --> 4648.12]  for turnip.
[4648.14 --> 4648.48]  Turnip.
[4648.48 --> 4649.40]  Thank you for that.
[4649.72 --> 4650.12]  That's what I mean.
[4650.14 --> 4650.86]  You can't really see it
[4650.86 --> 4651.06]  that way.
[4651.08 --> 4651.18]  So,
[4651.24 --> 4652.46]  27% of you
[4652.46 --> 4653.86]  do like the new one
[4653.86 --> 4654.10]  better.
[4654.24 --> 4654.42]  So,
[4654.54 --> 4654.82]  okay.
[4655.00 --> 4655.46]  All right.
[4656.42 --> 4657.52]  That is the lowest
[4657.52 --> 4658.20]  percentage.
[4659.44 --> 4659.84]  Yeah.
[4659.98 --> 4660.60]  By four.
[4661.04 --> 4661.28]  By,
[4661.52 --> 4661.76]  oh,
[4661.88 --> 4662.08]  yeah.
[4662.20 --> 4663.30]  That's very close now.
[4664.32 --> 4664.72]  Wow.
[4664.88 --> 4665.62]  That is very,
[4665.78 --> 4666.32]  very close.
[4666.52 --> 4666.72]  So,
[4667.08 --> 4667.76]  of the votes
[4667.76 --> 4668.68]  that are not people
[4668.68 --> 4669.80]  throwing them away,
[4670.10 --> 4670.80]  we've got about
[4670.80 --> 4671.84]  a 50-50 split.
[4671.98 --> 4672.22]  Okay.
[4672.58 --> 4672.82]  Well,
[4672.86 --> 4673.78]  when you make a change,
[4673.84 --> 4674.98]  if half of the people
[4674.98 --> 4675.50]  like it,
[4675.54 --> 4675.86]  I mean,
[4675.96 --> 4676.74]  That's actually not too bad.
[4676.78 --> 4676.90]  Yeah,
[4676.98 --> 4678.04]  based on when we changed
[4678.04 --> 4679.40]  our intro sequence,
[4679.50 --> 4680.68]  based on when we changed
[4680.68 --> 4681.24]  our studio,
[4681.70 --> 4682.76]  based on when we changed
[4682.76 --> 4683.44]  our host,
[4683.56 --> 4684.66]  based on when we changed
[4684.66 --> 4685.16]  our...
[4685.16 --> 4685.60]  By far,
[4685.68 --> 4686.82]  the vast majority of people
[4686.82 --> 4687.90]  liked the change to the forum.
[4688.08 --> 4688.90]  I'm just going to put that out there.
[4691.78 --> 4692.18]  Yeah.
[4693.00 --> 4693.62]  Good job.
[4693.78 --> 4694.32]  You want a cookie?
[4694.72 --> 4694.96]  Well,
[4694.96 --> 4696.24]  an internet cookie?
[4696.24 --> 4697.20]  Maybe we can give a cookie
[4697.20 --> 4698.62]  to Catman and Colonel Mortis.
[4700.10 --> 4700.64]  All right.
[4701.20 --> 4701.56]  So,
[4701.96 --> 4704.22]  the Tracer victory pose,
[4704.26 --> 4705.02]  this is posted by
[4705.02 --> 4706.12]  DragonTamer1,
[4706.34 --> 4707.96]  is to be removed
[4707.96 --> 4709.30]  from Overwatch
[4709.30 --> 4710.96]  after a fan complains
[4710.96 --> 4712.74]  that it is over-sexualized.
[4714.54 --> 4715.26]  Full statement
[4715.26 --> 4716.44]  can be found here.
[4716.60 --> 4717.32]  I usually stay out
[4717.32 --> 4718.12]  of this kind of stuff.
[4718.26 --> 4719.68]  But this is ridiculous.
[4719.68 --> 4720.32]  This is ridiculous.
[4720.32 --> 4720.84]  Ridiculous.
[4721.96 --> 4723.66]  What is sexual about that?
[4724.84 --> 4725.18]  I mean,
[4725.24 --> 4725.90]  other than the fact
[4725.90 --> 4726.82]  that her butt crack
[4726.82 --> 4727.32]  is showing,
[4727.52 --> 4727.72]  which,
[4728.06 --> 4728.34]  to me,
[4728.42 --> 4729.40]  has nothing to do
[4729.40 --> 4730.00]  with the pose
[4730.00 --> 4730.96]  and everything to do
[4730.96 --> 4732.10]  with the character model.
[4732.20 --> 4732.54]  And, like,
[4732.62 --> 4733.24]  any, like,
[4733.36 --> 4734.40]  superhero model
[4734.40 --> 4736.26]  of anyone.
[4736.56 --> 4737.62]  Doesn't matter if it's a girl,
[4737.72 --> 4738.78]  doesn't matter if it's a guy.
[4739.78 --> 4740.78]  You can see every...
[4740.78 --> 4740.92]  Like,
[4741.18 --> 4741.40]  like,
[4741.48 --> 4741.82]  if you...
[4741.82 --> 4742.26]  Spandex!
[4742.36 --> 4742.84]  Yeah,
[4742.94 --> 4743.70]  if you've watched
[4743.70 --> 4745.50]  some of the artists
[4745.50 --> 4746.70]  of comic books talking,
[4746.98 --> 4747.84]  a lot of the times,
[4747.84 --> 4748.66]  the costume
[4748.66 --> 4750.00]  is literally
[4750.00 --> 4751.76]  basically skin.
[4752.10 --> 4752.38]  Right.
[4752.56 --> 4753.86]  With a different color.
[4754.18 --> 4754.48]  Right.
[4754.66 --> 4755.52]  Guys and girls.
[4755.74 --> 4755.96]  Yep.
[4756.36 --> 4757.04]  Some of the guys
[4757.04 --> 4757.78]  will have skin
[4757.78 --> 4758.34]  but with, like,
[4758.70 --> 4760.06]  leather strapping
[4760.06 --> 4761.52]  as their clothes,
[4761.62 --> 4762.30]  which is, like,
[4762.38 --> 4763.54]  way more sexual.
[4763.92 --> 4764.96]  Should I feel bad
[4764.96 --> 4765.46]  that, like,
[4765.54 --> 4766.96]  Batman has an eight-pack?
[4767.70 --> 4768.12]  Yeah.
[4768.46 --> 4768.98]  Yeah.
[4769.52 --> 4772.18]  Look at any dude
[4772.18 --> 4773.98]  doing a military crawl
[4773.98 --> 4775.34]  in any, like,
[4775.52 --> 4776.12]  comic book
[4776.12 --> 4777.06]  or superhero thing
[4777.06 --> 4777.38]  ever.
[4777.86 --> 4778.26]  But.
[4778.96 --> 4779.60]  All but.
[4779.86 --> 4780.04]  Like,
[4780.06 --> 4780.92]  just look at it.
[4780.94 --> 4781.36]  I don't know.
[4781.44 --> 4782.14]  What do you want me to say?
[4782.16 --> 4782.54]  And, like,
[4782.68 --> 4784.28]  this...
[4784.28 --> 4785.66]  Eyebrows raised.
[4785.78 --> 4785.94]  Like,
[4785.98 --> 4786.82]  we're not even...
[4786.82 --> 4787.00]  Like,
[4787.06 --> 4787.28]  okay,
[4787.40 --> 4787.58]  okay.
[4787.86 --> 4788.58]  You look at...
[4788.58 --> 4789.16]  This is really...
[4789.16 --> 4790.12]  I don't know why
[4790.12 --> 4791.64]  I was looking at this.
[4791.74 --> 4792.56]  I think I posted
[4792.56 --> 4793.44]  a selfie
[4793.44 --> 4794.20]  on Instagram
[4794.20 --> 4794.70]  or Twitter
[4794.70 --> 4795.22]  or something
[4795.22 --> 4796.50]  and I was noting
[4796.50 --> 4797.86]  that it had more interaction
[4797.86 --> 4798.84]  than most of the pictures
[4798.84 --> 4799.70]  I post of hardware
[4799.70 --> 4800.36]  and I'm just like,
[4800.78 --> 4801.42]  selfies?
[4801.74 --> 4801.96]  Really?
[4802.32 --> 4802.54]  Yeah.
[4802.76 --> 4803.98]  And then for some reason
[4803.98 --> 4804.78]  I ended up on
[4804.78 --> 4806.08]  Kim Kardashian's Instagram
[4806.08 --> 4807.20]  because...
[4807.20 --> 4807.40]  What?
[4807.66 --> 4808.02]  No, no.
[4808.08 --> 4808.60]  I was like,
[4808.68 --> 4809.10]  blah, blah, blah.
[4809.20 --> 4809.58]  I was like,
[4809.62 --> 4810.10]  Googling, like,
[4810.14 --> 4810.70]  our selfies,
[4811.50 --> 4811.84]  like,
[4811.92 --> 4812.62]  the only thing,
[4812.74 --> 4812.88]  like,
[4812.96 --> 4814.28]  selfie effectiveness
[4814.28 --> 4815.18]  on social media.
[4815.26 --> 4815.38]  Like,
[4815.38 --> 4816.10]  I was doing research.
[4816.18 --> 4817.22]  I was actually doing work.
[4817.30 --> 4817.84]  I ended up on
[4817.84 --> 4818.90]  Kim Kardashian's Instagram
[4818.90 --> 4821.28]  and, like,
[4822.12 --> 4823.16]  half of the pictures
[4823.16 --> 4824.46]  are her doing
[4824.46 --> 4825.62]  this one pose
[4825.62 --> 4826.72]  and it's like,
[4827.62 --> 4828.98]  looking back at the camera,
[4829.52 --> 4829.76]  like,
[4830.12 --> 4831.36]  with her eyes
[4831.36 --> 4832.68]  in the corner of her eye
[4832.68 --> 4833.26]  or her pupils
[4833.26 --> 4834.30]  in the corner of her eye
[4834.30 --> 4835.04]  and, like,
[4835.50 --> 4835.98]  kind of like
[4835.98 --> 4837.10]  a softer duck face.
[4837.42 --> 4837.62]  Like,
[4837.68 --> 4838.42]  they're just all
[4838.42 --> 4839.12]  the same picture
[4839.12 --> 4842.08]  and that's supposed
[4842.08 --> 4842.66]  to be provocative,
[4842.82 --> 4843.14]  I think.
[4843.72 --> 4844.22]  And, like,
[4844.52 --> 4845.44]  she's not even doing this.
[4845.80 --> 4846.64]  We're talking like...
[4846.64 --> 4847.34]  She's barely even looking
[4847.34 --> 4847.78]  at the camera.
[4847.88 --> 4848.50]  She's not even looking
[4848.50 --> 4848.98]  at the camera.
[4849.36 --> 4850.00]  Eyebrow, like,
[4850.10 --> 4850.48]  arched.
[4850.54 --> 4851.84]  There's nothing seductive.
[4851.92 --> 4852.74]  There's nothing sexy
[4852.74 --> 4853.46]  about this.
[4853.56 --> 4854.16]  She did, like,
[4854.26 --> 4854.86]  the...
[4854.86 --> 4855.30]  It's funny
[4855.30 --> 4855.70]  because it's supposed
[4855.70 --> 4856.48]  to be a victory pose
[4856.48 --> 4857.40]  but she did the, like,
[4857.76 --> 4858.50]  spin around,
[4858.70 --> 4859.00]  yeah,
[4859.34 --> 4860.32]  that you see in, like,
[4860.86 --> 4861.46]  tons of, like,
[4861.52 --> 4862.72]  old school action movies.
[4863.58 --> 4864.36]  You know what I mean?
[4864.52 --> 4865.68]  I don't get this.
[4866.14 --> 4867.52]  I get why Blizzard
[4867.52 --> 4868.80]  is just gonna remove it
[4868.80 --> 4869.20]  because,
[4869.66 --> 4870.26]  quite frankly,
[4870.42 --> 4871.32]  I wouldn't want to deal
[4871.32 --> 4872.26]  with this crap either.
[4872.52 --> 4873.50]  I'm trying to...
[4873.50 --> 4874.62]  But I also...
[4874.62 --> 4875.46]  mostly contain
[4875.46 --> 4876.22]  my current thoughts
[4876.22 --> 4876.66]  about Blizzard
[4876.66 --> 4877.16]  but,
[4877.34 --> 4877.86]  but,
[4878.08 --> 4878.32]  yeah,
[4878.42 --> 4879.84]  I also think that
[4879.84 --> 4881.98]  that's a dangerous path
[4881.98 --> 4882.90]  to walk down
[4882.90 --> 4883.72]  when you clearly
[4883.72 --> 4884.70]  really haven't
[4884.70 --> 4885.38]  done anything wrong.
[4885.40 --> 4885.86]  Because the thing is,
[4885.94 --> 4886.08]  like,
[4886.14 --> 4887.02]  I understand people
[4887.02 --> 4887.60]  talking about the
[4887.60 --> 4888.90]  sexualization of women
[4888.90 --> 4889.50]  in video games
[4889.50 --> 4889.78]  and, like,
[4889.80 --> 4890.52]  I'm looking right now
[4890.52 --> 4891.26]  and there's a Tomb Raider
[4891.26 --> 4892.26]  ad on the side
[4892.26 --> 4892.92]  and she's, like,
[4892.94 --> 4894.78]  definitely 100% closed
[4894.78 --> 4895.24]  to the point where
[4895.24 --> 4896.00]  you can barely tell
[4896.00 --> 4897.04]  that she even has boobs.
[4897.32 --> 4897.78]  So, like,
[4898.26 --> 4899.16]  maybe people need
[4899.16 --> 4899.56]  to understand
[4899.56 --> 4900.26]  that things are changing
[4900.26 --> 4900.72]  a little bit.
[4900.78 --> 4901.26]  But anyways,
[4901.70 --> 4903.60]  guys are super
[4903.60 --> 4904.88]  within the same spectrum.
[4904.88 --> 4905.20]  Like,
[4905.24 --> 4905.72]  you were saying,
[4905.82 --> 4906.74]  Batman has an 8-pack
[4906.74 --> 4907.16]  or whatever.
[4907.52 --> 4907.62]  Yeah.
[4907.68 --> 4909.10]  Cloud carries around,
[4909.16 --> 4909.42]  like,
[4909.72 --> 4911.72]  this giant freaking sword
[4911.72 --> 4913.10]  which is super unwieldable
[4913.10 --> 4913.56]  by, like,
[4913.60 --> 4914.50]  almost anyone.
[4914.88 --> 4915.16]  Like,
[4915.48 --> 4916.36]  dudes in video games,
[4916.40 --> 4917.06]  look at anyone
[4917.06 --> 4918.20]  from Gears of War.
[4918.30 --> 4918.60]  They, like,
[4918.64 --> 4919.20]  can't eat
[4919.20 --> 4919.62]  and they're just
[4919.62 --> 4921.24]  completely jacked
[4921.24 --> 4921.84]  and ripped
[4921.84 --> 4922.24]  and, like,
[4922.24 --> 4923.22]  no one cares
[4923.22 --> 4925.80]  because it's a video game.
[4927.16 --> 4927.68]  God.
[4930.52 --> 4931.00]  Anyways.
[4932.86 --> 4933.34]  Alright,
[4933.48 --> 4934.26]  I think we got time
[4934.26 --> 4935.48]  for maybe one more time.
[4935.52 --> 4936.28]  Oh, wow.
[4936.44 --> 4937.34]  We have...
[4937.34 --> 4938.44]  We're way over time.
[4938.56 --> 4939.38]  If we have...
[4939.38 --> 4939.66]  Yeah.
[4940.48 --> 4940.74]  Oh,
[4940.92 --> 4941.24]  oh,
[4941.46 --> 4941.94]  oh,
[4942.10 --> 4942.56]  oh,
[4942.70 --> 4942.98]  oh,
[4942.98 --> 4944.20]  there's still definitely
[4944.20 --> 4945.44]  some good stuff in here
[4945.44 --> 4946.22]  but that's okay.
[4946.22 --> 4947.50]  SpaceX landed
[4947.50 --> 4950.60]  on a drone platform
[4950.60 --> 4951.12]  in the ocean.
[4951.72 --> 4952.52]  Pretty sick.
[4952.58 --> 4953.38]  You should look it up.
[4953.46 --> 4954.28]  Super cool.
[4954.96 --> 4955.44]  Oh,
[4955.64 --> 4956.96]  Windows 10 Redstone 1
[4956.96 --> 4958.06]  anniversary update.
[4958.22 --> 4959.02]  Maybe they finally
[4959.02 --> 4960.18]  fixed the start menu.
[4960.40 --> 4960.68]  Nope,
[4960.72 --> 4961.30]  not in there.
[4961.38 --> 4961.96]  That's a shame.
[4963.22 --> 4963.66]  Yeah,
[4963.70 --> 4964.60]  I had the start menu break
[4964.60 --> 4965.80]  on yet another Windows install
[4965.80 --> 4966.14]  today
[4966.14 --> 4967.42]  and even trying
[4967.42 --> 4968.56]  the PowerShell
[4968.56 --> 4970.14]  rebuild nonsense
[4970.14 --> 4971.14]  didn't fix it.
[4971.14 --> 4972.34]  Okay,
[4972.50 --> 4973.14]  I guess I'll just
[4973.14 --> 4973.98]  reformat again.
[4974.62 --> 4975.06]  Fine.
[4976.34 --> 4977.10]  That's brutal.
[4978.40 --> 4978.84]  Now,
[4979.02 --> 4979.34]  okay,
[4979.48 --> 4980.64]  I do want to do this one.
[4980.72 --> 4981.24]  This was,
[4981.86 --> 4982.08]  oh,
[4982.10 --> 4982.58]  I don't know
[4982.58 --> 4983.52]  who the original poster
[4983.52 --> 4984.22]  on the forum was
[4984.22 --> 4984.82]  for this one.
[4985.82 --> 4986.72]  To be clear,
[4987.02 --> 4988.10]  just because I think
[4988.10 --> 4988.64]  it's fine
[4988.64 --> 4989.84]  that a video game character
[4989.84 --> 4990.84]  looks over her shoulder
[4990.84 --> 4992.00]  does not mean
[4992.00 --> 4992.90]  that I think it's cool
[4992.90 --> 4994.08]  to spend $50,000
[4994.08 --> 4995.12]  recreating
[4995.12 --> 4996.16]  Scarlett Johansson
[4996.16 --> 4997.04]  as a robot.
[4998.12 --> 4998.32]  Well,
[4998.40 --> 4999.68]  did Scarlett Johansson
[4999.68 --> 5000.38]  say it was okay?
[5000.48 --> 5000.78]  No.
[5002.14 --> 5002.70]  Okay.
[5005.40 --> 5005.88]  So,
[5005.88 --> 5007.10]  that's really weird.
[5007.72 --> 5007.96]  Yep,
[5008.16 --> 5008.94]  so Ricky Ma
[5008.94 --> 5009.44]  created...
[5009.44 --> 5009.88]  Scarlett Johansson
[5009.88 --> 5010.42]  was down,
[5010.56 --> 5010.68]  like,
[5010.74 --> 5011.28]  that's a completely
[5011.28 --> 5011.90]  different story.
[5012.10 --> 5012.28]  Yep,
[5012.50 --> 5013.02]  Ricky Ma
[5013.02 --> 5014.46]  created the Mark I,
[5014.78 --> 5017.44]  a year and a half project
[5017.44 --> 5018.02]  with a budget
[5018.02 --> 5019.46]  of more than $50,000.
[5020.02 --> 5020.58]  Isn't that quite
[5020.58 --> 5021.26]  literally illegal?
[5021.36 --> 5021.78]  Because you're not
[5021.78 --> 5022.54]  allowed to use
[5022.54 --> 5024.68]  a depiction of...
[5024.68 --> 5024.98]  Well,
[5025.06 --> 5025.80]  Lindsay Lohan
[5025.80 --> 5026.40]  is in the middle
[5026.40 --> 5027.12]  of a long,
[5027.16 --> 5027.78]  what looks like
[5027.78 --> 5028.16]  it's going to be
[5028.16 --> 5029.08]  a long legal battle
[5029.08 --> 5029.86]  with Rockstar
[5029.86 --> 5030.72]  over the,
[5030.72 --> 5031.72]  blonde,
[5031.98 --> 5032.92]  bikinied character
[5032.92 --> 5033.86]  on the front of
[5033.86 --> 5035.46]  GTA 5?
[5035.46 --> 5036.36]  Is it 5?
[5036.40 --> 5036.84]  I think so,
[5036.90 --> 5037.00]  yeah.
[5037.00 --> 5037.84]  I don't remember
[5037.84 --> 5038.86]  what Grand Theft Auto
[5038.86 --> 5039.24]  it is.
[5039.32 --> 5039.58]  Anyway,
[5039.86 --> 5040.00]  yeah,
[5040.04 --> 5040.90]  I think it's GTA 5.
[5040.94 --> 5041.50]  I think you're right.
[5042.00 --> 5042.86]  Saying that they
[5042.86 --> 5043.58]  stole her likeness.
[5043.58 --> 5044.20]  I don't know why
[5044.20 --> 5044.98]  Lindsay Lohan
[5044.98 --> 5046.28]  imagines for a second
[5046.28 --> 5047.18]  that she's every
[5047.18 --> 5048.00]  single blonde.
[5048.86 --> 5049.80]  Not even that,
[5049.92 --> 5050.90]  but at the time
[5050.90 --> 5051.72]  that Grand Theft Auto
[5051.72 --> 5052.58]  5 was released
[5052.58 --> 5053.54]  that someone would
[5053.54 --> 5054.12]  consider her
[5054.12 --> 5055.20]  even remotely relevant.
[5055.20 --> 5055.50]  I guess what she's comparing.
[5055.92 --> 5056.22]  Yeah.
[5057.00 --> 5057.48]  Like,
[5057.54 --> 5058.06]  if you were going to
[5058.06 --> 5058.36]  model,
[5058.36 --> 5059.12]  if you were going to
[5059.12 --> 5059.82]  model like your
[5059.82 --> 5060.80]  video game cover
[5060.80 --> 5061.90]  after a sex symbol,
[5062.46 --> 5063.52]  I don't know
[5063.52 --> 5065.20]  why you would
[5065.20 --> 5066.48]  pick Lindsay Lohan
[5066.48 --> 5067.86]  in the last year.
[5068.80 --> 5068.86]  Yeah,
[5068.92 --> 5069.36]  there we go.
[5069.36 --> 5070.54]  So this is
[5070.54 --> 5071.42]  the claim.
[5072.06 --> 5072.56]  And actually,
[5072.84 --> 5073.40]  there's apparently
[5073.40 --> 5074.64]  a lot more of it
[5074.64 --> 5075.16]  than that.
[5075.74 --> 5075.76]  Like,
[5075.90 --> 5077.72]  the actual filing
[5077.72 --> 5079.12]  to Take-Two
[5079.12 --> 5080.90]  is like,
[5080.98 --> 5081.16]  okay,
[5081.18 --> 5081.72]  here's all these
[5081.72 --> 5082.52]  other examples.
[5082.96 --> 5084.26]  But that doesn't
[5084.26 --> 5086.50]  necessarily mean
[5086.50 --> 5087.22]  that I personally
[5087.22 --> 5087.68]  think she has
[5087.68 --> 5088.32]  much of a case.
[5088.94 --> 5091.02]  The chick used
[5091.02 --> 5091.54]  in the photo
[5091.54 --> 5092.80]  looks super
[5092.80 --> 5093.88]  crazy generic.
[5094.30 --> 5094.46]  So,
[5094.76 --> 5095.20]  I don't know,
[5095.34 --> 5095.58]  whatever.
[5095.92 --> 5096.28]  Anyway,
[5096.60 --> 5097.60]  so back to the
[5097.60 --> 5097.94]  Scarlet.
[5098.18 --> 5098.92]  Holding an iPhone
[5098.92 --> 5100.04]  and a piece symbol
[5100.04 --> 5101.30]  is also super
[5101.30 --> 5102.04]  crazy generic.
[5102.32 --> 5102.54]  Yeah.
[5103.30 --> 5103.74]  I don't know.
[5104.44 --> 5105.08]  Because you get
[5105.08 --> 5105.66]  a lot of pictures
[5105.66 --> 5107.56]  taken of you
[5107.56 --> 5108.40]  and you happen
[5108.40 --> 5109.16]  to hold a
[5109.16 --> 5110.00]  super generic pose
[5110.00 --> 5110.52]  does not mean
[5110.52 --> 5111.48]  that that thing
[5111.48 --> 5112.10]  is a depiction
[5112.10 --> 5112.40]  of you.
[5112.68 --> 5113.00]  I don't know.
[5113.66 --> 5114.02]  Okay,
[5114.20 --> 5115.50]  so the Mark I
[5115.50 --> 5117.00]  is a robot.
[5118.06 --> 5119.10]  Includes face
[5119.10 --> 5120.48]  and color tracking
[5120.48 --> 5121.22]  functions.
[5121.64 --> 5122.72]  Looks just like
[5122.72 --> 5123.50]  Scarlet Johansson
[5123.50 --> 5124.10]  and actually,
[5124.28 --> 5124.38]  like,
[5124.46 --> 5124.84]  shockingly,
[5124.96 --> 5125.58]  really does.
[5126.24 --> 5127.42]  Has a 3D printed
[5127.42 --> 5128.40]  skeleton beneath
[5128.40 --> 5129.52]  silicone skin
[5129.52 --> 5130.78]  I think is
[5130.78 --> 5131.74]  that's a typo.
[5131.80 --> 5132.58]  Silicone skin
[5132.58 --> 5134.50]  and he adopted
[5134.50 --> 5135.18]  a trial and error
[5135.18 --> 5136.06]  method to get
[5136.06 --> 5136.60]  the Mark I
[5136.60 --> 5137.42]  to this point.
[5138.10 --> 5138.74]  Ma believes
[5138.74 --> 5139.36]  that the importance
[5139.36 --> 5139.86]  of robots
[5139.86 --> 5140.64]  will only grow
[5140.64 --> 5141.24]  and hopes
[5141.24 --> 5141.96]  an investor
[5141.96 --> 5142.58]  will give him
[5142.58 --> 5143.10]  the capital
[5143.10 --> 5144.18]  to build more.
[5144.56 --> 5144.98]  He wants to
[5144.98 --> 5145.32]  write a book
[5145.32 --> 5145.98]  about the experience
[5145.98 --> 5146.56]  to help other
[5146.56 --> 5146.92]  enthusiasts.
[5147.38 --> 5148.58]  If he uses
[5148.58 --> 5149.96]  this robot
[5149.96 --> 5151.02]  for commercial
[5151.02 --> 5151.44]  gain,
[5152.08 --> 5152.82]  I have
[5152.82 --> 5153.98]  got to
[5153.98 --> 5154.52]  imagine
[5154.52 --> 5155.38]  that there
[5155.38 --> 5156.14]  is a lawsuit,
[5156.30 --> 5157.10]  a big one,
[5157.20 --> 5157.96]  one that she
[5157.96 --> 5158.66]  will win,
[5159.36 --> 5161.30]  that will...
[5161.30 --> 5161.64]  Because he's
[5161.64 --> 5162.18]  downright saying
[5162.18 --> 5162.64]  it is her,
[5162.70 --> 5162.88]  right?
[5163.68 --> 5164.92]  I don't actually
[5164.92 --> 5165.34]  know.
[5165.48 --> 5165.98]  Or does it just
[5165.98 --> 5166.64]  look a lot like
[5166.64 --> 5166.80]  her?
[5167.58 --> 5168.56]  A lot is an
[5168.56 --> 5169.20]  understatement.
[5170.26 --> 5170.68]  I mean,
[5171.04 --> 5172.12]  yeah,
[5172.54 --> 5173.30]  like...
[5173.30 --> 5175.08]  The head is
[5175.08 --> 5175.88]  way too big.
[5176.12 --> 5176.36]  Well,
[5177.36 --> 5177.84]  yeah,
[5178.18 --> 5179.24]  but that's...
[5179.24 --> 5179.88]  I don't know
[5179.88 --> 5180.46]  if that's
[5180.46 --> 5181.24]  necessarily...
[5181.24 --> 5181.40]  No,
[5181.46 --> 5182.00]  I'm just making
[5182.00 --> 5182.78]  a random comment.
[5182.92 --> 5183.02]  Like,
[5183.10 --> 5185.86]  I don't know
[5185.86 --> 5186.32]  celebrities.
[5186.58 --> 5187.26]  I'm sure that
[5187.26 --> 5187.74]  looks kind of
[5187.74 --> 5188.20]  like whoever
[5188.20 --> 5189.10]  we're talking
[5189.10 --> 5189.32]  about.
[5189.32 --> 5189.58]  Yeah,
[5189.58 --> 5190.20]  it does.
[5190.34 --> 5190.62]  Her head
[5190.62 --> 5191.04]  looks really
[5191.04 --> 5191.32]  big.
[5192.94 --> 5193.50]  Watch the
[5193.50 --> 5194.10]  actual person's
[5194.10 --> 5194.52]  head be that
[5194.52 --> 5194.96]  big and I'm
[5194.96 --> 5196.04]  just...
[5196.04 --> 5196.38]  Yeah.
[5197.06 --> 5197.58]  That would
[5197.58 --> 5197.82]  suck.
[5198.94 --> 5199.80]  My bad.
[5201.14 --> 5201.76]  What if people
[5201.76 --> 5202.08]  in the chat
[5202.08 --> 5202.36]  are saying
[5202.36 --> 5203.18]  creepy and stuff,
[5203.18 --> 5203.74]  so apparently
[5203.74 --> 5204.34]  it is very
[5204.34 --> 5204.66]  similar?
[5205.24 --> 5205.54]  Yeah,
[5205.64 --> 5205.76]  no,
[5205.82 --> 5206.72]  it's like
[5206.72 --> 5207.44]  creepy AF.
[5207.82 --> 5207.90]  Like,
[5208.00 --> 5208.84]  it's like
[5208.84 --> 5209.90]  super grody.
[5212.30 --> 5212.82]  Yeah.
[5213.10 --> 5213.46]  Okay,
[5213.56 --> 5214.38]  so the last
[5214.38 --> 5215.08]  topic for the
[5215.08 --> 5215.42]  day,
[5215.66 --> 5216.38]  posted by
[5216.38 --> 5217.30]  Nobel Harvard's
[5217.30 --> 5217.76]  on the forum.
[5217.86 --> 5218.36]  Original article
[5218.36 --> 5218.72]  here is
[5218.72 --> 5219.44]  TechFrags.
[5219.56 --> 5220.28]  This is a
[5220.28 --> 5220.52]  rumor,
[5220.80 --> 5221.70]  but like
[5221.70 --> 5222.82]  most Intel
[5222.82 --> 5223.18]  rumors,
[5223.78 --> 5224.74]  it looks
[5224.74 --> 5225.80]  pretty credible.
[5226.46 --> 5227.30]  I had already
[5227.30 --> 5227.94]  seen rumors
[5227.94 --> 5228.32]  of a
[5228.32 --> 5229.18]  Broadwell-E
[5229.18 --> 5229.94]  DECACORE.
[5230.04 --> 5230.38]  That's a
[5230.38 --> 5231.30]  10-core
[5231.30 --> 5233.02]  high,
[5233.02 --> 5234.02]  high-performance
[5234.02 --> 5234.62]  enthusiast
[5234.62 --> 5235.70]  desktop processor.
[5236.92 --> 5237.42]  The rumor
[5237.42 --> 5238.22]  now is it
[5238.22 --> 5239.22]  will break
[5239.22 --> 5240.56]  with Intel's
[5240.56 --> 5241.82]  long-standing
[5241.82 --> 5242.70]  pricing tradition.
[5242.96 --> 5243.02]  Like,
[5243.34 --> 5243.82]  it has been
[5243.82 --> 5244.84]  10 years now
[5244.84 --> 5245.32]  that they've been
[5245.32 --> 5246.24]  charging $999
[5246.24 --> 5247.12]  for Extreme
[5247.12 --> 5247.54]  Editions,
[5247.76 --> 5248.28]  and will
[5248.28 --> 5249.30]  apparently cost
[5249.30 --> 5250.70]  $1,500.
[5251.52 --> 5251.84]  That's one hell
[5251.84 --> 5252.46]  of a step up.
[5252.56 --> 5253.38]  So there will be,
[5253.78 --> 5255.38]  the rumor also
[5255.38 --> 5256.12]  states there will
[5256.12 --> 5257.10]  be an 8-core,
[5257.22 --> 5257.70]  like a direct
[5257.70 --> 5258.54]  replacement for
[5258.54 --> 5260.20]  the 5960X,
[5260.24 --> 5260.76]  that will be
[5260.76 --> 5261.64]  also $1,000,
[5262.14 --> 5263.06]  and is just
[5263.06 --> 5264.78]  like an
[5264.78 --> 5265.78]  architecture change,
[5266.16 --> 5266.78]  and then it
[5266.78 --> 5267.30]  will still be
[5267.30 --> 5267.84]  an 8-core,
[5268.14 --> 5268.82]  and this one
[5268.82 --> 5269.28]  is going to
[5269.28 --> 5270.48]  be a 10-core,
[5271.04 --> 5271.94]  10-core at
[5271.94 --> 5274.82]  $1,500 US dollars.
[5274.86 --> 5275.20]  Which is
[5275.20 --> 5277.02]  $1,950 Canadian.
[5277.18 --> 5277.52]  Now,
[5277.74 --> 5278.36]  I had forgotten
[5278.36 --> 5279.00]  about this,
[5279.26 --> 5280.44]  but there was
[5280.44 --> 5281.24]  a previous
[5281.24 --> 5282.08]  processor that
[5282.08 --> 5282.48]  launched at
[5282.48 --> 5282.92]  that price,
[5283.02 --> 5284.38]  the QX9550.
[5284.38 --> 5284.94]  That was a
[5284.94 --> 5285.72]  Skull Trail chip,
[5286.28 --> 5286.98]  and I believe
[5286.98 --> 5287.62]  you actually had
[5287.62 --> 5288.40]  to buy two of
[5288.40 --> 5288.56]  them,
[5288.62 --> 5289.40]  although I may
[5289.40 --> 5290.26]  not remember
[5290.26 --> 5291.42]  that,
[5292.08 --> 5292.68]  um,
[5293.00 --> 5293.32]  95,
[5293.52 --> 5294.26]  970,
[5294.44 --> 5294.78]  75,
[5295.04 --> 5295.18]  no,
[5295.34 --> 5295.52]  whoop,
[5295.66 --> 5296.08]  I think I
[5296.08 --> 5296.70]  did that wrong.
[5297.58 --> 5297.96]  97,
[5298.06 --> 5298.38]  75,
[5298.58 --> 5299.08]  is that it?
[5299.24 --> 5299.56]  Court to
[5299.56 --> 5299.92]  Extreme,
[5300.20 --> 5301.52]  is this Skull
[5301.52 --> 5301.98]  Trail back
[5301.98 --> 5302.80]  in 2008?
[5303.98 --> 5304.24]  Nope,
[5304.60 --> 5304.86]  nope,
[5304.92 --> 5305.30]  that might not
[5305.30 --> 5305.60]  be it.
[5305.96 --> 5306.78]  I don't remember,
[5306.92 --> 5307.46]  I don't remember.
[5307.66 --> 5308.48]  Sometimes my brain,
[5308.80 --> 5309.20]  she don't work
[5309.20 --> 5309.54]  too well.
[5310.10 --> 5310.32]  So,
[5310.54 --> 5310.84]  um,
[5311.68 --> 5312.50]  yeah,
[5313.00 --> 5313.84]  what are your
[5313.84 --> 5314.58]  thoughts on that?
[5314.78 --> 5314.92]  Well,
[5314.96 --> 5315.32]  it's like
[5315.32 --> 5316.04]  $2,000
[5316.04 --> 5316.66]  Canadian dollars,
[5316.84 --> 5317.62]  so my thoughts
[5317.62 --> 5317.88]  are,
[5318.00 --> 5318.78]  I guess that's
[5318.78 --> 5319.48]  something that
[5319.48 --> 5320.12]  I'll never see
[5320.12 --> 5320.64]  unless it's at
[5320.64 --> 5320.86]  work.
[5321.40 --> 5321.66]  Yep.
[5323.82 --> 5324.22]  Cool.
[5324.96 --> 5325.68]  I don't know.
[5326.14 --> 5326.48]  Hopefully,
[5326.80 --> 5327.24]  uh,
[5327.28 --> 5328.44]  retail edge,
[5329.44 --> 5330.14]  hopefully they
[5330.14 --> 5330.66]  get a bunch of
[5330.66 --> 5331.30]  them and flood
[5331.30 --> 5331.70]  the market,
[5331.86 --> 5332.06]  and then they
[5332.06 --> 5332.58]  get really cheap
[5332.58 --> 5333.00]  all of a sudden.
[5333.26 --> 5333.88]  I don't think
[5333.88 --> 5334.12]  so.
[5334.86 --> 5335.60]  I don't see that
[5335.60 --> 5335.90]  happening.
[5336.16 --> 5336.40]  No,
[5336.56 --> 5337.06]  probably not.
[5337.26 --> 5337.56]  Yeah.
[5337.70 --> 5337.98]  It's happened
[5337.98 --> 5338.38]  before,
[5338.52 --> 5338.92]  but like,
[5339.44 --> 5340.30]  yeah,
[5340.48 --> 5341.04]  probably not.
[5341.64 --> 5341.82]  Oh,
[5341.84 --> 5342.30]  apparently the
[5342.30 --> 5343.56]  QX9775,
[5343.84 --> 5344.82]  um,
[5345.92 --> 5347.08]  was not,
[5347.86 --> 5348.20]  oh yeah,
[5348.34 --> 5348.48]  no,
[5348.54 --> 5349.04]  I think that
[5349.04 --> 5349.28]  was,
[5349.32 --> 5349.66]  I think that
[5349.66 --> 5350.00]  was called
[5350.00 --> 5350.18]  trail,
[5350.26 --> 5351.30]  LGA771.
[5351.46 --> 5351.62]  Yeah,
[5351.66 --> 5352.02]  it was an
[5352.02 --> 5352.88]  enthusiast chip
[5352.88 --> 5353.82]  on a server
[5353.82 --> 5354.30]  platform,
[5354.40 --> 5354.94]  much like what
[5354.94 --> 5355.70]  AMD did with
[5355.70 --> 5356.64]  the original
[5356.64 --> 5357.54]  FX processor,
[5357.64 --> 5358.04]  the first,
[5358.10 --> 5358.74]  uh,
[5358.74 --> 5359.12]  the first
[5359.12 --> 5360.02]  thousand dollar
[5360.02 --> 5360.90]  FX extreme
[5360.90 --> 5361.26]  edition,
[5361.80 --> 5362.12]  you know,
[5362.16 --> 5362.86]  back when FX
[5362.86 --> 5363.60]  meant anything,
[5363.60 --> 5364.18]  um,
[5364.36 --> 5364.78]  processor.
[5365.44 --> 5365.88]  So,
[5366.02 --> 5366.42]  um,
[5366.62 --> 5366.94]  yeah,
[5367.18 --> 5367.88]  there you go.
[5367.96 --> 5368.22]  Good luck
[5368.22 --> 5368.54]  with that,
[5368.62 --> 5368.86]  Intel.
[5369.24 --> 5369.74]  Luke is kind
[5369.74 --> 5370.54]  of like Abed
[5370.54 --> 5371.34]  from community.
[5371.58 --> 5372.22]  I think people
[5372.22 --> 5373.00]  will buy it,
[5373.08 --> 5373.72]  but I don't,
[5373.80 --> 5374.14]  um,
[5375.14 --> 5375.34]  yeah,
[5375.40 --> 5375.92]  I don't,
[5376.14 --> 5377.22]  I don't know
[5377.22 --> 5377.56]  who.
[5379.80 --> 5380.28]  Anyways,
[5380.44 --> 5380.98]  we're way over
[5380.98 --> 5381.58]  showtime now.
[5381.84 --> 5382.20]  Thanks for
[5382.20 --> 5382.48]  watching,
[5382.56 --> 5382.80]  guys,
[5382.86 --> 5383.20]  we'll see you
[5383.20 --> 5383.60]  again next
[5383.60 --> 5383.84]  week,
[5383.94 --> 5384.40]  same bad
[5384.40 --> 5384.82]  time,
[5384.96 --> 5385.58]  same bad
[5385.58 --> 5386.04]  channel.
[5386.04 --> 5398.32]  Someone's like
[5398.32 --> 5399.54]  Cori extreme
[5399.54 --> 5401.20]  69 69 X
[5401.20 --> 5406.10]  69 69 X X X
[5406.10 --> 5406.66]  Yeah,
[5406.76 --> 5407.12]  dog.
[5407.60 --> 5410.38]  Do people
[5410.38 --> 5410.84]  really think
[5410.84 --> 5411.38]  that swearing
[5411.38 --> 5411.84]  at us will
[5411.84 --> 5412.32]  make us more
[5412.32 --> 5412.88]  likely to do
[5412.88 --> 5413.48]  an after party?
[5413.68 --> 5414.62]  Instead of a
[5414.62 --> 5415.10]  skull trail,
[5415.10 --> 5415.52]  they just call
[5415.52 --> 5415.98]  it like boob
[5415.98 --> 5416.24]  trail.
[5416.52 --> 5417.24]  Boob trail?
[5417.42 --> 5417.66]  Yeah.
[5417.98 --> 5418.54]  What's a boob
[5418.54 --> 5418.74]  trail?
[5418.80 --> 5419.10]  Is that like
[5419.10 --> 5419.46]  a treasure
[5419.46 --> 5419.78]  trail?
[5419.78 --> 5420.28]  No.
