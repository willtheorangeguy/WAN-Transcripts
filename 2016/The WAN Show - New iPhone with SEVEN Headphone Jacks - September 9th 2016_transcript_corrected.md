[0.24 → 9.34] Are you ready? Yeah! Okay, we've been through this before. Yes. You don't get to wear a Nerd Fusion shirt. I'm sorry. Unless Hillary wins the election. Right.
[11.00 → 16.04] We've been through this before. Yeah. I'm pretty sure we've been through this on stream before, so you guys bore witness to this.
[17.48 → 25.36] We wear Nerd Fusion shirts if Hillary wins, and they wear Linus Tech Tips shirts. See, I am in the uniform.
[25.36 → 29.34] See how my shirt matches this lower third? Matches this mug.
[31.44 → 33.20] Wait, what? Apparently we have mugs now. Oh, yeah.
[33.64 → 35.74] Which I'm totally going to drink from.
[36.96 → 40.88] Which I definitely always enjoy a hot beverage on the WAN show.
[43.38 → 45.34] I don't only drink ice water.
[45.48 → 48.96] We should just, now that they know that randomly throughout the show, we have to just be like, yes.
[49.46 → 53.36] Yeah. Well, you know, I just...
[53.36 → 57.08] I just, I really need coffee to nail this point home, you know.
[57.08 → 60.36] Don't even take a break to swallow. Just like, so I think...
[60.36 → 66.46] When that Norway newspaper wrote that thing in their paper and then challenged Zuckerberg, it was really a pretty intense thing.
[66.46 → 71.28] Yeah, it was really a shouting match that I would have loved to participate in.
[71.30 → 71.68] Drink coffee, too?
[71.68 → 72.70] Yeah, drink coffee, too.
[72.78 → 73.00] Yeah.
[73.36 → 73.76] Calmly.
[73.94 → 74.28] Yes.
[74.52 → 75.54] In a sedate manner.
[76.30 → 76.58] Interesting.
[76.58 → 77.58] What were we talking about?
[77.58 → 78.60] I literally don't...
[78.60 → 79.42] Wait, these shirts.
[80.16 → 81.72] Oh, right. There was the bet with...
[81.72 → 83.16] There was the bet with Seeds.
[83.28 → 83.46] Yeah.
[83.46 → 87.06] So there's a bet with Matt, Seeds, Zymurgy on who wins the election.
[87.58 → 88.80] I said Trump was going to win.
[88.86 → 89.56] Well, it's more of a...
[89.56 → 90.98] He said not Trump was going to win.
[91.10 → 92.54] They should have to wear our shirts for way longer.
[92.56 → 93.98] I actually don't remember the exact terms.
[94.68 → 95.16] I don't know.
[95.40 → 98.28] I might have not gone one-to-one odds, actually.
[98.32 → 104.80] I think I might have demanded, like, better Vegas odds on it than just, you know, one month to one month.
[104.80 → 109.52] And, like, it is, in reality, it's not just a Linus versus Seeds bet.
[109.64 → 109.88] No.
[110.14 → 111.02] You got...
[111.02 → 115.18] They made it a Linus Media Group versus Nerd Fusion bet as a whole.
[115.30 → 119.64] So the entire companies have to wear each other's shirts depending on who wins.
[119.66 → 128.88] And we have to pay for the other company to have enough shirts to wear, which is, like, actually not insignificant, given they have, like, eight people.
[129.26 → 131.64] So we would have to buy all of our shirts for them?
[131.80 → 132.04] Yeah.
[132.18 → 132.70] Oh, wrecked.
[132.70 → 133.70] Yeah, we're not going to...
[133.70 → 135.70] So you sort of want to win and also don't?
[136.28 → 136.64] Yes.
[136.88 → 137.18] Okay.
[137.32 → 138.28] Well, I...
[138.28 → 140.04] Yeah, well, I don't want to win at all.
[141.06 → 142.74] But that's a whole other conversation.
[143.38 → 144.60] Do either of you want to win.
[144.92 → 147.20] That's a whole tertiary conversation.
[148.20 → 149.00] All right.
[149.10 → 151.98] So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[152.32 → 155.74] Like Norway and Facebook clashing over news censorship.
[155.86 → 156.96] They are going head-to-head.
[157.30 → 159.34] There's a new Mario game for iOS.
[159.90 → 160.06] Yeah.
[160.06 → 164.44] Sony launched their AMD Polaris-powered PlayStation 4 Pro.
[164.72 → 170.60] And VR adoption among Steam users has crashed to a halt.
[170.82 → 171.10] Yep.
[171.60 → 172.30] To a halt.
[172.52 → 173.24] Not surprised.
[173.82 → 174.32] A halt.
[174.68 → 175.26] Not surprised.
[175.34 → 175.78] A halt.
[176.14 → 176.80] Not surprised.
[176.92 → 177.32] A halt.
[177.52 → 178.14] Not surprised.
[178.14 → 178.24] Not surprised.
[178.24 → 196.48] This is going to get awkward with the apology.
[196.48 → 210.02] Should be fine, except that I tore down the streaming machine today sort of little bit.
[210.02 → 210.42] Why?
[210.60 → 212.60] Well, I needed to...
[212.60 → 213.12] Okay, okay.
[213.26 → 221.04] So I actually have what I think is a really cool new segment.
[221.62 → 225.70] And I know you guys are going to give me a bunch of crap about new segments all the time.
[225.70 → 227.56] I like this a lot.
[227.88 → 230.70] But I have a new segment that we're calling...
[231.24 → 233.98] This is possibly my favourite segment that you've ever started.
[234.14 → 234.44] Really?
[234.94 → 237.20] This is what I am personally most interested in.
[237.56 → 237.94] Really?
[238.20 → 238.42] Yeah.
[238.82 → 239.22] Okay.
[239.36 → 241.68] That's why I was like, I really want you to do this.
[241.74 → 242.04] Okay.
[242.22 → 246.56] So the new segment is called Haunted Hardware.
[247.62 → 251.66] And basically, I'm always telling stories, especially on WAN Show.
[251.66 → 257.04] I'm always telling you guys stories about just bizarre land stuff that I have witnessed.
[257.86 → 258.66] Like, you know...
[259.98 → 261.14] I mean...
[261.14 → 263.66] Okay, it's hard to do this.
[263.74 → 265.54] It's like it's hard to come up with something on the spot.
[265.78 → 265.86] It is.
[266.04 → 266.52] Okay, okay.
[266.70 → 266.92] Okay.
[266.98 → 274.98] Perfect example that isn't the one that I use in the video as an example is I had a machine once that would not install an operating system.
[274.98 → 280.28] It would crash on the loading bar for Windows XP while it was like unpacking files or whatever.
[280.38 → 281.52] Every single time.
[281.62 → 281.96] Consistently.
[282.26 → 283.48] 100% of the time.
[283.70 → 285.20] I swapped the power supply.
[285.68 → 286.68] Installed Windows just fine.
[286.72 → 287.20] I went, okay.
[287.32 → 288.10] Bad power supply.
[288.68 → 289.88] But I don't have a lot of money.
[289.96 → 290.46] I'm a student.
[290.88 → 294.18] I'm going to put that other power supply back in and just kind of see if it was...
[294.18 → 295.60] System runs perfectly.
[296.24 → 297.12] Absolutely perfectly.
[297.34 → 298.46] Stress test all day.
[298.70 → 300.34] No problems whatsoever.
[300.66 → 301.84] I can do anything with it.
[302.06 → 303.82] In fact, I left the power supply in there.
[303.82 → 304.92] It ran for years.
[305.16 → 305.66] After that.
[305.92 → 306.22] Years.
[306.56 → 306.74] Okay?
[307.40 → 308.66] But I wasn't done yet.
[308.88 → 309.10] Okay?
[309.18 → 310.72] So I put...
[310.72 → 311.56] I actually...
[311.56 → 312.32] I was so curious.
[312.40 → 312.92] I was like, okay.
[313.04 → 317.52] I'm going to burn another half an hour to an hour of my time because I want to know if this is reproducible.
[318.20 → 320.98] So I put it back in, and I tried to install Windows again.
[321.28 → 322.26] Same exact hardware.
[322.50 → 322.90] Crashed.
[324.36 → 332.16] And I'm just sitting here going, how can you have a system that is 100% stable other than that you cannot install Windows on it?
[332.96 → 334.08] That's so random.
[334.08 → 334.64] So...
[334.64 → 335.04] But the problem...
[335.04 → 335.72] I would have liked...
[335.72 → 337.88] I would have really enjoyed if you tried a different OS.
[338.50 → 338.90] I...
[338.90 → 339.46] You know what?
[339.56 → 339.72] I...
[339.72 → 340.32] Just like...
[340.32 → 342.60] I wasn't even aware of other OSes at this time.
[342.60 → 342.78] Okay, yeah, yeah.
[342.78 → 344.20] This is like when I was first getting into computers.
[344.20 → 344.48] Sure.
[344.54 → 344.84] Yeah, yeah.
[344.84 → 346.80] So anyway...
[346.80 → 350.64] But the point of that is that that story is just a story.
[351.10 → 352.40] And you guys can...
[352.40 → 357.80] You guys could not believe me or you could believe me or you could say, gee, I wish you had tried another thing.
[357.80 → 360.14] See, but no, that's why I'm excited about the series.
[360.44 → 360.76] Right.
[360.76 → 362.10] Because now I'm interested, and I'm engaged.
[362.18 → 363.04] I love that kind of stuff.
[363.12 → 364.82] So now...
[364.82 → 366.16] Now...
[366.16 → 368.28] Oh, I'm going to capture the whole thing on video.
[369.18 → 369.78] So I...
[369.78 → 370.40] Are you going to tell them what it is?
[370.66 → 371.28] No, no.
[371.28 → 372.08] I'm not going to tell them what it is.
[372.08 → 373.28] I was like, that's a big...
[373.28 → 373.54] All right.
[373.60 → 374.78] No, I'm not going to tell them what it is.
[374.82 → 375.56] No, absolutely not.
[375.68 → 378.16] But stay tuned for haunted hardware.
[378.18 → 379.38] It's very topical.
[379.50 → 381.78] Because it's like super topical.
[381.84 → 382.10] Oh, yeah.
[382.10 → 383.56] Very current events related.
[383.80 → 384.02] Yeah.
[384.18 → 387.30] And I document the whole thing.
[387.70 → 388.96] I reproduce it.
[389.76 → 391.30] I demonstrate.
[391.30 → 397.12] Like, there's a point where I go from scratch with a lot of the camera rolling the entire time.
[397.28 → 397.50] Nice.
[397.50 → 400.38] And what I'm thinking is we will upload that video...
[400.38 → 400.90] Like, unlisted or something?
[400.90 → 401.98] ...in its entirety.
[402.28 → 402.46] Yeah.
[402.62 → 403.62] Unlisted separately.
[403.74 → 404.66] We'll link it in the description.
[404.66 → 404.90] Perfect.
[404.90 → 408.42] If you don't believe me, here's the proof.
[409.66 → 410.12] There you go.
[410.20 → 410.68] That's awesome.
[410.68 → 410.98] Yeah.
[411.06 → 412.18] It should be pretty excited.
[412.40 → 413.58] I'm pretty stoked on that.
[414.02 → 415.42] Topical, not tropical.
[416.96 → 418.56] They are very different.
[419.68 → 422.28] I mean, I was reading an article about how we've...
[422.28 → 427.48] I think we've eliminated a tenth of the wilderness in the world in the last...
[427.50 → 428.50] Okay.
[428.50 → 429.00] ...the last two decades.
[429.00 → 433.62] About equivalent to half of the land area of Australia.
[433.62 → 434.62] Whoa.
[434.62 → 434.98] Yeah.
[434.98 → 436.32] In the last 20 years.
[436.90 → 441.74] So, mostly in Central Africa and in the tropics.
[441.92 → 443.52] So, that would be a tropical topic.
[444.96 → 446.36] Or a topical tropic.
[446.38 → 446.98] Yeah, there we go.
[446.98 → 447.14] As it were.
[447.14 → 447.34] Yeah.
[448.78 → 450.00] But they are not the same thing.
[451.22 → 456.64] That caulking gun thing just looks like a really crappy chalk outline of a gun.
[457.32 → 458.40] No one's going to know what I'm talking about.
[458.40 → 459.14] It does, kind of.
[459.16 → 459.88] It's in the workshop.
[460.08 → 461.66] I don't know where the caulking gun is.
[461.82 → 463.26] Oh, I know what they're using it for.
[463.48 → 464.94] Also, I look partially angelic.
[465.84 → 466.52] Look at my hair.
[468.86 → 470.68] If you ask your mom, you look fully angelic.
[470.74 → 471.62] Aw, thanks, Mom.
[471.94 → 472.20] Yeah.
[472.20 → 473.32] You know she would say it.
[473.32 → 473.66] Probably.
[473.80 → 473.96] Yep.
[475.64 → 476.86] Can't say I always agree.
[477.10 → 478.54] You know, sometimes he gets kind of naughty.
[480.26 → 480.70] Wow.
[482.30 → 482.70] Okay.
[482.70 → 485.34] So, moving on to our first topic of the day.
[485.82 → 486.60] Big topic.
[487.60 → 490.18] Facebook backs down.
[490.82 → 492.72] They back down, you all.
[492.98 → 493.22] Yeah.
[493.28 → 496.50] On censoring the Napalm Girl photo.
[496.66 → 502.06] After public outcry, Facebook plans to restore the image and review
[502.06 → 503.48] its processes.
[503.76 → 505.34] So, if you weren't following this along,
[505.46 → 509.42] Norway's largest newspaper published a front page open letter
[509.42 → 512.00] to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
[512.24 → 512.80] Zuckerberg.
[513.02 → 513.50] Zuckerberg.
[513.50 → 516.78] It's like the body snatcher replacement for Mark Zuckerberg.
[517.26 → 520.48] So, they're lambasting the company's decision to censor
[520.48 → 522.22] an historic photo.
[522.78 → 523.34] An historic.
[523.50 → 528.16] No, it's a historic or an historic photograph of the Vietnam War,
[528.16 → 531.58] calling Zuckerberg to recognize and live up to his role
[531.58 → 534.14] as the world's most powerful editor.
[534.38 → 537.10] Which is an interesting way of stating that and kind of true.
[537.24 → 538.28] It is kind of true.
[538.36 → 540.04] I mean, if something doesn't exist on Facebook,
[540.14 → 542.96] for a lot of people I know, it basically does not exist.
[543.10 → 546.42] At the same time, you could argue that Google is even more powerful that way.
[547.52 → 548.00] I don't know.
[548.04 → 549.24] You know, I haven't looked at it recently.
[549.42 → 550.58] It would be interesting to weigh them.
[550.70 → 554.12] Yeah, because Facebook and Google are both always publishing statistics
[554.12 → 557.42] of like how many people log in and look at their Facebook feed like once per day.
[557.46 → 559.84] And I think Facebook's numbers are actually scarier.
[560.32 → 560.50] Really?
[560.50 → 567.60] Because with Google, they don't have quite as many services that you just –
[567.60 → 569.34] like if you go to the Google.com homepage,
[569.70 → 571.70] they don't have suggested news stories there somehow.
[572.18 → 572.62] Still.
[573.08 → 574.16] After all these years.
[574.70 → 578.32] Right, but like every time you type something into the search bar,
[579.06 → 579.90] that's a search.
[579.90 → 581.18] That's true.
[581.56 → 582.02] That's true.
[582.08 → 586.02] But all you have to do is go to Facebook.com and your feed,
[586.48 → 593.06] which is curated by people you know, so you inherently trust it more,
[593.32 → 596.80] is also full of advertisements and is full of promoted stories and stuff like that.
[596.82 → 597.26] That's a good point.
[597.58 → 602.72] So I would make the argument that for the passive user, not the active user,
[602.96 → 606.14] because I personally look at Google a lot more than I look at Facebook.
[606.14 → 608.44] Google and Google services a lot more than Facebook ones.
[608.44 → 613.04] But for the passive user who's just like vegging, like sitting at their computer,
[613.60 → 617.38] kind of browsing something, probably Facebook is more relevant.
[618.60 → 621.14] And if Facebook decides something doesn't exist,
[622.22 → 624.50] I think for a lot of people they just basically would never see it.
[624.54 → 625.20] Where are they going to see it?
[625.28 → 629.02] My Facebook is open a lot because I use it for –
[629.02 → 633.62] like I have this group where like some friends from high school and I just all share music.
[634.04 → 636.24] So I like play music through there almost constantly.
[636.24 → 638.54] But I don't like to go through my feed.
[638.72 → 640.22] But I think you're probably right.
[640.32 → 643.04] A huge portion of people would spend more overall time there.
[644.34 → 646.96] So anyway, I could elaborate on the story,
[647.04 → 651.48] but I realized I never posted on Facebook since we're talking about this.
[651.72 → 652.96] Tune into the WAN show.
[653.06 → 656.54] Yeah, I can't have it waterfall anymore from Twitter to Facebook
[656.54 → 659.04] because it just completely buries everything we post that way.
[659.14 → 659.92] I hate that.
[659.94 → 663.88] Which is pretty annoying because basically all they're doing is wasting my time.
[663.88 → 665.20] They're making me copy-paste things.
[665.20 → 670.10] I kind of want to like to create our own little bot that will just like –
[670.10 → 671.26] It's probably against terms of service.
[674.20 → 674.56] Yeah.
[675.94 → 676.70] God damn it.
[678.50 → 680.88] It probably definitely is.
[680.96 → 682.96] But that would be so nice because if you created your own bot,
[683.04 → 686.76] it wouldn't know because it wouldn't be going through the API services.
[687.28 → 689.88] You could just have it literally like copy and paste it in.
[690.50 → 691.90] It should make it like a normal paste.
[691.90 → 693.52] All right, so going back into what happened,
[693.66 → 698.46] the writer of the story was suspended from posting on Facebook for 24 hours.
[698.60 → 704.10] He posted a historic Vietnam War image of a naked girl fleeing from her napalm-bombed village.
[704.56 → 708.36] They then published a story discussing and criticizing the deletion of the image,
[708.42 → 711.68] and that post was also removed while containing the same image.
[712.06 → 718.20] The notice from Facebook explains that any images with nudity in them will be removed.
[718.20 → 722.86] So ESPN Hansen, editor-in-chief and CEO of Anton Posted –
[722.86 → 725.20] I probably butchered that, but I'm sorry –
[725.20 → 727.00] accused Zuckerberg of abusing his power,
[727.10 → 730.66] and then after that, the prime minister of Norway decided to speak out about the situation.
[730.80 → 734.44] She did this on Facebook, but several of her posts on the topic were also deleted,
[734.54 → 736.54] which is getting pretty ridiculous at that point.
[736.54 → 740.06] To be fair, this is probably just a bot going crazy.
[741.42 → 744.50] I seriously doubt this is someone like manually intervention and be like,
[744.62 → 747.56] no, screw you, Norway.
[747.96 → 748.72] Like, I don't know.
[748.80 → 750.04] It's also a matter of –
[750.04 → 751.04] And we have –
[751.04 → 754.80] So there is an anonymous Facebook spokesperson who responded saying,
[754.90 → 756.76] while we recognize that the photo is iconic,
[757.10 → 762.08] it's difficult to create a distinction between allowing a photograph of a nude child in one instance –
[762.08 → 762.94] I was just going to say –
[762.94 → 763.80] And not others.
[763.84 → 765.44] Above it said girl.
[765.64 → 765.96] Yes.
[766.18 → 767.80] And if this was an underage girl.
[767.80 → 768.68] Yes, it is.
[769.16 → 772.74] So we try to find the right balance between enabling people to express themselves
[772.74 → 775.42] while maintaining a safe and respectful experience for our global community.
[775.54 → 778.42] Our solutions won't always be perfect, but we'll continue to try to improve our policy,
[778.42 → 782.56] and they have since backed down and allowed the posting of this particular image.
[782.90 → 784.32] Which is interesting.
[784.70 → 788.54] Which is interesting, but I also completely get where they're coming from.
[788.56 → 789.40] Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[789.46 → 793.46] We discussed this on WAN Show last week without you, but YouTube, Google.
[793.48 → 793.74] Rude.
[794.24 → 795.02] Well, you weren't there.
[795.08 → 796.32] You did anything without me?
[796.42 → 796.70] Yes.
[797.04 → 798.26] I did something without you.
[798.40 → 799.44] I will make it up to you tonight.
[799.96 → 804.94] So basically, Google has cracked down on the –
[804.94 → 811.52] not the posting of, so this was why I publicly and strongly disagreed with some YouTuber statements
[811.52 → 813.60] that this is censorship, which it is not.
[814.06 → 816.70] If you can say whatever you want, that is not censorship.
[817.10 → 821.84] When someone refuses to pay you for saying whatever you want, that's not censorship.
[822.16 → 824.30] That's a completely different thing.
[824.68 → 825.22] And –
[825.22 → 828.22] Yeah, because they're not taking people's videos down.
[828.36 → 828.56] No.
[828.74 → 830.02] Or closing people's channels.
[830.18 → 830.28] No.
[830.28 → 832.92] That's something – I was getting really annoyed because there are so many videos that are like,
[833.06 → 834.38] my channel is being closed.
[834.50 → 835.42] I'm like, no, it's not.
[835.70 → 837.20] You would be closing your channel.
[837.44 → 837.72] Yes.
[837.80 → 838.32] They're just taking the monetization off.
[838.32 → 839.38] Because you're not making money anyway.
[839.38 → 840.40] Anyway, this isn't a current –
[840.40 → 844.98] Which is a whole other issue, and it's just a cold, hard reality for if you're taking money
[844.98 → 848.18] from sponsors that you're going to have to behave in a way that sponsors approve of,
[848.20 → 849.24] and it was going to happen eventually.
[850.82 → 852.28] But it's a very –
[852.28 → 853.72] I do want to chime in one quick second on this.
[853.72 → 853.74] Yeah.
[854.00 → 855.64] I did – someone posted a thing.
[855.66 → 856.92] Well, we can move to this after.
[857.08 → 857.42] Sure, yeah.
[857.42 → 858.24] I was just going to kind of close this.
[858.30 → 858.58] Yeah, sure.
[858.58 → 863.42] But basically, what I didn't agree with was the way Google's doing it,
[863.54 → 866.28] where they take this heavy-handed, ban-everything approach,
[866.50 → 871.48] and then probably what they will do is they will chip away –
[871.48 → 876.74] it's kind of like they take a big brick of marble, and they just kind of go,
[876.84 → 878.96] okay, so we're just like, everything's covered.
[879.22 → 882.54] And then they're just going to slowly chip away at the stuff that it turns out is actually okay
[882.54 → 888.24] until they end up with a statue of the devil stuff that no sponsor wants their advertisements anywhere near.
[888.58 → 891.04] And Facebook is doing it in much the same way.
[891.10 → 893.44] But the reality of it is, is do they really have a choice?
[894.12 → 900.82] Can Facebook manually go through and decide on every picture of a naked kid that's okay
[900.82 → 903.00] when they first implement a policy?
[903.68 → 907.86] And so I actually – like, I kind of agree with everything that happened here
[907.86 → 910.74] except Facebook removing the posts complaining about the removal.
[910.74 → 913.32] Unless they also contain the picture.
[913.32 → 913.96] That's what I'm saying.
[914.56 → 919.24] I'm wondering about the – what was her – was it Prime Minister?
[919.50 → 921.46] I don't want to get the position wrong.
[922.24 → 925.40] Yeah, so it was Erna Stolberg.
[925.48 → 926.50] Prime Minister of Norway.
[926.98 → 929.70] I'm wondering what the details of those posts –
[929.70 → 935.02] if it's just text complaining about the removal, that's crazy that that was removed.
[935.10 → 935.22] Yeah.
[935.28 → 939.04] But if it was like, I can't believe this was removed.
[939.50 → 940.72] This is fine.
[940.88 → 942.58] Then I would be like, okay, I understand that.
[942.88 → 947.10] Anyway, what I was going to say was someone was talking about how maybe a good solution
[947.10 → 952.02] for the monetization dropping that's going on YouTube would be different pools.
[952.82 → 959.22] So Google could have, like, advertisers that allow their ads to go on more, like, crazy videos
[959.22 → 962.16] or, like, traditionally not advertiser-friendly videos.
[962.36 → 966.64] And, like, companies that want to have their ads on these crazy videos can get cheaper ad buys.
[966.78 → 972.78] And maybe you get put in a lower monetization group, which is only open to those things.
[977.10 → 978.64] Did you – you said that?
[978.76 → 979.08] Okay.
[979.54 → 979.94] All right.
[980.22 → 981.46] I didn't watch the show.
[981.72 → 982.16] I don't know.
[982.42 → 983.24] It makes sense.
[983.38 → 983.60] Yeah.
[984.20 → 985.20] It does make sense.
[985.54 → 986.68] Everyone's like, let him keep going.
[987.04 → 987.44] No.
[987.60 → 988.26] Don't tell him.
[988.32 → 988.84] Don't tell him.
[989.04 → 989.40] No.
[989.52 → 991.80] You started smiling weird, and I was like, I don't know what's happening.
[992.10 → 994.24] And Linus never talks to Twitch chat.
[994.62 → 998.10] That's why – so I didn't know if you were trying to write to me or not,
[998.14 → 1000.18] because you don't normally type to Twitch chat.
[1000.32 → 1000.72] I don't know.
[1001.02 → 1001.96] No, I agree.
[1002.06 → 1002.84] I agree completely.
[1003.10 → 1005.78] I think that's how they should do it, and I think that's how they will do it.
[1005.78 → 1009.36] If anyone from Google watches the WAN show, which I'm not convinced that they do,
[1009.48 → 1012.92] but hey, if it managed to make it off WAN show and back to you,
[1012.98 → 1014.56] because I'm pretty sure you didn't watch the WAN show,
[1014.60 → 1015.96] and you'd have known that I was the one who said that.
[1016.00 → 1016.24] Yeah.
[1016.50 → 1019.02] I mean, someone else has probably come up with the idea independently as well.
[1019.06 → 1020.16] I'm sure it's already the plan.
[1020.50 → 1023.90] It's just a matter of it being difficult and complicated.
[1024.40 → 1027.18] And they would have to – I mean, this is something a lot of people don't know.
[1027.56 → 1033.24] A typical sponsor, if you're lucky, is negotiating their ad buys on a quarterly basis.
[1033.24 → 1035.40] Some of them will do it on a yearly basis.
[1035.94 → 1040.94] We'll talk to a sponsor in June, and we'll be like, hey, so we'd love to work together.
[1041.00 → 1042.60] We've got this cool idea for Q4.
[1042.68 → 1045.78] It'll be like, yep, all of our ad buys are reallocated at the beginning of the year.
[1045.80 → 1048.74] And I'm kind of sitting here going, and I hope none of our sponsors are watching this,
[1048.88 → 1051.90] because especially those, but what do you even do all day?
[1053.34 → 1053.92] Like seriously.
[1053.92 → 1064.94] Like what is your actual job if at one point at the beginning of the year you basically take all the brainpower out of deciding how to spend the advertising dollars that you have for the year?
[1064.96 → 1066.34] To probably manage those contracts.
[1066.52 → 1066.92] To be fair.
[1068.12 → 1074.66] Understand, though, too, that a lot of the time bigger brands, they subcontract this through agencies, right?
[1075.02 → 1078.74] Well, as far as I've been able to tell, because I talked to someone about this.
[1078.74 → 1082.74] I'm not going to say names or anything, because I've asked people, like, why the hell do you actually do this?
[1082.96 → 1085.92] Because I hate dealing with – sorry, Danny Middleman.
[1086.08 → 1089.88] I hate dealing with the middlemen because you always end up just having pass-through conversations.
[1090.18 → 1090.38] Yep.
[1090.74 → 1096.00] And they're like, okay, we're confused because they told us one thing, and now there's stuff going on.
[1096.08 → 1100.00] And then everyone has to kind of figure it out, and you're just adding more steps to the process.
[1100.00 → 1107.58] We had a deal fall through recently where we got on a call with the agency and the brand, and it turned out that our –
[1107.58 → 1110.40] So, okay, so there were actually four layers here.
[1110.52 → 1114.50] So there was us, our MCN, there was the brand agency, and there was the brand.
[1114.94 → 1115.70] Four layers.
[1116.12 → 1118.20] So our MCN did a great job.
[1118.80 → 1123.66] The brand had a clear idea of what they wanted, and honestly, those things were pretty well aligned.
[1124.34 → 1127.30] The agency basically passed along no information.
[1127.30 → 1131.74] The call was a complete cluster hump, and we found out shortly after the call –
[1131.74 → 1133.28] it's like the guys last week there anyway.
[1134.28 → 1136.06] So the deal completely fell through.
[1136.20 → 1137.06] So carry on.
[1137.06 → 1139.84] Yeah, so this stuff is frustrating, and I don't want to deal with it anyway.
[1139.94 → 1143.82] So I asked someone who was at one of the companies, not one of the PR companies,
[1143.90 → 1147.58] but one of the companies that would hire the PR companies, who was a PR person.
[1147.68 → 1149.00] We call them the brand, right?
[1149.10 → 1149.50] The brand.
[1149.54 → 1151.68] So brand versus agency.
[1151.74 → 1152.12] There we go.
[1152.12 → 1156.70] Okay, so I talked to a PR person from the brand and asked them why they don't do it, and it's a shield.
[1157.48 → 1157.72] Yeah.
[1157.90 → 1161.70] If their PR effort fails, they can just be like, their fault.
[1161.76 → 1162.18] Meat shield.
[1162.50 → 1163.48] Not brand's fault.
[1163.78 → 1163.98] Yep.
[1164.12 → 1164.48] Bye-bye.
[1164.48 → 1168.50] And, again, this is going back to my personal theories.
[1169.00 → 1171.40] It is a personal shield as well.
[1173.00 → 1173.50] What do you mean?
[1173.68 → 1177.08] Like, if I worked at IBM.
[1177.32 → 1178.20] Oh, no, definitely.
[1178.20 → 1184.96] For everyone at the brand, throughout the whole chain, the brand itself and the people working at the brand, it's all a shield.
[1185.04 → 1185.66] It's a meat shield.
[1185.82 → 1185.96] Yeah.
[1185.96 → 1192.64] So all they have to say is, okay, well, next year we will reallocate that entire chunk somewhere else.
[1192.80 → 1194.86] We're going to reallocate it into social.
[1194.86 → 1211.24] So basically someone gets paid an actual salary for an actual entire year to make a decision at the beginning of the year at one point in time to go, okay, we are going to allocate, we are going to listen to some proposals, and we are going to allocate budget here, here, here, and here.
[1211.24 → 1219.64] And then if it works, then I will be submitting a great report about how well it worked, and if it doesn't work, I'm going to submit a report about how I fired those people.
[1221.34 → 1222.14] Oh, man.
[1223.60 → 1224.30] Corporations, man.
[1224.40 → 1225.38] Become a PR person.
[1226.68 → 1228.74] Yeah, but you've got to work your way up the food chain first.
[1228.74 → 1229.46] You've got to get to the brand.
[1229.46 → 1232.50] Yeah, so first you'll be like the meat shield.
[1233.04 → 1234.40] Yeah, you've got to deal with being a meat shield.
[1234.42 → 1236.14] You have to survive as a meat shield first.
[1236.46 → 1236.66] Yeah.
[1236.80 → 1238.16] It's basically like warfare.
[1239.76 → 1240.88] But with words.
[1241.08 → 1241.38] Yes.
[1241.82 → 1249.38] So in much the same way, you can either survive as a meat shield and get promoted, or you can just be born into it because, like, nepotism or whatever.
[1249.60 → 1249.82] Yeah.
[1250.50 → 1250.72] Yeah.
[1251.20 → 1254.62] You have to defend against the internet's flamethrowers of compassion.
[1254.80 → 1255.20] All right.
[1255.20 → 1257.36] So moving on to our next topic.
[1257.36 → 1260.14] Oh, yes.
[1260.24 → 1265.02] Sony launches an AMD Polaris-powered PlayStation 4 Pro.
[1265.18 → 1267.48] So our original article here is from WCCF Tech.
[1268.12 → 1272.46] It's probably fine because this is, like, there's actually, like, a press release.
[1272.60 → 1273.36] Here are some specs.
[1273.46 → 1274.40] Like, it's not speculation.
[1275.10 → 1276.20] Speculation.
[1276.44 → 1276.60] Wow.
[1276.70 → 1278.20] I can't believe I've never made that joke before.
[1278.26 → 1278.74] Oh, wow.
[1278.84 → 1279.00] Yeah.
[1279.82 → 1284.96] So basically there's a single-chip custom processor featuring eight Jaguar cores,
[1284.96 → 1288.16] though we do know that they are clocked higher.
[1288.34 → 1292.16] So they're faster Jaguar cores, but okay.
[1292.16 → 1296.88] We have a 1.84-tera-flop AMD Radon-based graphics engine.
[1297.00 → 1303.38] So we know that this is not quite double the theoretical performance of what was already in the PlayStation 4.
[1303.64 → 1306.92] It's available with a 500 gig or a 1 terabyte drive.
[1307.02 → 1309.22] It's got 8 gigs of GDDR5 memory.
[1309.22 → 1314.78] It has a Blu-ray drive, an Ethernet port, 10 gig LAN.
[1314.84 → 1315.58] No, I'm just kidding.
[1315.66 → 1316.24] Just gigabit.
[1316.42 → 1319.28] It's approximately 2.1 kilograms.
[1320.50 → 1321.78] Starts at $400.
[1323.06 → 1324.18] Starts at $400.
[1325.12 → 1326.56] When is this for the – wait.
[1326.90 → 1327.34] So they're out now?
[1327.34 → 1328.82] This is the new Slim Standard model.
[1328.92 → 1329.48] Gosh darn it.
[1329.58 → 1332.00] This is the new – this is the –
[1332.00 → 1338.22] It's still 8 gigs of GDDR5 because that much is in the notes.
[1338.22 → 1338.86] Dang it.
[1339.00 → 1340.34] Where is the Pro 1?
[1341.00 → 1342.22] Nantes had a good article on it.
[1342.24 → 1343.06] I was looking at that.
[1343.58 → 1343.98] Okay.
[1344.16 → 1346.22] So the Pro 1, higher clock speeds.
[1346.34 → 1349.22] It is still 8 gigs of RAM that is said to run at higher clocks too
[1349.22 → 1353.20] and is bolstered by new lossless memory compression technology from AMD.
[1353.90 → 1356.94] The GPU component features over double the shading power of the PlayStation 4
[1356.94 → 1357.72] and it's based on the players.
[1357.88 → 1358.00] Okay.
[1358.14 → 1359.54] So basically I got everything right.
[1359.76 → 1361.02] The Pro starts at $399.
[1361.48 → 1361.80] Okay.
[1361.86 → 1362.74] We got everything right,
[1362.90 → 1365.68] even though we were looking at an article that I don't actually think was about it.
[1365.68 → 1368.56] So go Linus and Luke.
[1368.66 → 1369.04] So okay.
[1369.08 → 1369.44] Yay.
[1369.70 → 1370.42] In a nutshell,
[1370.78 → 1376.18] what Sony is trying to do is they are trying to make their console all about 4K.
[1377.04 → 1387.14] And they're still approaching it from sort of lacklustre sort of angle.
[1387.14 → 1390.22] So that's not grammatically correct, but let's go with it.
[1390.32 → 1391.16] Lacklustre angle.
[1391.52 → 1394.44] So they're still approaching it in a way that is quite frankly just not going to work
[1394.44 → 1397.66] because as the college educated among you may know,
[1398.02 → 1402.38] 4K is four times the pixel count of 1080p.
[1402.38 → 1404.84] So right off the hop,
[1405.12 → 1410.78] if we're running games at anything less than 60 FPS native 1080p on the PlayStation 4,
[1410.84 → 1412.16] which we most assuredly are,
[1412.80 → 1416.40] we will need four times the theoretical performance.
[1416.48 → 1417.56] It doesn't quite work like that.
[1417.64 → 1423.68] But we will need more than two times the theoretical performance of the original PlayStation 4
[1423.68 → 1426.26] in order to game at 4K smoothly at the same frame rates.
[1426.76 → 1428.38] Yeah, because there's like a lot of variables.
[1429.26 → 1430.80] There's a lot more to it than that.
[1430.80 → 1434.38] But shaders are not the same as as,
[1434.56 → 1438.80] your overall pixel fill rate is not the same as how your memory bandwidth affects all of that.
[1439.36 → 1442.14] You could double the functional units in the GPU,
[1442.36 → 1444.86] but if you didn't increase the memory bandwidth at all,
[1444.94 → 1446.42] then you wouldn't get doubling.
[1446.64 → 1450.04] And theoretical doubling does not equal practical real-world doubling.
[1450.20 → 1451.06] So there are a lot of things going on here.
[1451.06 → 1453.92] Unless you had a memory bandwidth that was already capable of the doubling.
[1453.92 → 1459.04] Even if you fully like double-doubled without making any kind of architectural change,
[1459.04 → 1461.44] I don't know that you would get double the performance.
[1461.54 → 1462.30] We could test it, though.
[1462.66 → 1462.80] That could be interesting.
[1462.80 → 1468.20] Like, we could go find a GPU that has exactly half of the CUBA cores of the higher-end one
[1468.20 → 1469.80] and see how it works out.
[1470.38 → 1471.30] We might have to overclock.
[1471.30 → 1472.48] No other changes, though?
[1472.52 → 1474.12] We might have to overclock and underclock.
[1474.14 → 1476.80] But there'd probably be like memory bandwidth changes and stuff.
[1476.92 → 1477.26] Yeah.
[1477.86 → 1479.28] Okay, I don't know if it would be possible.
[1479.40 → 1479.98] Well, let me tell you what.
[1480.00 → 1481.38] We'll call up NVIDIA or AMD.
[1481.54 → 1481.88] We'll be like,
[1481.88 → 1483.26] Hey, can you send us a custom GPU?
[1483.44 → 1485.22] Can you like seal off half of the...
[1485.22 → 1487.20] Are you there still?
[1487.46 → 1487.68] Hello?
[1490.68 → 1491.08] Anyway.
[1491.44 → 1493.56] So it's going to be the war again.
[1494.18 → 1496.64] Last time there was a PlayStation and Xbox launch,
[1496.82 → 1498.12] and there's coming up,
[1498.22 → 1499.62] there will be a PlayStation and Xbox launch.
[1499.92 → 1501.58] There was all the image comparisons.
[1502.24 → 1504.64] Every single tech YouTuber, including us,
[1504.64 → 1506.44] and probably this will happen again,
[1506.76 → 1512.62] is going to create computers that are like the same price or cheaper and better
[1512.62 → 1513.96] or the same performance.
[1514.40 → 1516.00] And then everyone's going to be like,
[1516.46 → 1518.82] but as computer parts keep coming out
[1518.82 → 1520.64] and these consoles are going to stay here for a little while,
[1520.78 → 1522.74] in the future, we'll have even better ones.
[1523.50 → 1525.44] And then with the next GPU launch,
[1525.62 → 1528.92] there will be even more videos of people going like,
[1529.06 → 1530.10] Oh man, look,
[1530.16 → 1533.62] you can even make faster computers for the same price as the consoles.
[1533.62 → 1535.32] But then the consoles are going to go down in price.
[1535.92 → 1537.32] And yeah, the whole war is going to come down.
[1537.32 → 1541.18] Do you want to redo 792p versus six-year-old graphics card?
[1541.80 → 1542.44] I can.
[1542.70 → 1543.38] That'd be pretty funny.
[1543.48 → 1543.76] Yeah.
[1544.18 → 1544.36] Yeah.
[1544.42 → 1545.86] That one's got almost a million views.
[1546.66 → 1547.42] 926,000.
[1547.54 → 1548.40] I kind of enjoyed that video.
[1548.52 → 1549.38] It's a...
[1549.38 → 1550.14] There's, again,
[1550.54 → 1553.50] like I just said for your doubling thing,
[1553.70 → 1555.22] there are some problems with it.
[1555.32 → 1556.44] But it was a fun video.
[1558.28 → 1558.92] That's true.
[1559.50 → 1560.30] So, I don't know.
[1560.42 → 1562.30] I'm kind of excited about the war again,
[1562.30 → 1563.64] just because I like...
[1563.64 → 1566.24] I like what it brings
[1566.24 → 1569.48] in terms of like people actually building low-cost computers.
[1569.52 → 1569.66] Yeah.
[1569.72 → 1570.96] And I get a kick out of...
[1570.96 → 1574.44] I get a kick out of how much more and more PC-like
[1574.44 → 1576.24] the consoles continue to become.
[1576.68 → 1578.16] It's like now all of a sudden,
[1578.30 → 1580.88] you can get PlayStation's with different specs.
[1582.06 → 1582.98] Yes, my friends.
[1583.10 → 1586.02] PlayStation 4s with different core specs.
[1586.02 → 1588.28] And when you run games
[1588.28 → 1589.98] in your better PlayStation 4
[1589.98 → 1592.14] versus your peasant PlayStation 4,
[1592.38 → 1593.90] we're going to have like a whole new level.
[1594.06 → 1595.02] There's going to be like...
[1595.02 → 1595.90] There's going to be like...
[1595.90 → 1597.80] Like the PCMR guys.
[1597.88 → 1598.60] They're going to be like...
[1598.60 → 1600.20] There's like console peasants
[1600.20 → 1602.74] and then there's like console like vassals or something.
[1603.96 → 1605.46] There's going to be like rankings.
[1606.08 → 1607.36] And it's all going to be dramatic
[1607.36 → 1609.14] and it's going to be all over the YouTube comments
[1609.14 → 1610.06] and I'm going to sit back
[1610.06 → 1610.82] and I'm going to laugh.
[1610.82 → 1613.86] But in a nutshell, okay,
[1614.38 → 1616.24] Sony needed to do this for a couple of reasons.
[1616.36 → 1618.40] Number one is it's all about 4K.
[1618.48 → 1619.08] Even Sony.
[1619.22 → 1621.06] It's like, you know, the TV division
[1621.06 → 1623.06] is kind of sitting there going...
[1623.06 → 1625.30] Like, how are you guys not helping us out here?
[1625.50 → 1625.84] Okay?
[1626.22 → 1628.08] We're trying to sell some 4K TVs here, all right?
[1628.94 → 1630.74] So they had to have 4K support,
[1630.80 → 1631.76] whether it's for Blu-ray
[1631.76 → 1634.18] or whether it is for gaming.
[1634.52 → 1635.64] 4K support had to come
[1635.64 → 1637.12] so they had to do something more powerful
[1637.12 → 1638.72] because the original PlayStation 4
[1638.72 → 1639.46] was going to run games
[1639.46 → 1641.14] at like 12 frames per second.
[1641.72 → 1643.82] Twice as cinematic as 24 frames per second.
[1644.78 → 1646.40] Also, PlayStation VR.
[1646.92 → 1648.02] There was speculation
[1648.02 → 1649.86] that Sony was going to use
[1649.86 → 1650.92] some rendering tricks,
[1651.16 → 1653.40] some frame interpolation tricks.
[1653.68 → 1655.10] They were going to figure out
[1655.10 → 1656.44] how to get PSVR running
[1656.44 → 1657.80] on the original PlayStation 4
[1657.80 → 1658.90] and have it be a good experience.
[1659.30 → 1660.00] We were skeptical.
[1660.72 → 1662.26] Looks like they didn't.
[1662.44 → 1664.34] PlayStation 4 Pro...
[1664.34 → 1665.14] Or is that what they're calling it?
[1665.16 → 1665.92] PlayStation 4 Pro?
[1665.98 → 1666.86] Yeah, PS4 Pro
[1666.86 → 1668.70] is going to be the way
[1668.70 → 1670.06] to experience PSVR
[1670.06 → 1671.18] if you care at all
[1671.18 → 1672.50] about a good experience.
[1673.28 → 1674.80] How does it make you professional?
[1679.38 → 1680.66] If you were a pro gamer,
[1680.80 → 1681.90] you probably wouldn't game
[1681.90 → 1682.84] on a like,
[1683.52 → 1684.80] Peasant Station 4.
[1684.98 → 1685.82] Yeah, if you're a pro gamer,
[1685.88 → 1685.94] you probably would.
[1685.94 → 1686.96] I bet they're going to call it
[1686.96 → 1687.78] Peasant Station 4.
[1687.88 → 1688.56] Someone will call it
[1688.56 → 1689.28] Peasant Station 4.
[1689.52 → 1690.92] A PlayStation 4 Pro owner
[1690.92 → 1692.70] is going to start that.
[1693.34 → 1694.92] You might have just started that yourself.
[1695.00 → 1695.76] I'm not sure.
[1696.14 → 1696.36] Yeah.
[1696.36 → 1697.38] People are going to start
[1697.38 → 1698.28] having pictures
[1698.28 → 1700.28] of the original PlayStation 4
[1700.28 → 1701.34] or Peasant Station 4
[1701.34 → 1702.22] and have, like,
[1702.28 → 1703.10] fake dirt on it.
[1703.26 → 1703.54] Yeah.
[1703.74 → 1704.26] Oh, man.
[1704.28 → 1704.56] I'd be like,
[1704.60 → 1705.70] it's the Peasant Station 4.
[1706.96 → 1707.58] Oh, my.
[1707.96 → 1709.24] This is going to be confusing,
[1709.70 → 1710.08] actually.
[1710.24 → 1711.92] One of the perfect things
[1711.92 → 1713.36] about consoles for a long time
[1713.36 → 1714.54] was the like,
[1714.64 → 1715.92] easy gifting idea.
[1716.08 → 1716.56] Plug and play.
[1716.68 → 1717.68] The mom could just go
[1717.68 → 1718.20] to the store
[1718.20 → 1718.88] and be like,
[1719.04 → 1721.18] my son wants the Xbox.
[1721.68 → 1721.80] Yeah.
[1721.80 → 1722.20] And then...
[1722.20 → 1723.06] Or the PlayStation.
[1723.56 → 1723.84] Yeah.
[1723.84 → 1724.44] They'd be like,
[1725.06 → 1726.18] here's the newest one.
[1726.44 → 1726.62] Yeah.
[1726.68 → 1727.96] Here is one game.
[1728.26 → 1728.44] Yeah.
[1728.44 → 1729.96] The only game that matters right now.
[1730.04 → 1730.22] Yeah.
[1730.42 → 1730.98] Your son will,
[1731.08 → 1732.12] or daughter will have to wait
[1732.12 → 1732.88] two years.
[1733.40 → 1734.72] For more interesting games.
[1734.72 → 1734.96] For more games.
[1735.24 → 1735.46] Yeah.
[1735.70 → 1736.12] And that's,
[1736.20 → 1736.92] and it was fine.
[1737.30 → 1737.86] And now it's going to be like...
[1737.86 → 1738.32] And it was good.
[1739.32 → 1740.84] And we liked it that way.
[1742.36 → 1744.28] Do you want the 500 gig model?
[1744.38 → 1745.78] Do you want the one terabyte model?
[1745.84 → 1747.06] Do you want the pro model?
[1747.20 → 1748.22] Do you want the non-pro model?
[1748.22 → 1749.40] Is your son not a professional?
[1749.92 → 1750.26] Is he a parent?
[1750.26 → 1751.76] Is your daughter going to grow up
[1751.76 → 1753.24] to pump gas all her life?
[1753.84 → 1755.38] I mean,
[1755.42 → 1755.96] that's okay,
[1756.10 → 1756.82] but you're not going to want
[1756.82 → 1757.36] the professional.
[1757.70 → 1758.64] You're going to want this one.
[1758.74 → 1759.68] And part of the problem
[1759.68 → 1762.10] is that this might actually introduce
[1762.10 → 1763.96] like competitive advantages.
[1764.74 → 1766.28] Pleb station 4 is another name for that.
[1766.28 → 1766.58] Okay.
[1766.66 → 1766.82] Yeah.
[1766.82 → 1767.72] That'll probably be used.
[1767.94 → 1768.22] Okay.
[1768.32 → 1769.66] You should maybe straw poll
[1769.66 → 1771.14] a few names that you see in there
[1771.14 → 1771.90] and see who...
[1771.90 → 1772.46] Poop Station.
[1773.22 → 1774.36] Poop Station sounds like
[1774.36 → 1775.10] a different thing.
[1775.24 → 1775.68] It does.
[1775.82 → 1776.70] It just literally sounds
[1776.70 → 1777.18] like a toilet.
[1777.32 → 1777.50] Yeah.
[1779.42 → 1780.52] Apparently it does not support
[1780.52 → 1781.22] 4K Blu-ray.
[1781.34 → 1782.12] I did not know that.
[1782.20 → 1782.96] I'd imagine that'll come
[1782.96 → 1783.76] with a firmware update.
[1784.34 → 1785.32] There's no way
[1785.32 → 1786.08] that it doesn't support
[1786.08 → 1787.10] 4K Blu-ray at some point.
[1787.12 → 1787.72] That's ridiculous.
[1789.98 → 1790.38] Anyway,
[1790.58 → 1791.48] what I was going to say was
[1791.48 → 1792.64] it might actually introduce
[1792.64 → 1793.54] a competitive advantage
[1793.54 → 1794.30] because if you're getting
[1794.30 → 1795.84] significantly more frame rate,
[1796.38 → 1796.56] like,
[1796.94 → 1799.06] maybe in older games
[1799.06 → 1800.66] that aren't meant to run
[1800.66 → 1801.60] or aren't designed
[1801.60 → 1802.64] to run at higher resolution,
[1802.76 → 1803.80] they might run faster.
[1804.00 → 1804.66] I was wrong.
[1804.66 → 1806.48] I did not follow
[1806.48 → 1807.92] the PlayStation 4 Pro news
[1807.92 → 1808.76] because I don't care.
[1810.68 → 1811.38] But no.
[1811.62 → 1813.54] The absence of a 4K Blu-ray player
[1813.54 → 1814.48] is due to
[1814.48 → 1816.22] a lack of consumer demand
[1816.22 → 1816.72] according to
[1816.72 → 1818.16] PlayStation boss Andrew House.
[1818.54 → 1820.00] Support cannot be patched in
[1820.00 → 1820.74] via firmware update
[1820.74 → 1821.74] at a later date either.
[1821.86 → 1822.44] He confirmed.
[1824.64 → 1825.08] Okay.
[1826.66 → 1827.26] Oh yeah.
[1827.26 → 1828.60] Lack of consumer demand.
[1828.76 → 1830.80] The very first question
[1830.80 → 1832.88] on Amazon.com
[1832.88 → 1833.60] when you scroll down
[1833.60 → 1834.78] on the pre-order page
[1834.78 → 1836.76] with over two times the...
[1836.76 → 1837.74] We can switch to my screen
[1837.74 → 1838.30] if you'd like.
[1839.30 → 1839.44] Yeah.
[1839.44 → 1840.40] With over two times
[1840.40 → 1841.80] the upvotes
[1841.80 → 1842.68] of any other question.
[1842.74 → 1843.38] Only at 42.
[1843.66 → 1844.96] But this is the...
[1844.96 → 1846.02] It's covered up by that.
[1846.18 → 1846.76] I'll scroll.
[1846.98 → 1847.28] It's okay.
[1847.38 → 1847.82] I got it.
[1848.20 → 1850.44] I want to give it the old...
[1850.44 → 1850.92] Ah.
[1851.54 → 1851.94] Fancy.
[1852.60 → 1852.96] Oh,
[1853.02 → 1853.62] I'm going to do this.
[1854.32 → 1855.24] It's only 42 votes
[1855.24 → 1856.10] as you can see there.
[1856.26 → 1857.24] But it's like,
[1857.28 → 1858.20] it's still up there.
[1858.26 → 1859.36] And this is the pre-order page
[1859.36 → 1859.78] on Amazon
[1859.78 → 1861.14] way before you can buy it.
[1861.22 → 1862.62] So I'm not suspecting that much.
[1862.82 → 1864.86] And there are 206 answers.
[1865.50 → 1866.74] Which is insane.
[1867.06 → 1867.62] Compared to like
[1867.62 → 1868.96] the one or six
[1868.96 → 1869.94] or zero answers
[1869.94 → 1870.54] on the other questions.
[1870.56 → 1871.44] I like the top answer.
[1871.64 → 1872.22] In one of the most
[1872.22 → 1873.28] mind-boggling decisions
[1873.28 → 1874.36] in console history,
[1874.50 → 1874.70] no.
[1877.28 → 1878.32] It cannot play
[1878.32 → 1879.76] ultra HD Blu-rays.
[1881.26 → 1881.70] So,
[1881.70 → 1882.10] yeah.
[1882.36 → 1883.54] Lack of consumer demand
[1883.54 → 1885.14] may be an inaccurate statement.
[1885.54 → 1885.84] I mean,
[1885.96 → 1887.58] it may not also be
[1887.58 → 1888.56] completely...
[1888.56 → 1888.92] Like,
[1889.04 → 1889.36] okay.
[1889.78 → 1891.22] I
[1891.22 → 1892.48] personally
[1892.48 → 1894.10] own
[1894.10 → 1895.76] a movie-watching
[1895.76 → 1896.14] setup
[1896.14 → 1897.58] that has a
[1897.58 → 1899.30] 65-inch TV
[1899.30 → 1901.60] literally a meter
[1901.60 → 1902.30] from my face.
[1903.42 → 1903.72] Okay?
[1904.28 → 1905.88] I am about
[1905.88 → 1906.48] as
[1906.48 → 1907.74] target-a-market
[1907.74 → 1909.72] as 4K Blu-ray
[1909.72 → 1911.08] could possibly have.
[1911.74 → 1912.82] I could not
[1912.82 → 1913.76] possibly care less.
[1914.20 → 1914.56] Really?
[1915.32 → 1916.70] I do.
[1917.04 → 1917.24] Like,
[1917.30 → 1917.58] honestly,
[1917.68 → 1918.06] I'll tell you,
[1918.10 → 1918.78] I have bought
[1918.78 → 1919.54] DVDs,
[1919.62 → 1919.78] like,
[1919.88 → 1920.66] even recently,
[1920.76 → 1920.88] like,
[1920.88 → 1921.52] before I got that
[1921.52 → 1921.78] setup,
[1921.96 → 1922.88] and now I'm really
[1922.88 → 1923.64] disappointed I own
[1923.64 → 1924.20] DVDs.
[1924.76 → 1926.60] But streaming 4K
[1926.60 → 1928.02] does not look better
[1928.02 → 1929.04] than 1080p Blu-ray,
[1929.30 → 1930.58] and 1080p Blu-ray
[1930.58 → 1931.90] looks great.
[1932.48 → 1933.54] Even at that distance.
[1933.54 → 1934.08] 4K Blu-ray?
[1934.74 → 1935.64] I have not.
[1935.64 → 1935.94] Because streaming 4K
[1935.94 → 1937.02] is not the same.
[1937.24 → 1937.90] Oh, no, it's not.
[1938.04 → 1938.58] It's not the same
[1938.58 → 1938.84] on, like,
[1938.86 → 1940.12] a few levels.
[1940.16 → 1941.20] Which is a whole
[1941.20 → 1942.96] other way to attack
[1942.96 → 1943.74] Sony's argument
[1943.74 → 1944.60] for why it doesn't
[1944.60 → 1945.14] support that.
[1945.14 → 1945.16] I'm going to go pretty
[1945.16 → 1945.74] blunt here and say
[1945.74 → 1946.38] that I don't think
[1946.38 → 1946.98] you can comment
[1946.98 → 1948.32] if you haven't seen it.
[1948.32 → 1948.60] Oh, okay.
[1948.82 → 1949.46] Okay, fine.
[1950.10 → 1950.86] So I'll tell you what,
[1950.96 → 1952.64] I will obtain a 4K
[1952.64 → 1953.74] Blu-ray at some point,
[1953.96 → 1954.82] and we will revisit
[1954.82 → 1955.60] this conversation.
[1955.84 → 1956.54] That could be a cool
[1956.54 → 1956.86] video.
[1957.70 → 1959.30] Is 4K Blu-ray worth it?
[1959.40 → 1959.86] Actually, that's
[1959.86 → 1960.40] probably a pretty good
[1960.40 → 1960.60] video.
[1960.70 → 1961.18] I should probably do
[1961.18 → 1961.30] that.
[1961.34 → 1961.90] You should, probably.
[1961.90 → 1962.50] And I'll be like,
[1962.62 → 1963.52] for you, no.
[1963.76 → 1964.78] But for me.
[1964.78 → 1964.96] It's a meter above
[1964.96 → 1965.62] your face.
[1965.86 → 1966.50] Hell yeah.
[1967.66 → 1968.66] Okay, but, like,
[1969.12 → 1969.72] shit, I wasn't
[1969.72 → 1970.00] going to say.
[1970.22 → 1971.52] I think that consumer
[1971.52 → 1972.36] demand would be more
[1972.36 → 1973.38] existent if this thing
[1973.38 → 1974.20] did support it.
[1974.60 → 1974.84] Yeah.
[1975.02 → 1975.72] Because I don't think
[1975.72 → 1976.34] that many people are
[1976.34 → 1977.30] going to want to go buy
[1977.30 → 1978.74] a player for 4K Blu-ray,
[1978.92 → 1979.78] but if their PlayStation
[1979.78 → 1980.84] already supported it,
[1980.86 → 1981.70] and they go to the
[1981.70 → 1981.90] store.
[1981.90 → 1981.92] Maybe they would buy
[1981.92 → 1982.58] a couple discs.
[1982.72 → 1982.92] Yeah.
[1983.06 → 1983.38] Maybe.
[1983.64 → 1983.84] Yeah.
[1983.94 → 1984.72] Especially if they were
[1984.72 → 1984.90] cheap.
[1985.02 → 1986.34] Like, especially by the
[1986.34 → 1987.20] time, maybe that's part
[1987.20 → 1987.58] of the problem.
[1987.68 → 1988.28] Maybe they don't feel
[1988.28 → 1988.90] like supporting it
[1988.90 → 1989.46] because they're not
[1989.46 → 1991.02] going to get $29.99
[1991.02 → 1992.18] for a Blu-ray disc
[1992.18 → 1992.50] anymore.
[1993.06 → 1994.22] So maybe the royalties
[1994.22 → 1994.76] just aren't even,
[1994.84 → 1995.94] like, I don't know
[1995.94 → 1996.76] what the rationale
[1996.76 → 1997.60] internally at Sony
[1997.60 → 1999.66] is exactly, but
[1999.66 → 2000.50] basically they've
[2000.50 → 2001.46] decided it's not worth
[2001.46 → 2001.70] it.
[2001.78 → 2001.96] Yeah.
[2003.18 → 2003.82] But, like,
[2003.88 → 2005.04] personally, especially
[2005.04 → 2005.70] for, like, $5,
[2005.98 → 2007.18] like, in the $7 bin,
[2007.54 → 2008.34] maybe not tomorrow
[2008.34 → 2009.22] because 4K Blu-ray
[2009.22 → 2009.88] is going to be expensive
[2009.88 → 2010.42] for a bit.
[2010.42 → 2011.58] But in the $7 bin
[2011.58 → 2012.22] in a few years,
[2012.36 → 2013.56] I would rather own it
[2013.56 → 2014.86] than stream it.
[2015.24 → 2015.34] Me too.
[2015.34 → 2016.16] In a lot of cases.
[2016.32 → 2016.80] Yep, me too.
[2016.88 → 2018.22] I don't buy everything.
[2018.40 → 2019.44] A lot of stuff I stream.
[2019.58 → 2020.62] Certain content, though,
[2020.72 → 2021.44] especially, like,
[2021.54 → 2022.76] I'm buying House of Cards
[2022.76 → 2023.38] even though I have
[2023.38 → 2024.50] a 4K Netflix subscription.
[2026.02 → 2026.42] Hackers,
[2026.90 → 2028.60] Harry Potter,
[2028.84 → 2029.48] Lord of the Rings,
[2029.82 → 2030.84] Secret Life of Walter Mitty,
[2031.10 → 2032.84] The Imaginaries of Dr. Parnassus.
[2032.94 → 2033.54] These are all things
[2033.54 → 2034.58] that I'd like to have on.
[2034.92 → 2035.32] Yep.
[2035.42 → 2036.44] On a physical media
[2036.44 → 2037.06] that I own.
[2037.32 → 2037.52] Yep.
[2037.52 → 2038.40] I mean, I don't keep them
[2038.40 → 2039.12] on physical media
[2039.12 → 2041.28] because I made that video.
[2041.50 → 2041.72] Yeah.
[2041.80 → 2042.50] Because it's stupid.
[2042.66 → 2043.30] I agree with that.
[2043.64 → 2045.02] But the idea is that
[2045.02 → 2046.08] you have it
[2046.08 → 2046.64] because Netflix
[2046.64 → 2047.56] is really volatile.
[2047.78 → 2048.94] Without web compression,
[2049.44 → 2050.92] I have it forever.
[2051.20 → 2051.46] Yep.
[2051.74 → 2052.54] Because I paid for it.
[2052.54 → 2053.74] And these streaming services
[2053.74 → 2054.20] are volatile.
[2054.34 → 2054.98] I don't think Netflix
[2054.98 → 2055.74] is going to go away.
[2055.80 → 2056.42] That's not what I mean
[2056.42 → 2056.88] by volatile.
[2057.06 → 2057.16] Yeah, no.
[2057.26 → 2057.94] But the content
[2057.94 → 2058.40] that's on there
[2058.40 → 2059.08] can change.
[2059.14 → 2059.30] Yep.
[2059.46 → 2060.36] And does change.
[2060.76 → 2060.84] Yeah.
[2060.94 → 2061.84] And it's designed that way.
[2061.96 → 2062.06] Totally.
[2062.06 → 2063.04] It's supposed to be like that.
[2063.08 → 2063.76] They're not going to license
[2063.76 → 2064.28] everything
[2064.28 → 2065.20] because that costs money.
[2065.28 → 2065.76] And I love it.
[2065.76 → 2067.16] And people who watch Netflix
[2067.16 → 2068.90] are going to watch Netflix regularly.
[2069.02 → 2069.90] They want to be refreshing it.
[2069.92 → 2070.52] So that's fine.
[2070.60 → 2070.74] Yeah.
[2071.12 → 2072.36] It also creates that urgency
[2072.36 → 2073.30] when you see something.
[2073.98 → 2075.22] It's very smart, actually.
[2076.66 → 2077.52] What was I talking about?
[2077.52 → 2077.98] Oh, right.
[2078.04 → 2078.94] I was going to add this
[2078.94 → 2080.76] to the...
[2080.76 → 2084.60] So is 4K Blu-ray worth it?
[2085.06 → 2085.48] No.
[2086.06 → 2087.70] But I like it.
[2088.22 → 2088.84] So there.
[2089.06 → 2090.18] That's already the whole video.
[2090.64 → 2092.86] All 6,782 of you
[2092.86 → 2093.96] can save yourselves the effort.
[2095.80 → 2096.88] But for everyone else,
[2097.02 → 2098.18] hopefully that'll be a good video.
[2098.44 → 2099.68] I still kind of want it.
[2100.00 → 2101.12] It's totally not worth it
[2101.12 → 2102.20] and it goes completely
[2102.20 → 2103.62] against the algorithm stuff
[2103.62 → 2104.40] that YouTube is trying
[2104.40 → 2105.24] to use right now.
[2105.34 → 2105.50] Yeah.
[2105.58 → 2106.40] But I would still love
[2106.40 → 2107.06] to make that channel
[2107.06 → 2107.80] that we talked about
[2107.80 → 2109.02] back at the old office.
[2109.40 → 2109.70] Was it?
[2109.70 → 2110.50] I don't know if you remember this.
[2110.74 → 2110.76] No.
[2111.48 → 2112.40] I talked about it
[2112.40 → 2113.44] with a OnePlus review.
[2114.44 → 2115.82] I think it was the OnePlus One
[2115.82 → 2116.68] that I was talking about it for.
[2117.12 → 2118.86] Where I would be like...
[2118.86 → 2119.62] It's just like
[2119.62 → 2121.50] super short tech reviews.
[2121.50 → 2123.70] So like 30 second review?
[2124.42 → 2124.78] Yeah.
[2125.52 → 2126.70] Like terrible company,
[2127.16 → 2127.84] good phone,
[2128.16 → 2129.42] problems with software stuff.
[2129.66 → 2130.46] Look it up on the forums.
[2130.52 → 2131.00] But it's cheap.
[2131.30 → 2131.88] But it's cheap.
[2132.56 → 2133.20] See you next time.
[2136.26 → 2137.00] And like,
[2137.26 → 2138.06] you could review
[2138.06 → 2139.14] graphics cards like that
[2139.14 → 2140.10] because you could just
[2140.10 → 2141.32] take a price performance graph
[2141.32 → 2141.76] and be like,
[2141.88 → 2142.50] it's lots here.
[2142.88 → 2143.74] See you next time.
[2145.74 → 2146.68] I hate you.
[2146.96 → 2148.10] But seriously though.
[2148.10 → 2153.44] So many things
[2153.44 → 2154.28] could be done that way.
[2154.48 → 2155.30] Everyone's suggesting
[2155.30 → 2157.14] we do tech quickie reviews.
[2157.68 → 2158.58] Tech quickie reviews.
[2158.60 → 2159.50] Tech quickie could start
[2159.50 → 2160.52] doing product reviews.
[2162.86 → 2163.30] Hmm.
[2164.18 → 2165.18] We even have a place
[2165.18 → 2166.12] to put it potentially.
[2167.10 → 2167.40] That's,
[2167.50 → 2167.68] oh,
[2167.76 → 2168.94] it's so short though.
[2169.04 → 2170.28] It's shorter than tech quickies.
[2170.66 → 2171.44] Because tech quickies
[2171.44 → 2172.16] aren't really like
[2172.16 → 2173.96] the fastest possible segment.
[2173.96 → 2173.98] Well,
[2173.98 → 2174.68] they used to be
[2174.68 → 2175.48] the fastest possible.
[2175.48 → 2176.18] Now they're like
[2176.18 → 2178.72] as much history
[2178.72 → 2180.12] and context as possible.
[2180.32 → 2180.60] Yeah.
[2181.16 → 2181.64] Yeah,
[2181.64 → 2182.42] they're not that short.
[2182.66 → 2183.00] No.
[2183.22 → 2183.48] Yeah.
[2184.76 → 2185.42] I don't know.
[2185.54 → 2186.64] Twitch chat's freaking out.
[2186.74 → 2187.36] They want it on,
[2187.38 → 2188.78] they want it on tech quickie.
[2188.88 → 2189.64] It's so short
[2189.64 → 2190.44] because these would be like
[2190.44 → 2190.88] They're like patented.
[2191.24 → 2191.92] 30 second.
[2193.18 → 2194.04] These would be like
[2194.04 → 2195.38] 30-second videos.
[2195.54 → 2195.92] Yeah,
[2196.08 → 2196.44] I don't know.
[2196.50 → 2197.24] We need to trademark
[2197.24 → 2198.74] the name React.
[2199.94 → 2200.38] React?
[2200.58 → 2200.86] Oh,
[2200.86 → 2201.24] Lord.
[2201.54 → 2202.34] Maybe we could trademark
[2202.34 → 2204.22] the name 30-second videos.
[2204.22 → 2205.96] And then if anyone
[2205.96 → 2206.62] makes a video
[2206.62 → 2207.58] that's 30 seconds long
[2207.58 → 2208.56] we can just crush them.
[2208.66 → 2209.14] Ba-bow.
[2212.02 → 2212.64] Turbo tech.
[2212.74 → 2213.64] That's not a bad name for it.
[2213.66 → 2213.68] Yeah,
[2213.68 → 2214.30] turbo tech.
[2215.24 → 2215.58] Hmm.
[2218.54 → 2218.90] Whoa,
[2219.10 → 2219.94] slow down there,
[2220.00 → 2220.28] turbo.
[2221.76 → 2222.68] I don't know.
[2222.74 → 2223.44] Twitch chat's like
[2223.44 → 2224.10] flipping out.
[2224.20 → 2224.64] They love this.
[2224.64 → 2226.44] I'm just soaking in
[2226.44 → 2227.70] the Twitch chat experience
[2227.70 → 2228.08] right now.
[2228.10 → 2228.38] But yeah,
[2228.42 → 2229.36] do you remember that conversation?
[2229.46 → 2229.96] We talked about it
[2229.96 → 2230.40] with the OnePlus.
[2230.52 → 2231.90] I actually do
[2231.90 → 2232.90] vaguely remember it
[2232.90 → 2234.38] but I had completely forgotten.
[2234.44 → 2235.62] I had like a script
[2235.62 → 2236.58] for the OnePlus One
[2236.58 → 2237.96] done at that point in time.
[2238.14 → 2239.08] I don't remember
[2239.08 → 2240.00] where it ended up going.
[2240.48 → 2240.50] But
[2240.50 → 2242.92] it was like
[2242.92 → 2243.60] you can do it
[2243.60 → 2245.28] for so many things.
[2248.36 → 2249.08] Oh man,
[2249.20 → 2250.24] any modern motherboard.
[2255.14 → 2256.02] Here's all the ports
[2256.02 → 2256.42] it has.
[2256.60 → 2256.90] Enjoy.
[2256.90 → 2259.26] By the way,
[2259.30 → 2259.72] if you want to put
[2259.72 → 2260.78] your old CPU on it,
[2261.22 → 2262.40] get crapped on it.
[2262.40 → 2262.48] Yeah,
[2262.48 → 2264.40] CPUs.
[2266.20 → 2267.18] More cores.
[2267.44 → 2268.56] They're slightly faster.
[2269.32 → 2270.58] It consumes less power.
[2271.32 → 2271.62] Enjoy.
[2272.76 → 2273.60] You can just,
[2273.92 → 2274.54] and then like,
[2274.78 → 2275.32] you could just
[2275.32 → 2276.54] copy and paste videos.
[2277.50 → 2278.16] So like,
[2278.24 → 2278.58] don't,
[2278.64 → 2280.98] don't say the product name
[2280.98 → 2281.46] in the video.
[2281.66 → 2282.62] And then if like,
[2282.62 → 2284.70] if the content
[2284.70 → 2285.18] of the review
[2285.18 → 2285.94] would be the same,
[2286.32 → 2287.72] you just put a different
[2287.72 → 2288.30] title on it
[2288.30 → 2289.10] and re-upload it.
[2290.74 → 2291.38] So like,
[2291.50 → 2292.50] every CPU coolant
[2292.50 → 2293.26] that comes out.
[2296.16 → 2296.94] Heat pipes,
[2297.04 → 2297.32] check.
[2297.48 → 2298.10] Aluminum fins,
[2298.26 → 2298.54] check.
[2298.80 → 2299.72] Flat bottom surface,
[2299.86 → 2300.04] check.
[2300.10 → 2300.76] Comes with a fan,
[2300.88 → 2301.24] check.
[2302.24 → 2302.52] Performance,
[2302.90 → 2303.46] pretty good.
[2304.66 → 2305.16] And then,
[2305.24 → 2305.36] okay,
[2305.48 → 2306.40] that could be the difference
[2306.40 → 2306.96] for every video.
[2307.36 → 2308.00] There would just be,
[2308.18 → 2308.50] performance,
[2308.64 → 2308.98] pretty good.
[2309.02 → 2309.66] And there's a graph
[2309.66 → 2310.08] while you say,
[2310.14 → 2310.40] performance,
[2310.54 → 2310.82] pretty good.
[2310.82 → 2311.56] And it just slots it
[2311.56 → 2312.14] wherever it goes,
[2312.38 → 2312.94] which is going to be like,
[2313.04 → 2314.10] exactly where the ones
[2314.10 → 2315.16] in the same form factor go.
[2315.28 → 2316.00] And then you're done.
[2317.64 → 2318.80] Not the worst idea
[2318.80 → 2319.54] I've ever heard.
[2319.66 → 2319.92] I mean,
[2320.04 → 2320.46] okay,
[2320.52 → 2321.96] we're going to get so far away
[2321.96 → 2323.08] from like advertiser friendly
[2323.08 → 2324.62] and it's completely the opposite
[2324.62 → 2325.66] of what YouTube wants.
[2325.68 → 2325.74] Yeah.
[2325.74 → 2326.36] We're going to get killed
[2326.36 → 2327.20] on watch time.
[2327.36 → 2327.48] Oh,
[2327.56 → 2327.94] destroyed.
[2328.04 → 2329.20] I think we're going to get killed
[2329.20 → 2330.42] on like comments
[2330.42 → 2331.30] because like,
[2331.34 → 2332.42] we're going to have to,
[2332.50 → 2332.62] like,
[2332.66 → 2333.32] that's the thing
[2333.32 → 2335.10] is we're going to have to get
[2335.10 → 2336.04] down and dirty
[2336.04 → 2338.06] with like fanboy arguments.
[2338.24 → 2338.62] Yeah.
[2338.62 → 2339.42] Like if we're going to try
[2339.42 → 2340.58] and summarize an AMD
[2340.58 → 2342.14] or an NVIDIA graphics card,
[2342.22 → 2343.02] we're going to have to be like,
[2343.68 → 2344.36] runs hot,
[2344.50 → 2345.10] is loud,
[2345.52 → 2346.22] worse drivers.
[2348.60 → 2349.90] I love that you didn't say
[2349.90 → 2350.62] what brand there.
[2350.78 → 2351.00] No,
[2351.12 → 2352.32] that's because it switches
[2352.32 → 2353.66] generation by generation.
[2353.82 → 2353.92] It does.
[2354.20 → 2354.50] But no,
[2354.60 → 2355.22] but okay,
[2355.22 → 2355.96] the reason why I said that
[2355.96 → 2357.34] is because the copy and paste video
[2357.34 → 2358.24] thing that I was talking about
[2358.24 → 2359.58] because you could just use that
[2359.58 → 2360.30] for like a bunch
[2360.30 → 2360.96] of different cards.
[2366.18 → 2367.60] I like it way too much.
[2367.74 → 2368.04] Oh man.
[2368.04 → 2368.30] I just,
[2368.42 → 2369.20] it does have a
[2369.34 → 2370.36] it has a lot of problems.
[2370.46 → 2370.94] And the thing is,
[2371.20 → 2372.34] people don't even want that.
[2372.72 → 2374.08] People want words.
[2374.52 → 2374.84] Yep.
[2375.00 → 2375.80] Even if they're
[2375.80 → 2377.36] pretty close to unnecessary,
[2377.36 → 2378.32] they want words.
[2378.32 → 2379.54] And sometimes the words
[2379.54 → 2380.48] are about pacing
[2380.48 → 2381.52] and they're about absorbing
[2381.52 → 2382.50] what you're looking at.
[2382.58 → 2383.82] And adding impact
[2383.82 → 2384.90] to a certain part
[2384.90 → 2385.50] of the video
[2385.50 → 2386.96] or like specifically
[2386.96 → 2387.92] what you're saying
[2387.92 → 2388.88] or whatever else.
[2388.96 → 2390.02] Like I have intentionally
[2390.02 → 2391.06] over the years
[2391.06 → 2392.16] on Linus Tech Tips
[2392.16 → 2393.52] and on Tech Quickie
[2393.52 → 2394.78] increased the length
[2394.78 → 2395.32] of the videos
[2395.32 → 2396.54] to add more depth
[2396.54 → 2397.94] and more analysis
[2397.94 → 2399.90] and more history.
[2400.62 → 2401.42] I had a benchmark
[2401.42 → 2402.98] for text length
[2402.98 → 2404.38] for videos before.
[2404.38 → 2404.74] Yep.
[2405.06 → 2406.34] And I think I got it from you
[2406.34 → 2408.34] and it was a page and a half
[2408.34 → 2409.52] including your intro
[2409.52 → 2410.44] and all the extra stuff
[2410.44 → 2411.66] that's on our script templates.
[2412.26 → 2413.88] And now that's way too short.
[2414.30 → 2414.58] Yep.
[2414.58 → 2417.06] It has to be two pages
[2417.06 → 2417.58] if not more.
[2417.62 → 2419.20] And the audience expects.
[2419.42 → 2420.84] They expect like a seven
[2420.84 → 2421.78] to eight-minute video
[2421.78 → 2422.52] and they expect us
[2422.52 → 2423.46] to say something meaningful
[2423.46 → 2424.12] in that time.
[2424.54 → 2425.72] So maybe this would just be
[2425.72 → 2426.50] a way to let off steam.
[2426.76 → 2427.02] Yeah.
[2427.18 → 2428.46] Be like this thing sucks.
[2428.62 → 2429.66] It costs too much.
[2429.86 → 2430.46] Don't buy it.
[2434.42 → 2435.52] That would be awesome.
[2436.80 → 2437.94] This can transition us
[2437.94 → 2438.82] into our next topic.
[2438.90 → 2439.10] Yeah.
[2439.20 → 2439.96] What's our next topic?
[2440.10 → 2441.46] Oh, let's do our ad spots.
[2441.60 → 2442.16] Oh, perfect.
[2442.66 → 2444.02] Dollar Shave Club!
[2444.58 → 2447.48] Let's see if I can hold this note
[2447.48 → 2448.80] until I bring up my talking points.
[2448.88 → 2450.00] It doesn't cost too much.
[2450.30 → 2451.14] It's pretty awesome.
[2451.38 → 2452.64] You don't have to go to the store.
[2452.98 → 2454.08] They're delivered to your house.
[2454.54 → 2456.16] The quality of the product is good.
[2456.38 → 2457.78] They have more than just razors.
[2458.46 → 2460.00] And if you sign up now,
[2460.18 → 2461.82] you will get the executive blade
[2461.82 → 2464.52] on promo for a bit
[2464.52 → 2466.74] until maybe the promo is gone.
[2466.84 → 2467.16] Crap.
[2467.46 → 2469.00] You can get it in the US, Australia, Canada.
[2469.00 → 2469.78] You'll get a free month
[2469.78 → 2470.72] of the executive razor.
[2470.84 → 2472.44] US, Australia, you just said that.
[2473.22 → 2474.24] But I have to say Canada
[2474.24 → 2475.80] because it's like the most important one.
[2476.00 → 2477.22] So we can't say the other ones twice
[2477.22 → 2477.80] and not Canada.
[2478.10 → 2478.34] Okay.
[2479.58 → 2482.96] And dollarshaveclub.com slash minus.
[2484.28 → 2486.10] Now, I think we actually do guarantee
[2486.10 → 2488.32] our sponsors a certain amount of airtime,
[2488.40 → 2489.78] and I'm pretty sure that wasn't it.
[2489.98 → 2490.76] Butt wipes for men!
[2490.88 → 2492.36] But we usually go over it.
[2492.54 → 2493.74] So like, does it work that way?
[2493.74 → 2496.40] Can you bank it?
[2496.92 → 2499.02] Like, could we just do from now on?
[2499.08 → 2500.74] Because we usually do like double or triple
[2500.74 → 2502.34] because we just go off on these tangents
[2502.34 → 2503.18] during our sponsor reads.
[2503.18 → 2503.66] Like this one?
[2504.30 → 2505.20] Exactly like this one.
[2505.24 → 2506.70] Okay, so maybe this will be the last one,
[2506.76 → 2508.22] the last tangential sponsor read.
[2508.74 → 2510.50] So could be just kind of go,
[2510.60 → 2511.68] okay, Dollar Shave,
[2512.02 → 2513.06] you guys are going to pay us
[2513.06 → 2514.44] the same rate that you've always paid us,
[2514.46 → 2515.24] but from now on,
[2515.50 → 2517.10] we're just going to like flash it up there
[2517.10 → 2517.60] for a second.
[2517.74 → 2518.02] We're going to be like,
[2518.08 → 2518.68] Dollar Shave Club.
[2519.10 → 2519.76] You guys know the drill.
[2519.90 → 2520.06] Boom.
[2520.36 → 2520.96] Back to the show.
[2520.96 → 2523.96] Would they just stop writing checks?
[2524.12 → 2524.44] Probably.
[2524.54 → 2525.56] Is that how that would work?
[2525.58 → 2525.98] I think so.
[2526.06 → 2526.66] Yeah, I think so too.
[2526.72 → 2526.96] All right.
[2527.32 → 2528.72] Speaking of not writing checks
[2528.72 → 2529.96] to Linus Tech Tips anymore,
[2530.66 → 2532.30] Squarespace still writes checks.
[2532.66 → 2534.48] So they've got 24-7 support
[2534.48 → 2535.30] via live chat and email.
[2535.42 → 2536.30] It's only eight bucks a month
[2536.30 → 2536.92] and you get a free domain
[2536.92 → 2537.68] if you buy it for a year.
[2537.82 → 2539.60] All their templates feature responsive design,
[2539.64 → 2541.50] meaning they look great on any device.
[2541.68 → 2542.46] They come with commerce.
[2542.56 → 2543.66] They come with a bunch of other cool tools,
[2543.74 → 2545.42] including their logo designer,
[2545.56 → 2548.28] as well as the build a one-page website
[2548.28 → 2549.98] because you want to be that guy.
[2550.96 → 2553.06] I don't approve of those websites,
[2553.18 → 2553.82] but with Squarespace,
[2554.10 → 2555.08] you can build them
[2555.08 → 2555.96] and you can build them...
[2556.96 → 2557.52] Beautiful.
[2557.72 → 2558.82] Yes, you can!
[2559.84 → 2561.00] See, that's still loud
[2561.00 → 2562.54] because we didn't say it as a slogan.
[2562.60 → 2563.92] Yeah, we said build them beautiful.
[2564.00 → 2564.16] Yeah.
[2564.26 → 2565.02] Your websites.
[2565.34 → 2565.56] Yep.
[2565.64 → 2566.32] Not Squarespace.
[2566.64 → 2566.84] Yep.
[2567.88 → 2568.40] We did it.
[2568.40 → 2570.28] Your websites with Squarespace.
[2570.82 → 2572.22] You could build them beautiful.
[2572.22 → 2572.84] But they will be beautiful.
[2572.92 → 2574.62] And you could have so many websites
[2574.62 → 2577.42] because each of them only costs $8 a month.
[2577.42 → 2579.10] You should have so many websites.
[2579.18 → 2582.64] You should have so many websites that...
[2582.64 → 2583.76] Because holding domains
[2583.76 → 2585.98] and using the domains can be beneficial to you.
[2585.98 → 2588.16] I mean, it's a simple, powerful, beautiful concept, really.
[2588.28 → 2588.46] Yeah.
[2590.16 → 2591.02] I love this.
[2591.08 → 2592.04] This is making me happy.
[2592.24 → 2593.68] I was so crushed
[2593.68 → 2595.94] when they said we shouldn't do their slogans anymore.
[2596.18 → 2597.22] Yeah, but we just don't care.
[2597.32 → 2598.56] And then their new slogan is
[2598.56 → 2599.36] set your website apart.
[2599.40 → 2600.32] That's not bad.
[2600.58 → 2600.84] No.
[2600.92 → 2601.66] That's pretty good.
[2601.74 → 2603.00] No, but we're not supposed to say it.
[2603.32 → 2604.32] We're not supposed to say it?
[2604.32 → 2606.06] I thought we're not supposed to say any slogans anymore.
[2606.06 → 2606.54] I don't know.
[2606.62 → 2607.20] I hate Nick.
[2609.06 → 2610.04] I don't hate Nick.
[2610.38 → 2611.58] Well, I hate him telling me
[2611.58 → 2612.86] that I can't do my sponsor reads
[2612.86 → 2613.72] the way I want to do them.
[2613.94 → 2614.96] Okay, well, that's...
[2614.96 → 2615.88] Actually, I don't hate him.
[2616.30 → 2617.76] It's more amusing than anything else
[2617.76 → 2619.02] because I'm just going to ignore him anyway.
[2619.32 → 2619.60] Oh.
[2619.94 → 2621.38] There's really nothing to hate about it
[2621.38 → 2622.94] other than, like, just...
[2622.94 → 2623.50] But then didn't he...
[2623.50 → 2624.62] You told me he came on the show
[2624.62 → 2625.60] and then just screwed around
[2625.60 → 2626.64] doing the sponsor spots anyway.
[2626.64 → 2626.90] He did.
[2627.18 → 2628.02] So he's a hypocrite.
[2628.16 → 2628.40] Yeah.
[2628.68 → 2629.16] That's right.
[2629.32 → 2629.90] He's a hypocrite.
[2629.96 → 2631.18] I think I heard the door open up there
[2631.18 → 2632.62] and he was going to come down and yell at us.
[2632.62 → 2634.08] But he heard us talking about...
[2634.08 → 2635.04] He knows we're onto him.
[2635.40 → 2636.90] He knows we know he's a hypocrite.
[2637.74 → 2638.22] And that...
[2638.22 → 2639.98] Oh, I didn't go back to my Squarespace lower third.
[2640.06 → 2641.06] Yeah, this is technically still
[2641.06 → 2642.18] the Squarespace watcher spot.
[2643.04 → 2643.62] So, uh...
[2644.48 → 2645.88] Squarespace.
[2646.50 → 2646.94] Squarespace.
[2647.36 → 2648.26] Build your website.
[2648.64 → 2649.54] Make it look awesome.
[2649.84 → 2651.76] Use Squarespace and use offer code WAN
[2651.76 → 2652.66] to save 10%
[2652.66 → 2654.60] so you don't pay more than you have to.
[2654.64 → 2656.58] You know if we got the right sponsors
[2656.58 → 2657.60] on that channel,
[2658.12 → 2659.18] it could be great.
[2659.42 → 2660.30] Because if they were sponsors
[2660.30 → 2662.28] based on, like, saving time,
[2662.62 → 2664.50] like, honestly...
[2664.50 → 2665.68] FreshBooks could work.
[2665.74 → 2667.04] FreshBooks, Dollar Shave Club.
[2667.04 → 2667.06] Dollar Shave Club.
[2667.06 → 2667.08] Dollar Shave Club.
[2667.08 → 2667.30] Could work.
[2667.62 → 2670.54] Because if the sponsor spot for...
[2670.54 → 2670.90] Squarespace would even work.
[2670.90 → 2672.10] I think Squarespace would be on.
[2672.20 → 2672.36] Yeah.
[2672.46 → 2673.22] Because Squarespace is all about
[2673.22 → 2675.10] don't dick around, like, you know,
[2675.34 → 2676.42] doing all of this crap manually.
[2676.42 → 2677.00] Make it look good.
[2677.10 → 2677.48] Here it is.
[2677.52 → 2678.04] Here's a template.
[2678.20 → 2679.04] Slap some pictures in.
[2679.12 → 2679.68] Put in your text.
[2679.72 → 2680.24] It looks great.
[2680.42 → 2680.60] Yeah.
[2680.76 → 2682.28] Get about the rest of your day.
[2682.42 → 2683.18] You could go, like,
[2683.28 → 2685.36] yeah, this air cooler is just the same
[2685.36 → 2686.60] as all other air coolers
[2686.60 → 2687.40] in its form factor.
[2687.40 → 2688.74] It looks like this.
[2688.84 → 2690.22] It costs this much.
[2690.34 → 2691.90] It fits here on a performance graph,
[2691.98 → 2693.32] which is exactly where you expected it to go.
[2693.32 → 2694.24] You can buy it at Amazon.
[2694.50 → 2695.42] You can buy it at Amazon.
[2695.88 → 2697.02] And, by the way,
[2697.20 → 2698.24] if you hate wasting time,
[2698.30 → 2699.50] which is why you watch these videos,
[2699.82 → 2700.64] Chug go Dollar Shave Club,
[2700.72 → 2701.76] they deliver shavers to your door.
[2701.92 → 2702.14] Goodbye.
[2705.02 → 2705.64] Cooler review.
[2705.78 → 2706.18] Right there.
[2706.34 → 2706.78] Full video.
[2707.06 → 2707.60] Full video.
[2708.50 → 2709.36] Okay, there is...
[2709.36 → 2710.80] Editing time, 10 minutes.
[2710.96 → 2711.88] There is some work
[2711.88 → 2713.38] that has to go into the video, though.
[2713.46 → 2714.08] Yeah, because you...
[2714.08 → 2715.40] Like, we have to actually benchmark it.
[2715.40 → 2716.22] We need performance graphs.
[2716.22 → 2718.22] We need to validate that...
[2718.78 → 2720.20] If we're going to say it doesn't matter,
[2720.28 → 2721.22] we have to actually make sure
[2721.22 → 2721.68] it doesn't matter.
[2722.02 → 2723.42] And you could put the performance graphs there.
[2723.48 → 2725.04] Someone could make a magic heat sink.
[2725.38 → 2726.92] Although, if Noctua is to be believed,
[2727.04 → 2727.88] it's much more difficult
[2727.88 → 2728.54] than you would think.
[2728.76 → 2730.04] Did you ever watch my video
[2730.04 → 2730.76] from the Noctua booth?
[2730.90 → 2731.62] I did, actually.
[2731.76 → 2732.28] Oh, okay.
[2732.46 → 2733.72] Well, for those of you who didn't,
[2733.78 → 2735.02] so I'm not going to talk to you anymore.
[2735.10 → 2736.16] And I talked to them.
[2736.66 → 2736.88] Right.
[2737.22 → 2739.28] Okay, so my video from the Noctua booth
[2739.28 → 2739.90] was really cool
[2739.90 → 2742.32] because basically it was an explanation
[2742.32 → 2744.18] for why Noctua appears to have been
[2744.18 → 2745.40] completely sitting on their ass
[2745.40 → 2746.24] for the last three years.
[2746.44 → 2747.68] They haven't released a successor
[2747.68 → 2748.86] to the NHD 15,
[2748.94 → 2750.94] which took forever after the NHD 14
[2750.94 → 2752.10] and was just bigger anyway.
[2752.34 → 2753.58] They haven't released a successor
[2753.58 → 2754.78] to it in years.
[2755.32 → 2756.68] And the answer is that
[2756.68 → 2757.14] they were like,
[2757.44 → 2759.34] well, we tried all these things
[2759.34 → 2760.00] and they don't work.
[2760.00 → 2760.84] And they showed a lot of stuff.
[2760.96 → 2761.92] They tried a lot of things.
[2761.96 → 2763.10] And they tried a lot of stuff
[2763.10 → 2764.10] that other companies
[2764.10 → 2765.16] have released products
[2765.16 → 2766.74] claiming that it's like way better,
[2766.84 → 2767.36] but actually,
[2767.46 → 2768.72] when you actually put it on a CPU,
[2768.72 → 2769.64] it doesn't make a difference.
[2769.76 → 2770.02] And it's like,
[2770.08 → 2771.10] oh, I can't figure out
[2771.10 → 2772.74] why you're not seeing a difference.
[2772.78 → 2773.90] In our lab, we see a difference.
[2774.02 → 2775.08] Oh, don't come into our lab.
[2776.70 → 2777.48] Noctua was just like,
[2777.60 → 2778.56] yeah, we tried all that crap.
[2778.60 → 2779.00] It doesn't work.
[2779.24 → 2779.50] Sorry.
[2780.10 → 2780.96] Or they'd be like,
[2781.02 → 2783.20] yeah, it cost an astronomical amount
[2783.20 → 2784.06] more money to make
[2784.06 → 2786.00] and made like 0.2 of a difference.
[2786.04 → 2787.38] Yeah, they made an all copper one,
[2787.44 → 2787.88] for example.
[2787.98 → 2788.36] They're like,
[2788.98 → 2789.88] yeah, yeah,
[2789.94 → 2791.10] copper is more conductive.
[2791.46 → 2792.02] That's cool.
[2792.02 → 2792.42] Yeah.
[2792.42 → 2792.78] Yeah.
[2797.18 → 2798.62] That was fascinating, actually.
[2798.68 → 2798.90] It's like,
[2799.02 → 2800.24] super balls heavy
[2800.24 → 2802.90] and super-duper balls expensive.
[2803.76 → 2804.22] It's like,
[2804.24 → 2804.84] why don't we just make
[2804.84 → 2806.04] a bout of silver at that point?
[2806.20 → 2806.70] I mean,
[2806.90 → 2809.26] do you want a $900 heap sink?
[2810.24 → 2810.60] Gold.
[2810.68 → 2811.92] Because we could make it for you.
[2813.00 → 2814.54] Actually, gold would probably be terrible.
[2814.66 → 2815.20] It would droop.
[2815.36 → 2815.56] Oh, yeah.
[2815.64 → 2816.54] The gold would be awful.
[2816.62 → 2817.42] And it's not as conductive
[2817.42 → 2817.94] as silver anyway.
[2818.16 → 2818.36] Yeah.
[2818.70 → 2819.52] I've heard about that.
[2819.66 → 2819.84] Yep.
[2820.64 → 2821.00] Okay.
[2821.00 → 2822.76] All right.
[2822.86 → 2824.48] Let's stop beating around the bush.
[2824.94 → 2826.18] Apple's iPhone 7.
[2826.18 → 2826.74] Wait, wait, wait.
[2826.74 → 2827.34] I got it.
[2827.44 → 2827.78] Hold up.
[2828.52 → 2829.14] iPhone 7.
[2829.28 → 2829.88] Really expensive.
[2830.06 → 2830.84] No headphone jack.
[2830.90 → 2831.74] You can use an adapter.
[2831.88 → 2833.22] It's $40 and huge.
[2834.12 → 2834.84] Thanks for watching.
[2835.26 → 2835.98] This video was sponsored
[2835.98 → 2836.74] by Dollar Shave Club.
[2836.80 → 2837.68] If you hate wasting time,
[2837.76 → 2838.48] check out their razors.
[2838.58 → 2839.58] They ship directly to your door.
[2839.70 → 2840.30] Also, Squarespace
[2840.30 → 2841.30] lets you build a website.
[2841.46 → 2842.08] That's beautiful
[2842.08 → 2844.88] in like a very short period of time.
[2845.08 → 2845.62] For only $8 a month.
[2845.62 → 2846.40] Crap, I'm bad at this.
[2847.10 → 2848.16] I am just inherently
[2848.16 → 2849.18] a verbose person.
[2849.26 → 2849.94] I think that's why
[2849.94 → 2850.82] I needed a podcast.
[2850.82 → 2851.08] I'm not.
[2851.08 → 2852.22] That was like an hour long.
[2852.34 → 2853.04] I can headline
[2853.04 → 2854.66] the shit out of this channel, man.
[2854.78 → 2855.16] All right.
[2855.46 → 2857.28] So let's screen share with me
[2857.28 → 2858.50] the Verge's article.
[2858.60 → 2860.14] The 11 most important thing
[2860.14 → 2861.80] from Apple's iPhone 7 event.
[2861.86 → 2862.36] You didn't even get
[2862.36 → 2863.04] all 11 of them.
[2863.10 → 2863.56] You suck.
[2864.14 → 2864.50] What?
[2864.74 → 2865.16] All of it.
[2865.84 → 2866.36] Mind you,
[2866.40 → 2866.96] I think they have
[2866.96 → 2867.88] the Apple Watch 2
[2867.88 → 2869.22] as one of the most important things.
[2869.22 → 2869.92] Oh, God.
[2869.92 → 2871.74] I really don't think that
[2871.74 → 2872.80] I'm going to agree with you.
[2872.98 → 2873.18] Yeah.
[2873.18 → 2873.22] Yeah.
[2873.34 → 2873.62] No.
[2873.74 → 2873.92] No.
[2874.00 → 2874.54] Sorry, Verge.
[2874.56 → 2874.88] We're done.
[2874.96 → 2875.44] We're done here.
[2875.66 → 2875.84] Nice.
[2876.50 → 2878.98] Although, what I don't know yet.
[2879.34 → 2880.42] I can't believe they showed off
[2880.42 → 2881.44] a Pokémon Go app
[2881.44 → 2882.22] for the Apple Watch.
[2882.26 → 2883.38] That took up like a significant
[2883.38 → 2884.14] amount of time
[2884.14 → 2885.60] in the keynote.
[2885.60 → 2888.04] What I don't know
[2888.04 → 2888.84] about the Apple Watch
[2888.84 → 2889.80] is whether the screen
[2889.80 → 2890.70] is always on.
[2891.30 → 2893.00] I haven't actually seen
[2893.00 → 2894.02] that in anyone's summary
[2894.02 → 2895.18] and I haven't finished
[2895.18 → 2895.98] watching the event yet.
[2896.02 → 2897.02] I haven't watched that part.
[2897.66 → 2898.76] So maybe Twitch chat
[2898.76 → 2899.48] can let me know.
[2899.96 → 2901.64] Supposedly, it is twice as bright,
[2901.74 → 2902.44] which is wonderful,
[2902.58 → 2903.66] but I never asked for that.
[2903.72 → 2904.48] What I asked for
[2904.48 → 2905.26] was to be able to tell
[2905.26 → 2906.40] the freaking time
[2906.40 → 2906.60] when I look at it.
[2906.60 → 2907.06] Was the brightness
[2907.06 → 2907.86] a problem at all?
[2907.96 → 2908.98] No, it wasn't.
[2909.04 → 2909.46] Yeah, I didn't think so.
[2909.46 → 2910.42] The problem was that
[2910.42 → 2911.24] it isn't on.
[2912.22 → 2912.98] And a lot of people
[2912.98 → 2914.56] have criticized me over this.
[2914.62 → 2915.02] They've been like,
[2915.02 → 2915.98] Linus, you don't get it.
[2916.32 → 2917.28] My Apple Watch
[2917.28 → 2918.32] lasts all day.
[2918.82 → 2919.18] I'm like,
[2919.32 → 2920.66] good for you.
[2920.88 → 2921.66] Not the point.
[2921.74 → 2922.40] Not the point.
[2923.28 → 2924.70] I want to be able
[2924.70 → 2925.98] to tell what time it is
[2925.98 → 2926.72] when I'm sitting,
[2927.42 → 2928.82] having an awkward conversation
[2928.82 → 2930.30] and I'm trying to figure out
[2930.30 → 2931.78] when I need to
[2931.78 → 2932.98] dismiss myself from this
[2932.98 → 2933.60] so that I can be
[2933.60 → 2934.32] somewhere on time.
[2934.76 → 2935.92] And that doesn't work
[2935.92 → 2937.14] when I have to go like this.
[2940.44 → 2941.26] I mean, that should be
[2941.26 → 2941.78] like a dance.
[2941.86 → 2942.32] Do the watch.
[2943.44 → 2944.34] Do the watch.
[2945.02 → 2946.52] Do this specific gesture
[2946.52 → 2948.16] if you want to know the time.
[2948.70 → 2949.32] Do the watch.
[2950.28 → 2951.10] Do the watch.
[2953.74 → 2954.42] That's going to be
[2954.42 → 2955.00] a gift to hell.
[2955.12 → 2955.90] Oh, I know, right?
[2956.32 → 2957.28] There's nothing we can do
[2957.28 → 2957.60] about that.
[2957.60 → 2957.82] Okay.
[2958.16 → 2958.96] What if we do them
[2958.96 → 2960.36] as supplementary reviews?
[2961.98 → 2962.78] So for every video
[2962.78 → 2963.20] that goes online...
[2963.20 → 2963.36] Okay, but let's take
[2963.36 → 2964.60] this conversation offline.
[2964.80 → 2966.30] Okay, Apple iPhone 7.
[2966.72 → 2968.44] Same display as the 6S.
[2968.62 → 2970.24] They say it's 25% brighter.
[2970.56 → 2970.76] Cool.
[2970.94 → 2971.60] Same resolution,
[2971.60 → 2972.80] which I don't personally
[2972.80 → 2973.28] care about.
[2973.38 → 2974.28] I'd just as soon
[2974.28 → 2975.18] save the battery life
[2975.18 → 2976.50] and have a lower resolution display
[2976.50 → 2977.92] as long as I can't tell
[2977.92 → 2978.80] that it's lower resolution,
[2978.94 → 2979.46] which quite frankly,
[2979.54 → 2980.04] I cannot.
[2980.82 → 2981.84] The home button
[2981.84 → 2983.04] now has no physical click.
[2983.16 → 2984.28] This is a big one for me.
[2984.40 → 2985.52] This is something that
[2985.52 → 2987.46] if the phone
[2987.46 → 2988.54] didn't have other
[2988.54 → 2990.16] crippling problems with it,
[2990.40 → 2991.64] could convince me
[2991.64 → 2992.40] that an iPhone
[2992.40 → 2993.76] is a more worthwhile
[2993.76 → 2994.48] purchase now
[2994.48 → 2995.66] than it was yesterday.
[2996.78 → 2998.00] Just because the physical click
[2998.00 → 2998.58] is breakable?
[2998.58 → 2999.76] Because it's breakable
[2999.76 → 3001.04] and because it does break.
[3001.44 → 3002.76] Because it breaks frequently.
[3003.00 → 3004.22] If it didn't really break,
[3004.60 → 3005.34] then it would be fine.
[3005.44 → 3006.44] But I've heard so many people
[3006.44 → 3007.26] that have to replace buttons,
[3007.40 → 3008.00] including you, right?
[3008.00 → 3009.22] Yeah, and there are other issues.
[3009.32 → 3010.00] Like for a while,
[3010.06 → 3011.14] Apple wasn't allowing people
[3011.14 → 3012.28] to retain Touch ID
[3012.28 → 3013.22] if they replace the button
[3013.22 → 3013.50] themselves,
[3013.56 → 3014.66] which is ridiculous.
[3015.20 → 3015.84] I think they've addressed
[3015.84 → 3016.30] that now.
[3016.44 → 3017.68] But the point is,
[3017.80 → 3018.88] now it's haptic feedback,
[3019.02 → 3020.00] so it feels like a click,
[3020.08 → 3020.66] but it's not.
[3020.74 → 3021.22] And if it works
[3021.22 → 3022.32] anywhere near as well
[3022.32 → 3023.38] as the MacBook 2015,
[3023.74 → 3024.64] it'll be awesome
[3024.64 → 3025.44] and I will love it.
[3026.52 → 3027.10] Okay, yeah.
[3027.12 → 3027.62] It was really impressive.
[3027.62 → 3028.72] Their haptic feedback engine
[3028.72 → 3029.78] is like very good.
[3029.92 → 3030.38] Very good.
[3030.50 → 3030.68] Okay.
[3031.06 → 3032.12] It's water-resistant.
[3032.44 → 3033.12] They're calling it out
[3033.12 → 3033.88] as IP67
[3033.88 → 3035.46] and there have been scandals.
[3035.56 → 3036.64] So the S7 Active
[3036.64 → 3039.52] was found with,
[3039.58 → 3040.70] I think it was two samples,
[3040.92 → 3041.86] the Consumer Reports
[3041.86 → 3042.32] or something like that.
[3042.32 → 3042.54] Anyway,
[3042.98 → 3044.34] it was found to not necessarily
[3044.34 → 3045.82] be all that water-resistant.
[3046.36 → 3047.74] If Apple's claiming it,
[3047.92 → 3048.70] what I will say
[3048.70 → 3049.44] is its probably
[3049.44 → 3050.24] pretty darn good.
[3050.44 → 3052.12] And I talked about this
[3052.12 → 3052.68] and this is going to be
[3052.68 → 3053.42] really embarrassing
[3053.42 → 3054.98] because I did a review
[3054.98 → 3059.44] of the Odyssey Sign headphones,
[3059.62 → 3060.58] a lightning headphone.
[3061.40 → 3063.12] And it got bumped
[3063.12 → 3065.22] because of packs.
[3065.62 → 3067.08] So the release to YouTube
[3067.08 → 3068.52] is a two-week window
[3068.52 → 3069.78] instead of a one-week window.
[3069.98 → 3071.14] And I speculate
[3071.14 → 3073.08] about the new iPhone 7,
[3073.52 → 3074.40] if that's what
[3074.40 → 3075.20] they're going to call it.
[3075.40 → 3076.80] And then I speculate
[3076.80 → 3078.54] that if the objective
[3078.54 → 3080.48] was to increase
[3080.48 → 3081.18] water resistance,
[3081.28 → 3082.04] like if they're going to give me
[3082.04 → 3083.72] some meaningful benefit
[3083.72 → 3085.08] out of taking away
[3085.08 → 3086.08] my headphone jack,
[3086.24 → 3088.00] then that will probably be it
[3088.00 → 3089.20] because I could see Apple.
[3089.28 → 3090.04] Now they've eliminated
[3090.04 → 3091.16] the home button,
[3091.46 → 3092.72] which is very difficult
[3092.72 → 3093.84] to Ingress protect.
[3094.42 → 3095.50] They have eliminated
[3095.50 → 3096.42] the headphone jack,
[3096.48 → 3097.20] which is difficult
[3097.20 → 3098.04] to Ingress protect.
[3098.58 → 3100.24] So if the objective here
[3100.24 → 3102.30] was not only to,
[3102.40 → 3102.90] you know,
[3103.58 → 3105.34] make the phone slightly slimmer,
[3105.42 → 3106.30] which I don't care about,
[3106.36 → 3107.14] but if it was to give me
[3107.14 → 3108.10] a meaningful upgrade
[3108.10 → 3109.04] in some other way,
[3109.20 → 3110.22] I would be a lot more
[3110.22 → 3110.88] receptive to it.
[3110.88 → 3111.94] And it looks like that is indeed
[3111.94 → 3112.60] what they did,
[3112.66 → 3113.26] although that video
[3113.26 → 3114.28] will still be kind of embarrassing.
[3115.38 → 3116.58] So Apple's ear pods
[3116.58 → 3117.52] will now connect
[3117.52 → 3119.74] through the Lightning Connect report.
[3119.92 → 3121.72] There are no headphones,
[3121.92 → 3123.34] there is no headphone jack
[3123.34 → 3123.70] on the bottom.
[3123.70 → 3124.68] Quick thing that I want to add
[3124.68 → 3125.90] about your Ingress protection thing.
[3125.94 → 3126.10] Yeah.
[3126.30 → 3127.58] This phone is,
[3127.70 → 3128.56] I don't remember what it is.
[3128.94 → 3129.98] IP67, if I recall correctly.
[3129.98 → 3130.40] IP67, okay.
[3130.40 → 3130.66] Yep, same.
[3130.84 → 3131.96] I don't believe that I've
[3131.96 → 3132.84] taken it out of spec.
[3133.96 → 3134.96] It has problems.
[3135.64 → 3136.02] There you go.
[3136.04 → 3137.16] That are very probably
[3137.16 → 3138.02] because of water.
[3138.14 → 3138.98] On the other hand,
[3138.98 → 3140.80] the Galaxy S7 has been
[3140.80 → 3141.70] the best performing
[3141.70 → 3142.80] water-resistant device
[3142.80 → 3143.68] that I've yet seen,
[3144.06 → 3144.50] surviving,
[3144.62 → 3146.50] I think we went 20 feet down.
[3146.60 → 3147.06] That's intense.
[3147.06 → 3147.72] Before it died,
[3147.84 → 3148.98] or 20 or 30 feet down
[3148.98 → 3149.66] in salt water
[3149.66 → 3150.70] before it managed to die.
[3150.86 → 3152.10] So this audio jack
[3152.10 → 3154.10] is horrible.
[3154.36 → 3154.46] Yeah.
[3154.62 → 3156.00] So basically the point is,
[3156.14 → 3157.32] there's a lot of variability,
[3157.72 → 3158.38] and if Apple
[3158.38 → 3160.38] has been quietly working
[3160.38 → 3160.98] on improving
[3160.98 → 3161.76] the water resistance
[3161.76 → 3162.88] of their devices over time,
[3162.90 → 3163.44] which we know,
[3163.64 → 3163.78] Yeah.
[3163.78 → 3165.94] and they've basically
[3165.94 → 3166.34] determined,
[3166.48 → 3166.58] okay,
[3166.66 → 3167.50] well for us to put
[3167.50 → 3168.80] IP67 on something,
[3169.06 → 3170.06] we need to eliminate
[3170.06 → 3170.66] these ports,
[3171.40 → 3171.98] and they were just
[3171.98 → 3172.38] kind of waiting
[3172.38 → 3172.98] for the right moment
[3172.98 → 3173.50] to do it,
[3173.54 → 3174.24] because it's not like
[3174.24 → 3175.54] water-resistant competitors
[3175.54 → 3176.02] haven't been out
[3176.02 → 3176.98] for quite a while now.
[3177.54 → 3178.44] Maybe they kind of went,
[3178.54 → 3178.78] okay,
[3179.18 → 3179.44] you know,
[3179.56 → 3180.12] you have to be,
[3180.20 → 3180.48] what is it,
[3180.48 → 3181.26] you have to have the courage
[3181.26 → 3182.14] to move forward
[3182.14 → 3183.72] with a thing that
[3183.72 → 3183.98] no one wants.
[3183.98 → 3184.54] Something like that.
[3184.66 → 3185.12] But okay,
[3185.32 → 3186.34] my counterargument
[3186.34 → 3187.16] to that a little bit,
[3187.24 → 3187.80] I said I was going to
[3187.80 → 3188.54] devil's advocate you,
[3188.66 → 3189.78] but not yet.
[3189.78 → 3192.46] Why not just have two?
[3194.30 → 3196.18] Go dually USB type C's.
[3198.46 → 3198.82] Yeah,
[3199.00 → 3199.28] I mean,
[3199.34 → 3200.10] that's an interesting,
[3200.14 → 3201.10] You even have one that like,
[3201.86 → 3203.08] this one charges faster,
[3203.16 → 3203.62] by the way,
[3203.92 → 3204.46] or something.
[3204.92 → 3205.86] You can plug it into either,
[3205.98 → 3206.58] but like this one
[3206.58 → 3207.66] will charge your phone faster.
[3207.78 → 3208.80] Apple is,
[3208.98 → 3209.24] I mean,
[3209.24 → 3209.72] I think they're
[3209.72 → 3211.12] philosophically opposed to that.
[3211.52 → 3212.42] Like they've never put,
[3212.46 → 3212.56] yeah,
[3212.62 → 3213.48] they've never put an extra
[3213.48 → 3214.06] port on anything
[3214.06 → 3214.80] if they didn't have to.
[3215.68 → 3215.92] I mean,
[3215.92 → 3217.32] they even have a laptop
[3217.32 → 3218.48] computer that only has
[3218.48 → 3218.94] one port.
[3218.94 → 3220.46] And a headphone jack,
[3220.54 → 3220.70] though.
[3221.30 → 3221.62] Oh,
[3222.02 → 3222.58] right.
[3223.78 → 3224.42] Oh man.
[3224.50 → 3224.64] I mean,
[3224.66 → 3225.32] are we going to see
[3225.32 → 3226.24] Apple's laptop,
[3226.44 → 3227.48] like have they been waiting
[3227.48 → 3228.60] to refresh their laptops
[3228.60 → 3229.50] so they can put
[3229.50 → 3230.46] lightning connectors on them?
[3231.54 → 3231.90] Interesting.
[3232.60 → 3233.22] There's a thought.
[3234.46 → 3234.82] So,
[3235.12 → 3235.46] I mean,
[3235.50 → 3236.22] the summary is,
[3236.24 → 3237.40] and I actually do a better job
[3237.40 → 3238.40] of this in my
[3238.40 → 3239.40] Odyssey Sign review,
[3239.48 → 3240.42] and I'll talk about it some more
[3240.42 → 3241.66] when I review the iPhone 7,
[3241.74 → 3242.62] which I undoubtedly will.
[3243.22 → 3244.60] But the summary is,
[3244.80 → 3245.66] it's a mixed bag.
[3245.80 → 3246.50] You get a little bit of
[3246.50 → 3247.66] extra space inside the device
[3247.66 → 3248.40] that you can use for
[3248.40 → 3249.18] whatever it is that you
[3249.18 → 3250.58] determine you need to use it for.
[3250.80 → 3251.92] You lose compatibility
[3251.92 → 3254.60] with 99.999% of headphones
[3254.60 → 3255.62] on the planet
[3255.62 → 3257.82] without a goofy adapter
[3257.82 → 3258.60] that people will
[3258.60 → 3259.66] undoubtedly lose.
[3259.74 → 3259.84] Like,
[3259.88 → 3260.54] I was actually,
[3262.68 → 3264.08] so I have another device
[3264.08 → 3265.30] here in the studio,
[3265.44 → 3267.18] the Droid Z Force
[3267.18 → 3269.42] from Lenovo.
[3269.66 → 3271.94] The Motor Droid Z Force
[3271.94 → 3272.20] from,
[3272.36 → 3272.46] like,
[3272.46 → 3272.56] yeah,
[3272.62 → 3273.34] Lenovo acquired them.
[3273.34 → 3274.50] I think they're branding it Lenovo.
[3274.66 → 3274.84] Anyway,
[3274.90 → 3275.44] the point is,
[3275.86 → 3277.64] it only has a USB Type-C connector.
[3277.74 → 3279.04] It does not have a headphone jack,
[3279.12 → 3280.20] and I've used the adapter,
[3280.62 → 3281.96] and cleverly,
[3282.04 → 3283.20] they include this little rubber thing
[3283.20 → 3284.26] so that you can stick it
[3284.26 → 3285.30] to your headphones
[3285.30 → 3285.74] so it doesn't,
[3285.74 → 3285.88] like,
[3285.92 → 3286.84] come off and get lost.
[3286.84 → 3290.56] I think people are ultimately
[3290.56 → 3292.16] going to be salty about it.
[3292.32 → 3292.80] I'm salty about it.
[3292.80 → 3293.20] I would need,
[3293.20 → 3293.50] like,
[3293.58 → 3294.68] eight of those cables.
[3294.86 → 3295.88] I would prefer
[3295.88 → 3296.76] to just be able
[3296.76 → 3297.76] to plug in natively.
[3298.40 → 3300.06] I don't personally find
[3300.06 → 3301.34] that upgraded amps
[3301.34 → 3301.92] and Days
[3301.92 → 3303.34] make a huge difference
[3303.34 → 3303.64] for me
[3303.64 → 3304.72] with the kind of source material
[3304.72 → 3305.54] that I use
[3305.54 → 3306.22] and that quite,
[3306.50 → 3307.32] if we're all being honest
[3307.32 → 3307.80] with ourselves,
[3308.62 → 3309.68] none of you use either.
[3309.68 → 3312.80] so I never wanted this,
[3313.20 → 3314.32] but at the end of the day,
[3315.54 → 3315.88] oh,
[3316.14 → 3318.06] I think it's this cable.
[3322.02 → 3324.14] Did that change your mic?
[3324.50 → 3325.42] Did you fully unplug it?
[3325.54 → 3326.06] Oh, maybe.
[3326.40 → 3326.96] It's worth checking.
[3327.48 → 3327.88] Oh,
[3327.94 → 3328.68] for crying out loud.
[3328.98 → 3330.28] But at the end of the day,
[3330.38 → 3331.86] people are going to accept it.
[3331.96 → 3332.10] No,
[3332.16 → 3332.92] it's still fine.
[3333.74 → 3334.12] And,
[3334.20 → 3335.84] yeah,
[3335.90 → 3336.86] I think we're all going to move on.
[3337.46 → 3337.72] I mean,
[3337.82 → 3339.10] Apple is pushing
[3339.10 → 3341.22] their wireless ear pods.
[3341.36 → 3341.60] AirPods,
[3341.84 → 3342.52] is that what they're calling them?
[3342.54 → 3343.46] They look so ridiculous.
[3343.76 → 3343.92] Yeah,
[3344.02 → 3344.84] they have new,
[3344.86 → 3346.02] they have new
[3346.02 → 3347.94] wireless beats.
[3348.50 → 3349.62] The problem for me
[3349.62 → 3351.02] is that this introduces
[3351.02 → 3352.28] yet another
[3352.28 → 3352.92] freaking
[3352.92 → 3354.48] thing in my life
[3354.48 → 3355.46] that I have to charge every day.
[3356.70 → 3358.16] That's the very first thing
[3358.16 → 3358.62] I thought of
[3358.62 → 3359.04] when I saw that
[3359.04 → 3359.32] was like,
[3359.46 → 3359.66] wow,
[3359.72 → 3360.30] I don't want to charge
[3360.30 → 3360.76] my headphones.
[3361.00 → 3361.16] Now,
[3361.36 → 3362.28] Intel showed off
[3362.28 → 3363.10] a couple of years ago
[3363.10 → 3363.62] at CES,
[3363.76 → 3364.40] they showed off
[3364.40 → 3365.80] a wireless charging bull.
[3366.56 → 3367.58] The concept for which
[3367.58 → 3368.86] is awesome.
[3369.70 → 3369.90] Okay?
[3370.44 → 3370.84] That,
[3371.00 → 3371.80] I would be okay
[3371.80 → 3373.38] with wireless crap
[3373.38 → 3374.64] if all I had to do
[3374.64 → 3375.22] at the end of the day
[3375.22 → 3375.96] is like,
[3376.32 → 3377.22] shed your watch,
[3377.50 → 3378.80] drop your earphones in,
[3378.88 → 3379.80] drop your phone in.
[3379.98 → 3380.76] I get up in the morning
[3380.76 → 3382.20] and everything is wirelessly charged.
[3382.36 → 3383.06] It's slow charges
[3383.06 → 3384.30] so my battery doesn't heat up
[3384.30 → 3385.08] and I work like,
[3385.60 → 3386.42] it's awesome
[3386.42 → 3387.12] and it's amazing.
[3387.82 → 3388.94] That would be great.
[3389.78 → 3390.82] And maybe that's the future
[3390.82 → 3391.46] we're heading towards
[3391.46 → 3392.46] and maybe you have to take
[3392.46 → 3393.02] these steps
[3393.02 → 3393.80] in order to
[3393.80 → 3395.28] get enough mass appeal
[3395.28 → 3396.58] for these wireless devices
[3396.58 → 3397.90] that you can get
[3397.90 → 3398.86] the economies of scale
[3398.86 → 3399.88] that are associated with
[3399.88 → 3400.74] shrinking the batteries
[3400.74 → 3402.30] and shrinking the electronics
[3402.30 → 3403.80] and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3403.82 → 3404.72] Maybe we're heading towards that
[3404.72 → 3406.52] but it is a very frustrating
[3406.52 → 3407.20] stepping stone
[3407.20 → 3408.40] and I personally
[3408.40 → 3409.72] would still use
[3409.72 → 3411.00] my iPhone 6S
[3411.00 → 3411.98] although I'm saying this
[3411.98 → 3413.12] without having used the 7.
[3413.32 → 3414.36] They say the camera's amazing.
[3414.82 → 3416.58] I probably will still use
[3416.58 → 3417.50] my iPhone 6S
[3417.50 → 3418.36] if I need to use
[3418.36 → 3419.10] an iOS device.
[3419.66 → 3419.98] There.
[3420.78 → 3421.68] That's my two cents.
[3421.68 → 3423.08] I'm not going to buy
[3423.08 → 3424.58] a full gamut
[3424.58 → 3426.50] of new headphone things
[3426.50 → 3427.64] because I use
[3427.64 → 3428.62] full headphones
[3428.62 → 3429.22] and earbuds
[3429.22 → 3429.88] with my phone.
[3430.56 → 3431.00] So
[3431.00 → 3433.04] that's not going to happen.
[3433.16 → 3434.44] But I wanted
[3434.44 → 3436.00] again,
[3436.10 → 3436.50] I'm going to need
[3436.50 → 3437.36] a million of them
[3437.36 → 3438.72] and like
[3438.72 → 3439.90] they're probably not cheap.
[3440.44 → 3441.44] I don't remember
[3441.44 → 3442.34] how much they cost
[3442.34 → 3442.88] but I'm sure
[3442.88 → 3444.08] we'll see cheaper ones
[3444.08 → 3444.76] after the fact.
[3445.22 → 3446.12] Someone said
[3446.12 → 3446.80] 40 bucks
[3446.80 → 3447.64] in the Twitch chat
[3447.64 → 3448.18] but I don't think
[3448.18 → 3448.64] that's right.
[3448.88 → 3450.60] I think 40 bucks
[3450.60 → 3451.00] wasn't that
[3451.00 → 3451.64] for the Belching
[3451.64 → 3453.22] USB-C
[3453.22 → 3454.30] to dual USB-C?
[3455.04 → 3455.68] That I'm not sure.
[3455.70 → 3456.32] Have you seen that?
[3457.26 → 3457.82] So Belching
[3457.82 → 3458.86] has an adapter already
[3458.86 → 3460.20] or not USB-C
[3460.20 → 3460.60] deep
[3460.60 → 3460.96] lightning
[3460.96 → 3464.12] that just splits it
[3464.12 → 3464.76] but it's like
[3464.76 → 3465.64] on a short little cable
[3465.64 → 3467.06] and then it's a huge box
[3467.06 → 3467.96] so that you'd be able
[3467.96 → 3468.50] to plug in
[3468.50 → 3469.48] a headphone
[3469.48 → 3470.28] and microphone thing.
[3470.92 → 3471.50] There you go.
[3472.04 → 3472.68] Oh Lord.
[3472.86 → 3473.40] But it also
[3473.40 → 3474.78] doesn't break to 3.5.
[3478.64 → 3479.62] And that's $40.
[3480.28 → 3480.44] Yeah.
[3480.44 → 3481.60] And that's to address
[3481.60 → 3482.40] the other issue.
[3482.52 → 3483.26] I mean I haven't even
[3483.26 → 3484.00] talked about that
[3484.00 → 3484.78] now you can't charge
[3484.78 → 3485.30] your phone and use
[3485.30 → 3486.22] headphones at the same time
[3486.22 → 3486.76] unless you're using
[3486.76 → 3487.30] wireless headphones.
[3487.30 → 3488.16] That's a big problem
[3488.16 → 3488.54] for me.
[3488.60 → 3489.90] Which is a huge problem
[3489.90 → 3491.52] for any mobile gamer.
[3491.66 → 3492.86] I mean Apple's
[3492.86 → 3493.56] keynote.
[3494.90 → 3495.66] Blah blah blah.
[3495.80 → 3496.50] We are the biggest
[3496.50 → 3498.24] mobile gaming platform.
[3498.40 → 3499.18] Blah blah blah blah.
[3499.28 → 3499.92] You can only game
[3499.92 → 3500.68] for a few hours
[3500.68 → 3501.22] on an iPhone
[3501.22 → 3502.40] before it runs out of battery.
[3502.50 → 3503.22] Ha ha ha ha.
[3503.58 → 3504.22] Good luck listening
[3504.22 → 3504.90] to your headphones
[3504.90 → 3506.48] so you don't have to be
[3506.48 → 3507.80] that jerk on the bus
[3507.80 → 3508.76] that's got fucking
[3508.76 → 3510.40] Clash of Clans.
[3511.12 → 3511.86] I said freaking
[3511.86 → 3512.34] by the way.
[3512.50 → 3513.38] That sort of slipped out
[3513.38 → 3513.92] kind of funny.
[3514.12 → 3514.42] Whoop.
[3514.84 → 3516.04] I don't swear on this show.
[3516.40 → 3516.96] Kids at home
[3516.96 → 3518.64] don't repeat what you heard here.
[3518.64 → 3519.64] Ha ha ha.
[3520.08 → 3520.54] I mean
[3520.54 → 3520.96] you know
[3520.96 → 3521.70] Clash of Clans
[3521.70 → 3522.28] on the bus
[3522.28 → 3523.68] making everyone around you
[3523.68 → 3524.26] mad.
[3524.42 → 3524.60] Yeah.
[3524.60 → 3525.66] That's super ridiculous.
[3526.44 → 3526.84] And like
[3526.84 → 3528.10] obviously you can just
[3528.10 → 3528.70] mute it or whatever
[3528.70 → 3529.44] but that's lame.
[3529.68 → 3530.00] Yeah.
[3530.08 → 3530.76] That's stupid.
[3531.22 → 3531.94] Why would you
[3531.94 → 3532.88] degrade the experience?
[3533.02 → 3533.16] No.
[3533.28 → 3533.96] A new device
[3533.96 → 3534.56] should never
[3534.56 → 3536.14] degrade the experience.
[3536.16 → 3536.86] What I'm expecting
[3536.86 → 3537.42] is that
[3537.42 → 3538.06] I kind of think
[3538.06 → 3538.64] someone's going to
[3538.64 → 3539.26] come out with
[3539.26 → 3540.86] a case
[3540.86 → 3542.64] that has
[3542.64 → 3543.30] extra ports
[3543.30 → 3543.82] built in.
[3544.02 → 3544.56] I'm not kidding.
[3544.66 → 3545.00] So you're just
[3545.00 → 3545.56] going to have to buy
[3545.56 → 3546.52] a bigger phone
[3546.52 → 3546.92] essentially.
[3547.18 → 3547.94] Our new device
[3547.94 → 3548.56] is magical.
[3548.76 → 3549.40] It's revolutionary.
[3549.76 → 3550.42] It's three times
[3550.42 → 3550.76] as big
[3550.76 → 3551.50] with all the stupid
[3551.50 → 3552.02] adapters
[3552.02 → 3552.44] that you have
[3552.44 → 3553.18] bolted onto it.
[3553.18 → 3553.88] But like
[3553.88 → 3555.36] having it slimline
[3555.36 → 3555.90] in a case
[3555.90 → 3556.96] as slim as it can get
[3556.96 → 3558.58] and just making
[3558.58 → 3559.38] your phone taller
[3559.38 → 3559.92] essentially
[3559.92 → 3561.48] is probably
[3561.48 → 3562.38] the most elegant
[3562.38 → 3562.98] solution that they're
[3562.98 → 3563.52] going to be able to do.
[3563.68 → 3564.42] So the case will
[3564.42 → 3565.22] plug into the bottom
[3565.22 → 3565.76] of your phone.
[3565.86 → 3566.30] That's like saying
[3566.30 → 3567.14] the most elegant way
[3567.14 → 3567.82] to put a tutu
[3567.82 → 3568.96] on a hippo.
[3569.10 → 3569.24] Yeah.
[3569.68 → 3570.44] Well there is
[3570.44 → 3571.40] a most elegant way
[3571.40 → 3572.06] to put a tutu
[3572.06 → 3572.38] on a hippo.
[3572.40 → 3572.90] There is.
[3572.94 → 3573.52] I'm sure there is.
[3573.52 → 3574.26] But who cares?
[3574.52 → 3574.88] Yeah.
[3575.28 → 3576.14] I would be more
[3576.14 → 3576.84] interested in this though.
[3576.92 → 3577.46] I would rather
[3577.46 → 3578.20] use the phone
[3578.20 → 3578.82] if it
[3578.82 → 3580.36] got to a split out
[3580.36 → 3580.74] box
[3580.74 → 3581.58] in an external
[3581.58 → 3582.26] case thing
[3582.26 → 3583.20] and that went
[3583.20 → 3583.68] into like
[3583.68 → 3584.60] dual USB
[3584.60 → 3586.04] or why do I keep
[3586.04 → 3586.46] saying USB?
[3586.62 → 3587.10] Dual lightning
[3587.10 → 3587.58] and like
[3587.58 → 3588.28] and a 3.5.
[3588.28 → 3589.22] It is technically USB.
[3589.72 → 3590.80] That would be wicked.
[3592.30 → 3592.82] Alright.
[3593.16 → 3593.34] Dual lightning
[3593.34 → 3594.08] and a 3.5
[3594.08 → 3594.82] I would be very happy.
[3594.96 → 3596.22] So there is a new camera.
[3596.70 → 3597.72] Larger aperture
[3597.72 → 3598.46] optical image
[3598.46 → 3599.10] stabilization.
[3599.52 → 3600.14] The iPhone 7
[3600.14 → 3600.92] actually gets
[3600.92 → 3601.90] an additional
[3601.90 → 3602.56] telephoto lens
[3602.56 → 3602.96] on the back
[3602.96 → 3603.44] that works like
[3603.44 → 3603.88] a built-in
[3603.88 → 3604.70] zoom feature.
[3605.54 → 3606.76] Longer battery life.
[3607.38 → 3607.98] Like apparently
[3607.98 → 3608.88] very substantially.
[3608.88 → 3609.96] they haven't specified
[3609.96 → 3610.74] the capacity yet.
[3610.84 → 3611.32] I guess we'll just
[3611.32 → 3611.64] have to wait
[3611.64 → 3612.20] for the fixity
[3612.20 → 3612.54] teardown.
[3612.66 → 3613.00] I don't know
[3613.00 → 3613.94] why they're so
[3613.94 → 3614.90] like teeheehee
[3614.90 → 3615.78] about all this stuff.
[3615.86 → 3616.26] We're going to figure
[3616.26 → 3616.76] it out eventually
[3616.76 → 3617.22] anyway.
[3617.80 → 3618.84] The front facing camera
[3618.84 → 3620.06] is now 7 megapixels
[3620.06 → 3620.86] and includes
[3620.86 → 3621.54] auto image
[3621.54 → 3621.98] stabilization
[3621.98 → 3623.40] which is not
[3623.40 → 3623.88] the same as
[3623.88 → 3624.52] optical image
[3624.52 → 3624.90] stabilization
[3624.90 → 3626.14] so we'll find out
[3626.14 → 3626.84] exactly what that
[3626.84 → 3627.04] means.
[3627.10 → 3627.36] And they have
[3627.36 → 3628.18] finally done away
[3628.18 → 3629.26] with the 16 gig
[3629.26 → 3630.00] capacity and they
[3630.00 → 3630.76] have a glossy
[3630.76 → 3631.56] jet black
[3631.56 → 3632.10] that will look
[3632.10 → 3633.18] great in photos
[3633.18 → 3634.38] and will validate
[3634.38 → 3635.46] once and for all
[3635.46 → 3637.26] why Luke and I
[3637.26 → 3637.66] have to spend
[3637.66 → 3638.26] so much time
[3638.26 → 3638.82] being angry
[3638.82 → 3639.50] at manufacturers
[3639.50 → 3640.06] for making
[3640.06 → 3641.02] glossy black
[3641.02 → 3642.26] things and it
[3642.26 → 3643.04] will be because
[3643.04 → 3644.14] the iPhone 7
[3644.14 → 3644.84] will sell better
[3644.84 → 3645.34] in that colour
[3645.34 → 3646.20] than anything else
[3646.20 → 3646.92] because Apple
[3646.92 → 3647.54] made it more
[3647.54 → 3648.54] exclusive by making
[3648.54 → 3649.10] it only available
[3649.10 → 3649.46] in the higher
[3649.46 → 3650.74] capacities so people
[3650.74 → 3651.08] are going to want
[3651.08 → 3651.76] to show off that
[3651.76 → 3652.26] they have a ball
[3652.26 → 3652.70] in one they're
[3652.70 → 3653.06] going to get a
[3653.06 → 3653.76] glossy jet black
[3653.76 → 3655.08] one, and we are
[3655.08 → 3655.54] going to have to
[3655.54 → 3656.34] continue to be mad
[3656.34 → 3657.22] that our wireless
[3657.22 → 3658.54] routers are glossy
[3658.54 → 3659.80] black plastic and
[3659.80 → 3660.70] look stupid after
[3660.70 → 3661.66] four seconds because
[3661.66 → 3662.34] you have the audacity
[3662.34 → 3662.90] to plug a cable
[3662.90 → 3663.28] into them.
[3664.14 → 3665.48] Or just let dust
[3665.48 → 3666.22] sit on them.
[3666.56 → 3667.00] That too.
[3667.00 → 3668.10] glossy things just
[3668.10 → 3669.16] look terrible unless
[3669.16 → 3670.10] you literally just
[3670.10 → 3670.52] cleaned it.
[3671.68 → 3672.78] So we asked on
[3672.78 → 3674.10] Twitter if people
[3674.10 → 3674.92] wanted to suggest
[3674.92 → 3675.68] what we should talk
[3675.68 → 3676.50] about on WAN Show
[3676.50 → 3677.60] about the iPhone 7.
[3677.98 → 3679.00] I completely forgot
[3679.00 → 3680.32] to look at this
[3680.32 → 3681.22] but I'm pretty sure
[3681.22 → 3681.82] that we talked
[3681.82 → 3683.08] about most of them.
[3685.46 → 3685.90] Yeah.
[3686.48 → 3687.22] One of the things
[3687.22 → 3687.70] that I really don't
[3687.70 → 3688.16] like about the
[3688.16 → 3689.26] wireless ear pods is
[3689.26 → 3689.86] that they look like
[3689.86 → 3690.22] earrings.
[3691.46 → 3692.32] Have you seen that?
[3694.30 → 3695.26] Yeah, yeah, I saw
[3695.26 → 3695.42] them.
[3695.64 → 3696.16] I think they look
[3696.16 → 3696.58] ridiculous.
[3696.58 → 3697.10] They do.
[3697.50 → 3697.70] Yeah.
[3698.24 → 3699.10] Like most wireless
[3699.10 → 3699.80] headphones, they just
[3699.80 → 3700.42] wrap around.
[3700.58 → 3701.04] They're going to turn
[3701.04 → 3701.74] into a status symbol.
[3702.18 → 3702.48] They're going to be
[3702.48 → 3703.02] like the original
[3703.02 → 3704.14] white ear pods.
[3704.78 → 3705.26] Or no, they weren't
[3705.26 → 3705.80] called ear pods.
[3705.90 → 3706.32] Whatever, I don't
[3706.32 → 3706.52] care.
[3707.08 → 3708.08] White earphones.
[3709.22 → 3710.54] I don't know, man.
[3710.90 → 3711.44] We'll see.
[3711.78 → 3712.48] We will see.
[3712.60 → 3712.90] We'll see.
[3713.02 → 3714.08] Some celebrity is
[3714.08 → 3714.70] going to wear them.
[3715.72 → 3716.12] Yeah.
[3716.32 → 3716.50] Yeah.
[3716.64 → 3717.30] But then you look
[3717.30 → 3718.06] at like Bluetooth
[3718.06 → 3718.72] things.
[3720.12 → 3720.44] Yeah.
[3720.48 → 3721.30] Those always kind
[3721.30 → 3721.80] of made you look
[3721.80 → 3722.42] sort of like a douche.
[3722.42 → 3722.92] Yeah, they make you
[3722.92 → 3723.52] look like a douche.
[3723.88 → 3724.72] And these will make
[3724.72 → 3725.58] you look like a douche
[3725.58 → 3726.58] unless you're like,
[3727.00 → 3727.36] cool.
[3727.86 → 3728.54] And then they will
[3728.54 → 3729.54] make you look like a
[3729.54 → 3731.34] douche or whatever.
[3733.54 → 3734.36] Oh, man.
[3735.60 → 3737.00] Most people really just
[3737.00 → 3738.18] asked for the headphone
[3738.18 → 3738.74] jack removal
[3738.74 → 3739.30] controversy.
[3740.24 → 3740.52] So.
[3741.24 → 3741.68] Yeah.
[3741.98 → 3742.40] Yeah.
[3742.68 → 3743.20] That was fairly
[3743.20 → 3743.60] obvious.
[3744.72 → 3745.90] Robert Preston says,
[3745.96 → 3746.70] I'm an easy man to
[3746.70 → 3747.08] make happy.
[3747.14 → 3747.70] I want a phone that
[3747.70 → 3748.30] makes calls and
[3748.30 → 3748.88] doesn't explode.
[3748.88 → 3750.26] Yep.
[3750.54 → 3751.04] I like that.
[3751.36 → 3751.94] you have to shop
[3751.94 → 3752.58] fairly carefully
[3752.58 → 3753.10] these days.
[3753.88 → 3755.18] Not exploding is an
[3755.18 → 3755.94] exclusive feature.
[3756.72 → 3757.32] All right.
[3757.54 → 3757.82] So, yeah.
[3758.40 → 3759.30] Talk about waterproof.
[3759.52 → 3759.74] Talk about.
[3759.86 → 3760.04] OK.
[3760.14 → 3761.36] So our summary notes
[3761.36 → 3761.76] were fine.
[3762.08 → 3762.36] Excellent.
[3762.56 → 3762.66] Good.
[3762.66 → 3763.18] I'm happy with the
[3763.18 → 3764.08] waterproof improvements.
[3764.26 → 3764.84] It's expensive,
[3764.96 → 3765.34] by the way.
[3765.60 → 3766.18] I've been a big.
[3766.50 → 3768.02] I've been a big.
[3768.22 → 3768.58] Wow.
[3769.00 → 3769.90] I've been a big.
[3770.00 → 3770.94] You don't bing anything.
[3771.62 → 3771.84] No.
[3772.40 → 3772.82] I just.
[3772.96 → 3773.84] It got caught in my
[3773.84 → 3775.06] nasal because I'm sick
[3775.06 → 3775.42] right now.
[3775.48 → 3775.82] All right.
[3775.82 → 3777.52] The watch 2 is here.
[3778.86 → 3779.26] Hooray.
[3780.14 → 3780.66] You're going to
[3780.66 → 3781.04] review it?
[3781.52 → 3782.34] I probably will.
[3782.58 → 3783.32] I'll probably end up
[3783.32 → 3784.04] just saying I think
[3784.04 → 3784.70] it's stupid again.
[3785.18 → 3785.74] Starts at three.
[3786.06 → 3786.50] Excuse me.
[3786.56 → 3787.62] $370 US dollars.
[3787.74 → 3788.34] Has GPS.
[3789.14 → 3789.76] Boasts a brighter
[3789.76 → 3790.26] display.
[3790.40 → 3790.96] So basically they
[3790.96 → 3791.52] addressed everything
[3791.52 → 3792.08] that I don't care
[3792.08 → 3792.30] about.
[3792.40 → 3793.02] It's like more
[3793.02 → 3793.82] waterproof now.
[3793.98 → 3794.34] I don't know how
[3794.34 → 3795.14] many people's Apple
[3795.14 → 3796.10] watches are dying in
[3796.10 → 3796.40] the water.
[3797.12 → 3799.14] MSRP for a GTX 1070.
[3801.48 → 3801.88] Yeah.
[3802.10 → 3803.12] Not that you can buy
[3803.12 → 3804.06] them at that price.
[3804.06 → 3804.08] You can get a better
[3804.08 → 3805.80] video card than you
[3805.82 → 3806.84] probably have if you
[3806.84 → 3807.42] didn't buy an Apple
[3807.42 → 3807.70] watch.
[3807.88 → 3808.44] I have a rant on
[3808.44 → 3808.80] that coming.
[3809.00 → 3809.78] There's a new Mario
[3809.78 → 3810.56] game for iOS.
[3810.80 → 3811.38] The original article
[3811.38 → 3812.46] here is from Kodak.
[3812.72 → 3813.34] Coming on Android
[3813.34 → 3813.66] later.
[3814.18 → 3814.32] Yep.
[3815.84 → 3816.70] So there you go.
[3816.86 → 3817.92] Mario is on a phone
[3817.92 → 3819.62] which is exciting
[3819.62 → 3820.76] because if you wanted
[3820.76 → 3821.56] to play Mario on your
[3821.56 → 3822.46] phone then that will
[3822.46 → 3822.92] excite you.
[3823.56 → 3823.82] I do.
[3823.82 → 3824.18] I mean it will be
[3824.18 → 3824.94] nice to have better
[3824.94 → 3826.40] quality platformers on
[3826.40 → 3826.72] mobile.
[3826.94 → 3827.48] So that's cool.
[3827.74 → 3827.88] Yep.
[3828.06 → 3828.66] It will offer three
[3828.66 → 3829.32] distinct modes.
[3829.46 → 3830.02] So there's challenge
[3830.02 → 3831.02] courses to complete.
[3831.22 → 3832.20] There's second mode
[3832.20 → 3833.00] which is challenging
[3833.00 → 3834.00] play data of other
[3834.00 → 3834.60] people's courses.
[3834.60 → 3835.20] and then you can
[3835.20 → 3835.76] create your own
[3835.76 → 3836.32] Mushroom Kingdom
[3836.32 → 3837.34] using coins collected
[3837.34 → 3838.46] by playing the first
[3838.46 → 3838.92] two modes.
[3839.42 → 3840.52] One thing that drives
[3840.52 → 3841.92] me insane about this.
[3842.02 → 3842.92] Where's the actual
[3842.92 → 3843.38] topic?
[3845.62 → 3847.02] It'll be free to
[3847.02 → 3848.82] download with a set
[3848.82 → 3849.68] purchase price.
[3849.68 → 3850.16] What?
[3850.16 → 3852.74] What does that even
[3852.74 → 3853.18] mean?
[3853.52 → 3854.88] And that's not like a
[3854.88 → 3856.04] weird quote that
[3856.04 → 3856.52] Colton did.
[3856.74 → 3858.20] That's exactly the
[3858.20 → 3858.48] quote.
[3860.18 → 3861.30] In quotations.
[3861.50 → 3862.12] That's what the guy
[3862.12 → 3862.42] said.
[3864.06 → 3865.96] So like I don't know
[3865.96 → 3867.52] because I read
[3867.52 → 3869.32] it'll be free to
[3869.32 → 3870.24] download but with a set
[3870.24 → 3871.04] purchase price and was
[3871.04 → 3872.22] like wow Colton way to
[3872.22 → 3872.50] go.
[3872.96 → 3873.58] Clicked through and was
[3873.58 → 3875.42] like oh actually yes.
[3875.90 → 3876.80] Good job Colton.
[3877.40 → 3878.64] More literally this time.
[3878.64 → 3881.32] What does that even
[3881.32 → 3881.62] mean?
[3881.94 → 3882.34] Okay.
[3882.80 → 3884.12] You claim to see this
[3884.12 → 3884.42] coming.
[3884.68 → 3885.28] I did not.
[3885.64 → 3885.78] Really?
[3886.10 → 3886.42] Hit me.
[3886.54 → 3887.36] VR adoption among
[3887.36 → 3888.56] Steam users has crashed
[3888.56 → 3888.96] to a halt.
[3889.08 → 3889.92] Original article here is
[3889.92 → 3890.64] from VentureBeat.
[3891.40 → 3893.06] VR is an extremely
[3893.06 → 3895.24] difficult thing to
[3895.24 → 3897.66] properly explain the
[3897.66 → 3899.40] experience and feeling
[3899.40 → 3900.98] of without having the
[3900.98 → 3901.88] person actually do it.
[3901.98 → 3903.94] Apparently it means it
[3903.94 → 3904.58] is not free.
[3904.74 → 3905.14] You pay.
[3905.14 → 3905.76] There are no
[3905.76 → 3906.50] microtransactions.
[3909.00 → 3910.08] You can download it
[3910.08 → 3910.84] for free, but you have
[3910.84 → 3911.90] to pay to unlock it.
[3912.94 → 3914.12] That's super dumb.
[3914.54 → 3914.76] Yeah.
[3915.42 → 3916.74] So there you go.
[3917.00 → 3917.34] Okay.
[3917.64 → 3918.02] Sure.
[3918.42 → 3919.22] That's super dumb.
[3919.26 → 3919.38] Yeah.
[3919.42 → 3920.16] It was apparently a bad
[3920.16 → 3920.62] translation.
[3921.20 → 3921.60] Okay.
[3921.60 → 3921.68] Okay.
[3921.68 → 3922.20] That makes sense.
[3923.40 → 3923.88] Okay.
[3924.06 → 3924.62] So why?
[3924.84 → 3924.86] Yes.
[3924.86 → 3926.08] It's extremely it's
[3926.08 → 3927.68] it's hard to translate
[3927.68 → 3928.36] because it's an
[3928.36 → 3928.96] experience.
[3928.96 → 3930.74] It's like some it's
[3930.74 → 3931.60] like telling someone
[3931.60 → 3934.26] that a roller coaster
[3934.26 → 3935.48] was cool who's never
[3935.48 → 3936.42] been on a roller coaster
[3936.42 → 3937.26] or anything that moves
[3937.26 → 3938.54] quickly or inflicted
[3938.54 → 3939.36] g-force on them at all
[3939.36 → 3939.66] before.
[3940.52 → 3941.00] Yeah.
[3941.02 → 3941.62] You go around the
[3941.62 → 3942.20] corner, and it like
[3942.20 → 3943.62] pulls your body and
[3943.62 → 3944.88] stuff and the person's
[3944.88 → 3946.52] like what?
[3947.26 → 3948.12] Like it doesn't it
[3948.12 → 3949.00] doesn't translate very
[3949.00 → 3949.24] well.
[3949.38 → 3950.50] Every single person I've
[3950.50 → 3951.40] described VR to no
[3951.40 → 3952.46] matter how excited and
[3952.46 → 3954.56] how intricate I made the
[3954.56 → 3956.46] description once they
[3956.46 → 3958.08] try it completely
[3958.08 → 3959.12] different conversations.
[3960.06 → 3960.96] They're pretty deadpan
[3960.96 → 3961.66] and like yeah sure
[3961.66 → 3962.14] whatever dude.
[3962.22 → 3962.70] Then they try it
[3962.70 → 3964.04] they're like whoa I
[3964.04 → 3965.34] want one like every
[3965.34 → 3965.98] single time.
[3966.10 → 3967.98] So here is sort of
[3967.98 → 3969.40] where I didn't see
[3969.40 → 3970.74] this coming because I
[3970.74 → 3971.66] agree with everything
[3971.66 → 3972.30] you just said.
[3972.40 → 3972.62] Okay.
[3973.12 → 3975.62] But what I thought was
[3975.62 → 3979.10] that people would do
[3979.10 → 3979.46] that.
[3979.72 → 3980.42] People would show
[3980.42 → 3981.10] their friends and
[3981.10 → 3981.90] they'd be like whoa I
[3981.90 → 3982.38] want one.
[3982.70 → 3982.80] Yes.
[3982.80 → 3983.54] So what you're saying
[3983.54 → 3984.56] is that the people who
[3984.56 → 3985.76] play VR games don't have
[3985.76 → 3986.08] friends.
[3986.82 → 3987.28] Well there's a
[3987.28 → 3988.06] combination of things.
[3988.08 → 3990.80] that's possibly true.
[3990.92 → 3991.78] I mean I play VR.
[3992.02 → 3992.72] I don't have friends.
[3993.54 → 3994.70] That's possibly true to a
[3994.70 → 3995.10] certain degree.
[3995.58 → 3996.68] One thing that I was
[3996.68 → 3997.78] pushing for quite a while
[3997.78 → 3998.50] and you probably know
[3998.50 → 3999.42] this is that I wanted
[3999.42 → 4001.66] best buys and stuff like
[4001.66 → 4002.76] brick and mortar stores
[4002.76 → 4003.88] to start setting up.
[4004.26 → 4005.32] Yeah but not really yet.
[4005.32 → 4005.72] Yeah it takes time.
[4006.02 → 4006.16] Yep.
[4006.24 → 4007.26] And it's not really that
[4007.26 → 4007.74] great yet.
[4008.06 → 4009.32] And I've heard of a
[4009.32 → 4010.12] couple small brick and
[4010.12 → 4011.34] mortar stores having them
[4011.34 → 4012.72] with the Rift which is
[4012.72 → 4014.46] not the experience that I
[4014.46 → 4015.14] want people trying.
[4015.28 → 4015.52] Right.
[4015.52 → 4018.24] And the most popular
[4018.24 → 4019.66] VR experience right now
[4019.66 → 4021.20] is with the damn
[4021.20 → 4022.92] Gear VR.
[4024.18 → 4024.48] Ooh.
[4025.02 → 4025.92] The Gear VR is awful.
[4026.14 → 4026.64] Exactly.
[4027.06 → 4028.06] So people are getting
[4028.06 → 4029.42] this Gear VR for free
[4029.42 → 4030.60] throwing it on and then
[4030.60 → 4032.74] going why the heck
[4032.74 → 4034.66] censoring myself a little
[4034.66 → 4035.04] bit there.
[4035.28 → 4036.84] Would I ever spend all
[4036.84 → 4037.44] that money.
[4037.62 → 4038.76] A thousand dollars for
[4038.76 → 4039.60] like that but better.
[4039.80 → 4040.84] Because it isn't that but
[4040.84 → 4041.04] better.
[4041.16 → 4041.76] It's not that at all.
[4041.76 → 4043.20] Completely different
[4043.20 → 4044.30] categories of things.
[4044.38 → 4044.56] Right.
[4045.08 → 4045.84] But they're calling it
[4045.84 → 4046.90] the same thing and
[4046.90 → 4048.88] Samsung is all oh yeah
[4048.88 → 4049.66] and their radio
[4049.66 → 4050.46] advertisements are like
[4050.46 → 4051.62] oh yeah today I was
[4051.62 → 4052.40] running around with
[4052.40 → 4053.54] dinosaurs and then I
[4053.54 → 4054.36] was like fighting
[4054.36 → 4055.70] zombies and stuff and
[4055.70 → 4056.78] so they try to make it
[4056.78 → 4058.06] the same amount of
[4058.06 → 4058.82] exciting and they
[4058.82 → 4059.68] describe it in the
[4059.68 → 4061.12] exact same way that
[4061.12 → 4061.96] people are describing
[4061.96 → 4063.42] the high-end headsets
[4063.42 → 4064.88] then people are trying
[4064.88 → 4066.28] the Gear VR's and
[4066.28 → 4067.02] then going why the
[4067.02 → 4068.78] hell would I ever buy
[4068.78 → 4069.56] that nicer one.
[4069.56 → 4071.76] So people are not
[4071.76 → 4073.50] exposed to it in a
[4073.50 → 4074.88] direct hands-on way.
[4075.02 → 4075.12] Right.
[4075.46 → 4077.12] People are exposed to
[4077.12 → 4078.34] shitty versions of it
[4078.34 → 4079.58] in a direct hands-on
[4079.58 → 4079.86] way.
[4080.60 → 4082.16] And the community that
[4082.16 → 4083.56] has them is very
[4083.56 → 4084.56] small, and then they're
[4084.56 → 4085.16] really expensive.
[4085.60 → 4085.90] Right.
[4086.36 → 4088.58] And the well-informed
[4088.58 → 4089.98] community also knows
[4089.98 → 4091.26] that these are the
[4091.26 → 4091.84] first version.
[4092.60 → 4093.96] There's probably
[4093.96 → 4094.86] follow-up versions
[4094.86 → 4096.14] coming relatively
[4096.14 → 4097.10] quickly that will be
[4097.10 → 4098.12] considerably better and
[4098.12 → 4098.62] that's going to be
[4098.62 → 4099.38] happening for a while.
[4099.38 → 4099.68] Yeah.
[4099.86 → 4100.10] Okay.
[4100.12 → 4101.38] So like it's this
[4101.38 → 4102.90] huge I totally saw
[4102.90 → 4103.34] this coming.
[4104.88 → 4105.86] That's why that's a
[4105.86 → 4106.46] big reason why I was
[4106.46 → 4106.98] worried about even
[4106.98 → 4108.00] making the Rift review
[4108.00 → 4109.96] so late because I knew
[4109.96 → 4110.64] the hype train was
[4110.64 → 4111.98] already crashing so
[4111.98 → 4112.26] hard.
[4112.68 → 4113.26] All right.
[4113.30 → 4114.20] So basically the
[4114.20 → 4114.94] numbers are here.
[4115.12 → 4116.16] According to a survey
[4116.16 → 4117.12] of customers that use
[4117.12 → 4117.96] Steam conducted by
[4117.96 → 4121.16] Valve the number of
[4121.16 → 4122.76] new HTC Five owners
[4122.76 → 4124.06] on Steam only grew by
[4124.06 → 4125.90] 0.3% in July and
[4125.90 → 4127.10] remained flat in
[4127.10 → 4127.58] August.
[4127.58 → 4129.16] Oculus saw similar
[4129.16 → 4130.74] results of 0.3% in
[4130.74 → 4132.22] July and 0.1% in
[4132.22 → 4132.56] August.
[4132.90 → 4133.02] Yep.
[4133.56 → 4134.28] July and August are
[4134.28 → 4135.08] important because they
[4135.08 → 4135.90] are the first months
[4135.90 → 4137.26] where both HTC and
[4137.26 → 4138.76] Oculus are shipping
[4138.76 → 4140.06] orders when they
[4140.06 → 4140.72] receive them.
[4141.86 → 4142.38] Wow.
[4143.38 → 4144.34] That's tough eh?
[4144.80 → 4145.08] Yep.
[4146.58 → 4147.20] All right.
[4148.20 → 4148.64] Um.
[4148.86 → 4149.62] Let me just see if we've
[4149.62 → 4150.28] got anything else that's
[4150.28 → 4151.10] fascinating here.
[4151.10 → 4151.98] I would be interested in
[4151.98 → 4152.58] seeing some other
[4152.58 → 4153.58] statistics on that
[4153.58 → 4154.08] Steam thing.
[4154.36 → 4155.62] Like the percentage of
[4155.62 → 4157.16] computers that can
[4157.16 → 4158.42] actually perform
[4158.42 → 4160.28] properly with those
[4160.28 → 4161.06] VR headsets.
[4161.22 → 4162.22] How many of those
[4162.22 → 4162.96] people are buying
[4162.96 → 4163.44] headsets?
[4163.52 → 4163.70] Right.
[4163.90 → 4164.94] Because a huge amount
[4164.94 → 4165.64] of the Steam hardware
[4165.64 → 4168.24] survey is like not
[4168.24 → 4168.82] even necessarily
[4168.82 → 4170.16] dedicated GPU laptops.
[4170.26 → 4170.40] Yep.
[4170.46 → 4170.82] That's true.
[4171.08 → 4173.18] And like your mom's
[4173.18 → 4174.48] HP that was 300
[4174.48 → 4174.92] bucks.
[4175.26 → 4175.42] Yep.
[4175.42 → 4176.30] And stuff like that.
[4176.30 → 4177.34] So a lot of these
[4177.34 → 4178.72] things VR headsets
[4178.72 → 4179.90] aren't even remotely in
[4179.90 → 4181.34] the horizon for them.
[4181.78 → 4181.90] Yeah.
[4181.90 → 4182.78] And it doesn't apply.
[4183.04 → 4183.58] So the percentage
[4183.58 → 4184.90] sounds lower than it
[4184.90 → 4185.54] probably should.
[4186.52 → 4187.78] So this made me mad
[4187.78 → 4188.70] and then I got over it.
[4188.92 → 4189.72] Google Chrome to
[4189.72 → 4190.94] disallow backspace as
[4190.94 → 4191.52] the back button.
[4191.70 → 4192.38] See I'm going to press
[4192.38 → 4193.32] backspace, and it's not
[4193.32 → 4193.86] going to do anything.
[4194.00 → 4194.66] Mind you this is the
[4194.66 → 4195.58] first page I loaded in
[4195.58 → 4196.48] this tab so it probably
[4196.48 → 4196.90] wouldn't have done
[4196.90 → 4197.44] anything anyway.
[4197.84 → 4198.72] But I'll demonstrate
[4198.72 → 4199.06] again.
[4199.18 → 4199.58] I am pressing.
[4199.72 → 4199.88] See?
[4200.16 → 4200.86] Oh look at that.
[4201.14 → 4201.80] Alt left arrow?
[4201.80 → 4203.02] Press alt left arrow
[4203.02 → 4203.90] to go back.
[4204.70 → 4205.74] Press alt left arrow.
[4205.74 → 4206.36] All right.
[4206.42 → 4207.14] All right Chrome.
[4207.30 → 4207.84] There you go.
[4207.96 → 4208.96] So the idea is to keep
[4208.96 → 4209.78] people from losing all
[4209.78 → 4210.88] their work by accidentally
[4210.88 → 4212.08] trying to backspace
[4212.08 → 4212.76] something and then
[4212.76 → 4214.08] losing a web form.
[4214.52 → 4215.90] Which I personally don't
[4215.90 → 4216.46] really have a lot of
[4216.46 → 4217.18] difficulty with.
[4217.22 → 4217.78] Apparently this is
[4217.78 → 4218.20] ancient.
[4218.58 → 4219.56] And this is old?
[4220.66 → 4221.96] Not this VR thing.
[4222.36 → 4222.64] Oh.
[4223.04 → 4223.40] Chrome.
[4223.48 → 4224.14] Well whatever.
[4224.36 → 4224.72] I know.
[4224.82 → 4225.50] No they've been rolling
[4225.50 → 4226.02] it out slowly.
[4226.26 → 4226.64] Oh okay.
[4226.64 → 4227.60] It hit me this week.
[4227.64 → 4227.98] Oh okay.
[4228.06 → 4228.76] And I hadn't heard
[4228.76 → 4229.44] about it, and it made
[4229.44 → 4229.76] me mad.
[4229.98 → 4230.52] You use that?
[4230.66 → 4231.02] That's all.
[4231.22 → 4231.96] I use backspace?
[4232.22 → 4232.82] To go.
[4232.92 → 4233.04] Yeah.
[4233.14 → 4233.34] Yeah.
[4233.54 → 4233.90] I don't.
[4233.96 → 4234.36] All the time.
[4234.52 → 4234.88] I don't.
[4234.88 → 4235.28] Well.
[4235.94 → 4236.78] I just do it with my
[4236.78 → 4236.98] mouse.
[4237.10 → 4237.38] Whatever.
[4238.06 → 4238.94] Which will still work.
[4239.06 → 4240.02] I do it with both.
[4240.10 → 4241.02] Get rest.
[4241.10 → 4242.08] Sometimes I touch the
[4242.08 → 4242.86] little back button on
[4242.86 → 4243.42] the touch screen.
[4244.42 → 4244.64] Yeah.
[4244.80 → 4245.34] That's right.
[4245.48 → 4245.76] Whoa.
[4246.00 → 4246.28] Yeah.
[4246.80 → 4247.24] You're a.
[4247.62 → 4247.96] You're like a.
[4247.96 → 4248.68] I'm like a rebel.
[4248.72 → 4249.18] Triangle.
[4249.58 → 4249.86] Yeah.
[4251.14 → 4251.62] Um.
[4253.18 → 4253.46] Yeah.
[4253.54 → 4253.86] What?
[4254.36 → 4254.58] Yeah.
[4254.58 → 4255.30] No I kind of.
[4255.62 → 4256.56] Oh sure.
[4256.74 → 4257.06] All right.
[4257.56 → 4258.90] No I'll do it.
[4258.96 → 4259.52] I'll bite.
[4259.60 → 4260.50] I'll bite on this one.
[4260.50 → 4261.90] Okay.
[4262.40 → 4272.12] Turing phone cadenza will apparently feature dual Snapdragon 830s with a 60 megapixel quad
[4272.12 → 4274.30] rear camera triplet lens.
[4274.84 → 4276.24] Why would you have quad rear cameras?
[4276.46 → 4279.10] So IMAX 6K is the resolution they're calling that.
[4279.64 → 4284.54] Dual front cameras, 20 megapixels, 12 gigs of RAM, one terabyte of storage.
[4284.54 → 4287.78] Swordfish OS with deep learning AI.
[4287.90 → 4288.72] What is this?
[4289.50 → 4294.40] A 5.8 inch 1440 by 2560 display.
[4295.94 → 4299.52] So Turing Robotics has revealed plans for the future of the Turing phone.
[4300.28 → 4304.58] Should be a leading edge program to realize the next generation of mobile devices.
[4305.60 → 4308.66] One gigabit per second, 60 gigahertz, Y gig support.
[4308.76 → 4309.42] I mean what are they planning?
[4309.84 → 4312.22] Saying the phone will be released sometime in 2017.
[4312.50 → 4314.10] Quad NATO sim support.
[4314.10 → 4319.32] I mean this basically just sounds like someone going on PC parts picker and just like picking
[4319.32 → 4322.42] all the most expensive stuff that totally won't work together and just putting it in
[4322.42 → 4322.78] a cart.
[4325.20 → 4329.52] Graphene oxide composite body work with liquid metal 2.0 structural frame.
[4330.12 → 4332.42] It's only going to have a 2400 William power.
[4332.46 → 4335.40] Oh 2400 William power graphene super capacitor battery.
[4335.52 → 4341.06] So like basically like instant charging and a 1600 William power lithium hydrogen
[4341.06 → 4342.10] fuel cell.
[4342.10 → 4346.92] And it's hilarious because our next topic is Half-Life 3 confirmed.
[4347.32 → 4350.48] Which is almost like that phone is like Half-Life 3 confirmed.
[4350.78 → 4351.70] Why is this in here?
[4351.74 → 4352.20] What is this?
[4352.24 → 4353.88] We're almost at the back to the future date.
[4354.32 → 4356.48] We're even closer to the Star Wars tipping point.
[4356.58 → 4356.82] The what?
[4356.98 → 4360.52] On May 13th the Phantom Menace will have come out closer to Return of the Jedi than to the
[4360.52 → 4360.80] present.
[4360.80 → 4365.28] It's weird how I'm consistently surprised by the passage of time when it's literally the
[4365.28 → 4366.32] most predictable thing in the universe.
[4366.44 → 4370.78] You know a long time ago should have plus four more decades added into the re-releases.
[4372.12 → 4372.48] What?
[4372.48 → 4374.16] Oh hold on a second.
[4374.32 → 4374.98] Half-Life.
[4375.82 → 4377.36] Half-Life Episode 2.
[4378.34 → 4379.48] It's been that many days.
[4379.60 → 4380.90] September 10th 2016.
[4381.42 → 4382.28] So that's the...
[4382.28 → 4382.98] Oh I see.
[4383.30 → 4383.62] Okay.
[4384.02 → 4384.34] Wow.
[4384.44 → 4385.26] Has it really...
[4385.26 → 4385.78] Was it...
[4385.78 → 4386.70] Yeah it was 10 years.
[4386.82 → 4389.24] Has it really been 10 years since Half-Life Episode 2?
[4390.20 → 4391.72] Holy crap I feel old.
[4391.72 → 4392.80] And we're old.
[4392.80 → 4393.80] Wow.
[4394.68 → 4396.96] Speaking of VR things because someone lit the fire.
[4397.60 → 4402.30] Oculus Touch Controller price was leaked on MediaMarkt for 200 Euros.
[4403.70 → 4404.58] Oh cool.
[4404.72 → 4408.70] Which is probably going to be 200 US dollars as well because...
[4408.70 → 4409.62] Because...
[4409.62 → 4409.88] Ha!
[4410.16 → 4411.58] Take that Europeans.
[4411.86 → 4415.72] You're not an American so you get wrecked by pricing, apparently.
[4416.00 → 4416.26] Sorry.
[4416.58 → 4417.42] We're not Americans either.
[4417.68 → 4419.60] So before anyone forgets that point.
[4420.60 → 4422.78] We just like talking about Trump because...
[4422.80 → 4423.22] That's funny.
[4424.04 → 4427.82] And it really impacts us a lot because we live really close, and we're a tiny population.
[4428.04 → 4428.30] Yeah.
[4428.54 → 4430.10] I mean what if he makes us pay for a wall?
[4430.36 → 4431.90] That is like a really long border.
[4432.14 → 4432.58] It is.
[4433.10 → 4435.28] Alright, so thank you for tuning in to the WAN Show.
[4435.48 → 4436.48] We will see you again next week.
[4436.56 → 4437.34] Same bat time.
[4437.48 → 4438.58] Same bat channel.
[4438.76 → 4440.48] We could employ all the oil riggers that way.
[4441.80 → 4442.62] Could be good.
[4442.94 → 4445.26] What if you made the wall out of solar panels?
[4446.70 → 4448.26] And then it became a profit venture.
[4448.36 → 4450.08] We could export the power to the states.
[4450.08 → 4453.38] So you're saying solar freaking walls.
[4453.66 → 4453.86] Yeah.
[4454.30 → 4455.42] Solar freaking walls.
[4455.52 → 4456.26] Solar freaking walls.
[4456.50 → 4457.58] You're not allowed on this show.
[4460.20 → 4461.08] Solar freaking walls.
[4467.82 → 4469.64] Would the top of the wall be a road?
[4470.10 → 4473.22] Like if you travel along the border on the wall road?
[4473.36 → 4473.74] Road wall?
[4473.74 → 4475.36] Okay.
