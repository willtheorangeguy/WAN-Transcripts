• Question about server room storage capacity, answered by Dennis
• Samsung's PM1633A is a high-capacity solid-state drive (SSD) with a storage density of up to 15.36 terabytes.
• It uses a SAS interface and has random read IOPS of up to 200,000 and write IOPS of up to 32,000 per second.
• The drive is designed for applications that require high data storage density, frequent reading, and infrequent writing.
• Samsung is trying to set a new bar for the endurance of the drive, with a warranty of five years and a daily capacity of 15.36 terabytes without failure.
• The PM1633A is also hot-swappable, making it ideal for use in data centres where drive failures can be costly and time-consuming to replace.
