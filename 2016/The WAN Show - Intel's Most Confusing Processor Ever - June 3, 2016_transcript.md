[0.00 --> 8.58]  all right what's up what's up my friends welcome to the WAN show we've got a great show for you
[8.58 --> 14.70]  guys today lots of different topics I've got a brand new co-host here I just came in off the
[14.70 --> 22.08]  street no you look like you came in off the street you don't have like you know a look like I do no
[22.08 --> 29.76]  I am jealous actually I was hoping like do we have a wig or anything I came in like off the club that's
[29.76 --> 33.22]  that's where I came in off I'm gonna go see if there's anything I can wear all right in the
[33.22 --> 40.00]  meantime I'm gonna tell you guys what we've got for topics today uh Intel has unveiled Broadwell E
[40.00 --> 47.58]  their new flagship desktop processors that is to say HEDT or high-end desktop processors
[47.58 --> 56.14]  whoo that pricing AMD on the subject of maybe lower pricing has showed off their Polaris GPUs
[56.14 --> 64.18]  and actually did a reveal of a Zen CPU more on that later on we've got some information it's all
[64.18 --> 73.70]  rumors at this point about the one plus three launch and Samsung has a 512 gig SSD that's like
[73.70 --> 80.80]  this big looks like it is going to enable some seriously wow you look even worse than me uh some
[80.80 --> 90.44]  seriously small devices with a seriously large amount of storage so uh without further ado let's
[90.44 --> 97.12]  hope the intro works because I actually did not test it today yeah you did no I didn't listen to it
[97.12 --> 107.12]  also it seems to be taking a while to to load there let's see if it finds that file and uh goes ahead and
[107.12 --> 113.72]  plays it at some point that would be super duper swell come on you got this buddy you got this buddy
[113.72 --> 121.60]  buddy I need like a hair thing uh I'm gonna use a bunch of them
[121.60 --> 125.20]  addition
[137.52 --> 141.72]  uh
[141.72 --> 148.60]  Aaron terrifies us all.
[148.86 --> 150.34]  Oh man, this hair is awful.
[150.54 --> 152.34]  You can feel that it's cheap.
[152.76 --> 153.38]  Uh, yeah.
[153.98 --> 156.28]  I had to wear that for an entire WAN show.
[156.34 --> 157.28]  No one's forcing you.
[157.36 --> 158.54]  That's the key difference here.
[158.56 --> 159.02]  You know what?
[159.24 --> 161.88]  I want to be in the Linus Club.
[162.10 --> 162.86]  In the Linus Club.
[162.86 --> 163.84]  You are in the Linus Club.
[163.94 --> 165.12]  It's called Linus Media Group, yo.
[166.00 --> 166.86]  All right.
[167.10 --> 171.62]  So, uh, without further ado, why don't we just go ahead
[171.62 --> 173.60]  and get this party started?
[174.14 --> 177.78]  Let's kick it off with the big Intel news.
[177.98 --> 180.82]  So we can pick, well, we can pick any,
[180.94 --> 183.30]  any source we want for this particular,
[183.46 --> 184.08]  a little bit of news.
[184.16 --> 187.98]  Let's go ahead and drop the LTT forum link in here.
[187.98 --> 192.98]  So Intel has unveiled Broadwell E with complete benchmarks,
[193.86 --> 197.88]  pricing, and there's 6950X overclocking results
[197.88 --> 199.06]  that are out there.
[199.06 --> 201.84]  So first let's talk pricing.
[202.86 --> 206.98]  It is not going to be any surprise that the HEDT
[206.98 --> 210.88]  or high-end desktop enthusiast desktop parts
[210.88 --> 212.52]  are going to be priced a little higher
[212.52 --> 214.18]  than their mainstream counterparts.
[214.18 --> 215.74]  So you're used to seeing, you know,
[215.80 --> 219.48]  a 6600K i5 or a 6700K,
[219.56 --> 225.68]  somewhere in that $250 to $350 range.
[225.68 --> 232.32]  HEDT starts at $434 if you're buying lots of 1,000 of them.
[232.44 --> 234.40]  So the assumption there would be that you would see these
[234.40 --> 238.22]  somewhere in the neighborhood of 349,
[238.28 --> 239.92]  if they're on a really aggressive sale,
[239.96 --> 242.30]  all the way up to probably like 369
[242.30 --> 243.72]  or something along those lines.
[244.26 --> 246.64]  It's funny because you can see Intel's margins,
[246.76 --> 250.02]  and this is my, this is my former retailer coming through.
[250.12 --> 251.48]  It's not really my concern anymore.
[251.48 --> 254.72]  But you can see Intel's margins on their balance sheets,
[254.72 --> 258.40]  which are a lot healthier than freaking, you know,
[258.68 --> 260.62]  6% or anything like that.
[260.94 --> 262.84]  And as a retailer, you have to get by
[262.84 --> 265.94]  with somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 to 5.5%
[265.94 --> 267.82]  on Intel processors, from my experience.
[268.16 --> 270.34]  With that said, there is marketing funding available,
[270.34 --> 273.56]  but it just feels like the wealth could be shared
[273.56 --> 274.86]  a little bit in that regard.
[274.86 --> 277.46]  Though that's not necessarily the case.
[277.66 --> 282.42]  Fun fact, giving a typical computer retailer more margin
[282.42 --> 287.56]  will basically just result in more policing the retailers
[287.56 --> 289.86]  to make sure that they aren't undercutting each other
[289.86 --> 291.98]  by a dollar every other day,
[292.10 --> 293.90]  taking all the margin of the product.
[293.98 --> 296.80]  In fact, one of the reasons that I suspect
[296.80 --> 300.22]  that many manufacturers such as NVIDIA and Intel,
[300.32 --> 301.70]  I don't believe it's legal in Canada,
[301.70 --> 304.88]  but in the United States, you can enforce what's called a MAP
[304.88 --> 307.22]  or a minimum advertised price.
[308.06 --> 309.38]  And that's the reason that they do this.
[309.44 --> 312.76]  And even though they do, many just go around it anyway
[312.76 --> 315.68]  by offering in-store deals or whatever the case may be.
[315.76 --> 318.58]  The advertised price or is it a minimum actual price?
[318.76 --> 319.74]  Minimum advertised price.
[319.84 --> 322.76]  So if you've ever seen that feature on a site,
[322.88 --> 324.62]  and it's less typical on Canadian sites,
[324.72 --> 326.08]  because again, like I said,
[326.08 --> 328.14]  I believe MAP is still illegal in Canada.
[330.66 --> 332.86]  If you see price too low to show,
[333.42 --> 335.04]  add to cart to see price.
[335.46 --> 337.56]  That means that the price is below MAP.
[338.50 --> 339.42]  Ed, can I help you?
[341.94 --> 342.58]  Oh, okay.
[343.72 --> 345.42]  Yeah, I think you can scan on it.
[345.94 --> 346.88]  I don't know to where.
[347.86 --> 348.60]  So there's that.
[350.02 --> 351.24]  Why are you talking to Ed?
[351.56 --> 352.08]  I don't know.
[352.16 --> 353.98]  Maybe Ed wants to participate in the show too.
[354.00 --> 354.92]  He doesn't have fun here.
[354.92 --> 357.16]  Well, do you have a, yeah, he doesn't have fun hair like us.
[357.22 --> 358.66]  Actually, his hair is getting pretty fun
[358.66 --> 360.94]  with his little ponytail thing that he's got going on there.
[361.96 --> 362.36]  Samurai.
[362.76 --> 364.92]  There's like a, oh man, there's a hair clip
[364.92 --> 366.60]  that sits right under this headband.
[367.28 --> 369.14]  That's actually quite painful.
[369.26 --> 372.18]  But you know, fashion is not about comfort.
[372.92 --> 373.10]  No.
[373.30 --> 375.92]  Fashion is about looking amazing.
[377.04 --> 379.00]  I have real hair that can go down this way.
[379.06 --> 381.04]  Yeah, that's not a thing to brag about.
[381.14 --> 383.78]  Do you have your ponytail thing still?
[383.78 --> 384.52]  I have it.
[385.22 --> 386.06]  It's now that way?
[386.14 --> 388.56]  So you have your ponytail combed forward.
[389.48 --> 390.60]  Just under my hat.
[391.32 --> 393.46]  If I'm not wearing a hat, I do it off.
[393.72 --> 394.08]  Great.
[394.72 --> 395.90]  I look good with this.
[395.96 --> 397.04]  Oh, man.
[397.32 --> 398.24]  It's not a ponytail.
[398.52 --> 399.26]  It's a man bun.
[399.42 --> 400.28]  A man bun.
[400.52 --> 402.56]  Maybe I should go full rainbow dash all the time.
[402.84 --> 403.32]  All right.
[403.36 --> 406.16]  So let's talk pricing for the rest of these processors.
[406.16 --> 410.86]  So to start with, here, I'm just going to go ahead and pull up.
[410.92 --> 412.80]  So these images are off of Anantek.
[412.98 --> 413.80]  I love those guys.
[413.96 --> 416.84]  And I'm going to have to move us over to the right for this, I think.
[417.28 --> 417.90]  There we go.
[418.38 --> 420.70]  So there is the 6800K.
[421.10 --> 423.78]  So the 6800K is a 6-core.
[424.22 --> 425.66]  There are not any.
[425.80 --> 426.26]  Here, let me see.
[426.32 --> 426.88]  Yep, there we go.
[427.12 --> 427.88]  It's a 6-core.
[427.88 --> 432.62]  There are no quad-cores in the lineup, just like last time around.
[433.20 --> 434.66]  It is hyper-threaded.
[434.76 --> 436.30]  All i7s are hyper-threaded.
[436.44 --> 438.30]  So that shouldn't be any kind of a surprise.
[438.52 --> 441.58]  Anything on the ATDT platform is a core i7.
[442.10 --> 444.76]  Well, unless you were to, like, pop a Xeon in there.
[444.82 --> 446.70]  It's not the kind of thing that Intel supports officially.
[446.92 --> 450.14]  But between you and me and the wall, it can be done.
[450.76 --> 452.54]  It's clocked at 3.4 GHz.
[452.54 --> 460.32]  So once again, the 6-core processor is actually clocked higher, even at the lower end, than
[460.32 --> 461.54]  the 8-core processor.
[461.68 --> 465.82]  So this was the case last time around with the 5960X.
[466.12 --> 473.60]  And it turbos up to a multiplier of 35, or you can see, up to 3.6 GHz.
[474.86 --> 476.56]  So let's step it up a little bit.
[476.60 --> 479.58]  Let's go have a look at the 6850K.
[479.58 --> 483.66]  There are actually four SKUs this time, which is pretty interesting.
[484.14 --> 485.90]  So this one is clocked a little higher.
[486.52 --> 492.12]  And otherwise, basically pretty much the same thing.
[492.18 --> 493.72]  It's even rated at the same TDP.
[494.30 --> 497.36]  Although Ian over at Anantech actually tested them.
[498.12 --> 503.76]  And, I mean, it's something that I've personally been aware of for quite some time, but may not
[503.76 --> 505.02]  be something that you guys know.
[505.02 --> 509.36]  So he tested them and discovered that even though they're all rated at the same TDP, or
[509.36 --> 513.84]  thermal design power, the power consumption from one chip to another is actually quite
[513.84 --> 514.24]  different.
[514.72 --> 518.74]  And the reason for that will be fairly evident once we go have a look at the third SKU.
[518.84 --> 520.68]  So this is the 6900K.
[522.96 --> 525.06]  This one comes in...
[525.06 --> 525.40]  Oh, right.
[525.46 --> 529.36]  So the other difference between those last two was 28 PCI Express lanes on the lower end
[529.36 --> 531.02]  one and 40 on the higher end one.
[531.02 --> 532.26]  They are pulling that again.
[532.84 --> 539.00]  So the 6900K is actually more of a direct replacement for the 5960X.
[539.74 --> 545.88]  And the reason that I say that is here we go from six cores to eight cores with hyperthreading
[545.88 --> 547.92]  and actually the same clock speed.
[548.42 --> 553.12]  So this is what would have typically been an extreme edition in every way, including pricing.
[553.12 --> 559.08]  This chip is going to cost you a whopping $1,000 at retail.
[559.16 --> 560.84]  Actually, a little bit more now.
[560.90 --> 562.64]  They've actually increased the pricing there.
[562.78 --> 568.40]  So it is $1,089 for a 6900K in lots of $1,000.
[568.78 --> 573.48]  Leading us to a chip that has never existed before.
[574.08 --> 577.38]  Lower maximum clock speed for the flagship one.
[577.38 --> 581.86]  Like I was saying, this is similar to last generation where the 8 core is clocked lower
[581.86 --> 583.50]  than the 6 cores.
[584.64 --> 587.82]  But this one has a whopping 10 cores.
[588.16 --> 591.28]  And it's overclockable on a desktop platform.
[591.72 --> 599.12]  Based on early results, you would expect somewhere in the neighborhood of 4.1 and change gigahertz
[599.12 --> 610.30]  when overclocking it, making it at $1,700 a very difficult purchase to justify.
[610.72 --> 612.60]  So let's start talking workloads, okay?
[613.00 --> 614.08]  What do people do with computers?
[614.30 --> 616.36]  Well, I was just going to say, like, slow down here.
[616.42 --> 618.92]  This all just sounds like a bunch of techno babble to me.
[619.26 --> 624.46]  Why should I, as a normal person, care about all of this?
[624.46 --> 625.52]  Do you hear what he just called himself?
[626.70 --> 627.92]  Lean into the microphone a little.
[628.06 --> 629.50]  As a normal person.
[629.60 --> 629.80]  Yeah.
[629.96 --> 632.28]  Well, not quite like that, but, like, sit up.
[632.74 --> 636.94]  Yeah, you know, it's just, like, the armrests are still on this chair.
[638.34 --> 638.74]  See?
[638.94 --> 640.88]  That's what happens when you have armrests.
[641.06 --> 642.10]  It's a disaster.
[644.16 --> 644.52]  Okay.
[645.06 --> 646.00]  So, okay.
[646.44 --> 647.42]  What are you asking?
[648.26 --> 654.78]  I was saying, like, why should the average person care about the new 10-core Intel CPU?
[656.18 --> 659.56]  Well, this is where I wanted to get into different workloads, okay?
[659.72 --> 661.84]  So tell me, what do people do on their computers?
[661.96 --> 663.38]  Just start firing stuff at me.
[663.72 --> 665.44]  Well, gaming, I do a lot of video.
[665.48 --> 665.58]  Okay.
[665.58 --> 666.16]  Well, hold on, hold on.
[666.18 --> 666.84]  Let's do one at a time.
[666.84 --> 667.58]  You said rapid fire.
[667.58 --> 671.32]  So for gaming, I didn't say rapidly fire.
[671.44 --> 672.44]  I said fire at me.
[672.44 --> 685.24]  So for gaming, the 6950X, so the Extreme Edition $1,700, $1,800 probably retail, $1,800 processor
[685.24 --> 692.14]  performs identically across the board to the other Extreme Edition processors.
[692.14 --> 695.20]  So the 2.6 cores and the 8 core.
[695.88 --> 696.40]  Identically.
[696.40 --> 704.36]  Because gaming is mostly going to come down to what clock speed you can run your fastest
[704.36 --> 705.90]  2 to 4 cores at.
[707.30 --> 713.50]  In the case of going up against something like a 6700K, so that's a Skylake quad core on the
[713.50 --> 719.90]  mainstream platform, it will actually lose in quite a few cases because it is clocked significantly
[719.90 --> 720.30]  lower.
[720.44 --> 723.14]  Skylake can turbo up to 4 gigahertz.
[723.14 --> 729.16]  So that's about a 10% difference in clock speed, not to mention that it's running a more
[729.16 --> 730.78]  up-to-date microarchitecture.
[730.78 --> 737.30]  So on the desktop platform, they actually are running one full generation newer of chip design,
[737.68 --> 742.24]  enabling newer features, as well as higher performance and lower power consumption.
[742.44 --> 745.36]  You say on the desktop platform, you mean like desktops, not laptops.
[745.36 --> 746.90]  The mainstream desktop platform.
[747.34 --> 749.66]  Because these are both desktop platforms that we're talking about.
[749.74 --> 750.04]  Great.
[750.04 --> 753.40]  So not high-end desktop, regular desktop.
[754.12 --> 754.30]  Okay.
[754.40 --> 758.08]  So for gaming, basically it makes no sense at all.
[758.48 --> 759.34]  Hit me with another use case.
[759.34 --> 760.18]  To have the 10 core.
[760.30 --> 760.46]  Yeah.
[760.58 --> 762.98]  To have the $1,700 Extreme Edition 10 core.
[763.00 --> 763.16]  Okay.
[763.18 --> 763.78]  Video editing.
[764.32 --> 765.02]  Video editing.
[765.14 --> 765.32]  Okay.
[765.46 --> 769.50]  So once again, I pretty much can't think of a scenario where it makes any sense.
[769.56 --> 769.70]  Really?
[769.70 --> 776.56]  Because in most cases, you are either, once again, limited by peak clock speed.
[776.56 --> 777.18]  Mm-hmm.
[777.70 --> 782.98]  Or you are using some kind of workload.
[783.12 --> 787.38]  Like let's say Sorensen Squeeze, where you can take advantage of more cores.
[787.38 --> 794.90]  And if that's the case, then let's go ahead and have a look at what's available in the Xeon E5 V4 lineup.
[795.24 --> 804.02]  Because those chips are actually socket for socket compatible with pretty much any board that would hold one of these Extreme Editions.
[804.02 --> 806.72]  I'm going to go ahead and pull up Intel's Arc website.
[807.76 --> 810.22]  Let's find something comparably priced here.
[810.54 --> 818.86]  Here's a $1,745 processor that consumes less power and has 14 cores clocked at 2.4 GHz.
[819.20 --> 822.88]  Let's have a look at its max turbo speed of 3.3 GHz.
[824.78 --> 825.84]  Is that impressive?
[826.18 --> 829.50]  So yeah, that's pretty freaking good.
[829.58 --> 832.00]  Not to mention that it comes with ECC memory support.
[832.00 --> 833.36]  Oh yeah, of course.
[833.36 --> 836.36]  With that said, it doesn't support overclocking.
[836.50 --> 840.16]  So let's have a look at what else they have in sort of a comparable price range.
[840.66 --> 843.18]  Here's a lower clocked 16 core.
[843.78 --> 851.96]  Eh, probably wouldn't be looking at that unless I was in like a heavily virtualized environment where I'm running a lot of host operating systems.
[853.64 --> 856.96]  What about like rendering for 3D animation?
[856.96 --> 870.12]  In that case, basically that's one of the few workloads where you can basically take the number of cores times the frequency that they run at, factoring in the architecture that they use, and kind of just add them up.
[870.22 --> 871.26]  And get an actual result.
[871.34 --> 871.86]  It scales.
[871.86 --> 875.32]  3D rendering scales relatively linearly.
[875.66 --> 877.94]  But that's on the CPU, not the GPU, right?
[878.50 --> 878.66]  Yeah.
[878.66 --> 879.86]  Are we rendering with the CPU?
[880.14 --> 881.88]  If we're talking about CPU rendering, then yes.
[881.88 --> 882.90]  But would you want to do that?
[883.48 --> 886.68]  Well, it really depends on what application you're using.
[886.80 --> 890.52]  It's one of those things where it comes down to what that person's actually using.
[890.52 --> 895.78]  So Intel's competing against Xeon's in these heavily multithreaded workloads.
[896.12 --> 903.98]  And then the other issue that I have is particularly with our new workflow in Adobe Premiere, we could easily be using quad cores.
[904.10 --> 915.28]  We did a video recently with an Ultrabook, a dual core Ultrabook, editing video over the network using our Cineform codec that we convert all of our footage to.
[915.52 --> 917.30]  And the performance was fine.
[917.30 --> 927.60]  So the only thing you would actually be able to use the extra horses for would be the final export, which from my experience only benefits from about...
[927.60 --> 932.32]  So we've got 14 core processors in those machines right now, and they hit about 60% usage.
[932.50 --> 934.30]  So from about 8 cores...
[936.30 --> 937.56]  Out of 10.
[938.10 --> 939.54]  Out of 10, yeah.
[939.80 --> 942.78]  So you could easily buy the 8 core instead.
[943.26 --> 945.80]  Oh, and that wouldn't utilize just 6 then?
[945.80 --> 947.56]  And it actually utilizes up to 8?
[947.64 --> 951.76]  Yeah, it utilizes up to 8 from my experience with the way that we render to H.264.
[951.92 --> 952.02]  Yeah.
[952.40 --> 958.04]  But most people don't go to Cineform first unless they have watched our stuff and realize that it's awesome.
[958.22 --> 964.76]  So you're paying an extra $700 for two more cores on an 8 core.
[964.76 --> 975.46]  There's another problem is that dual socket motherboards are not that expensive compared to regular motherboards, especially if you're already spending $1,700 on a processor.
[975.46 --> 978.56]  Let's assume that you're buying a decent motherboard to go with it.
[978.56 --> 979.78]  So let's have a look at...
[979.78 --> 984.60]  Here's a 90-watt chip with 10 cores clocked at 2.4 to...
[984.60 --> 985.28]  Let's see.
[985.40 --> 987.22]  3.4 gigahertz max turbo.
[987.74 --> 989.62]  You could throw two of those in.
[989.94 --> 991.54]  That's a $939 processor.
[991.66 --> 996.40]  So just spending a little bit more, you could chuck two of these bad boys in for a total of 20 cores.
[996.60 --> 996.84]  Ooh.
[997.52 --> 1000.00]  If you had a heavily multi-threaded workload.
[1000.16 --> 1001.58]  And it would be able to use all of that?
[1001.58 --> 1002.30]  Well, it depends.
[1002.36 --> 1005.36]  If you have a heavily multi-threaded workload, then yes, it would.
[1005.38 --> 1006.04]  So no dwarf fortress.
[1006.72 --> 1007.50]  So no.
[1008.12 --> 1008.94]  Dwarf fortress would not pass it.
[1008.94 --> 1010.58]  It only utilizes one core.
[1010.76 --> 1011.04]  Okay.
[1011.28 --> 1011.60]  All right.
[1011.80 --> 1012.28]  I think.
[1013.12 --> 1014.54]  So hit me with another workload.
[1014.98 --> 1015.46]  Oh, dear.
[1017.16 --> 1018.04]  SETI at home.
[1018.18 --> 1018.96]  Folding at home.
[1019.54 --> 1020.42]  One of those things.
[1020.42 --> 1026.02]  So once again, my 20-core dual Xeon setup is going to absolutely mop the floor with it.
[1026.28 --> 1026.34]  Yeah?
[1026.66 --> 1026.86]  Yep.
[1026.94 --> 1029.10]  That can be utilized with multiple stuff.
[1029.10 --> 1029.58]  Yeah.
[1029.74 --> 1032.40]  And if it couldn't, then a 10-core definitely wouldn't make a difference.
[1032.52 --> 1037.58]  So distributed computing would benefit from our overclocked 10-core processor, but not enough
[1037.58 --> 1038.62]  to justify the price.
[1038.88 --> 1039.66]  Hit me again.
[1040.14 --> 1040.76]  I'm out.
[1040.88 --> 1041.72]  I don't have any more.
[1041.84 --> 1042.70]  You hit you.
[1042.90 --> 1043.56]  I'm out too.
[1043.84 --> 1049.38]  I can't figure out what this product is for, especially at that price.
[1050.04 --> 1056.62]  I think at $1,000, if they were giving us the 8-core at the kind of $650, $700 price
[1056.62 --> 1062.22]  point, and if they were giving us, maybe, you know, I'd be okay with a 6-core, but maybe
[1062.22 --> 1067.74]  with all the PCI Express lanes, or an 8-core with the 28-PCI Express lanes.
[1067.84 --> 1072.84]  Like, if we were really getting a significant improvement this time around, then I would be
[1072.84 --> 1073.46]  pretty happy.
[1073.62 --> 1074.30]  Like, hang on.
[1074.36 --> 1078.44]  Like, why do they make a 10-core CPU if it's not really useful for many things?
[1078.48 --> 1079.62]  You just get more CPUs.
[1080.32 --> 1080.74]  Well, it...
[1080.74 --> 1080.92]  It's cheaper.
[1080.92 --> 1081.60]  What's the point?
[1081.80 --> 1085.94]  It is useful for things, but it's, like, not at that price.
[1086.02 --> 1087.16]  At $1,000...
[1087.16 --> 1087.96]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[1088.06 --> 1090.26]  If it's not useful at that price, then it's not useful.
[1090.44 --> 1094.04]  So basically what it looks like happened is someone at Intel went...
[1094.04 --> 1094.80]  Well, crap.
[1094.80 --> 1095.40]  Because we can?
[1095.94 --> 1096.96]  No, not that.
[1097.46 --> 1100.82]  I mean, no, I don't think Intel does anything just because they can anymore.
[1101.34 --> 1102.92]  I think someone at Intel went...
[1102.92 --> 1110.50]  If we deliver an 8-core overclockable processor, so we're talking, you know, 4 GHz times 10,
[1110.60 --> 1112.06]  so 40 GHz of power.
[1112.16 --> 1113.44]  Yes, I know it doesn't scale like that.
[1114.34 --> 1123.34]  We are going to be seriously cannibalizing Xeon unless we hamstring it in some way or jack
[1123.34 --> 1123.78]  the price.
[1123.88 --> 1126.64]  And it already is hamstrung in a way.
[1126.86 --> 1130.96]  So it is not capable of having two of them installed on a single motherboard.
[1130.96 --> 1131.82]  Mm-hmm.
[1131.90 --> 1135.96]  That's something that's been true of the HEDT processors since...
[1136.62 --> 1138.58]  Wow, since Skull Trail, I guess?
[1139.16 --> 1140.06]  Yeah, since Skull Trail.
[1140.40 --> 1141.70]  I don't know what Skull Trail is.
[1141.86 --> 1144.02]  It was a very, very expensive...
[1144.02 --> 1146.76]  Basically, it was two Xeons, but they branded them as Extreme Editions.
[1147.04 --> 1149.46]  And then a specific motherboard that you could put them on.
[1149.66 --> 1150.02]  Wonderful.
[1150.18 --> 1150.70]  Two motherboards.
[1150.78 --> 1151.96]  I think EVGA had one as well.
[1152.34 --> 1159.66]  So other than Skull Trail, we've never seen an Extreme Edition processor,
[1159.66 --> 1163.66]  an overclockable processor that can be installed with two...
[1164.18 --> 1166.30]  can be installed in a dual socket board,
[1166.42 --> 1168.30]  or at least have two of them installed in a dual socket board.
[1168.36 --> 1170.78]  I've heard that they'll work in a dual socket board if you only install one of them.
[1170.78 --> 1172.02]  Are there triple socket boards?
[1172.20 --> 1174.54]  There are quad socket boards and eight socket boards.
[1174.76 --> 1175.08]  Oh, wow.
[1175.22 --> 1175.44]  Yes.
[1175.54 --> 1176.76]  Does it go only up to eight?
[1177.14 --> 1179.86]  I am not aware of a 16 socket board,
[1179.96 --> 1182.38]  and the size of it would be a thing to be reckoned with.
[1182.54 --> 1182.68]  Oh.
[1183.78 --> 1184.34]  So...
[1184.34 --> 1185.04]  Make a fun video.
[1185.04 --> 1186.86]  Basically, I think that's what happened.
[1187.96 --> 1193.30]  They were worried that taking away ECC memory compatibility wouldn't be enough
[1193.30 --> 1197.48]  to prevent high-end workstation and entry-level server customers
[1197.48 --> 1199.76]  from using these things at $1,000.
[1200.60 --> 1204.96]  And they couldn't figure out a way other than just throwing more cores on it
[1204.96 --> 1207.96]  to differentiate it from the last generation Extreme Edition
[1207.96 --> 1210.72]  in a significant enough way
[1210.72 --> 1215.04]  that customers would kind of drool over it all over again.
[1215.22 --> 1215.60]  All right, all right.
[1215.66 --> 1216.46]  But blah, blah, blah.
[1216.64 --> 1217.50]  Who is it for?
[1218.36 --> 1220.52]  It is for people with more money than cents.
[1220.74 --> 1221.18]  Okay.
[1221.34 --> 1223.84]  Which has been true of many Extreme Editions in the past.
[1223.86 --> 1226.60]  Just normal consumers, not like big companies?
[1226.82 --> 1228.48]  Oh, like who are they trying to sell it to?
[1228.48 --> 1228.70]  Yeah.
[1228.94 --> 1230.72]  Yeah, regular consumers like gamers.
[1230.90 --> 1231.16]  Okay.
[1231.96 --> 1234.60]  Gamers who want a little bit less performance.
[1234.60 --> 1236.50]  Yeah, but all the gamers watch Linus Tech Tips
[1236.50 --> 1237.80]  and then they'll know that it's pointless.
[1238.64 --> 1240.56]  No, that's not the case at all.
[1240.64 --> 1242.50]  In fact, I forget where I was reading this,
[1242.56 --> 1244.34]  but I looked at a really interesting graph
[1244.34 --> 1249.82]  of the estimated sell-through of Intel's HEDT lineup
[1249.82 --> 1251.44]  over the last several generations.
[1251.52 --> 1252.92]  It might have been on WCCF Tech.
[1253.64 --> 1256.98]  And the price, so times the price,
[1257.08 --> 1261.22]  and the most successful processors they've had in terms of revenue
[1261.22 --> 1263.92]  have been...
[1263.92 --> 1265.16]  The more hardcore ones?
[1265.16 --> 1266.96]  Yeah, the higher priced ones
[1266.96 --> 1270.74]  that increase the core count over the previous generation.
[1270.98 --> 1273.46]  So it looks like Intel is trying to make
[1273.46 --> 1276.32]  that exact lightning strike here.
[1277.06 --> 1280.58]  But I personally really doubt it,
[1281.06 --> 1282.90]  and I sincerely hope not,
[1283.02 --> 1285.40]  unless this is an omen.
[1285.96 --> 1286.20]  Huh?
[1286.20 --> 1288.14]  Yes, an omen.
[1288.14 --> 1293.06]  Because the last time a processor manufacturer
[1293.06 --> 1296.36]  took kind of the existing pricing structure
[1296.36 --> 1302.50]  and blew it like way sky high for no apparent reason
[1302.50 --> 1305.68]  other than to create the illusion of bragging rights
[1305.68 --> 1308.44]  amongst their most affluent customers,
[1308.44 --> 1311.26]  the last time that happened,
[1311.42 --> 1315.12]  it was AMD pulling this crap with the original FX.
[1315.70 --> 1318.72]  It was actually Intel responding to AMD
[1318.72 --> 1321.58]  when they created Extreme Edition.
[1321.58 --> 1326.22]  So AMD was the one who started this $1,000 FX.
[1326.48 --> 1329.70]  You can only get one if you spend $1,000 on it lineup.
[1330.90 --> 1334.52]  So what I'm hoping is that now that that's happening again,
[1335.32 --> 1337.30]  because what happened right after AMD did FX
[1337.30 --> 1339.78]  was Intel took the balance of power back.
[1339.88 --> 1341.80]  They crushed the FX with like a $400 chip.
[1341.80 --> 1346.50]  What I'm hoping is that AMD's Zen will be affordable
[1346.50 --> 1350.70]  and make this thing look really embarrassing for Intel.
[1351.90 --> 1353.54]  Billy Hatcher 312 says,
[1353.74 --> 1355.36]  shut up with pre-recorded crap.
[1356.24 --> 1357.74]  So there you go, Billy.
[1357.88 --> 1358.66]  Pre-recorded?
[1359.18 --> 1360.88]  I'm proving that it's not pre-recorded
[1360.88 --> 1361.86]  by responding to his comment.
[1361.88 --> 1362.38]  Oh, lovely.
[1362.66 --> 1362.82]  Yeah.
[1364.94 --> 1365.70]  All right.
[1365.82 --> 1367.00]  So there you have it.
[1367.04 --> 1370.34]  That's my take on the 6950X.
[1370.34 --> 1371.86]  Did you almost fall asleep?
[1372.78 --> 1373.92]  These chairs are comfortable.
[1374.18 --> 1375.44]  These chairs are comfortable,
[1375.64 --> 1378.20]  but it's all the way back as well.
[1378.40 --> 1379.24]  Yes, you can't do that.
[1379.34 --> 1380.94]  Please do not mess with these chairs.
[1381.08 --> 1382.08]  Someone messed with this one,
[1382.12 --> 1383.42]  and it was like tilted funny enough.
[1383.42 --> 1385.50]  Yeah, but the handle's right here on the left.
[1385.56 --> 1388.02]  Well, just don't,
[1388.08 --> 1389.14]  because Linus will get upset.
[1389.38 --> 1391.08]  Yeah, well, it's like two seconds to fix.
[1391.18 --> 1391.52]  All right.
[1391.66 --> 1393.60]  So, yeah, but I couldn't figure out how to do it.
[1393.72 --> 1394.32]  That was the problem.
[1394.32 --> 1395.20]  I had told you before,
[1395.28 --> 1396.06]  and you had ignored me.
[1396.08 --> 1396.72]  Well, I forgot.
[1396.72 --> 1397.26]  Mm-hmm.
[1397.92 --> 1398.42]  All right.
[1398.42 --> 1400.94]  Let's go ahead and drop our next topic in the chat here.
[1401.48 --> 1404.10]  AMD Polaris and Zen Reveals.
[1404.30 --> 1405.96]  So let's talk Polaris first.
[1406.06 --> 1407.84]  This is where I was at in Macau.
[1408.08 --> 1409.36]  We're going down a little bit.
[1409.46 --> 1409.62]  Yeah.
[1409.78 --> 1410.24]  No, okay.
[1410.32 --> 1410.84]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1410.84 --> 1412.54]  You can just talk with Twitch chat if you want.
[1412.64 --> 1413.16]  You don't have to.
[1413.18 --> 1414.08]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I might.
[1414.16 --> 1415.10]  Pay attention if you're bored.
[1415.32 --> 1415.84]  I am bored.
[1416.40 --> 1418.16]  So let's talk about Polaris first.
[1418.20 --> 1419.86]  So I was at the event in Macau.
[1421.24 --> 1423.20]  Here's what we know so far.
[1423.20 --> 1428.20]  The goal is to bring real VR, like Rift Vive grade VR,
[1428.42 --> 1430.64]  to the first 100 million customers.
[1433.00 --> 1434.20]  That's the $200 thingy?
[1434.86 --> 1436.78]  I actually don't know how much of this is rumor
[1436.78 --> 1442.02]  and how much of this is not rumor right now.
[1442.12 --> 1445.40]  So there's a ZDNet article that we've pulled the information from.
[1445.50 --> 1449.16]  I don't know how much of it is embargoed and how much of it isn't
[1449.16 --> 1451.04]  because I know at least some of it is.
[1451.04 --> 1452.78]  So according to the ZDNet article,
[1453.12 --> 1457.70]  it's built on the 14 nanometer FinFET process from Global Foundries.
[1457.96 --> 1460.52]  It will have greater than 5 teraflops of power.
[1460.96 --> 1462.52]  Oh, this is apparently all from the announcement stream.
[1462.60 --> 1462.96]  Thanks, Nick.
[1464.14 --> 1466.20]  256 gigabytes per second of memory bandwidth,
[1466.46 --> 1468.62]  4 or 8 gigs of DDDR5,
[1468.98 --> 1472.50]  150 watt power draw starting at $199 US,
[1472.62 --> 1474.42]  although I would personally speculate
[1474.42 --> 1478.64]  that the 8 gig version will not be available for $199,
[1478.64 --> 1479.56]  at least to start.
[1479.84 --> 1485.92]  They are claiming up to a 2.8x performance per watt improvement
[1485.92 --> 1487.46]  over the previous generation.
[1488.28 --> 1489.42]  And to clarify,
[1490.06 --> 1495.50]  even though they were talking a lot about VR, VR, VR, VR
[1495.50 --> 1497.28]  with the RX 480,
[1497.70 --> 1502.02]  that is not the entire point of the card.
[1502.46 --> 1504.64]  And I actually had quite a few people...
[1505.44 --> 1506.68]  Hold on a second.
[1506.68 --> 1508.38]  I'm just creating a straw pool here.
[1509.64 --> 1512.64]  I have an MMM for non-VR.
[1513.06 --> 1514.94]  Let's go with yes, no.
[1516.70 --> 1517.30]  There we go.
[1517.38 --> 1518.96]  Sorry, I've got my straw pool created here.
[1519.20 --> 1521.62]  So I had quite a few people kind of go,
[1521.90 --> 1522.86]  well, gee, Linus,
[1523.28 --> 1525.14]  on the video that I uploaded
[1525.14 --> 1527.16]  where I did an interview with Raja Kuduri,
[1527.70 --> 1529.78]  say, like, I'm not interested in VR.
[1529.96 --> 1531.56]  So what, is this just a VR card?
[1532.18 --> 1534.66]  And the answer is no, of course not.
[1534.76 --> 1537.60]  What they're talking about when they say it's really great for VR
[1537.60 --> 1543.28]  is they're saying that it is powerful enough for VR at an affordable price.
[1543.66 --> 1545.48]  Not that it only works for VR.
[1545.48 --> 1547.24]  So I would expect this card,
[1547.32 --> 1549.18]  in fact, one of the demos they did,
[1549.22 --> 1551.48]  the only demo I've seen of its performance so far,
[1551.84 --> 1555.70]  one of the demos they did showed it up against two RX 480s,
[1555.76 --> 1557.76]  up against a single GTX 1080,
[1558.22 --> 1559.72]  in ashes of the singularity,
[1560.48 --> 1565.04]  holding up pretty darn well in a non-VR 3D workload.
[1565.04 --> 1567.68]  Now, does it have that minimum high frame rate
[1567.68 --> 1568.64]  that you were talking about?
[1568.86 --> 1572.24]  So that is one of the things that they would be tackling
[1572.24 --> 1575.02]  in a sort of VR-optimized design,
[1575.32 --> 1579.98]  helping it not dip below that minimum VR frame rate
[1579.98 --> 1581.24]  of 90 frames per second.
[1581.40 --> 1582.42]  You can't have that. It's crazy.
[1582.56 --> 1583.60]  Now, with that said,
[1583.82 --> 1586.80]  controlling dips is also enormously beneficial
[1586.80 --> 1588.92]  for flat 3D gaming.
[1588.92 --> 1591.14]  So it's not a problem
[1591.14 --> 1593.82]  that they've optimized the architecture
[1593.82 --> 1595.68]  to avoid dips in frame rate.
[1595.86 --> 1597.24]  That wouldn't hurt anybody.
[1597.34 --> 1598.48]  Everyone should be happy about that.
[1598.54 --> 1600.42]  Just the reason it's more important for VR
[1600.42 --> 1602.14]  is that it doesn't make you feel sick
[1602.14 --> 1604.08]  when you're looking at a panel in front of you,
[1604.08 --> 1606.66]  whereas when you're in a virtual reality headset,
[1607.18 --> 1609.58]  it most assuredly does.
[1609.84 --> 1610.24]  Yes.
[1610.74 --> 1611.76]  So this is interesting.
[1611.90 --> 1616.50]  We have a whopping 53% of you,
[1616.54 --> 1618.42]  and if we factor out the turnip votes,
[1618.42 --> 1620.50]  it becomes even more.
[1621.10 --> 1624.64]  Like 70% of you are interested in the RX 480.
[1625.46 --> 1628.12]  Okay, we haven't actually done one of these in a while,
[1628.22 --> 1630.90]  but we are going to have to do a Twitter blitz here.
[1631.00 --> 1632.16]  I want to hear from you guys.
[1632.24 --> 1633.70]  Tweet me, at Linus Tech on Twitter.
[1634.40 --> 1634.70]  Yeah.
[1635.52 --> 1639.44]  Are you planning to buy an RX 480?
[1640.02 --> 1640.74]  Sight unseen.
[1641.02 --> 1642.86]  You haven't even seen the performance yet.
[1642.92 --> 1643.84]  Do we not have the specs?
[1644.00 --> 1644.62]  Do we not know?
[1644.74 --> 1645.68]  We have specs,
[1645.68 --> 1648.48]  but that doesn't necessarily tell us the whole story,
[1648.54 --> 1649.78]  and we don't even have all the specs.
[1650.18 --> 1651.52]  36 compute units,
[1652.00 --> 1653.38]  and then we have memory bandwidth,
[1653.98 --> 1654.74]  and we have 5-tariff.
[1654.80 --> 1656.56]  Like, we know approximately how it's going to perform,
[1656.90 --> 1658.48]  but that is not the whole story.
[1659.04 --> 1662.38]  How powerful is the AMD hype train here, guys?
[1662.38 --> 1665.80]  Hit me up and let me know in the Twitter blitz.
[1666.80 --> 1668.66]  You know, are you planning to buy one?
[1669.16 --> 1671.88]  And it doesn't necessarily have to be for you.
[1672.28 --> 1674.16]  Tell me what you're planning to buy it for.
[1674.24 --> 1677.12]  Like, are you planning to buy one for a friend's computer,
[1677.30 --> 1678.90]  or for a relative's computer,
[1679.04 --> 1680.42]  or something along those lines?
[1680.50 --> 1681.74]  I do want to hear from you guys.
[1682.12 --> 1684.98]  Let's go ahead and chat zen very briefly here
[1684.98 --> 1687.00]  while I wait for some results to roll in there.
[1687.00 --> 1691.00]  Let me just go...
[1691.00 --> 1693.72]  Actually, I think this article is the ZDNet one
[1693.72 --> 1695.68]  that I was accidentally referring to before.
[1695.82 --> 1697.02]  Let's go ahead and pop that in there.
[1698.10 --> 1698.62]  All right.
[1699.98 --> 1701.76]  So, I've heard it speculated,
[1702.32 --> 1704.42]  you know, six ways from Sunday,
[1705.16 --> 1708.12]  that Zen will be released, you know,
[1708.86 --> 1711.04]  this year, or early next year,
[1711.16 --> 1712.52]  or early this year.
[1712.56 --> 1714.70]  I mean, there has been rumors flying about Zen.
[1714.70 --> 1718.56]  This is AMD's upcoming flagship CPU architecture.
[1718.90 --> 1720.64]  It's going to be awesome or not?
[1720.80 --> 1723.52]  Well, according to, you know,
[1723.60 --> 1726.46]  AMD fanboys and AMD employees, yes,
[1726.58 --> 1729.92]  but they've both let me down a number of times in the past,
[1729.92 --> 1732.26]  so I'm personally withholding any judgment
[1732.26 --> 1733.78]  until I actually am holding one
[1733.78 --> 1734.82]  and putting it into a motherboard.
[1735.12 --> 1741.88]  But it looks like they may actually be coming closer.
[1742.60 --> 1744.08]  So, here's the update.
[1744.70 --> 1748.18]  Lisa Su held a Zen processor
[1748.18 --> 1752.78]  that she claimed is working in her hand on stage.
[1754.24 --> 1757.30]  They are claiming 40% higher IPC,
[1757.42 --> 1758.62]  that's instructions per clock,
[1758.74 --> 1759.80]  versus the last generation,
[1759.94 --> 1762.02]  although we don't know anything about the final clock speed.
[1763.80 --> 1767.78]  What was shown was 8 cores, 16 threads,
[1767.94 --> 1770.44]  so we should have some kind of hyper-threading equivalent
[1770.44 --> 1771.82]  on the AMD side now.
[1771.82 --> 1774.40]  It's going to be using a FinFET process,
[1774.60 --> 1776.12]  which is not any kind of a surprise.
[1776.50 --> 1778.96]  There will be an AM4 desktop platform to go with it,
[1779.00 --> 1780.18]  which, oh, man,
[1780.30 --> 1782.88]  AMD is sorely in need of a desktop platform upgrade.
[1782.88 --> 1783.20]  Totally.
[1784.26 --> 1785.12]  I mean, did you know?
[1785.36 --> 1785.76]  No.
[1785.98 --> 1788.98]  That AMD's flagship desktop processor,
[1789.08 --> 1791.34]  the 9590FX, whatever it is,
[1791.78 --> 1795.20]  still runs PCI Express 2.0.
[1795.58 --> 1796.66]  That sounds old.
[1796.66 --> 1797.70]  And DDR3.
[1799.12 --> 1801.08]  PCI Express 2.0 is older than DDR3,
[1801.22 --> 1801.78]  but that's okay.
[1801.88 --> 1803.70]  I like having you here for these reactions.
[1803.92 --> 1804.44]  I enjoy that.
[1806.52 --> 1809.04]  Because even though I had actually,
[1809.14 --> 1810.82]  ooh, this was kind of a backroom discussion,
[1810.98 --> 1813.60]  so I'm not going to say which motherboard manufacturer said it,
[1813.86 --> 1816.64]  but one motherboard manufacturer had actually done the work
[1816.64 --> 1819.28]  of enabling PCI Express 3.0.
[1819.46 --> 1822.60]  They had motherboards that they'd like had it working on,
[1823.10 --> 1823.56]  and then...
[1823.56 --> 1824.48]  For AMD's chip.
[1824.48 --> 1827.42]  Yeah, and there was kind of no official support
[1827.42 --> 1828.80]  or there was some issues.
[1828.82 --> 1829.46]  Right, but they packed it in.
[1829.66 --> 1830.58]  I like that.
[1830.66 --> 1832.44]  That update is just not coming.
[1832.94 --> 1834.22]  Oh, so they tried it.
[1834.30 --> 1834.46]  Yeah.
[1834.46 --> 1835.52]  They got it kind of working.
[1835.72 --> 1838.70]  So it got as bad as motherboard makers
[1838.70 --> 1839.98]  were trying to do the work for them,
[1840.08 --> 1841.88]  and nothing ever happened.
[1841.88 --> 1842.94]  I feel like that with Premiere.
[1843.32 --> 1844.16]  Yeah, well...
[1844.16 --> 1845.46]  I'm doing the work for Adobe.
[1846.70 --> 1848.64]  So there's no date for Zen,
[1849.38 --> 1851.32]  but what was said is that it's alive,
[1851.32 --> 1852.56]  it's on track,
[1852.72 --> 1855.76]  and they are extraordinarily excited
[1855.76 --> 1857.52]  about what Zen will bring to the marketplace.
[1857.52 --> 1859.12]  Is there a due date on this,
[1859.20 --> 1860.68]  or are they just...
[1860.68 --> 1862.10]  So it could be vaporware?
[1862.30 --> 1864.78]  I would say I'll be surprised
[1864.78 --> 1866.54]  if it's not Q4 this year,
[1866.90 --> 1869.84]  or much more likely Q1, Q2 next year.
[1870.06 --> 1872.84]  Q4 means the last four months, kids.
[1874.30 --> 1876.14]  I'm going to let you think about that for a second.
[1876.20 --> 1876.82]  Last three months?
[1876.88 --> 1877.16]  Yeah.
[1877.16 --> 1881.06]  Well, you know, four times three is 12.
[1881.82 --> 1882.90]  It divides in there somehow.
[1883.60 --> 1884.40]  Thank you, Taryn.
[1884.48 --> 1884.66]  It's three.
[1885.04 --> 1886.12]  All right, let's go ahead
[1886.12 --> 1889.18]  and jump on to that Twitter blitz over there.
[1889.30 --> 1891.28]  Have a look at what you guys are...
[1891.28 --> 1892.80]  Have a look at what you guys are...
[1892.80 --> 1893.94]  Oh, dang it.
[1893.98 --> 1895.02]  I don't know why it does this.
[1895.54 --> 1897.92]  Give me my window region.
[1898.80 --> 1899.46]  Come on, baby.
[1900.62 --> 1901.34]  Come on, baby.
[1901.50 --> 1901.98]  What are you talking about?
[1902.28 --> 1903.04]  You can do this.
[1903.36 --> 1903.78]  What are you doing?
[1903.78 --> 1906.90]  Oh, I'm just waiting for the dialogue to pop up
[1906.90 --> 1908.38]  so that I can go ahead and capture it.
[1908.38 --> 1908.62]  You know what?
[1908.64 --> 1908.86]  It's okay.
[1908.94 --> 1910.30]  I can just start reading some of these.
[1911.46 --> 1912.74]  Steven Workman says,
[1912.84 --> 1915.04]  I'm saving up for my first proper gaming PC
[1915.04 --> 1916.76]  and I'm really interested in the 480.
[1916.98 --> 1919.58]  The frames per Canadian peso look pretty good.
[1920.06 --> 1922.02]  That's a serious factor.
[1922.24 --> 1924.94]  Like, this will be a serious gaming card
[1924.94 --> 1926.26]  available at a price
[1926.26 --> 1929.42]  that people outside of the United States of America
[1929.42 --> 1931.62]  might actually be able to afford.
[1931.80 --> 1933.46]  But, like, it is a serious gaming card, right?
[1933.46 --> 1934.44]  Like, we know the specs.
[1934.56 --> 1935.68]  We know that it will be good.
[1935.84 --> 1937.68]  We know that it will be good.
[1937.84 --> 1938.74]  We just don't know how good.
[1938.96 --> 1939.46]  Uh-huh.
[1939.80 --> 1941.00]  We know the minimum goodness.
[1941.48 --> 1943.96]  And there are other things that we don't know, for example.
[1944.06 --> 1945.62]  Like, we don't know if it's going to be plagued
[1945.62 --> 1947.24]  by driver issues out of the gate.
[1947.36 --> 1947.84]  Oh, boy.
[1948.32 --> 1948.94]  That'll be fun.
[1949.06 --> 1951.30]  Like, we have no way of predicting something like that.
[1954.58 --> 1955.32]  Here we go.
[1955.68 --> 1956.36]  Igor says,
[1956.36 --> 1956.84]  Yes.
[1957.38 --> 1958.94]  RX480 for my own rig.
[1959.36 --> 1962.54]  Sold my 7970 Crossfire and will buy it.
[1963.46 --> 1964.12]  There you go.
[1965.54 --> 1966.32]  Bob Ross.
[1966.44 --> 1969.18]  I'm considering it for a friend's $1,000 gaming rig.
[1969.70 --> 1970.30]  Brian says,
[1970.38 --> 1972.36]  I'm waiting for GTX 1050.
[1972.78 --> 1976.00]  Unless someone puts a frigging backplate on the RX.
[1976.00 --> 1978.64]  I would say, Brian,
[1979.12 --> 1987.38]  I probably would not make my decision about a GPU
[1987.38 --> 1989.70]  based on whether or not it has a backplate.
[1990.20 --> 1990.96]  Fun fact,
[1991.38 --> 1992.34]  backplates,
[1992.52 --> 1993.48]  in many cases,
[1993.72 --> 1995.08]  you'll see cutouts on them
[1995.08 --> 1997.72]  for certain components to stick up through them
[1997.72 --> 1999.06]  because backplates,
[1999.28 --> 2000.00]  in many cases,
[2000.12 --> 2001.98]  actually cause components on the back of the card
[2001.98 --> 2002.64]  to run hotter.
[2002.64 --> 2005.04]  Because there's a big thing of metal in the way.
[2005.22 --> 2006.64]  Because there's a big thing of metal in the way.
[2006.76 --> 2007.32]  That makes sense.
[2007.34 --> 2009.16]  Unless the manufacturer is investing
[2009.16 --> 2011.84]  in a lot of thermal interface material,
[2012.08 --> 2016.62]  as well as the precision manufacturing of the backplate
[2016.62 --> 2017.84]  that will allow it to rest evenly
[2017.84 --> 2019.06]  on all of those components,
[2020.26 --> 2021.38]  they actually are,
[2021.68 --> 2022.50]  A, not that beneficial,
[2022.74 --> 2023.16]  and B,
[2023.48 --> 2025.48]  can actually reduce compatibility
[2025.48 --> 2028.38]  with other cards being in your system
[2028.38 --> 2029.20]  at the same time
[2029.20 --> 2032.60]  because the spec for the spacing of a PCI slot
[2032.60 --> 2035.34]  does not account for anything above the PCB
[2035.34 --> 2036.32]  on the back of the card.
[2037.22 --> 2038.38]  So there's a,
[2038.44 --> 2039.96]  You put the thing on top of my head.
[2040.06 --> 2041.06]  Fun fact for you.
[2041.12 --> 2042.24]  No, no, it's not actually there.
[2042.42 --> 2043.28]  Oh, yeah, no, it is.
[2043.40 --> 2044.02]  It's on the stream.
[2044.10 --> 2044.22]  See?
[2044.64 --> 2045.14]  Oh, really?
[2045.26 --> 2046.32]  Yeah, it's right there.
[2046.64 --> 2046.94]  Oh.
[2049.16 --> 2049.56]  Oops.
[2049.82 --> 2050.98]  You captured your own.
[2051.50 --> 2051.80]  Oh.
[2052.76 --> 2053.64]  Okay, well.
[2053.80 --> 2055.04]  Headless Terran over here.
[2055.28 --> 2056.52]  Gosh darn it.
[2056.52 --> 2057.08]  Whatever.
[2060.08 --> 2060.76]  I give up on that.
[2060.84 --> 2062.14]  I'm just going to read them to you guys.
[2064.24 --> 2065.04]  Nitroblast says,
[2065.14 --> 2067.04]  You have to get the timing just right
[2067.04 --> 2068.52]  to get it on the WAN show.
[2068.80 --> 2069.06]  Lol.
[2070.50 --> 2071.76]  Yes, that is true.
[2071.86 --> 2072.74]  And it is pretty tough.
[2073.38 --> 2074.36]  Daniel says,
[2074.56 --> 2075.56]  If I could buy it yet.
[2075.68 --> 2076.48]  Holy cow.
[2076.94 --> 2077.18]  What?
[2077.30 --> 2079.58]  Compared even to the straw poll,
[2080.18 --> 2082.94]  there's a lot of you guys saying,
[2083.10 --> 2084.40]  Yeah, let's go for it.
[2084.40 --> 2086.60]  See, I'm way more cautious than this.
[2086.72 --> 2088.32]  I don't like to buy anything
[2088.32 --> 2090.30]  unless it's been out for a while.
[2090.62 --> 2092.22]  Everything about it is known.
[2092.66 --> 2094.20]  People have been using it for a while.
[2094.28 --> 2095.18]  They know that it's good.
[2095.66 --> 2097.12]  I don't like to be on the cutting edge
[2097.12 --> 2098.08]  for stuff like this.
[2098.74 --> 2099.06]  Huh.
[2099.14 --> 2100.38]  I think y'all are crazy.
[2100.78 --> 2101.96]  I mean, I personally think
[2101.96 --> 2102.96]  it's a little early too.
[2102.96 --> 2106.34]  I would be waiting for GTX 1060.
[2106.34 --> 2107.92]  I just want to see
[2107.92 --> 2109.52]  how that card plays out
[2109.52 --> 2111.02]  because what you guys need to remember
[2111.02 --> 2112.28]  is that
[2112.28 --> 2115.32]  even though AMD is shouting from the rooftops
[2115.32 --> 2118.44]  about how amazing RX 460 to 480
[2118.44 --> 2119.52]  are going to be
[2119.52 --> 2121.66]  and how they're going to be like
[2121.66 --> 2122.88]  killer performance
[2122.88 --> 2124.60]  per watt, per dollar
[2124.60 --> 2125.50]  and all that stuff.
[2126.36 --> 2127.84]  It's not like
[2127.84 --> 2129.60]  this is AMD's flagship
[2129.60 --> 2133.28]  GTX 1080, 1070 competing chip size.
[2133.70 --> 2135.42]  That's not what we're looking at here.
[2135.42 --> 2139.12]  This is more of a mainstream size die.
[2139.80 --> 2142.04]  So NVIDIA's cards,
[2142.22 --> 2142.80]  NVIDIA's chips
[2142.80 --> 2144.44]  were never intended to compete
[2144.44 --> 2146.22]  with these Polaris chips.
[2146.34 --> 2147.36]  Like they sit above
[2147.36 --> 2148.68]  and below each other like this.
[2148.98 --> 2150.36]  So for a little while here
[2150.36 --> 2151.94]  until NVIDIA fills out
[2151.94 --> 2154.34]  their lower end 14 nanometer cards
[2154.34 --> 2155.76]  and AMD fills out
[2155.76 --> 2156.62]  their higher end ones
[2156.62 --> 2158.96]  whether you buy NVIDIA or AMD
[2158.96 --> 2160.46]  could basically come down
[2160.46 --> 2161.72]  to how much money you have to spend.
[2162.46 --> 2163.52]  If you're looking at
[2163.52 --> 2165.80]  like a value gaming rig
[2165.80 --> 2167.94]  you may be forced to buy AMD
[2167.94 --> 2169.86]  because NVIDIA's last generation
[2169.86 --> 2171.54]  28 nanometer Maxwell chips
[2171.54 --> 2172.76]  are probably going to make
[2172.76 --> 2174.60]  no sense compared to Polaris.
[2175.02 --> 2176.70]  But if you want a high end rig
[2176.70 --> 2178.40]  I mean unless you want to just start
[2178.40 --> 2180.16]  like stacking RX 480s
[2180.16 --> 2180.76]  into your system
[2180.76 --> 2182.14]  which is never a good strategy
[2182.14 --> 2182.58]  by the way
[2182.58 --> 2183.44]  adding up more cards
[2183.44 --> 2184.52]  you're going to be forced
[2184.52 --> 2185.14]  to buy NVIDIA
[2185.14 --> 2186.14]  because AMD won't have
[2186.14 --> 2187.34]  anything even close
[2187.34 --> 2188.20]  to competing with it.
[2188.20 --> 2189.08]  Yeah.
[2189.66 --> 2190.30]  What he said.
[2191.80 --> 2193.06]  Or you could just lag behind
[2193.06 --> 2193.80]  by like two years
[2193.80 --> 2194.70]  and everything will be fine.
[2195.08 --> 2195.38]  Alright.
[2195.58 --> 2196.24]  Why don't we move
[2196.24 --> 2197.24]  why don't we move on
[2197.24 --> 2198.40]  to a topic that Taren
[2198.40 --> 2199.48]  will like better.
[2200.34 --> 2201.02]  Or 20 years
[2201.02 --> 2201.70]  that's not true.
[2202.48 --> 2204.20]  So this is
[2204.20 --> 2206.48]  I mean this is
[2206.48 --> 2207.32]  one of those things
[2207.32 --> 2208.10]  where it's like
[2208.10 --> 2208.86]  in your 101
[2208.86 --> 2210.00]  philosophy
[2210.00 --> 2211.02]  from like a
[2211.02 --> 2213.00]  philosophy 101
[2213.00 --> 2214.34]  type of standpoint
[2214.34 --> 2215.54]  you know
[2215.54 --> 2216.54]  you could be like
[2216.54 --> 2218.48]  whoa man
[2218.48 --> 2219.94]  I have opinions on this.
[2220.14 --> 2220.88]  Yeah man.
[2221.70 --> 2223.10]  So Elon Musk
[2223.10 --> 2224.02]  Yeah.
[2224.30 --> 2225.42]  The chance we are not
[2225.42 --> 2227.18]  living in a computer simulation
[2227.18 --> 2230.26]  is one in billions.
[2230.68 --> 2231.32]  Where did he get
[2231.32 --> 2232.62]  that number from?
[2232.76 --> 2233.26]  He figures
[2233.26 --> 2234.66]  if we aren't stuck
[2234.66 --> 2236.14]  in a Matrix style world
[2236.14 --> 2237.54]  then the world
[2237.54 --> 2239.10]  is about to end.
[2239.76 --> 2240.36]  Really?
[2241.08 --> 2241.78]  Now how does he
[2241.78 --> 2243.14]  furthermore figure that?
[2243.14 --> 2245.36]  I so disagree with this
[2245.36 --> 2245.94]  by the way
[2245.94 --> 2247.38]  I have lots of reasons.
[2247.46 --> 2248.38]  Why don't you go first
[2248.38 --> 2249.20]  and then I'll go through
[2249.20 --> 2249.92]  and then I'll go through
[2249.92 --> 2250.92]  our notes on Mr. Musk's statements here.
[2250.92 --> 2251.58]  There's a concept
[2251.58 --> 2252.58]  in philosophy
[2252.58 --> 2254.22]  known as falsifiability.
[2254.42 --> 2254.58]  Wait.
[2254.72 --> 2255.40]  Or is that science?
[2255.50 --> 2255.76]  Whatever.
[2256.08 --> 2256.72]  It's a concept.
[2257.64 --> 2258.92]  For something to be
[2258.92 --> 2259.54]  scientific
[2259.54 --> 2261.20]  it needs to be falsifiable.
[2261.72 --> 2262.66]  So you could say
[2262.66 --> 2263.74]  that there's
[2263.74 --> 2264.72]  like there's the example
[2264.72 --> 2266.24]  of the Russell's teapot
[2266.24 --> 2267.40]  floating out between
[2267.40 --> 2269.20]  Mars and Earth.
[2269.52 --> 2270.22]  It could be there
[2270.22 --> 2270.86]  but we don't know
[2270.86 --> 2271.42]  and there's absolutely
[2271.42 --> 2273.04]  no way to prove
[2273.04 --> 2273.82]  A what teapot?
[2274.10 --> 2275.00]  Just a teapot.
[2275.26 --> 2275.52]  Okay.
[2275.90 --> 2276.60]  No, no, okay.
[2276.72 --> 2277.42]  I'm not explaining
[2277.42 --> 2277.98]  this very well.
[2277.98 --> 2278.42]  No, you're not.
[2278.70 --> 2279.22]  No, no, no, okay.
[2279.34 --> 2280.08]  Let's start over
[2280.08 --> 2280.90]  with solipsism
[2280.90 --> 2282.04]  which is the idea
[2282.04 --> 2283.92]  that my mind
[2283.92 --> 2284.62]  is the only one
[2284.62 --> 2285.66]  that I know for sure
[2285.66 --> 2286.34]  exists.
[2286.76 --> 2287.42]  I think therefore
[2287.42 --> 2287.96]  I am.
[2288.14 --> 2288.28]  Right?
[2288.64 --> 2289.76]  Famous thing
[2289.76 --> 2290.40]  in philosophy.
[2291.68 --> 2292.90]  The only thing
[2292.90 --> 2293.62]  why is my phone
[2293.62 --> 2294.08]  making noise?
[2294.18 --> 2294.78]  The only thing
[2294.78 --> 2295.68]  that you can prove
[2295.68 --> 2297.28]  to yourself
[2297.28 --> 2298.62]  absolutely 100%
[2298.62 --> 2300.10]  is that you exist.
[2300.10 --> 2301.12]  Everything beyond
[2301.12 --> 2301.70]  there you have to
[2301.70 --> 2302.26]  take at least
[2302.26 --> 2303.04]  some measure of
[2303.04 --> 2304.32]  faith to accept.
[2305.28 --> 2306.16]  So as long as
[2306.16 --> 2306.78]  your standards of
[2306.78 --> 2307.32]  proof are not
[2307.32 --> 2308.18]  so incredibly
[2308.18 --> 2311.00]  hardcore that you
[2311.00 --> 2311.58]  don't believe
[2311.58 --> 2312.10]  that the world
[2312.10 --> 2313.26]  exists by itself
[2313.26 --> 2314.42]  you can pretty much
[2314.42 --> 2315.04]  accept that the
[2315.04 --> 2315.82]  world is real.
[2316.14 --> 2316.22]  Okay.
[2316.38 --> 2317.94]  So the problem
[2317.94 --> 2318.80]  with saying
[2318.80 --> 2319.38]  that we're in
[2319.38 --> 2319.92]  the matrix
[2319.92 --> 2320.78]  or a computer
[2320.78 --> 2321.38]  simulation
[2321.38 --> 2322.38]  or whatever
[2322.38 --> 2323.00]  is that it's
[2323.00 --> 2323.76]  not falsifiable.
[2324.10 --> 2324.80]  There's no
[2324.80 --> 2326.22]  possible way
[2326.22 --> 2327.34]  to prove that.
[2327.34 --> 2328.72]  there's no way
[2328.72 --> 2329.12]  to prove it
[2329.12 --> 2329.60]  and there's no way
[2329.60 --> 2330.50]  more importantly
[2330.50 --> 2330.94]  there's no way
[2330.94 --> 2331.90]  to disprove it.
[2332.50 --> 2333.36]  And that's why
[2333.36 --> 2334.22]  you can't believe
[2334.22 --> 2334.80]  this and that's
[2334.80 --> 2335.24]  why you can't
[2335.24 --> 2336.04]  make any meaningful
[2336.04 --> 2336.74]  statement upon
[2336.74 --> 2337.44]  how true it is.
[2337.58 --> 2338.14]  It's nice to be
[2338.14 --> 2338.64]  able to speculate
[2338.64 --> 2340.16]  but to put a
[2340.16 --> 2340.66]  number on it
[2340.66 --> 2341.16]  like one out
[2341.16 --> 2341.62]  of a million
[2341.62 --> 2343.28]  or ten million
[2343.28 --> 2343.82]  or whatever he
[2343.82 --> 2344.56]  said that's
[2344.56 --> 2344.96]  ridiculous.
[2345.66 --> 2346.74]  So to be clear
[2346.74 --> 2347.32]  it is a bit
[2347.32 --> 2348.24]  of a sensationalist
[2348.24 --> 2349.24]  headline but
[2349.24 --> 2350.34]  here's sort of
[2350.34 --> 2352.54]  the spiel.
[2353.54 --> 2354.12]  The strongest
[2354.12 --> 2354.98]  argument for us
[2354.98 --> 2355.96]  probably being
[2355.96 --> 2356.62]  in a simulation
[2356.62 --> 2357.36]  I think is
[2357.36 --> 2357.98]  the following
[2357.98 --> 2359.10]  he told the
[2359.10 --> 2360.06]  code conference
[2360.06 --> 2360.74]  in California.
[2361.44 --> 2362.20]  40 years ago
[2362.20 --> 2363.06]  we had pong
[2363.06 --> 2364.86]  two rectangles
[2364.86 --> 2365.30]  and a dot.
[2366.14 --> 2367.20]  Well I'm sold.
[2367.50 --> 2367.68]  Okay.
[2368.16 --> 2368.80]  That's where we
[2368.80 --> 2369.00]  were.
[2370.16 --> 2370.92]  Now 40 years
[2370.92 --> 2371.58]  later we have
[2371.58 --> 2372.42]  photorealistic
[2372.42 --> 2373.22]  3D simulations
[2373.22 --> 2373.90]  with millions
[2373.90 --> 2374.38]  of people
[2374.38 --> 2375.44]  playing simultaneously
[2375.44 --> 2376.04]  and it's getting
[2376.04 --> 2376.74]  better every year.
[2377.32 --> 2377.72]  Soon we'll have
[2377.72 --> 2378.44]  virtual reality
[2378.44 --> 2378.88]  we'll have
[2378.88 --> 2379.82]  augmented reality.
[2380.10 --> 2380.76]  So he said
[2380.76 --> 2381.68]  that if the speed
[2381.68 --> 2382.90]  of these advancements
[2382.90 --> 2384.16]  dropped by a thousand
[2384.16 --> 2385.48]  we would still
[2385.48 --> 2386.82]  be moving forward
[2386.82 --> 2387.60]  at an intense
[2387.60 --> 2388.36]  speed relative
[2388.36 --> 2389.22]  to the age of
[2389.22 --> 2390.60]  life in general.
[2391.14 --> 2392.22]  So it says
[2392.22 --> 2393.90]  probably to the
[2393.90 --> 2394.66]  question of whether
[2394.66 --> 2395.74]  we are all in a
[2395.74 --> 2396.82]  simulated game
[2396.82 --> 2397.86]  and that we should
[2397.86 --> 2398.72]  be hopeful we're
[2398.72 --> 2399.34]  in a simulation
[2399.34 --> 2400.10]  because otherwise
[2400.10 --> 2401.14]  if civilization
[2401.14 --> 2401.96]  stops advancing
[2401.96 --> 2402.56]  then that may be
[2402.56 --> 2403.28]  due to some kind
[2403.28 --> 2404.42]  of calamitous
[2404.42 --> 2405.26]  event that stops
[2405.26 --> 2405.86]  civilization.
[2406.44 --> 2406.92]  So I guess the
[2406.92 --> 2407.70]  argument is that
[2407.70 --> 2408.68]  at the rate that
[2408.68 --> 2410.00]  we are improving
[2410.00 --> 2411.04]  technologically
[2411.04 --> 2413.52]  it shouldn't be
[2413.52 --> 2414.46]  a surprise
[2414.46 --> 2415.20]  that we can
[2415.20 --> 2415.90]  technologically
[2415.90 --> 2417.80]  improve enough
[2417.80 --> 2418.70]  to have a
[2418.70 --> 2419.98]  simulation of us?
[2420.36 --> 2421.28]  Oh well I mean
[2421.28 --> 2422.24]  like it
[2422.24 --> 2423.52]  there's an
[2423.52 --> 2424.22]  interesting story
[2424.22 --> 2424.74]  about this
[2424.74 --> 2425.34]  where they come
[2425.34 --> 2425.70]  up with a
[2425.70 --> 2426.26]  computer that
[2426.26 --> 2426.94]  can simulate
[2426.94 --> 2428.14]  no they come
[2428.14 --> 2428.68]  up with a
[2428.68 --> 2429.24]  computer with
[2429.24 --> 2430.92]  infinite power
[2430.92 --> 2431.92]  right it can
[2431.92 --> 2432.78]  it has infinite
[2432.78 --> 2433.72]  CPU cycles
[2433.72 --> 2434.60]  and so then
[2434.60 --> 2435.06]  they decide
[2435.06 --> 2435.54]  oh let's
[2435.54 --> 2436.52]  simulate the
[2436.52 --> 2436.82]  universe
[2436.82 --> 2437.88]  and they do
[2437.88 --> 2438.70]  that and then
[2438.70 --> 2439.20]  they figure out
[2439.20 --> 2439.62]  oh crap
[2439.62 --> 2440.42]  we're in our
[2440.42 --> 2441.22]  own simulation
[2441.22 --> 2441.94]  because it
[2441.94 --> 2442.64]  goes infinitely
[2442.64 --> 2443.82]  deep so the
[2443.82 --> 2444.22]  chance that you
[2444.22 --> 2444.76]  would be on one
[2444.76 --> 2445.02]  of those
[2445.02 --> 2445.94]  simulation levels
[2445.94 --> 2446.82]  because right the
[2446.82 --> 2447.40]  computer is being
[2447.40 --> 2448.42]  simulated inside of
[2448.42 --> 2448.96]  the computer because
[2448.96 --> 2450.94]  it's infinite so the
[2450.94 --> 2451.34]  chance that you
[2451.34 --> 2451.88]  would be one of
[2451.88 --> 2452.46]  those would you
[2452.46 --> 2453.16]  know is pretty
[2453.16 --> 2454.36]  much guaranteed.
[2454.72 --> 2455.10]  So that seems
[2455.10 --> 2455.82]  like basically the
[2455.82 --> 2456.48]  conversation we're
[2456.48 --> 2456.62]  having.
[2456.74 --> 2457.56]  The trouble is you
[2457.56 --> 2458.70]  cannot make a
[2458.70 --> 2459.52]  computer that can
[2459.52 --> 2460.26]  simulate the
[2460.26 --> 2461.20]  universe without it
[2461.20 --> 2462.08]  being larger than
[2462.08 --> 2463.22]  the universe because
[2463.22 --> 2463.76]  it would have to be
[2463.76 --> 2464.78]  in the universe
[2464.78 --> 2465.74]  right?
[2466.30 --> 2467.08]  No you could have
[2467.08 --> 2468.04]  a data set that
[2468.04 --> 2469.58]  is larger than the
[2469.58 --> 2470.54]  physical computer
[2470.54 --> 2471.12]  itself.
[2473.50 --> 2474.28]  I don't know.
[2475.56 --> 2476.90]  The point is I
[2476.90 --> 2477.86]  mean the universe is
[2477.86 --> 2479.90]  quite a huge thing
[2479.90 --> 2481.14]  and you know what I
[2481.14 --> 2481.96]  think the point is?
[2482.88 --> 2484.36]  Atoms it's like
[2484.36 --> 2485.64]  trillion quintillion
[2485.64 --> 2486.20]  billions.
[2488.10 --> 2489.86]  I think I'm going to
[2489.86 --> 2491.48]  need a second.
[2491.62 --> 2492.44]  All right let's go
[2492.44 --> 2492.82]  ahead and do a
[2492.82 --> 2493.86]  rapid fire topic here.
[2493.98 --> 2495.24]  This one's pretty
[2495.24 --> 2496.08]  light we don't have to
[2496.08 --> 2496.90]  think much about it.
[2496.90 --> 2498.78]  Original article here
[2498.78 --> 2500.00]  is from theverge.com
[2500.00 --> 2500.54]  let's go ahead and
[2500.54 --> 2501.52]  pull this baby up.
[2502.42 --> 2504.84]  Ducky releases a
[2504.84 --> 2506.70]  the Ducky pocket is
[2506.70 --> 2508.00]  a mechanical keyboard
[2508.00 --> 2509.70]  calculator with
[2509.70 --> 2510.76]  Cherry MX switches.
[2510.76 --> 2511.34]  Oh great.
[2511.96 --> 2512.28]  Huh?
[2512.92 --> 2513.28]  Huh?
[2514.28 --> 2515.72]  How awesome is that?
[2516.44 --> 2517.48]  Can I be the voice
[2517.48 --> 2518.68]  of negativity over
[2518.68 --> 2518.88]  here?
[2518.88 --> 2519.42]  You can be the voice
[2519.42 --> 2520.36]  of negativity but I'll
[2520.36 --> 2521.08]  hate you for it.
[2521.08 --> 2522.50]  What's cool about
[2522.50 --> 2523.60]  mechanical keyboards
[2523.60 --> 2526.14]  and I used to not be
[2526.14 --> 2526.98]  so sold on them and
[2526.98 --> 2527.68]  now I understand
[2527.68 --> 2529.78]  why they're cool is
[2529.78 --> 2530.48]  that they're comfortable
[2530.48 --> 2531.16]  to type on.
[2531.28 --> 2531.42]  Yeah.
[2532.08 --> 2533.32]  They're nice to type on.
[2533.32 --> 2533.64]  I don't know.
[2533.82 --> 2536.62]  They're good to type on.
[2536.72 --> 2537.00]  They're good.
[2537.02 --> 2537.68]  But when you're typing
[2537.68 --> 2539.26]  you're doing a lot of
[2539.26 --> 2540.86]  keystrokes quite quickly
[2540.86 --> 2541.88]  and you need to do so
[2541.88 --> 2542.32]  accurately.
[2542.58 --> 2542.84]  Uh-huh.
[2542.98 --> 2544.02]  With a calculator
[2544.02 --> 2545.04]  A calculator.
[2545.84 --> 2546.62]  Not so much.
[2547.12 --> 2548.26]  Or with something like
[2548.26 --> 2548.98]  we have these little
[2548.98 --> 2549.92]  tech keys keyboards
[2549.92 --> 2550.74]  that have like three
[2550.74 --> 2551.54]  keys on them.
[2551.72 --> 2552.78]  Those don't need to be
[2552.78 --> 2553.18]  mechanical.
[2553.82 --> 2555.08]  We don't need fancy
[2555.08 --> 2555.80]  key switches.
[2556.10 --> 2557.38]  We just need buttons.
[2557.58 --> 2558.22]  It doesn't matter.
[2558.30 --> 2558.78]  I'm going to counter
[2558.78 --> 2559.24]  that argument.
[2559.48 --> 2560.44]  Some people touch
[2560.44 --> 2561.36]  type on a number pad.
[2561.82 --> 2562.08]  Okay.
[2562.24 --> 2563.42]  For people who do a
[2563.42 --> 2564.12]  lot of calculations
[2564.12 --> 2565.24]  I can see that being
[2565.24 --> 2565.52]  cool.
[2565.62 --> 2566.22]  Well why would anyone
[2566.22 --> 2566.90]  who doesn't do a lot
[2566.90 --> 2567.78]  of calculations buy a
[2567.78 --> 2568.10]  calculator?
[2568.24 --> 2568.70]  They have one built
[2568.70 --> 2569.24]  into their phone.
[2570.22 --> 2570.82]  That's why I don't
[2570.82 --> 2571.48]  have a calculator.
[2571.84 --> 2572.12]  Right.
[2572.18 --> 2572.80]  It's part of my phone.
[2573.02 --> 2574.56]  So if you were to
[2574.56 --> 2575.52]  buy a calculator
[2575.52 --> 2576.30]  wouldn't you by
[2576.30 --> 2577.46]  definition be the
[2577.46 --> 2578.28]  target audience for
[2578.28 --> 2578.88]  someone who would
[2578.88 --> 2580.22]  need good key
[2580.22 --> 2582.04]  switches on a
[2582.04 --> 2582.40]  calculator?
[2583.16 --> 2584.90]  I just tore your
[2584.90 --> 2585.90]  argument apart son.
[2586.66 --> 2587.64]  You just got WAN
[2587.64 --> 2588.00]  showed.
[2589.28 --> 2590.44]  So basically.
[2590.78 --> 2591.44]  Why are you typing
[2591.44 --> 2592.54]  everything in by hand
[2592.54 --> 2592.86]  anyway?
[2593.12 --> 2594.10]  So basically it's
[2594.10 --> 2595.82]  the same thing as
[2595.82 --> 2597.00]  those standalone
[2597.00 --> 2598.18]  mechanical number
[2598.18 --> 2598.90]  pads that have
[2598.90 --> 2599.62]  existed for quite
[2599.62 --> 2600.34]  some time for
[2600.34 --> 2601.32]  laptop users in
[2601.32 --> 2601.76]  particular.
[2602.04 --> 2603.22]  But now it has an
[2603.22 --> 2604.20]  LCD display on it.
[2604.20 --> 2605.60]  which I personally
[2605.60 --> 2606.22]  think is very cool.
[2606.34 --> 2607.00]  Yeah whatever.
[2608.12 --> 2608.60]  I'm sold.
[2609.30 --> 2609.76]  I'm sold.
[2610.52 --> 2611.24]  Apparently it has
[2611.24 --> 2612.56]  RGB backlighting?
[2612.74 --> 2613.82]  Yeah see that's
[2613.82 --> 2615.36]  definitely pointless.
[2615.74 --> 2616.14]  Badass.
[2616.90 --> 2617.30]  Badass.
[2617.48 --> 2617.84]  Pointless.
[2618.42 --> 2618.86]  Badass.
[2618.86 --> 2619.36]  What do you need
[2619.36 --> 2619.82]  that for?
[2619.84 --> 2620.48]  Well you don't need
[2620.48 --> 2620.66]  it.
[2620.76 --> 2621.54]  No you don't need
[2621.54 --> 2621.66]  it.
[2621.72 --> 2622.48]  It's not about need.
[2622.90 --> 2623.56]  It's about being
[2623.56 --> 2623.96]  cool.
[2624.96 --> 2626.02]  Yeah you know you're
[2626.02 --> 2626.54]  cruising down the
[2626.54 --> 2627.46]  street with your RGB
[2627.46 --> 2629.24]  calculator impressing
[2629.24 --> 2630.00]  all the ladies.
[2632.88 --> 2634.40]  You just type boobies
[2634.40 --> 2634.98]  in it and then you
[2634.98 --> 2635.44]  show it to them.
[2635.56 --> 2635.70]  Yeah.
[2636.26 --> 2637.24]  That would impress
[2637.24 --> 2637.58]  them right?
[2637.58 --> 2637.68]  That's such a good
[2637.68 --> 2638.40]  trick you know.
[2638.58 --> 2639.60]  What else can you
[2639.60 --> 2640.18]  spell on the
[2640.18 --> 2640.56]  calculator?
[2640.84 --> 2641.54]  I can't remember.
[2641.76 --> 2642.18]  I don't know.
[2642.36 --> 2643.00]  It's been a while
[2643.00 --> 2643.86]  since high school.
[2644.04 --> 2644.78]  Definitely boobs.
[2645.44 --> 2646.20]  Yeah well then you
[2646.20 --> 2646.90]  know that's easy.
[2647.02 --> 2647.48]  And boob.
[2648.02 --> 2648.24]  Yeah.
[2648.38 --> 2648.82]  And boob.
[2651.30 --> 2652.06]  Are we done?
[2652.50 --> 2653.28]  We're done with that.
[2653.28 --> 2654.86]  All right let's move
[2654.86 --> 2656.52]  on to our first
[2656.52 --> 2658.18]  sponsor spot of the
[2658.18 --> 2659.16]  day.
[2660.32 --> 2661.76]  DollarShaveClub.com is
[2661.76 --> 2663.36]  apparently missing the
[2663.36 --> 2665.60]  logo because Colton
[2665.60 --> 2667.50]  forgot to tell us to
[2667.50 --> 2667.86]  do it.
[2667.88 --> 2669.30]  Didn't put the logo in
[2669.30 --> 2670.30]  the right place.
[2671.36 --> 2673.60]  DollarShaveClub.com and
[2673.60 --> 2674.08]  the link is
[2674.08 --> 2675.16]  DollarShaveClub.com
[2675.16 --> 2676.14]  slash Linus.
[2676.22 --> 2677.70]  Unfortunately it is
[2677.70 --> 2679.42]  not present at the
[2679.42 --> 2681.26]  bottom of our thing
[2681.26 --> 2682.90]  right now because the
[2682.90 --> 2684.48]  sponsor lower third
[2684.48 --> 2685.48]  folder is completely
[2685.48 --> 2686.74]  empty but that's okay.
[2687.16 --> 2688.08]  Way to go Colton.
[2688.58 --> 2689.48]  DollarShaveClub.com
[2689.48 --> 2690.28]  delivers amazing
[2690.28 --> 2691.04]  razors straight to
[2691.04 --> 2692.02]  your door for a
[2692.02 --> 2693.92]  third of what those
[2693.92 --> 2695.30]  other razor companies
[2695.30 --> 2696.50]  charge giving both
[2696.50 --> 2697.72]  your wallet and your
[2697.72 --> 2699.52]  face some relief.
[2699.62 --> 2700.54]  Using a fresh razor
[2700.54 --> 2702.18]  really really does feel
[2702.18 --> 2703.50]  a lot nicer on the
[2703.50 --> 2704.68]  face and since they
[2704.68 --> 2705.42]  deliver enough for
[2705.42 --> 2706.02]  you to have a new
[2706.02 --> 2707.04]  one every week there
[2707.04 --> 2707.78]  will be nothing we
[2707.78 --> 2708.40]  can do about it.
[2708.74 --> 2709.82]  A new one every week
[2709.82 --> 2711.98]  you will be in pretty
[2711.98 --> 2712.86]  good shape to be
[2712.86 --> 2714.22]  using well there's
[2714.22 --> 2714.90]  nothing you can do
[2714.90 --> 2715.56]  about it trust me.
[2717.06 --> 2717.98]  I've got an idea.
[2718.38 --> 2718.66]  Go ahead.
[2719.12 --> 2719.82]  And for the
[2719.82 --> 2720.68]  smoothest shave ever
[2720.68 --> 2722.20]  all you gotta do is
[2722.20 --> 2722.80]  check out some of
[2722.80 --> 2723.42]  their other bathroom
[2723.42 --> 2723.84]  supplies.
[2723.96 --> 2724.34]  They've got their
[2724.34 --> 2725.24]  Dr. Carver Shave
[2725.24 --> 2726.14]  Butter as well as
[2726.14 --> 2727.30]  their own aftershave
[2727.30 --> 2728.66]  so that you can make
[2728.66 --> 2729.36]  sure all of your
[2729.36 --> 2730.08]  facial needs are
[2730.08 --> 2731.40]  taken care of which
[2731.40 --> 2732.10]  isn't to say that
[2732.10 --> 2732.80]  they only have
[2732.80 --> 2733.36]  products for your
[2733.36 --> 2733.70]  face.
[2733.82 --> 2734.44]  Their one wipe
[2734.44 --> 2735.40]  Charlie's peppermint
[2735.40 --> 2736.10]  scented butt wipes
[2736.10 --> 2737.50]  for men are not for
[2737.50 --> 2738.26]  your face they're for
[2738.26 --> 2738.74]  your butt.
[2739.12 --> 2739.88]  Although if you wanted
[2739.88 --> 2740.62]  to wipe your face
[2740.62 --> 2743.10]  yeah they can't.
[2743.10 --> 2743.74]  It's too small.
[2743.78 --> 2744.62]  They can't see that.
[2745.10 --> 2745.92]  If you wanted to
[2745.92 --> 2746.64]  wipe your face with
[2746.64 --> 2747.44]  them you could.
[2747.68 --> 2748.60]  Just don't do that
[2748.60 --> 2749.38]  after you've wiped
[2749.38 --> 2750.06]  your butt with them.
[2750.42 --> 2750.94]  So head over to
[2750.94 --> 2752.12]  dollarshaveclub.com
[2752.12 --> 2753.00]  slash Linus we'll
[2753.00 --> 2753.66]  have that linked in
[2753.66 --> 2754.36]  the video description
[2754.36 --> 2756.28]  to give them a try
[2756.28 --> 2757.06]  today.
[2757.34 --> 2757.88]  I'm gonna go ahead
[2757.88 --> 2758.84]  and drop that in the
[2758.84 --> 2760.22]  Twitch chat since
[2760.22 --> 2762.48]  yeah otherwise that
[2762.48 --> 2763.56]  link is not gonna be
[2763.56 --> 2764.62]  available anywhere.
[2764.62 --> 2765.14]  there.
[2765.68 --> 2765.88]  Woo.
[2767.24 --> 2768.38]  All right let's
[2768.38 --> 2769.56]  move on to Fresh
[2769.56 --> 2769.90]  Books.
[2770.42 --> 2772.70]  Now if you guys run
[2772.70 --> 2773.82]  a small business or
[2773.82 --> 2774.86]  you know anyone who
[2774.86 --> 2775.98]  runs a small business
[2775.98 --> 2777.70]  check out Fresh
[2777.70 --> 2777.96]  Books.
[2778.34 --> 2779.46]  At least just go to
[2779.46 --> 2780.60]  the link freshbooks.com
[2780.60 --> 2781.38]  slash when we've got
[2781.38 --> 2782.02]  that right here.
[2782.58 --> 2783.52]  Freshbooks.com
[2783.52 --> 2785.42]  slash when and just
[2785.42 --> 2786.70]  have a look at what
[2786.70 --> 2787.22]  they're about.
[2787.38 --> 2788.26]  It's a super simple
[2788.26 --> 2789.34]  to use invoicing tool
[2789.34 --> 2789.92]  this one's working
[2789.92 --> 2790.14]  Taryn.
[2790.40 --> 2791.26]  It's a super simple
[2791.26 --> 2792.32]  to use invoicing tool
[2792.32 --> 2794.46]  that does a lot more
[2794.46 --> 2795.38]  than just help you
[2795.38 --> 2796.34]  create and send
[2796.34 --> 2797.42]  slick looking invoices.
[2797.68 --> 2798.24]  You can keep track
[2798.24 --> 2798.98]  of your time.
[2799.36 --> 2799.98]  You can keep track
[2799.98 --> 2800.90]  of your expenses.
[2801.40 --> 2802.02]  You can keep track
[2802.02 --> 2802.84]  of who owes you
[2802.84 --> 2803.40]  money.
[2803.74 --> 2804.40]  How much.
[2804.74 --> 2805.62]  When it's due.
[2806.16 --> 2806.78]  Speaking of when
[2806.78 --> 2807.36]  it's due you can
[2807.36 --> 2807.94]  actually use it to
[2807.94 --> 2809.00]  take deposits which
[2809.00 --> 2809.80]  depending on the
[2809.80 --> 2810.30]  kind of business
[2810.30 --> 2811.08]  you're running may
[2811.08 --> 2812.22]  be very very useful.
[2812.34 --> 2813.08]  For example when I
[2813.08 --> 2814.22]  used to run a
[2814.22 --> 2815.22]  house painting business
[2815.22 --> 2816.60]  taking a 10% or
[2816.60 --> 2817.98]  15% deposit is
[2817.98 --> 2819.60]  necessary because
[2819.60 --> 2820.28]  otherwise you're
[2820.28 --> 2821.02]  gonna go and buy a
[2821.02 --> 2821.78]  bunch of paint for
[2821.78 --> 2822.46]  the first day on the
[2822.46 --> 2822.96]  job site.
[2823.42 --> 2824.08]  Show up and they're
[2824.08 --> 2824.44]  like yeah I'm
[2824.44 --> 2824.98]  no we booked with
[2824.98 --> 2825.42]  someone else.
[2825.78 --> 2826.46]  Uh no.
[2826.98 --> 2827.40]  Well then I'm
[2827.40 --> 2828.20]  keeping your deposit
[2828.20 --> 2829.14]  and all this paint
[2829.14 --> 2829.54]  yo.
[2829.82 --> 2830.08]  Yeah.
[2830.52 --> 2830.98]  Actually I would
[2830.98 --> 2831.60]  let them keep the
[2831.60 --> 2832.10]  paint because I have
[2832.10 --> 2832.92]  no use for extra
[2832.92 --> 2833.18]  paint.
[2833.26 --> 2833.72]  I just have to
[2833.72 --> 2834.66]  dispose of it which
[2834.66 --> 2836.12]  by the way is not
[2836.12 --> 2837.26]  free in many places.
[2837.78 --> 2838.48]  Well I mean what if
[2838.48 --> 2839.48]  it's like kind of
[2839.48 --> 2840.10]  generic paint.
[2840.20 --> 2840.78]  Well yeah if it's
[2840.78 --> 2842.48]  like black trim paint
[2842.48 --> 2843.16]  or something I would
[2843.16 --> 2844.88]  keep it but if it's
[2844.88 --> 2845.34]  something that I
[2845.34 --> 2845.98]  don't think I can
[2845.98 --> 2846.78]  reuse then I would
[2846.78 --> 2847.40]  definitely want to
[2847.40 --> 2847.96]  get rid of that.
[2849.16 --> 2850.02]  So if you have any
[2850.02 --> 2851.14]  questions they have
[2851.14 --> 2852.20]  support staff that'll
[2852.20 --> 2853.02]  help you but the
[2853.02 --> 2854.20]  whole idea behind
[2854.20 --> 2855.02]  FreshBooks is that
[2855.02 --> 2855.82]  it's designed for
[2855.82 --> 2856.58]  people who are not
[2856.58 --> 2858.16]  necessarily numbers
[2858.16 --> 2859.30]  people and accounting
[2859.30 --> 2859.78]  experts.
[2859.78 --> 2860.54]  So head over to
[2860.54 --> 2861.68]  freshbooks.com slash
[2861.68 --> 2863.46]  when for a free trial
[2863.46 --> 2865.26]  and enter when in the
[2865.26 --> 2865.86]  how did you hear
[2865.86 --> 2866.84]  about us section.
[2867.54 --> 2868.12]  By the way they just
[2868.12 --> 2869.06]  got a mobile card
[2869.06 --> 2869.72]  reader so you can
[2869.72 --> 2870.84]  actually charge people
[2870.84 --> 2871.94]  by credit card as well.
[2871.94 --> 2873.04]  Oh that's actually
[2873.04 --> 2873.72]  very convenient.
[2873.72 --> 2875.36]  Linda.com.
[2875.42 --> 2876.04]  Why don't I let you do
[2876.04 --> 2877.06]  the Linda.com slot.
[2877.14 --> 2878.16]  You love Linda.com.
[2878.36 --> 2879.06]  Well I do.
[2879.34 --> 2881.12]  Actually I just they
[2881.12 --> 2882.80]  do it's not just
[2882.80 --> 2883.72]  software training right
[2883.72 --> 2885.56]  it's like job stuff
[2885.56 --> 2887.12]  training basically.
[2887.82 --> 2888.44]  Don't tell me.
[2888.54 --> 2888.70]  Tell them.
[2888.70 --> 2889.72]  No no no I'm asking you
[2889.72 --> 2890.90]  because there's a lot
[2890.90 --> 2891.78]  more to them than I
[2891.78 --> 2892.92]  even realized at first
[2892.92 --> 2894.16]  because like I use
[2894.16 --> 2896.10]  Linda.com they do
[2896.10 --> 2897.38]  video tutorials on
[2897.38 --> 2898.82]  lots of stuff.
[2898.94 --> 2900.00]  They have lots of
[2900.00 --> 2900.80]  software training.
[2901.38 --> 2902.24]  I learned some stuff
[2902.24 --> 2903.42]  from Excel about
[2903.42 --> 2904.14]  Excel from them.
[2904.22 --> 2904.70]  I learned a lot of
[2904.70 --> 2906.02]  Photoshop stuff some
[2906.02 --> 2907.00]  Premiere stuff After
[2907.00 --> 2907.70]  Effects stuff.
[2909.22 --> 2910.44]  The video tutorials
[2910.44 --> 2911.42]  that they do are like
[2911.42 --> 2912.56]  really good because
[2912.56 --> 2913.64]  they go through
[2913.64 --> 2915.20]  everything like from
[2915.20 --> 2916.28]  the ground up and
[2916.28 --> 2917.20]  they explain it and
[2917.20 --> 2917.54]  you can see it
[2917.54 --> 2918.70]  happening on screen and
[2918.70 --> 2919.78]  it's not just horrible
[2919.78 --> 2920.84]  to follow like so
[2920.84 --> 2921.86]  many tutorials are.
[2922.98 --> 2924.06]  It's just it's great
[2924.06 --> 2925.36]  stuff and they've also
[2925.36 --> 2926.46]  got like photography
[2926.46 --> 2928.32]  animation like you
[2928.32 --> 2929.44]  can just scroll through
[2929.44 --> 2931.22]  just go to Linda.com
[2931.22 --> 2932.04]  and just scroll through
[2932.04 --> 2932.74]  all the stuff that they
[2932.74 --> 2933.72]  offer to get an idea
[2933.72 --> 2935.22]  of what they have.
[2935.34 --> 2936.64]  So stuff like office
[2936.64 --> 2938.50]  applications Photoshop
[2938.50 --> 2939.80]  Adobe Premiere
[2939.80 --> 2940.46]  photography.
[2940.46 --> 2941.24]  I already said that.
[2941.54 --> 2942.52]  I wasn't listening.
[2944.04 --> 2945.20]  Lots of different stuff
[2945.20 --> 2946.12]  it's used by millions
[2946.12 --> 2946.56]  worldwide.
[2946.56 --> 2947.52]  They're adding new
[2947.52 --> 2948.88]  courses all the time.
[2948.96 --> 2949.66]  They're taught by
[2949.66 --> 2951.06]  industry experts.
[2951.52 --> 2952.14]  That's important
[2952.14 --> 2953.40]  because like they'll
[2953.40 --> 2954.62]  tell you like oh this
[2954.62 --> 2955.72]  feature is dumb.
[2955.84 --> 2956.56]  Don't use it.
[2956.80 --> 2957.66]  Well not in those words.
[2957.74 --> 2958.26]  Well it depends on the
[2958.26 --> 2958.52]  guy.
[2958.94 --> 2959.88]  Like Deke is pretty funny.
[2959.96 --> 2960.60]  He does the Photoshop
[2960.60 --> 2961.08]  ones.
[2961.52 --> 2963.30]  He will tell you what to
[2963.30 --> 2963.52]  do.
[2963.64 --> 2964.40]  So you can use it on
[2964.40 --> 2965.40]  your iPhone, on your
[2965.40 --> 2966.26]  Android device.
[2966.38 --> 2967.54]  You can actually download
[2967.54 --> 2968.38]  the videos.
[2968.62 --> 2969.58]  You can skim along
[2969.58 --> 2970.56]  through transcripts of
[2970.56 --> 2971.02]  the courses.
[2971.26 --> 2971.72]  Oh that's really useful.
[2971.72 --> 2972.26]  Find the part that's
[2972.26 --> 2972.68]  interesting.
[2972.68 --> 2974.50]  You can share your
[2974.50 --> 2975.38]  learning plan with
[2975.38 --> 2976.16]  someone else if you
[2976.16 --> 2977.12]  want to sort of go
[2977.12 --> 2977.60]  through the same
[2977.60 --> 2978.42]  curriculum together.
[2978.78 --> 2979.62]  And plans start at only
[2979.62 --> 2981.48]  $25 a month.
[2981.56 --> 2982.22]  So check it over over
[2982.22 --> 2984.10]  at lynda.com slash
[2984.10 --> 2985.50]  when show.
[2986.78 --> 2987.48]  All right.
[2987.58 --> 2988.12]  So we've been adding
[2988.12 --> 2988.48]  some more.
[2988.64 --> 2990.16]  I had a class where
[2990.16 --> 2991.56]  literally the whole
[2991.56 --> 2993.46]  class was like hey
[2993.46 --> 2994.46]  just use Lynda.
[2994.84 --> 2995.48]  And I was like why
[2995.48 --> 2996.26]  did I pay for this
[2996.26 --> 2997.82]  class if they're just
[2997.82 --> 2999.02]  also making me pay for
[2999.02 --> 2999.34]  Lynda.
[2999.34 --> 3000.12]  I should have just
[3000.12 --> 3001.12]  done Lynda in the
[3001.12 --> 3001.30]  first place.
[3001.30 --> 3001.56]  Which would have
[3001.56 --> 3002.14]  been a lot cheaper
[3002.14 --> 3002.74]  than that class
[3002.74 --> 3002.96]  probably.
[3002.96 --> 3004.50]  And so now I just
[3004.50 --> 3005.34]  use Lynda.
[3007.34 --> 3008.24]  All right.
[3008.36 --> 3009.10]  So the next article
[3009.10 --> 3009.92]  here is from
[3009.92 --> 3012.00]  techraptor.net.
[3013.14 --> 3013.66]  Here we go.
[3013.78 --> 3013.88]  Oh.
[3014.42 --> 3014.66]  Whoops.
[3014.72 --> 3015.12]  That was the wrong
[3015.12 --> 3015.30]  one.
[3015.88 --> 3018.28]  That is a controversial
[3018.28 --> 3020.14]  looking thumbnail image
[3020.14 --> 3020.82]  that we've got going on
[3020.82 --> 3020.94]  there.
[3021.22 --> 3023.08]  26 controversial games
[3023.08 --> 3024.84]  pulled from Steam in a
[3024.84 --> 3026.16]  German crackdown.
[3026.62 --> 3027.80]  So the removed games
[3027.80 --> 3029.20]  include Karma
[3029.20 --> 3030.34]  Gettin Max Pack.
[3030.46 --> 3031.96]  That is an old game.
[3032.86 --> 3034.36]  Painkiller Black Edition.
[3035.00 --> 3035.82]  It's like okay.
[3036.20 --> 3036.64]  Postal.
[3036.90 --> 3037.48]  Postal 2.
[3037.74 --> 3038.58]  Postal 3.
[3039.24 --> 3040.02]  Rune Classic.
[3040.18 --> 3040.72]  Time Shift.
[3040.88 --> 3041.54]  Uber Soldier.
[3043.12 --> 3044.38]  Basically some
[3044.38 --> 3045.78]  hyper violent
[3045.78 --> 3046.86]  types of titles.
[3047.50 --> 3048.54]  And this is an attempt
[3048.54 --> 3049.72]  to remove media
[3049.72 --> 3051.10]  which may be harmful
[3051.10 --> 3052.02]  to Germany's
[3052.02 --> 3053.28]  younger audience.
[3054.50 --> 3054.94]  Oh dear.
[3055.04 --> 3055.78]  So the game releases
[3055.78 --> 3056.80]  actually span
[3056.80 --> 3058.86]  an era of 20 years
[3059.20 --> 3059.50]  years.
[3059.50 --> 3060.06]  I was going to say
[3060.06 --> 3061.66]  those are old.
[3062.06 --> 3062.58]  Some of those.
[3062.86 --> 3063.78]  And it appears to be
[3063.78 --> 3064.98]  done accordingly
[3064.98 --> 3067.02]  to the titles
[3067.02 --> 3067.58]  appearing on
[3067.58 --> 3068.52]  The List of Media
[3068.52 --> 3069.74]  Harmful to Young People
[3069.74 --> 3070.64]  also known as
[3070.64 --> 3071.84]  The Index.
[3072.62 --> 3073.34]  So it includes
[3073.34 --> 3073.78]  games,
[3074.04 --> 3074.42]  music,
[3074.68 --> 3074.92]  books,
[3075.06 --> 3075.92]  and movies.
[3075.92 --> 3076.06]  movies.
[3076.62 --> 3077.28]  And when a title
[3077.28 --> 3078.44]  is placed on this list
[3078.44 --> 3079.56]  it is placed in one
[3079.56 --> 3080.84]  of two categories.
[3081.40 --> 3081.92]  List A.
[3082.30 --> 3082.74]  Sorry?
[3082.94 --> 3083.82]  It includes books.
[3083.88 --> 3084.04]  Yep.
[3084.50 --> 3085.40]  They're banning books now.
[3085.60 --> 3087.32]  So List A is unable
[3087.32 --> 3089.10]  to receive a USK rating.
[3089.30 --> 3090.00]  So that's the German
[3090.00 --> 3091.32]  equivalent of ESRB.
[3091.90 --> 3092.96]  So this prevents
[3092.96 --> 3094.24]  an official German release.
[3095.14 --> 3096.48]  And buyers of foreign
[3096.48 --> 3097.72]  versions must not
[3097.72 --> 3098.72]  make the game's content
[3098.72 --> 3099.58]  accessible to minors
[3099.58 --> 3100.28]  in any way.
[3100.28 --> 3102.46]  And List B cannot
[3102.46 --> 3103.66]  be sold at all
[3103.66 --> 3104.26]  within Germany.
[3104.38 --> 3105.26]  So Valve hasn't issued
[3105.26 --> 3106.00]  an official statement
[3106.00 --> 3107.48]  but some of it I get.
[3107.76 --> 3108.54]  So some of these
[3108.54 --> 3110.80]  contain Nazi imagery.
[3111.22 --> 3111.54]  Oh.
[3111.68 --> 3112.18]  Which is
[3112.18 --> 3113.98]  hardcore banned
[3113.98 --> 3114.74]  in Germany, man.
[3114.92 --> 3115.26]  Oh.
[3115.72 --> 3115.94]  Yeah.
[3116.10 --> 3116.96]  That would make sense.
[3116.96 --> 3117.84]  That is definitely
[3117.84 --> 3119.34]  not a thing.
[3120.18 --> 3122.44]  But some of this stuff
[3122.44 --> 3124.14]  does not appear
[3124.14 --> 3124.94]  to have been banned
[3124.94 --> 3126.44]  for that particular reason.
[3126.78 --> 3126.98]  Well,
[3127.18 --> 3127.96]  here's the thing.
[3128.04 --> 3128.60]  I know that there's
[3128.60 --> 3129.28]  a lot of discussions
[3129.28 --> 3131.44]  about do violent
[3131.44 --> 3132.08]  video games
[3132.08 --> 3133.20]  make kids violent.
[3134.10 --> 3134.90]  Do we know
[3134.90 --> 3135.64]  the answer?
[3135.76 --> 3136.70]  We don't know the answer.
[3136.80 --> 3137.40]  Some people think
[3137.40 --> 3138.18]  they know the answer
[3138.18 --> 3138.64]  but...
[3138.64 --> 3139.70]  Has there been
[3139.70 --> 3140.44]  research done?
[3140.60 --> 3141.22]  Because if it
[3141.22 --> 3141.82]  legitimately
[3141.82 --> 3143.30]  causes kids
[3143.30 --> 3144.00]  to be more violent
[3144.00 --> 3145.18]  then that's a concern
[3145.18 --> 3146.02]  for sure.
[3146.64 --> 3148.04]  But do we know?
[3148.32 --> 3149.20]  There's research done
[3149.20 --> 3149.84]  but none of it's
[3149.84 --> 3150.72]  conclusive and anyone
[3150.72 --> 3151.40]  who thinks that
[3151.40 --> 3152.38]  any of it is conclusive
[3152.38 --> 3153.70]  has an agenda
[3153.70 --> 3155.20]  and is trying to
[3155.20 --> 3156.42]  sort of answer it
[3156.42 --> 3157.28]  one way or the other
[3157.28 --> 3157.98]  before they even
[3157.98 --> 3158.84]  go in and look at it.
[3158.84 --> 3160.10]  There's nothing conclusive.
[3160.34 --> 3161.28]  I find that so hard
[3161.28 --> 3161.78]  to believe.
[3162.02 --> 3163.26]  I can personally say
[3163.26 --> 3164.90]  that I was not
[3164.90 --> 3165.40]  made violent
[3165.40 --> 3166.46]  by violent video games.
[3166.48 --> 3166.90]  Yeah, me neither
[3166.90 --> 3167.58]  probably.
[3168.04 --> 3168.44]  But,
[3168.76 --> 3169.26]  yeah, me neither
[3169.26 --> 3169.70]  probably.
[3169.84 --> 3170.26]  I don't know.
[3170.30 --> 3170.82]  You don't strike me
[3170.82 --> 3171.18]  as particularly violent.
[3171.18 --> 3172.50]  No, I'm not violent.
[3172.62 --> 3173.22]  Not like your old
[3173.22 --> 3173.88]  roommate anyway.
[3174.12 --> 3174.82]  Oh, yeah.
[3175.00 --> 3177.48]  I had a guy's roommate
[3177.48 --> 3177.92]  who ended up
[3177.92 --> 3178.78]  killing a few people.
[3179.56 --> 3181.64]  It's a story
[3181.64 --> 3182.34]  for another time.
[3182.36 --> 3182.80]  I'm surprised
[3182.80 --> 3183.50]  he didn't kill you.
[3184.50 --> 3185.06]  I got,
[3185.24 --> 3186.04]  I peaced out of there
[3186.04 --> 3186.64]  real quick.
[3187.14 --> 3187.66]  Yeah, I would too.
[3187.66 --> 3188.32]  He would have.
[3189.02 --> 3189.56]  You think so?
[3190.00 --> 3190.40]  Yes.
[3190.92 --> 3192.46]  He was incredibly unstable.
[3192.94 --> 3194.06]  Very violent person.
[3194.84 --> 3195.26]  And, uh...
[3195.26 --> 3196.14]  Play a lot of video games?
[3196.18 --> 3196.90]  He played a lot of sports.
[3197.74 --> 3198.14]  Interesting.
[3198.22 --> 3199.06]  Hashtag blame sports.
[3199.30 --> 3200.88]  Do sports make kids violent?
[3200.98 --> 3201.28]  Well,
[3201.50 --> 3202.16]  you know,
[3202.28 --> 3203.02]  maybe.
[3204.14 --> 3204.74]  Because, like,
[3204.80 --> 3205.98]  Luke was talking to me
[3205.98 --> 3206.26]  about,
[3206.34 --> 3206.68]  what was it,
[3206.72 --> 3207.16]  lacrosse,
[3207.20 --> 3207.74]  where he was playing
[3207.74 --> 3208.54]  where every time
[3208.54 --> 3208.98]  he'd go out
[3208.98 --> 3210.14]  he would just, like,
[3210.54 --> 3211.34]  hit this one guy
[3211.34 --> 3212.08]  that he didn't like.
[3212.46 --> 3213.02]  Do you remember that?
[3213.28 --> 3213.62]  No,
[3213.72 --> 3214.34]  he never told me
[3214.34 --> 3215.40]  that part of lacrosse.
[3215.42 --> 3216.12]  I wouldn't have played
[3216.12 --> 3216.80]  lacrosse with him
[3216.80 --> 3217.18]  if I'd known that.
[3217.18 --> 3218.10]  That's what I was saying,
[3218.16 --> 3218.86]  but this guy
[3218.86 --> 3220.18]  was a bit bigger than Luke
[3220.18 --> 3220.68]  and he always thought
[3220.68 --> 3221.26]  he could take him
[3221.26 --> 3222.34]  and then Luke always
[3222.34 --> 3223.26]  laid the beat down.
[3223.48 --> 3224.50]  So, yeah,
[3224.86 --> 3225.32]  sports,
[3225.58 --> 3225.90]  you know,
[3226.70 --> 3227.70]  also a concern.
[3227.90 --> 3228.10]  Yeah,
[3228.16 --> 3229.14]  so we should ban sports.
[3229.18 --> 3230.46]  We should ban sports.
[3231.56 --> 3232.08]  Take that.
[3232.08 --> 3233.50]  Speaking of banning,
[3233.58 --> 3234.38]  we should ban
[3234.38 --> 3235.64]  large SSDs
[3235.64 --> 3236.52]  because this looks
[3236.52 --> 3238.56]  freaking awesome.
[3239.42 --> 3239.64]  So,
[3240.06 --> 3241.40]  the original article here
[3241.40 --> 3243.74]  is from news.samsung.com.
[3244.24 --> 3245.18]  Samsung has begun
[3245.18 --> 3246.08]  mass producing
[3246.08 --> 3247.38]  the industry's first
[3247.38 --> 3250.40]  512 gig NVMe SSD
[3250.40 --> 3253.14]  in a single BGA package.
[3253.54 --> 3254.36]  This is to give
[3254.36 --> 3255.32]  more flexibility
[3255.32 --> 3257.38]  in computing device design.
[3257.48 --> 3258.00]  For those of us
[3258.00 --> 3258.32]  who don't know
[3258.32 --> 3260.22]  what a BGA package is,
[3260.46 --> 3260.82]  explain.
[3261.96 --> 3262.40]  you know
[3262.40 --> 3264.50]  what the single chip
[3264.50 --> 3265.60]  on a stick of RAM
[3265.60 --> 3266.08]  looks like?
[3266.46 --> 3267.12]  Just the one
[3267.12 --> 3267.88]  little black chip?
[3267.90 --> 3268.56]  The black thingy
[3268.56 --> 3269.26]  that's kind of square.
[3269.36 --> 3269.44]  Yeah,
[3269.48 --> 3269.88]  you know how there's
[3269.88 --> 3270.34]  a bunch of them?
[3270.36 --> 3270.58]  Yeah.
[3271.40 --> 3273.06]  Each one of those
[3273.06 --> 3274.26]  is a BGA package.
[3274.46 --> 3274.84]  Like that picture,
[3274.92 --> 3275.04]  okay.
[3275.24 --> 3275.38]  Yeah.
[3275.52 --> 3275.86]  So,
[3275.98 --> 3276.78]  this right here
[3276.78 --> 3277.32]  that you guys
[3277.32 --> 3277.98]  are looking at,
[3278.26 --> 3281.72]  that is a 512 gig SSD.
[3281.92 --> 3282.76]  That's half a terabyte.
[3283.74 --> 3285.86]  Un-freaking-real.
[3286.36 --> 3286.54]  So,
[3286.62 --> 3287.78]  we're at the point now
[3287.78 --> 3288.96]  where especially
[3288.96 --> 3289.88]  guys like Samsung,
[3290.00 --> 3290.74]  the only reason
[3290.74 --> 3291.48]  we don't have,
[3291.56 --> 3291.96]  you know,
[3292.56 --> 3293.42]  20 terabyte
[3293.42 --> 3295.02]  or 50 terabyte SSDs
[3295.02 --> 3296.52]  is that the cost
[3296.52 --> 3297.20]  of the controller
[3297.20 --> 3297.74]  and the cost
[3297.74 --> 3298.50]  of all those chips
[3298.50 --> 3299.76]  would simply be
[3299.76 --> 3300.38]  too high
[3300.38 --> 3301.24]  for any customer
[3301.24 --> 3301.86]  to afford it.
[3301.86 --> 3302.18]  Those are like
[3302.18 --> 3303.00]  smaller than a dime,
[3303.08 --> 3303.30]  right?
[3304.26 --> 3304.66]  Yeah,
[3304.72 --> 3305.08]  I'd say they're
[3305.08 --> 3305.60]  about the size
[3305.60 --> 3306.00]  of a dime,
[3306.08 --> 3306.28]  yeah.
[3306.76 --> 3307.08]  So,
[3307.14 --> 3307.64]  what that means
[3307.64 --> 3309.00]  is in a new tablet
[3309.00 --> 3310.92]  or like a two-in-one,
[3311.42 --> 3312.20]  you could have
[3312.20 --> 3313.42]  a full-fledged
[3313.42 --> 3314.30]  NVMe SSD,
[3314.48 --> 3315.72]  albeit not with
[3315.72 --> 3316.50]  the same power
[3316.50 --> 3317.00]  as something
[3317.00 --> 3318.30]  like a 950 Pro,
[3318.30 --> 3320.12]  but a full-fledged
[3320.12 --> 3321.08]  NVMe SSD
[3321.08 --> 3323.56]  in an unheard
[3323.56 --> 3324.20]  of form factor.
[3324.40 --> 3324.42]  Like,
[3324.48 --> 3325.08]  we don't even have
[3325.08 --> 3325.50]  to have
[3325.50 --> 3327.30]  a card on it.
[3327.82 --> 3329.10]  I do not
[3329.10 --> 3330.24]  know pricing
[3330.24 --> 3331.64]  at this time.
[3332.04 --> 3333.10]  All we have
[3333.10 --> 3333.76]  right now
[3333.76 --> 3334.86]  is specs.
[3335.36 --> 3335.66]  So,
[3335.70 --> 3336.06]  they're saying
[3336.06 --> 3336.56]  it's designed
[3336.56 --> 3336.96]  for use
[3336.96 --> 3337.74]  in next-generation
[3337.74 --> 3338.20]  PCs
[3338.20 --> 3339.30]  and ultra-slim
[3339.30 --> 3339.82]  notebooks,
[3340.60 --> 3341.98]  extremely compact
[3341.98 --> 3342.82]  package that contains
[3342.82 --> 3343.96]  all essential
[3343.96 --> 3344.78]  SSD components
[3344.78 --> 3345.58]  including
[3345.58 --> 3347.36]  the NAND flash memory,
[3347.72 --> 3348.36]  the DRAM,
[3348.66 --> 3349.56]  and the controller.
[3350.50 --> 3351.52]  It triples
[3351.52 --> 3352.10]  the performance
[3352.10 --> 3352.68]  of a typical
[3352.68 --> 3353.58]  SATA SSD,
[3354.38 --> 3354.86]  says
[3354.86 --> 3356.48]  Jungbae Lee,
[3356.74 --> 3357.44]  the senior vice
[3357.44 --> 3357.96]  president of
[3357.96 --> 3358.46]  memory product
[3358.46 --> 3358.86]  planning and
[3358.86 --> 3359.66]  application engineering
[3359.66 --> 3360.02]  team,
[3361.22 --> 3362.08]  which is freaking
[3362.08 --> 3363.06]  unbelievable.
[3363.30 --> 3364.12]  It's got 15
[3364.12 --> 3364.78]  of Samsung's
[3364.78 --> 3365.44]  48-layer,
[3365.50 --> 3366.44]  256-gigabit
[3366.44 --> 3367.70]  VNAND flash chips,
[3368.44 --> 3369.78]  one 20-nanometer
[3369.78 --> 3371.16]  4-gig LPDDR4
[3371.16 --> 3372.24]  mobile DRAM chip,
[3372.34 --> 3373.02]  and a high-performance
[3373.02 --> 3373.72]  Samsung controller.
[3373.86 --> 3374.36]  It weighs only
[3374.36 --> 3375.46]  about one gram.
[3375.58 --> 3376.56]  Ha ha ha.
[3376.94 --> 3377.60]  Sequential read
[3377.60 --> 3378.12]  and write speeds
[3378.12 --> 3379.60]  of 1.5 gigabytes
[3379.60 --> 3380.38]  per second
[3380.38 --> 3382.12]  and 900 megabytes
[3382.12 --> 3382.58]  per second
[3382.58 --> 3383.36]  when TurboWrite
[3383.36 --> 3384.54]  technology is used.
[3386.16 --> 3387.40]  Pretty freaking
[3387.40 --> 3388.04]  unbelievable.
[3389.02 --> 3389.86]  Let's go ahead
[3389.86 --> 3390.36]  and start doing
[3390.36 --> 3391.46]  some rapid-fire topics.
[3391.90 --> 3392.12]  Taren,
[3392.50 --> 3393.28]  would you use
[3393.28 --> 3394.50]  a water-cooled laptop?
[3394.92 --> 3395.28]  No.
[3396.08 --> 3396.50]  No.
[3396.98 --> 3397.52]  Based on what
[3397.52 --> 3398.34]  I've seen with Linus
[3398.34 --> 3398.92]  who's supposed to
[3398.92 --> 3399.54]  know what he's doing
[3399.54 --> 3401.00]  and likes water-cooling
[3401.00 --> 3401.82]  and still
[3401.82 --> 3402.62]  stuff gets
[3402.62 --> 3403.60]  corroded and horrible?
[3404.42 --> 3404.76]  No.
[3404.76 --> 3405.68]  That wasn't me
[3405.68 --> 3406.26]  at my best
[3406.26 --> 3407.02]  in all fairness
[3407.02 --> 3407.84]  to water-cooling.
[3407.84 --> 3408.96]  Now hang on though
[3408.96 --> 3410.90]  because I've seen
[3410.90 --> 3411.36]  the insides
[3411.36 --> 3411.76]  of some of these
[3411.76 --> 3412.88]  laptops and they
[3412.88 --> 3413.80]  have the little
[3413.80 --> 3415.08]  tube thingies.
[3415.14 --> 3415.40]  What are those
[3415.40 --> 3415.70]  called?
[3416.12 --> 3416.56]  Heat pipes?
[3416.80 --> 3417.52]  Heat pipes, yes.
[3417.64 --> 3418.60]  Do those have a liquid
[3418.60 --> 3418.94]  in them?
[3419.10 --> 3419.50]  Okay.
[3420.18 --> 3420.94]  You're opening up
[3420.94 --> 3421.58]  a can of worms right now.
[3421.58 --> 3422.28]  Kind of water-cooled
[3422.28 --> 3422.64]  already.
[3422.82 --> 3424.02]  And it's contained.
[3424.42 --> 3425.12]  The point is
[3425.12 --> 3426.56]  it needs to be contained.
[3426.82 --> 3427.40]  You're opening up
[3427.40 --> 3428.00]  a can of worms
[3428.00 --> 3430.06]  because some phone
[3430.06 --> 3430.86]  manufacturers,
[3431.48 --> 3432.94]  including Sony
[3432.94 --> 3433.96]  and,
[3434.04 --> 3436.28]  what's their face?
[3436.38 --> 3437.22]  Someone else is doing it.
[3437.48 --> 3438.76]  Some phone manufacturers
[3438.76 --> 3439.42]  are coming out
[3439.42 --> 3439.72]  and saying
[3439.72 --> 3440.84]  they have water-cooled
[3440.84 --> 3441.28]  phones
[3441.28 --> 3442.82]  because their phone
[3442.82 --> 3443.98]  contains a heat pipe.
[3443.98 --> 3445.92]  But that is not
[3445.92 --> 3447.46]  strictly speaking
[3447.46 --> 3448.58]  true.
[3449.36 --> 3450.32]  A heat pipe
[3450.32 --> 3451.86]  contains a fluid,
[3452.38 --> 3452.70]  yes,
[3452.84 --> 3455.24]  and when it's cold
[3455.24 --> 3456.42]  in one part
[3456.42 --> 3457.20]  of the heat pipe
[3457.20 --> 3458.64]  it will be liquid.
[3459.14 --> 3459.70]  So they actually,
[3459.88 --> 3460.68]  I believe they lower
[3460.68 --> 3461.82]  the pressure inside them
[3461.82 --> 3462.54]  so that the
[3462.54 --> 3463.66]  depresation point
[3463.66 --> 3464.68]  of the liquid
[3464.68 --> 3465.76]  actually gets lower
[3465.76 --> 3466.04]  anyway.
[3466.54 --> 3467.54]  So the idea
[3467.54 --> 3468.26]  is that
[3468.26 --> 3470.38]  at a cold point
[3470.38 --> 3471.28]  in the heat pipe
[3471.28 --> 3472.36]  that would be
[3472.36 --> 3473.38]  where your heat sink is.
[3473.38 --> 3474.66]  It will turn to liquid
[3474.66 --> 3475.46]  and wick
[3475.46 --> 3477.20]  back to the heat source
[3477.20 --> 3478.56]  where it will evaporate
[3478.56 --> 3479.42]  and flow.
[3479.88 --> 3480.60]  So in a sense,
[3480.98 --> 3481.38]  yes,
[3481.96 --> 3483.34]  liquid is moving
[3483.34 --> 3484.36]  inside the heat pipe
[3484.36 --> 3485.54]  but it is,
[3485.70 --> 3486.62]  it will not achieve
[3486.62 --> 3488.18]  nearly the efficiency
[3488.18 --> 3489.38]  of a full-on
[3489.38 --> 3490.34]  liquid loop.
[3490.64 --> 3491.42]  Because it's a loop.
[3491.90 --> 3492.52]  Because...
[3492.52 --> 3493.24]  Is that the difference?
[3493.68 --> 3494.62]  A loop with a pump?
[3495.84 --> 3496.40]  Well,
[3496.60 --> 3497.82]  it's to do with,
[3497.82 --> 3498.92]  it's to do with conduction.
[3499.50 --> 3501.26]  So having more volume
[3501.26 --> 3502.02]  of water
[3502.02 --> 3503.20]  making contact
[3503.20 --> 3503.40]  contact
[3503.40 --> 3505.28]  with more surface area
[3505.28 --> 3506.54]  of copper heat sink
[3506.54 --> 3508.02]  is better.
[3508.24 --> 3508.96]  Having the water
[3508.96 --> 3510.14]  move at high speed
[3510.14 --> 3511.32]  is better.
[3512.12 --> 3512.38]  Having,
[3512.46 --> 3512.68]  again,
[3512.78 --> 3513.96]  having more water
[3513.96 --> 3514.80]  is better
[3514.80 --> 3516.52]  for absorbing
[3516.52 --> 3518.12]  little spikes
[3518.12 --> 3519.56]  in thermal output
[3519.56 --> 3521.08]  because the water
[3521.08 --> 3521.64]  itself
[3521.64 --> 3522.52]  will take quite a bit
[3522.52 --> 3523.38]  of time to heat up
[3523.38 --> 3524.82]  even if you don't
[3524.82 --> 3525.44]  have anything
[3525.44 --> 3526.32]  actively cooling it.
[3526.32 --> 3526.86]  So it would make
[3526.86 --> 3527.88]  something like a phone
[3527.88 --> 3528.68]  if you could actually
[3528.68 --> 3529.38]  water cool it
[3529.38 --> 3530.16]  and there was a significant
[3530.16 --> 3531.52]  volume of water inside,
[3531.52 --> 3532.52]  it would mean that
[3532.52 --> 3533.10]  when you start
[3533.10 --> 3533.78]  playing a game
[3533.78 --> 3534.46]  it would take much
[3534.46 --> 3535.48]  longer to start
[3535.48 --> 3536.22]  thermal throttling
[3536.22 --> 3536.88]  for example
[3536.88 --> 3537.30]  because you'd have
[3537.30 --> 3537.86]  to heat up
[3537.86 --> 3538.44]  all that water
[3538.44 --> 3539.76]  and water can absorb
[3539.76 --> 3541.40]  a lot of thermal energy
[3541.40 --> 3542.30]  before the temperature
[3542.30 --> 3543.22]  of it actually rises.
[3543.22 --> 3544.02]  Is there not a better
[3544.02 --> 3545.06]  liquid than water
[3545.06 --> 3545.90]  that can absorb
[3545.90 --> 3546.80]  even more heat?
[3547.06 --> 3548.36]  I think most heat pipes
[3548.36 --> 3549.36]  do use water.
[3550.22 --> 3550.86]  With maybe some extra
[3550.86 --> 3551.46]  stuff in there.
[3551.48 --> 3552.24]  Some of them may use
[3552.24 --> 3553.86]  alcohols of some sort.
[3554.08 --> 3554.86]  I'm not a heat pipe
[3554.86 --> 3555.72]  expert unfortunately.
[3555.72 --> 3557.78]  Alright so let's talk
[3557.78 --> 3558.50]  about this water
[3558.50 --> 3559.06]  cooled laptop.
[3559.28 --> 3560.84]  This is the GX800
[3560.84 --> 3561.54]  the successor
[3561.54 --> 3563.08]  to the GX700.
[3563.62 --> 3565.10]  It can run on its own
[3565.10 --> 3566.04]  just like its predecessor
[3566.04 --> 3567.34]  but it can also clip
[3567.34 --> 3569.16]  into this quick release
[3569.16 --> 3570.22]  enabled base
[3570.22 --> 3571.24]  that includes
[3571.24 --> 3572.00]  water cooling.
[3572.62 --> 3573.44]  This is great.
[3573.52 --> 3573.92]  So this is over
[3573.92 --> 3574.64]  on TechRadar.
[3575.42 --> 3576.34]  Positive things.
[3576.56 --> 3577.26]  Very powerful.
[3577.80 --> 3578.58]  Color customizable
[3578.58 --> 3579.66]  mechanical keyboard.
[3580.30 --> 3581.96]  Thermo hydro clocking
[3581.96 --> 3582.44]  unlocks.
[3582.68 --> 3583.86]  Overclocking for everything.
[3584.74 --> 3585.34]  Bad.
[3585.72 --> 3587.16]  Extreme power needs.
[3588.00 --> 3588.96]  Oh really?
[3590.66 --> 3592.04]  Yeah so describing
[3592.04 --> 3593.34]  the last one they released
[3593.34 --> 3594.84]  as absolutely mental
[3594.84 --> 3596.56]  I think is probably
[3596.56 --> 3597.62]  an understatement.
[3597.86 --> 3598.26]  Mental in a good
[3598.26 --> 3599.02]  or a bad way?
[3599.48 --> 3601.16]  I think they just mean
[3601.16 --> 3602.30]  mental in a mentally
[3602.30 --> 3603.60]  insane way.
[3603.96 --> 3605.22]  Well but like
[3605.22 --> 3606.22]  is it good or bad?
[3606.70 --> 3607.96]  I'm a simple man.
[3608.12 --> 3608.92]  I have simple answers.
[3609.20 --> 3611.30]  It's heavy and expensive
[3611.30 --> 3613.46]  and powerful.
[3613.46 --> 3616.14]  It has a
[3616.14 --> 3617.98]  GTX 980.
[3621.08 --> 3621.76]  Yeah.
[3622.12 --> 3622.86]  Apparently this one
[3622.86 --> 3624.18]  has two 980s
[3624.18 --> 3625.94]  which is
[3625.94 --> 3626.70]  what?
[3626.70 --> 3627.20]  That's insane.
[3627.22 --> 3627.46]  Really?
[3628.02 --> 3629.56]  Hold on a second here.
[3630.24 --> 3631.16]  Two 980s
[3631.16 --> 3631.72]  stuffed in there?
[3631.72 --> 3632.08]  What?
[3633.08 --> 3633.80]  You sure?
[3635.06 --> 3635.54]  Yeah.
[3636.02 --> 3636.70]  Apparently it has
[3636.70 --> 3637.76]  two 980s in it.
[3637.84 --> 3638.52]  Do we have one?
[3638.52 --> 3639.96]  The laptop actually comes
[3639.96 --> 3643.42]  with two 330 watt power supplies
[3643.42 --> 3646.04]  meaning that this laptop
[3646.04 --> 3648.80]  actually I had not gone far enough
[3648.80 --> 3650.30]  to realize it had two 980s in it.
[3650.46 --> 3652.18]  This laptop will consume
[3652.18 --> 3653.46]  as much power
[3653.46 --> 3655.86]  as a desktop
[3655.86 --> 3660.12]  and be about as portable
[3660.12 --> 3661.10]  really as a desktop
[3661.10 --> 3662.02]  with a screen
[3662.02 --> 3662.90]  on the side panel.
[3663.14 --> 3663.34]  Yeah.
[3664.58 --> 3665.96]  So make of that
[3665.96 --> 3666.50]  what you will.
[3667.14 --> 3668.00]  It's not the only
[3668.00 --> 3668.84]  ridiculous thing
[3668.84 --> 3669.68]  that Asus released
[3669.68 --> 3670.16]  at the show.
[3670.26 --> 3671.00]  The Zenbo
[3671.00 --> 3672.50]  proves that
[3672.50 --> 3673.80]  this is a great
[3673.80 --> 3675.54]  headline from Engadget.
[3675.90 --> 3676.50]  Proves that our
[3676.50 --> 3677.80]  robot butler dreams
[3677.80 --> 3678.94]  remain just that.
[3680.48 --> 3681.76]  The promotional video
[3681.76 --> 3682.46]  for this thing
[3682.46 --> 3684.24]  is freaking creepy.
[3684.24 --> 3685.18]  Oh wow.
[3685.30 --> 3685.96]  That face.
[3686.24 --> 3687.54]  They could have chosen
[3687.54 --> 3688.96]  any other face.
[3689.62 --> 3690.44]  Let me go ahead
[3690.44 --> 3691.60]  and move the
[3691.60 --> 3693.60]  move this down.
[3693.74 --> 3694.14]  There you go.
[3694.20 --> 3695.10]  So we can put this
[3695.10 --> 3695.42]  full screen.
[3695.60 --> 3696.50]  Appreciate the
[3696.50 --> 3696.86]  thing.
[3696.86 --> 3697.46]  This thing
[3697.46 --> 3698.62]  is freaking
[3698.62 --> 3700.04]  here's the
[3700.04 --> 3701.24]  here's the YouTube video.
[3701.42 --> 3702.42]  You guys don't even
[3702.42 --> 3703.24]  really need audio
[3703.24 --> 3703.90]  but it's like
[3703.90 --> 3705.38]  it's just so
[3705.38 --> 3706.28]  weird.
[3706.48 --> 3707.48]  Like it introduces
[3707.48 --> 3708.08]  all these
[3708.08 --> 3709.16]  characters
[3709.16 --> 3711.02]  or something
[3711.02 --> 3712.78]  and then it shows
[3712.78 --> 3713.18]  how
[3713.18 --> 3715.08]  Zenbo
[3715.08 --> 3716.00]  helps them.
[3716.32 --> 3716.62]  Yeah but what
[3716.62 --> 3717.64]  it doesn't have arms.
[3717.82 --> 3718.12]  And then
[3718.12 --> 3719.32]  well he tells
[3719.32 --> 3720.02]  grandpa to take
[3720.02 --> 3720.70]  his medication
[3720.70 --> 3721.16]  or like
[3721.16 --> 3721.70]  But your phone
[3721.70 --> 3722.24]  could do that.
[3722.32 --> 3723.12]  He takes pictures
[3723.12 --> 3723.84]  with a terrible
[3723.84 --> 3724.42]  camera.
[3724.68 --> 3725.10]  But your phone
[3725.10 --> 3725.76]  could do that.
[3727.08 --> 3727.50]  Yes.
[3729.08 --> 3729.48]  But
[3729.48 --> 3730.70]  They're all gonna be
[3730.70 --> 3731.84]  waist high level
[3731.84 --> 3732.28]  pictures.
[3732.28 --> 3732.78]  Then like
[3732.78 --> 3734.78]  grandpa falls down
[3734.78 --> 3735.66]  in this like
[3735.66 --> 3736.14]  weird
[3736.14 --> 3737.04]  slow-mo
[3737.04 --> 3737.54]  sequence
[3737.54 --> 3738.96]  and then
[3738.96 --> 3739.80]  Zenbo
[3739.80 --> 3740.66]  gives mom
[3740.66 --> 3741.48]  a live view
[3741.48 --> 3742.06]  of how
[3742.06 --> 3742.62]  grandpa fell
[3742.62 --> 3743.12]  down
[3743.12 --> 3743.96]  and
[3743.96 --> 3745.04]  makes sure
[3745.04 --> 3745.62]  that grandpa's
[3745.62 --> 3746.12]  okay
[3746.12 --> 3747.60]  and stuff.
[3747.84 --> 3747.96]  It's
[3747.96 --> 3748.76]  look at him
[3748.76 --> 3749.64]  like smiling
[3749.64 --> 3750.74]  while grandpa falls.
[3751.00 --> 3751.88]  Can he recognize
[3751.88 --> 3752.72]  that a person
[3752.72 --> 3753.58]  has fallen down?
[3753.68 --> 3754.22]  I mean computer
[3754.22 --> 3754.92]  vision is
[3754.92 --> 3755.58]  a difficult
[3755.58 --> 3756.08]  thing to
[3756.08 --> 3756.78]  do.
[3757.00 --> 3757.96]  Yeah I'm
[3757.96 --> 3759.26]  What if a dog
[3759.26 --> 3760.16]  falls to the floor
[3760.16 --> 3760.94]  and just kind of
[3760.94 --> 3761.60]  walks away?
[3761.80 --> 3762.34]  I mean will it
[3762.34 --> 3763.20]  be able to tell
[3763.20 --> 3763.72]  the difference?
[3763.96 --> 3764.38]  Yeah I'm
[3764.38 --> 3764.94]  really not
[3764.94 --> 3765.36]  sold on the
[3765.36 --> 3765.84]  it's like
[3765.84 --> 3766.90]  an 11 minute
[3766.90 --> 3767.66]  long video.
[3767.94 --> 3768.94]  Does it have any
[3768.94 --> 3769.98]  useful information?
[3771.18 --> 3772.06]  If you were
[3772.06 --> 3772.80]  looking to buy
[3772.80 --> 3773.32]  a Zenbo
[3773.32 --> 3773.78]  and you were
[3773.78 --> 3774.40]  wondering about
[3774.40 --> 3774.82]  the things
[3774.82 --> 3775.18]  that it
[3775.18 --> 3776.22]  theoretically does
[3776.22 --> 3777.46]  then yes
[3777.46 --> 3777.98]  it contains
[3777.98 --> 3778.52]  a lot of
[3778.52 --> 3779.36]  useful information.
[3779.72 --> 3780.56]  Otherwise I
[3780.56 --> 3780.90]  would say
[3780.90 --> 3781.44]  it's 11
[3781.44 --> 3782.58]  agonizing minutes
[3782.58 --> 3783.50]  of I sure
[3783.50 --> 3784.14]  wish that
[3784.14 --> 3785.50]  the Zenbo
[3785.50 --> 3786.14]  was a product
[3786.14 --> 3786.58]  that anyone
[3786.58 --> 3787.44]  could care about
[3787.44 --> 3788.08]  and that
[3788.08 --> 3789.70]  and that
[3789.70 --> 3790.02]  he just
[3790.02 --> 3790.46]  hadn't spent
[3790.46 --> 3790.84]  their time
[3790.84 --> 3791.36]  doing something
[3791.36 --> 3791.62]  else.
[3792.56 --> 3793.48]  So here's
[3793.48 --> 3794.08]  the functionality
[3794.08 --> 3794.58]  it apparently
[3794.58 --> 3794.90]  has.
[3795.10 --> 3795.38]  It can
[3795.38 --> 3795.66]  detect
[3795.66 --> 3796.18]  faces.
[3796.98 --> 3797.66]  It can
[3797.66 --> 3798.02]  apparently
[3798.02 --> 3798.44]  help with
[3798.44 --> 3798.74]  cooking
[3798.74 --> 3799.12]  because it
[3799.12 --> 3799.42]  can put
[3799.42 --> 3800.02]  recipes up
[3800.02 --> 3800.24]  on its
[3800.24 --> 3800.52]  screen
[3800.52 --> 3800.92]  although I
[3800.92 --> 3801.26]  can't think
[3801.26 --> 3801.66]  of a reason
[3801.66 --> 3802.08]  that I would
[3802.08 --> 3802.80]  want a robot
[3802.80 --> 3803.48]  on the floor
[3803.48 --> 3804.12]  with my recipe
[3804.12 --> 3804.62]  on its face.
[3804.62 --> 3805.04]  You'd have to
[3805.04 --> 3805.46]  pick it up
[3805.46 --> 3805.82]  and put it
[3805.82 --> 3806.50]  on the counter
[3806.50 --> 3807.88]  which is like
[3807.88 --> 3808.46]  I could have
[3808.46 --> 3808.88]  a laptop
[3808.88 --> 3809.44]  to do that.
[3809.46 --> 3809.90]  It has built
[3809.90 --> 3810.34]  in speakers
[3810.34 --> 3811.00]  for music.
[3811.52 --> 3812.40]  It can connect
[3812.40 --> 3813.18]  to smart devices
[3813.18 --> 3813.58]  like air
[3813.58 --> 3814.02]  conditioners,
[3814.14 --> 3814.78]  lighting TVs
[3814.78 --> 3815.44]  and connected
[3815.44 --> 3816.06]  door locks.
[3816.54 --> 3817.64]  Oh I would
[3817.64 --> 3818.08]  not want to
[3818.08 --> 3818.46]  connect.
[3818.64 --> 3819.02]  It can move
[3819.02 --> 3819.64]  around independently
[3819.64 --> 3821.16]  assuming that
[3821.16 --> 3821.44]  your house
[3821.44 --> 3821.82]  doesn't have
[3821.82 --> 3822.64]  any stairs.
[3824.08 --> 3825.32]  And it will
[3825.32 --> 3825.62]  learn
[3825.62 --> 3825.94]  I've fallen
[3825.94 --> 3826.42]  but I can't
[3826.42 --> 3826.82]  get up.
[3826.92 --> 3827.20]  And it will
[3827.20 --> 3827.78]  apparently learn
[3827.78 --> 3828.26]  and adapt
[3828.26 --> 3828.84]  to how you
[3828.84 --> 3829.32]  use it.
[3829.44 --> 3829.82]  Of course
[3829.82 --> 3830.20]  it will.
[3831.06 --> 3831.66]  Well one
[3831.66 --> 3832.20]  solution
[3832.20 --> 3832.76]  So does the
[3832.76 --> 3833.64]  mechanoid G15
[3833.64 --> 3834.10]  and that thing
[3834.10 --> 3834.78]  was awful.
[3835.04 --> 3835.64]  One solution
[3835.64 --> 3836.20]  to getting
[3836.20 --> 3837.62]  your stupid
[3837.62 --> 3838.54]  butler upstairs
[3838.54 --> 3839.46]  would be a
[3839.46 --> 3840.62]  dumb waiter.
[3844.44 --> 3845.26]  Can we move
[3845.26 --> 3845.68]  on now?
[3845.70 --> 3846.08]  Yeah we can
[3846.08 --> 3846.42]  move on.
[3848.02 --> 3848.70]  What else
[3848.70 --> 3849.54]  we got here?
[3850.04 --> 3850.76]  Like robotics
[3850.76 --> 3851.38]  you know
[3851.38 --> 3853.16]  you would
[3853.16 --> 3854.76]  there's some
[3854.76 --> 3855.26]  impressive
[3855.26 --> 3856.94]  hurdles that
[3856.94 --> 3857.32]  have been
[3857.32 --> 3858.04]  made
[3858.04 --> 3858.94]  but
[3858.94 --> 3860.84]  this thing
[3860.84 --> 3861.46]  is way
[3861.46 --> 3861.94]  too early
[3861.94 --> 3862.52]  like there's
[3862.52 --> 3862.84]  no way
[3862.84 --> 3863.10]  that it's
[3863.10 --> 3863.22]  going to
[3863.22 --> 3863.44]  have the
[3863.44 --> 3863.78]  functionality
[3863.78 --> 3864.24]  that you
[3864.24 --> 3864.88]  would want
[3864.88 --> 3865.60]  from a
[3865.60 --> 3866.28]  robot assistant.
[3866.58 --> 3866.90]  Not even
[3866.90 --> 3867.30]  close.
[3867.38 --> 3867.68]  Not even
[3867.68 --> 3868.06]  close.
[3868.20 --> 3868.52]  Like it
[3868.52 --> 3868.90]  doesn't have
[3868.90 --> 3869.26]  an arm.
[3869.84 --> 3870.20]  Give it
[3870.20 --> 3870.76]  one arm.
[3871.36 --> 3871.76]  That's all
[3871.76 --> 3872.06]  you need
[3872.06 --> 3872.40]  hey one
[3872.40 --> 3872.62]  arm?
[3872.76 --> 3874.16]  Well I
[3874.16 --> 3875.24]  mean that's
[3875.24 --> 3875.46]  where you
[3875.46 --> 3875.76]  start.
[3877.44 --> 3878.08]  You're so
[3878.08 --> 3878.40]  immature.
[3878.96 --> 3879.86]  I always
[3879.86 --> 3880.56]  you know
[3880.56 --> 3881.02]  forget.
[3881.90 --> 3882.22]  I don't know
[3882.22 --> 3882.52]  why.
[3882.52 --> 3882.96]  Indian
[3882.96 --> 3883.56]  customers
[3883.56 --> 3884.40]  hit hard
[3884.40 --> 3884.90]  on Nvidia
[3884.90 --> 3886.00]  for insane
[3886.00 --> 3886.70]  pricing of
[3886.70 --> 3887.14]  their 1080
[3887.14 --> 3887.94]  graphics card.
[3888.58 --> 3889.02]  So the
[3889.02 --> 3889.72]  founders edition
[3889.72 --> 3890.46]  is supposed
[3890.46 --> 3890.72]  to be
[3890.72 --> 3891.34]  somewhere in
[3891.34 --> 3891.74]  the neighborhood
[3891.74 --> 3892.52]  of $699
[3892.52 --> 3893.22]  US with
[3893.22 --> 3893.98]  $599
[3893.98 --> 3894.80]  being more
[3894.80 --> 3895.10]  like what
[3895.10 --> 3895.54]  you'd expect
[3895.54 --> 3896.32]  for regular
[3896.32 --> 3896.90]  models
[3896.90 --> 3897.66]  non-reference
[3897.66 --> 3897.90]  cards.
[3899.18 --> 3899.60]  So on
[3899.60 --> 3900.26]  May 27th
[3900.26 --> 3900.46]  it was
[3900.46 --> 3900.88]  officially
[3900.88 --> 3901.28]  released
[3901.28 --> 3901.42]  and
[3901.42 --> 3901.82]  officially
[3901.82 --> 3902.22]  available
[3902.22 --> 3902.60]  on
[3902.60 --> 3903.86]  Amazon.in
[3903.86 --> 3904.38]  one of
[3904.38 --> 3904.72]  the top
[3904.72 --> 3905.28]  three online
[3905.28 --> 3905.62]  shopping
[3905.62 --> 3906.00]  websites
[3906.00 --> 3906.62]  in India.
[3907.50 --> 3907.98]  Zotac,
[3908.12 --> 3908.56]  Gigabyte
[3908.56 --> 3909.24]  and Asus
[3909.24 --> 3909.96]  apparently have
[3909.96 --> 3910.44]  their prices
[3910.44 --> 3910.80]  listed
[3910.80 --> 3912.30]  57% to
[3912.30 --> 3913.46]  87%
[3913.46 --> 3914.46]  higher than
[3914.46 --> 3914.82]  the price
[3914.82 --> 3915.32]  announced at
[3915.32 --> 3915.92]  Nvidia's launch
[3915.92 --> 3916.16]  event.
[3916.64 --> 3917.00]  So prices
[3917.00 --> 3917.38]  should be
[3917.38 --> 3918.02]  at around
[3918.02 --> 3919.28]  47,000
[3919.28 --> 3920.58]  rupees but
[3920.58 --> 3921.06]  cards are
[3921.06 --> 3921.70]  listed around
[3921.70 --> 3924.06]  71,500
[3924.06 --> 3924.66]  rupees or
[3924.66 --> 3924.98]  about
[3924.98 --> 3926.58]  1,070
[3926.58 --> 3928.12]  US dollars.
[3928.12 --> 3929.50]  I would
[3929.50 --> 3929.80]  love to
[3929.80 --> 3930.04]  give the
[3930.04 --> 3930.44]  benefit of
[3930.44 --> 3930.72]  the doubt
[3930.72 --> 3931.04]  and say
[3931.04 --> 3931.40]  Indian
[3931.40 --> 3931.84]  retailers
[3931.84 --> 3932.34]  probably
[3932.34 --> 3932.98]  screwed up
[3932.98 --> 3933.44]  the model
[3933.44 --> 3934.08]  number and
[3934.08 --> 3934.68]  the pricing
[3934.68 --> 3935.24]  columns.
[3936.86 --> 3938.02]  But that's
[3938.02 --> 3938.70]  probably not
[3938.70 --> 3939.48]  what happened.
[3939.66 --> 3939.90]  I mean
[3939.90 --> 3940.84]  the reality
[3940.84 --> 3941.42]  of it is
[3941.42 --> 3941.92]  whether it's
[3941.92 --> 3942.60]  due to
[3942.60 --> 3943.40]  tariffs or
[3943.40 --> 3944.98]  taxes or
[3944.98 --> 3946.54]  any other
[3946.54 --> 3947.84]  wide variety
[3947.84 --> 3948.38]  of reasons
[3948.38 --> 3949.42]  sometimes US
[3949.42 --> 3950.38]  pricing does
[3950.38 --> 3950.98]  not translate
[3950.98 --> 3951.36]  to other
[3951.36 --> 3951.84]  countries.
[3952.62 --> 3953.30]  With that
[3953.30 --> 3953.76]  said,
[3954.74 --> 3955.72]  this does
[3955.72 --> 3956.48]  look a
[3956.48 --> 3957.00]  little bit
[3957.00 --> 3957.70]  like pure
[3957.70 --> 3959.10]  gouging to
[3959.10 --> 3959.82]  me.
[3961.02 --> 3961.40]  You gotta
[3961.40 --> 3962.88]  gouge
[3962.88 --> 3963.26]  someone.
[3964.14 --> 3964.42]  So you
[3964.42 --> 3964.76]  know what?
[3965.28 --> 3965.94]  Let's do
[3965.94 --> 3966.50]  another straw
[3966.50 --> 3967.00]  pool here.
[3967.06 --> 3967.28]  I want to
[3967.28 --> 3967.58]  hear from
[3967.58 --> 3968.14]  you guys.
[3969.04 --> 3969.84]  Do US
[3969.84 --> 3970.28]  prices
[3970.28 --> 3972.54]  translate to
[3972.54 --> 3973.02]  where you
[3973.02 --> 3973.36]  live?
[3973.74 --> 3974.46]  Because honestly
[3974.46 --> 3974.90]  here in
[3974.90 --> 3975.88]  Canada they
[3975.88 --> 3976.38]  pretty much
[3976.38 --> 3976.74]  do.
[3977.12 --> 3977.74]  In some
[3977.74 --> 3978.38]  cases no.
[3978.38 --> 3978.60]  These are
[3978.60 --> 3979.44]  pricier here.
[3979.62 --> 3980.16]  Some things
[3980.16 --> 3980.50]  are but
[3980.50 --> 3980.98]  computer
[3980.98 --> 3981.64]  components
[3981.64 --> 3982.92]  are generally
[3982.92 --> 3983.76]  once you
[3983.76 --> 3984.22]  factor in
[3984.22 --> 3984.86]  exchange rate
[3984.86 --> 3985.52]  and factor in
[3985.52 --> 3985.96]  that shipping
[3985.96 --> 3986.78]  does just
[3986.78 --> 3987.18]  cost a
[3987.18 --> 3987.50]  little more
[3987.50 --> 3987.86]  up here.
[3988.38 --> 3988.68]  They are
[3988.68 --> 3989.24]  pretty darn
[3989.24 --> 3989.68]  close.
[3990.44 --> 3991.06]  You might
[3991.06 --> 3991.40]  not see
[3991.40 --> 3991.94]  the same
[3991.94 --> 3992.92]  Black Friday
[3992.92 --> 3993.42]  deals for
[3993.42 --> 3994.10]  example but
[3994.10 --> 3995.08]  general pricing
[3995.08 --> 3995.72]  day to day
[3995.72 --> 3997.08]  is actually
[3997.08 --> 3997.84]  very very
[3997.84 --> 3998.22]  close.
[3998.42 --> 3998.82]  So I want
[3998.82 --> 3999.20]  to hear from
[3999.20 --> 3999.76]  you guys
[3999.76 --> 4001.06]  whether that's
[4001.06 --> 4001.50]  what you
[4001.50 --> 4002.06]  have observed
[4002.06 --> 4002.58]  where you're
[4002.58 --> 4002.90]  from.
[4005.78 --> 4006.38]  This is
[4006.38 --> 4006.90]  really cool.
[4007.48 --> 4007.86]  Have you
[4007.86 --> 4008.22]  checked out
[4008.22 --> 4008.88]  the elevated
[4008.88 --> 4009.38]  bus?
[4010.30 --> 4010.70]  No.
[4010.86 --> 4011.18]  Okay scroll
[4011.18 --> 4011.58]  down to that
[4011.58 --> 4012.22]  topic and have
[4012.22 --> 4012.78]  a look and
[4012.78 --> 4013.86]  we'll make
[4013.86 --> 4014.30]  that our next
[4014.30 --> 4014.48]  one.
[4014.54 --> 4014.84]  But I want
[4014.84 --> 4015.44]  to show the
[4015.44 --> 4015.92]  straw poll
[4015.92 --> 4016.54]  results here
[4016.54 --> 4016.90]  first.
[4019.52 --> 4020.20]  So yeah
[4020.20 --> 4020.62]  we've got
[4020.62 --> 4021.16]  a whopping
[4021.16 --> 4022.32]  54% of
[4022.32 --> 4022.52]  you.
[4023.04 --> 4023.68]  Oh I
[4023.68 --> 4024.28]  screwed up
[4024.28 --> 4024.68]  the title
[4024.68 --> 4025.30]  but hopefully
[4025.30 --> 4025.76]  you guys
[4025.76 --> 4027.60]  were listening
[4027.60 --> 4028.62]  while I was
[4028.62 --> 4029.28]  telling you
[4029.28 --> 4029.94]  about the
[4029.94 --> 4030.40]  title of
[4030.40 --> 4030.52]  it.
[4030.90 --> 4031.40]  Do US
[4031.40 --> 4032.20]  prices to
[4032.20 --> 4032.66]  where you
[4032.66 --> 4032.92]  live?
[4033.00 --> 4033.32]  We've got
[4033.32 --> 4034.20]  53% of
[4034.20 --> 4034.56]  you saying
[4034.56 --> 4034.94]  no.
[4035.06 --> 4035.86]  25% of
[4035.86 --> 4036.28]  you throwing
[4036.28 --> 4036.70]  away your
[4036.70 --> 4036.98]  vote.
[4037.66 --> 4038.82]  And only
[4038.82 --> 4039.82]  22% of
[4039.82 --> 4040.46]  you saying
[4040.46 --> 4041.00]  yes.
[4041.18 --> 4041.62]  Which given
[4041.62 --> 4042.88]  that I
[4042.88 --> 4043.62]  think over
[4043.62 --> 4044.30]  22%
[4044.30 --> 4044.56]  of our
[4044.56 --> 4044.96]  viewership
[4044.96 --> 4045.20]  is in
[4045.20 --> 4045.76]  the US
[4045.76 --> 4046.92]  would mean
[4046.92 --> 4048.00]  that some
[4048.00 --> 4048.26]  of our
[4048.26 --> 4049.06]  US viewers
[4049.06 --> 4050.10]  either they
[4050.10 --> 4050.48]  all figured
[4050.48 --> 4050.88]  out that
[4050.88 --> 4051.28]  they shouldn't
[4051.28 --> 4051.86]  vote because
[4051.86 --> 4052.26]  they are
[4052.26 --> 4052.64]  from the
[4052.64 --> 4054.10]  US or
[4054.10 --> 4056.42]  they got
[4056.42 --> 4056.64]  a little
[4056.64 --> 4057.32]  confused.
[4059.58 --> 4060.22]  So I
[4060.22 --> 4060.62]  wasn't paying
[4060.62 --> 4061.10]  attention on
[4061.10 --> 4061.44]  looking at
[4061.44 --> 4061.88]  this elevated
[4061.88 --> 4062.34]  bus.
[4062.90 --> 4063.36]  Yeah this
[4063.36 --> 4063.68]  thing looks
[4063.68 --> 4064.04]  freaking.
[4064.14 --> 4064.50]  It looks
[4064.50 --> 4065.90]  really cool.
[4065.98 --> 4066.36]  Awesome.
[4066.36 --> 4067.02]  Comma.
[4067.76 --> 4068.42]  But I
[4068.42 --> 4069.00]  have some
[4069.00 --> 4069.62]  concerns.
[4070.34 --> 4070.80]  Yeah I've
[4070.80 --> 4071.38]  got a handful
[4071.38 --> 4071.94]  of concerns
[4071.94 --> 4072.22]  too.
[4072.34 --> 4072.72]  So this
[4072.72 --> 4073.00]  is pretty
[4073.00 --> 4073.24]  cool.
[4073.30 --> 4073.52]  There's a
[4073.52 --> 4074.08]  YouTube video
[4074.08 --> 4074.58]  of it here.
[4074.66 --> 4074.86]  I'm just
[4074.86 --> 4075.18]  going to go
[4075.18 --> 4075.68]  ahead and
[4075.68 --> 4076.58]  pull this
[4076.58 --> 4076.80]  up.
[4077.26 --> 4077.76]  So this
[4077.76 --> 4078.34]  there you
[4078.34 --> 4078.62]  go.
[4079.12 --> 4079.54]  It's not
[4079.54 --> 4079.84]  up.
[4080.04 --> 4080.82]  Oh whoops.
[4081.08 --> 4081.30]  I'm sorry.
[4081.52 --> 4081.78]  Let's go
[4081.78 --> 4082.36]  ahead and
[4082.36 --> 4082.86]  share a
[4082.86 --> 4083.10]  line of
[4083.10 --> 4083.38]  the screen.
[4083.48 --> 4084.02]  So this
[4084.02 --> 4085.60]  is sort
[4085.60 --> 4086.10]  of a
[4086.10 --> 4086.86]  concept
[4086.86 --> 4088.22]  for an
[4088.22 --> 4088.70]  elevated
[4088.70 --> 4089.02]  bus.
[4089.10 --> 4089.34]  So the
[4089.34 --> 4089.78]  passengers
[4089.78 --> 4090.42]  sit up
[4090.42 --> 4090.64]  here.
[4091.52 --> 4092.18]  And the
[4092.18 --> 4092.80]  idea is that
[4092.80 --> 4093.14]  this would
[4093.14 --> 4094.08]  solve congestion
[4094.08 --> 4095.38]  problems by
[4095.38 --> 4096.08]  actually having
[4096.08 --> 4096.76]  it drive
[4096.76 --> 4097.72]  above the
[4097.72 --> 4098.10]  road.
[4098.46 --> 4099.70]  Above cars
[4099.70 --> 4100.02]  on the
[4100.02 --> 4100.30]  road.
[4100.56 --> 4101.00]  Let me tell
[4101.00 --> 4101.34]  you though if
[4101.34 --> 4101.70]  I was in
[4101.70 --> 4102.72]  a car and
[4102.72 --> 4103.10]  that thing
[4103.10 --> 4104.00]  passed me I
[4104.00 --> 4104.46]  would be
[4104.46 --> 4105.32]  terrified.
[4106.48 --> 4107.14]  I would be
[4107.14 --> 4107.68]  like whoa
[4107.68 --> 4108.70]  suddenly I'm
[4108.70 --> 4109.18]  in a tunnel.
[4109.94 --> 4111.04]  I was going
[4111.04 --> 4111.60]  to turn.
[4112.44 --> 4113.00]  People are
[4113.00 --> 4113.42]  going to freak
[4113.42 --> 4113.88]  out when that
[4113.88 --> 4114.40]  thing goes over
[4114.40 --> 4114.58]  them.
[4114.66 --> 4114.80]  Yep.
[4114.94 --> 4115.76]  I mean people
[4115.76 --> 4116.70]  in bike lanes
[4116.70 --> 4117.38]  might get
[4117.38 --> 4118.72]  hit.
[4119.72 --> 4120.28]  Anyone in
[4120.28 --> 4120.68]  sort of a
[4120.68 --> 4121.24]  taller than
[4121.24 --> 4122.04]  normal vehicle
[4122.04 --> 4122.68]  might have a
[4122.68 --> 4123.00]  bit of a
[4123.00 --> 4123.40]  problem.
[4123.76 --> 4124.24]  Well you'd
[4124.24 --> 4124.96]  have to oh
[4124.96 --> 4125.36]  dear you'd
[4125.36 --> 4125.98]  have to impose
[4125.98 --> 4126.56]  height limits
[4126.56 --> 4127.42]  on cars on
[4127.42 --> 4128.12]  certain roads.
[4128.30 --> 4128.58]  Yep.
[4128.86 --> 4129.10]  Yeah.
[4129.24 --> 4129.62]  You'd have to
[4129.62 --> 4130.10]  like have the
[4130.10 --> 4130.78]  bars so you
[4130.78 --> 4131.12]  can't even
[4131.12 --> 4131.40]  enter.
[4131.50 --> 4131.82]  There are
[4131.82 --> 4132.50]  definitely some
[4132.50 --> 4133.00]  issues with
[4133.00 --> 4133.98]  the idea but
[4133.98 --> 4134.46]  Like it's a
[4134.46 --> 4135.36]  cool idea in
[4135.36 --> 4136.82]  theory maybe but
[4136.82 --> 4137.48]  If it was
[4137.48 --> 4138.58]  deployed strategically
[4138.58 --> 4140.20]  I could see
[4140.20 --> 4140.66]  this being
[4140.66 --> 4141.28]  pretty cool.
[4141.40 --> 4141.52]  It will
[4141.52 --> 4142.16]  apparently be
[4142.16 --> 4142.48]  able to
[4142.48 --> 4143.40]  carry 1,200
[4143.40 --> 4144.10]  passengers.
[4144.66 --> 4145.22]  It will be
[4145.22 --> 4145.58]  able to go
[4145.58 --> 4146.16]  over top of
[4146.16 --> 4146.66]  cars and let
[4146.66 --> 4147.24]  traffic pass
[4147.24 --> 4147.84]  underneath it.
[4147.94 --> 4148.38]  It runs on
[4148.38 --> 4149.24]  fixed rails along
[4149.24 --> 4150.00]  the road and
[4150.00 --> 4150.64]  it had a scale
[4150.64 --> 4151.92]  model shown at
[4151.92 --> 4152.52]  the expo.
[4152.96 --> 4153.84]  So here in
[4153.84 --> 4155.18]  Vancouver-ish
[4155.18 --> 4155.96]  area we have
[4155.96 --> 4156.36]  something called
[4156.36 --> 4156.74]  the Sky
[4156.74 --> 4157.74]  Train which is
[4157.74 --> 4158.64]  basically just a
[4158.64 --> 4160.06]  subway but it's
[4160.06 --> 4160.90]  elevated it's in
[4160.90 --> 4161.80]  the air and it
[4161.80 --> 4163.34]  just goes over the
[4163.34 --> 4163.64]  roads.
[4163.74 --> 4164.16]  It does not
[4164.16 --> 4165.28]  interact with them
[4165.28 --> 4166.14]  it's either over or
[4166.14 --> 4166.42]  under.
[4166.80 --> 4167.88]  So you never have to
[4167.88 --> 4168.66]  deal with it it never
[4168.66 --> 4169.26]  has to wait at a
[4169.26 --> 4169.58]  light.
[4169.94 --> 4170.76]  But the cost of
[4170.76 --> 4172.52]  that is much
[4172.52 --> 4172.82]  higher.
[4173.06 --> 4173.14]  Yeah.
[4173.26 --> 4173.56]  So they're
[4173.56 --> 4174.36]  estimating that this
[4174.36 --> 4175.28]  will cost one
[4175.28 --> 4177.36]  fifth what a
[4177.36 --> 4178.24]  subway would cost.
[4178.24 --> 4180.80]  has anyone ever
[4180.80 --> 4181.38]  done this?
[4181.80 --> 4182.38]  Not that I'm
[4182.38 --> 4182.70]  aware of.
[4182.70 --> 4183.28]  So it's just a
[4183.28 --> 4183.84]  little model.
[4184.30 --> 4184.48]  Yes.
[4184.48 --> 4184.92]  Because I've seen
[4184.92 --> 4185.44]  this kind of thing
[4185.44 --> 4185.86]  before.
[4186.02 --> 4186.72]  It's just a little
[4186.72 --> 4188.08]  model for now.
[4190.08 --> 4191.34]  I would love to
[4191.34 --> 4192.00]  ride one of those
[4192.00 --> 4192.60]  it would be awesome.
[4192.76 --> 4193.12]  That would be
[4193.12 --> 4193.50]  cool.
[4193.66 --> 4193.82]  Yeah.
[4193.92 --> 4194.50]  Like sitting in the
[4194.50 --> 4194.92]  front of that
[4194.92 --> 4195.56]  thing just like
[4195.56 --> 4196.38]  whipping over the
[4196.38 --> 4197.18]  cars underneath you
[4197.18 --> 4198.58]  it would be like if
[4198.58 --> 4199.60]  bridges could drive.
[4199.98 --> 4200.16]  Yeah.
[4200.16 --> 4202.16]  I don't imagine
[4202.16 --> 4203.04]  that it whips very
[4203.04 --> 4203.24]  much.
[4203.34 --> 4203.94]  Probably the cars
[4203.94 --> 4204.50]  under it are going
[4204.50 --> 4205.30]  to be going faster
[4205.30 --> 4206.52]  than this thing.
[4206.66 --> 4207.66]  It probably lumbers
[4207.66 --> 4208.36]  along.
[4208.54 --> 4209.92]  Well the idea is to
[4209.92 --> 4211.56]  get around traffic.
[4212.10 --> 4212.40]  Yeah.
[4212.60 --> 4213.02]  But like.
[4213.14 --> 4213.44]  Beyond like
[4213.44 --> 4213.84]  congested roads.
[4213.84 --> 4214.48]  What about when it
[4214.48 --> 4215.36]  comes up to a light?
[4215.88 --> 4216.34]  Like it's going to
[4216.34 --> 4216.86]  have to wait at the
[4216.86 --> 4217.12]  light.
[4218.66 --> 4218.98]  Right?
[4219.26 --> 4219.82]  Because like what if
[4219.82 --> 4220.42]  you have two of these
[4220.42 --> 4220.76]  things?
[4220.78 --> 4220.90]  Yeah.
[4220.98 --> 4221.26]  It would have to
[4221.26 --> 4221.66]  wait at the light.
[4221.66 --> 4221.84]  And what if you've
[4221.84 --> 4222.82]  got the other cars?
[4222.90 --> 4223.50]  Like they can't pass
[4223.50 --> 4223.88]  through it.
[4223.96 --> 4224.62]  Unless you do like
[4224.62 --> 4225.18]  columns.
[4225.34 --> 4225.90]  Like the cars would
[4225.90 --> 4227.08]  be faster off the line
[4227.08 --> 4227.86]  but maybe the bus
[4227.86 --> 4228.68]  would go faster when
[4228.68 --> 4229.58]  they hit a
[4229.58 --> 4230.84]  attraction of some
[4230.84 --> 4230.92]  sort.
[4230.94 --> 4231.40]  I don't know.
[4231.78 --> 4232.64]  I don't know man.
[4232.76 --> 4233.36]  I like it.
[4233.60 --> 4234.22]  I think it's cool.
[4234.58 --> 4236.24]  It's cool but is it
[4236.24 --> 4236.62]  practical?
[4237.96 --> 4238.40]  Alright.
[4238.88 --> 4239.80]  Speaking of practical
[4239.80 --> 4240.94]  I think that's pretty
[4240.94 --> 4241.96]  much it for the
[4241.96 --> 4243.36]  practical life of the
[4243.36 --> 4243.92]  show today.
[4244.06 --> 4244.48]  Is it?
[4244.70 --> 4245.54]  Let's give Taryn a
[4245.54 --> 4246.34]  big round of applause
[4246.34 --> 4247.24]  for being my co-host
[4247.24 --> 4247.52]  today.
[4247.66 --> 4248.26]  Yay Taryn.
[4248.86 --> 4249.48]  Yay Taryn.
[4249.78 --> 4250.20]  Oh wow.
[4250.28 --> 4251.12]  Twitch chat hates
[4251.12 --> 4251.34]  you.
[4251.46 --> 4251.76]  Do they?
[4251.84 --> 4252.38]  Oh no.
[4253.58 --> 4254.50]  No they're fine.
[4254.92 --> 4255.70]  Oh you're looking at
[4255.70 --> 4255.78]  it.
[4255.84 --> 4256.20]  Never mind.
[4256.82 --> 4257.96]  I did not get away
[4257.96 --> 4258.74]  with that one there.
[4258.74 --> 4260.76]  And just so for
[4260.76 --> 4261.40]  those of you who
[4261.40 --> 4262.10]  have been wondering
[4262.10 --> 4262.88]  Oh yeah we never
[4262.88 --> 4263.34]  explain.
[4263.40 --> 4264.08]  All stream.
[4264.28 --> 4265.30]  The reason for this
[4265.30 --> 4266.58]  is I was actually
[4266.58 --> 4268.12]  shooting my review
[4268.12 --> 4269.56]  of the cat
[4269.56 --> 4270.60]  headphones from
[4270.60 --> 4272.06]  Brookstone so I
[4272.06 --> 4274.42]  wanted a look that
[4274.42 --> 4275.44]  I felt like would
[4275.44 --> 4278.26]  appropriately go
[4278.26 --> 4279.26]  along with them so
[4279.26 --> 4281.42]  I got all done up
[4281.42 --> 4283.18]  prior to hosting the
[4283.18 --> 4283.48]  review.
[4283.58 --> 4284.08]  And then I was
[4284.08 --> 4285.14]  jealous so I put this
[4285.14 --> 4285.38]  on.
[4285.44 --> 4285.66]  Yeah.
[4285.66 --> 4287.62]  Pretty much.
[4288.46 --> 4289.28]  There's not much to
[4289.28 --> 4289.42]  it.
[4289.54 --> 4289.76]  Yeah.
[4289.92 --> 4290.52]  I look good in
[4290.52 --> 4290.82]  this.
[4292.40 --> 4292.84]  Yeah.
[4293.20 --> 4293.90]  All right.
[4294.48 --> 4295.38]  Thanks guys.
[4296.04 --> 4297.02]  See you next time.
[4297.18 --> 4297.98]  Same bat time.
[4298.12 --> 4299.14]  Same bat channel.
[4299.40 --> 4299.72]  Yeah.
[4301.30 --> 4302.16]  Hopefully the intro
[4302.16 --> 4302.56]  works.
[4304.00 --> 4305.00]  Got people asking if
[4305.00 --> 4305.76]  you can take the ears
[4305.76 --> 4306.06]  off.
[4306.60 --> 4307.80]  No I don't think so.
[4308.60 --> 4309.26]  Unless you cut them
[4309.26 --> 4309.52]  off.
[4309.52 --> 4312.96]  This wig is hot.
[4313.64 --> 4314.16]  I know.
[4314.40 --> 4316.12]  Wigs make your head
[4316.12 --> 4317.60]  surprisingly hot.
[4317.78 --> 4318.28]  It's all sweaty.
[4318.68 --> 4320.38]  Like it is not a
[4320.38 --> 4320.98]  pretty thing.
[4323.92 --> 4325.02]  Well I don't know
[4325.02 --> 4325.22]  if.
[4325.36 --> 4325.94]  Oh there it goes.
[4325.94 --> 4327.94]  There it goes.
[4328.56 --> 4329.94]  In the middle.
[4329.94 --> 4330.86]  No.
[4330.86 --> 4331.74]  No.
[4332.70 --> 4333.34]  My one is
[4333.34 --> 4333.86]  okay.
[4338.20 --> 4338.92]  Yes.
[4338.92 --> 4352.00]  The show
[4352.00 --> 4352.38]  is
[4352.38 --> 4353.58]  a
[4353.58 --> 4353.78]  road
[4353.78 --> 4354.34]  is
[4354.34 --> 4354.64]  injured.
[4354.72 --> 4354.90]  Oh
[4354.90 --> 4355.62]  no.
[4355.62 --> 4356.56]  Just
[4356.56 --> 4356.90]  a
[4356.90 --> 4357.22]  little
[4357.22 --> 4357.90]  man.
