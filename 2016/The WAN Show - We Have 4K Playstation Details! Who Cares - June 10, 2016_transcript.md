[0.00 --> 5.00]  Funny story to start the show.
[5.00 --> 7.00]  Is this going to be nipple related?
[7.00 --> 8.00]  No, it's not.
[8.00 --> 10.00]  Oh, that's a shame.
[10.00 --> 11.00]  Right?
[11.00 --> 17.00]  Anyways, when I came back from Taiwan, I came into YVR, the airport that is near us.
[17.00 --> 19.00]  Don't worry about it.
[19.00 --> 20.00]  Statue with nipples.
[20.00 --> 22.00]  No, no, unfortunately not.
[22.00 --> 24.00]  Are you going to work nipples into this at some point?
[24.00 --> 25.00]  No, actually.
[25.00 --> 26.00]  None.
[26.00 --> 27.00]  Crap.
[27.00 --> 29.00]  Okay, so you came to the Vancouver airport.
[29.00 --> 30.00]  I'll try.
[30.00 --> 31.00]  I'll see if I can do it.
[31.00 --> 32.00]  Which is in Richmond, by the way.
[32.00 --> 33.00]  Vancouver International Airport, not in Vancouver.
[33.00 --> 34.00]  Yes.
[34.00 --> 35.00]  It's in the Greater Vancouver area.
[35.00 --> 36.00]  That's true.
[36.00 --> 40.00]  Or Greater Vancouver Regional District, as it's actually called.
[40.00 --> 42.00]  The GTA is the Greater Toronto area.
[42.00 --> 44.00]  The GVRG, sucker.
[44.00 --> 46.00]  Okay, my bad.
[46.00 --> 50.00]  Anyways, the Wi-Fi network there does one of those things where you have to approve your
[50.00 --> 53.00]  login thing through a portal and whatever.
[53.00 --> 56.00]  I was trying to do it, and it wasn't working, and I needed internet at that point in time,
[56.00 --> 59.00]  so I was like, whatever, and turned my Wi-Fi off.
[59.00 --> 61.00]  Didn't really think about it.
[61.00 --> 67.00]  A little while later, using my phone, and it's like, oh, your Wi-Fi, your data has been
[67.00 --> 69.00]  turned off because you're at your maximum.
[69.00 --> 73.00]  My warning didn't come through or I swiped it without realizing it because I hate it when
[73.00 --> 76.00]  notifications load while you're in your notification bar.
[76.00 --> 79.00]  I might have swiped it without actually seeing it.
[79.00 --> 86.00]  So my data is dead, and I think I'm like six days into the month or something.
[86.00 --> 88.00]  So that sucks.
[88.00 --> 90.00]  I have a dumb phone for a while.
[90.00 --> 93.00]  Well, your smart phone, just a dumb user.
[93.00 --> 95.00]  Yeah, that's fair.
[95.00 --> 99.00]  So I guess, yeah, I failed to work nipples into that.
[99.00 --> 100.00]  Yeah, you did.
[100.00 --> 103.00]  That's okay because I can work nipples into anything.
[103.00 --> 109.00]  People are asking us to turn the mic up, but I just did a test recording, and it was fine.
[109.00 --> 113.00]  So I guess I had the volume a little high.
[113.00 --> 115.00]  Actually, I don't even know why that worked at all.
[115.00 --> 120.00]  What I just did in terms of testing, maybe I could load up the stream and see if people
[120.00 --> 121.00]  are messing with me in the meantime.
[121.00 --> 124.00]  Why don't you let them know what fantastic topics we have for them today?
[124.00 --> 133.00]  So we have the whole catastrophe around TeamViewer, all the accounts being hacked into or passwords
[133.00 --> 136.00]  being known or whatever because those aren't really the same thing.
[136.00 --> 138.00]  But anyways, we'll talk about that later.
[138.00 --> 142.00]  Gawker has officially filed for bankruptcy and is saying some other stuff.
[142.00 --> 149.00]  Sony officially confirms the 4K-ready PlayStation, but I believe it's not being announced at E3 or something.
[149.00 --> 154.00]  And I don't actually know a fourth topic that's interesting.
[154.00 --> 156.00]  You sound wonderful to me, by the way.
[156.00 --> 157.00]  Do I?
[157.00 --> 160.00]  Yeah, I'm at like 38% on my system volume.
[160.00 --> 162.00]  So, I'm...
[162.00 --> 164.00]  Okay!
[164.00 --> 165.00]  Space mining!
[165.00 --> 166.00]  Space mining.
[166.00 --> 167.00]  What?
[167.00 --> 168.00]  I don't know.
[168.00 --> 169.00]  I didn't see that.
[169.00 --> 170.00]  Alright, space mining.
[170.00 --> 171.00]  We might not talk about that one.
[171.00 --> 172.00]  Yeah, we may not get to that.
[172.00 --> 173.00]  Yeah.
[173.00 --> 174.00]  Intro time!
[174.00 --> 175.00]  Cool!
[179.00 --> 206.00]  Tune your wifi back on for a week.
[206.00 --> 211.84]  back on for a week or maybe not gross maybe it's like hot oh if you're into that sort of thing
[211.84 --> 218.50]  like phone spit yeah that's probably not good all right apparently the intro is loud well you know
[218.50 --> 225.10]  what you guys there is only so much i can oh there's only so much i can do jim's address says
[225.10 --> 233.10]  ow and also that it's pre-recorded i think no it's not pre-recorded all right so let's get into some
[233.10 --> 240.68]  topics first up we've got and i actually have no idea whether um whether luke said that this was
[240.68 --> 247.94]  going to be one of our one of our main topics for this week yeah gawker is no more at least in its
[247.94 --> 254.80]  current form maybe someday it will reach its final form but that won't be its current form uh they
[254.80 --> 261.92]  filed for bankruptcy and have said that they will sell the company uh the headline says to ziff davis
[261.92 --> 268.24]  or someone else that i don't think it's necessarily gawker saying they're gonna sell to ziff davis it's
[268.24 --> 274.08]  that ziff davis has an offer in on them for somewhere to the tune of 90 to 100 million dollars you know
[274.08 --> 275.62]  maybe i should just buy gawker
[275.62 --> 283.68]  what yeah i know you know for a fact that i can't that's not gonna work and afford that also just
[283.68 --> 290.94]  doesn't sound like a good idea yeah why would we do that if we could just like life hacker i said a
[290.94 --> 294.00]  tweet about this earlier i was like i don't really care about the rest of it but if life hacker
[294.00 --> 299.48]  survives that would be cool yeah if we could just consume like just them i'd be down with that i
[299.48 --> 303.10]  mean theoretically we could use some of the upstairs office space for that make them all canadians
[303.10 --> 309.94]  theoretically they could sell individual publications so uh so gawker is uh life hacker
[309.94 --> 320.48]  jezebel deadspin gawker.com gizmodo kotaku jalopnik uh and yeah jezebel and uh deadspin i don't know if you said that
[320.48 --> 325.94]  yeah no you said deadspin actually but you know good job um you said it twice which is important
[325.94 --> 333.74]  for people who didn't hear you the first yeah um so out of all of those yeah i think life hacker i
[333.74 --> 339.58]  i didn't used to mine gizmodo but i can't remember the last time i went on that site i liked them i
[339.58 --> 346.86]  think when i was like 16 yeah let's see if that lines up no how old were you in 2009 19 you were
[346.86 --> 353.66]  19 or well 18 for most of it 18 okay so i was close very close i was actually quite close okay so um
[353.66 --> 361.42]  um basically yeah they're filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy um actually yeah i think so
[361.42 --> 366.98]  excellent it was right around there yes um so they're they're they've announced their chapter
[366.98 --> 374.06]  11 filing uh basically that puts them in protection from creditors for the time being while they
[374.06 --> 380.92]  sort of entertain offers to buy the company um gawker and nick denton have said that they will not
[380.92 --> 387.28]  pay hulk hogan and peter thiel the 140 million dollars they have told their employees that they
[387.28 --> 393.56]  still plan to fight the case and to operate the publishing business while they do so um
[393.56 --> 400.30]  but ziff davis has come out and said there's uh let me just see if i can bring up the uh the article
[400.30 --> 405.88]  here so this was in an internal memo it does say for less than 100 million dollars yeah like i'm
[405.88 --> 410.90]  assuming not a ton less there's conflicting reports so this particular one on recode.net says
[410.90 --> 415.86]  for around 100 million but it should be noted that they may end up paying more because this is
[415.86 --> 422.66]  just their initial bid for it and actually nothing to do necessarily with um how much it'll end up
[422.66 --> 427.78]  selling for someone else could make a counter offer yep yep it could end up being a bidding war over
[427.78 --> 435.86]  jezebel yep which i guess someone wants apparently um i didn't know that these sites as a whole were
[435.86 --> 446.58]  still that big i had no idea online written media publications were still worth like tens of millions
[446.58 --> 452.50]  of dollars each i mean i guess it's sort of enormous amounts of traffic um this is a really good clip
[452.50 --> 459.14]  with nick denton basically saying um nope i stand by the decision to publish that even in light of
[459.14 --> 464.98]  everything that has happened um he's expressed a lot of frustration with peter thiel basically
[465.62 --> 474.34]  public basically funding this lawsuit as a way to um i think i i forget i was reading some article
[474.34 --> 478.66]  about it but the the quote from him was something to the effect don't quote me on this that's a quote of
[478.66 --> 485.62]  a quote that's not an accurate quote but sick um so the so something to the effect of that it's not
[485.62 --> 492.58]  vengeance but it's more of like a cautionary sort of like it's more of a deterrent i think was some
[492.58 --> 500.34]  something close to the word that was used um against publishing articles that are basic that basically
[500.34 --> 507.22]  amount to bullying so that was that was sort of how he interpreted the hulk hogan article where this
[507.22 --> 514.42]  sort of this individual was being bullied by a publication that uh published an article and indeed a
[514.42 --> 523.06]  sex tape video of him um banging to use the term that the kids use these days i think uh a friend's
[523.06 --> 530.18]  wife did they say that yeah banging still a thing cool still a thing really you gotta throw that in at
[530.18 --> 535.62]  me yeah well i guess that's still a thing if you're an old man well like how long has banging been around
[535.62 --> 542.50]  for i don't know a long time i'm sure my dad is like well versed with that term the term or what are we
[542.50 --> 551.30]  talking about i'm here so probably both just being honest it's almost father's day you got nine days
[551.30 --> 558.82]  to figure it out to figure out if he's your father or well maybe that could that could be the situation
[558.82 --> 567.54]  okay so luke's parents aside and they're whatever they don't still watch wancho do they they probably do
[567.54 --> 577.86]  oh that's a shame hi mom and dad um so it'll be a court supervised auction and uh basically the the
[577.86 --> 584.66]  lawsuit one way or the other will have to be resolved before nick uh before excuse me ziff davis is going
[584.66 --> 592.18]  to have any interest in in taking uh taking possession of it and uh yeah that's basically how it went down
[592.18 --> 598.50]  um um would this make you think twice about publishing a sex tape on linus tech tips
[604.26 --> 608.98]  why why would why would we publish a sex tape online i i didn't say we i said you so
[608.98 --> 614.98]  okay no we should do this but we should do it with like uh like computer components
[614.98 --> 621.14]  oh man we should like make a fake hulk hogan
[624.66 --> 632.74]  no i want and have it water cool someone else's computer i want no part i want no part of any of
[632.74 --> 638.50]  this i just want we've got people asking for us to review a sex bot
[638.50 --> 647.06]  okay let's talk hold on our robots let's turn does our robot yeah but taryn wouldn't know what to do
[647.06 --> 656.02]  with the sex so let's talk let's talk seriously again for a minute would you do an objective review
[657.62 --> 665.78]  of a sex robot uh okay i mean we'd have to be careful what we show in b-roll and not in b-roll
[665.78 --> 671.14]  right but would you would you benchmark it and host the video i think i think like
[672.58 --> 678.98]  the the journalistic side of me is like yeah and then there's like i'm in a relationship no
[680.10 --> 687.86]  so but what if the i think is it cheating if it's a robot probably is it like because i mean they're
[687.86 --> 692.74]  not that sophisticated at this point yeah at this point i think basically they just do pre-programmed
[692.74 --> 698.02]  you are attempting to because this this ties into another conversation which is like
[699.06 --> 702.90]  is porn okay while you're in a relationship and this is like stuff you need to decide in
[702.90 --> 707.30]  your relationship yeah i'm not saying as a general statement i mean with you and your partner yes
[707.30 --> 713.38]  it's porn okay and then on top of that is vr porn okay because they're actually pretty different
[714.02 --> 722.10]  right yeah vr porn is very much putting you in that scenario yeah with like like uh directional audio
[722.10 --> 725.30]  so you feel like you're there and like if the person's talking to you you can hear where it's
[725.30 --> 729.78]  coming from like all that like crazy stuff yeah which is like on another level and then you're
[729.78 --> 734.26]  stepping up again you think so i think each one of those will reduce the amount of people that are
[734.26 --> 740.82]  okay you don't think actually i i would i would argue i would argue the other way so i think porn is
[740.82 --> 745.54]  where it is so we both let's establish that porn is a baseline okay and you know your baseline could
[745.54 --> 748.90]  be it's like super okay and mine could be it's super not okay or the other way around whatever
[748.90 --> 753.62]  it doesn't matter let's call two-dimensional porn the baseline sure and let's talk like two
[753.62 --> 758.10]  dimensional is like on a screen let's talk let's talk like straight guy on girl if you're a straight
[758.10 --> 765.14]  person like like like vanilla porn like sure not like animals or whatever because i wasn't really
[765.14 --> 772.02]  okay like i'm thinking like two two-dimensional like just kind of vanilla porn whatever fits in your
[772.02 --> 777.06]  preferences yeah like whatever would be vanilla for you everyone's vanilla can be a little different you
[777.06 --> 782.90]  know chocolate strawberry vanilla we're talking vanilla okay so that's our baseline okay i would
[782.90 --> 793.86]  make the argument that a robot is actually less akin to a real life sexual experience than i see where
[793.86 --> 799.38]  you're coming from with that but you also have problems where and certainly less than uh than toy
[799.38 --> 806.26]  assisted vr toy assisted vr toy assisted vr is way up there um with the robot though you are directly
[806.26 --> 814.34]  trying to replace the person in the actions that they do and it is possible to get somewhat emotionally
[814.34 --> 823.30]  attached to a robot so like you are actually attempting to replace the functionality of the partner yeah
[823.30 --> 830.82]  which is also why vr toy assisted would probably would that top the robot for you i don't know
[831.62 --> 837.78]  they're both like so these are both like no zone for you this is really awkward uh
[838.74 --> 843.78]  well remember we're talking when you're in a relationship and remember your no zone can be
[843.78 --> 848.74]  sort of what you're comfortable with someone else engaging in while you're in a relationship like it
[848.74 --> 855.30]  goes a two-way street yeah yeah so are both of those gray area at the very least to say to say okay
[855.30 --> 864.02]  would need like a discussion blah blah blah okay okay interesting see i how did we get here i don't know
[865.46 --> 874.90]  but i i i i wholly disagree okay i think that the robot and then okay i and i'm saying inanimate object
[874.90 --> 880.82]  i understand that not all of them are completely inanimate um some of them like blink and stuff
[881.30 --> 888.58]  oh okay yeah yeah um but i would make the argument that an inanimate object is less like a real
[888.58 --> 897.62]  experience than an actor on a screen uh but it's not happening directly to you
[899.78 --> 904.34]  that's true but nothing's happening to you i mean let's face it you're doing all the work in either
[904.34 --> 911.38]  scenario that might be true in relationships as well though wow shots fired not even sorry to hear
[911.38 --> 918.18]  that bro no no that's not true at all but i'm saying for some people that is a reality it's it's
[918.18 --> 925.06]  i'm sorry but like it is okay sure fair enough people are saying next topic and they're probably
[925.06 --> 932.42]  right there yeah yeah um what is next topic sony officially confirms the 4k ready playstation excellent
[932.42 --> 939.22]  so original article here is from the verge confirms a ps4 console upgrade but it won't
[940.26 --> 944.18]  be at e3 which raises the question what will be at e3
[947.78 --> 952.42]  don't know people were asking me like at combutex and stuff they're like you've done e3 before are you
[952.42 --> 958.90]  going this year i was like nope like oh why not it's because we're not well you know what's funny is we
[958.90 --> 965.22]  missed a year when e3 was like the yeah and then we were like okay we'll do it next year but the
[965.22 --> 971.06]  problem is that we're not in the console mindset like we don't even understand what qualifies as
[971.06 --> 977.30]  like a big e3 for console people because it's all just kind of e3 yeah so it's like yeah all the consoles
[977.30 --> 984.02]  are launching this year we don't go the next year all the consoles launched last year we go and it's like
[984.02 --> 989.38]  here's some game with games with some tessellation or something the problem is even if we did go the
[989.38 --> 995.78]  previous year it was probably just keynotes wasn't it just keynotes like i'm pretty sure we just
[995.78 --> 1001.14]  watched those in the office i remember like talking to you because we were both scripting and half
[1001.14 --> 1007.62]  watching at the same time like we basically more or less went just virtually not to tie back to the
[1007.62 --> 1014.34]  previous conversation yeah i mean on that subject man i went to uh i think two keynotes yeah two
[1014.34 --> 1019.46]  keynotes at computex this year i went to one let's just not do them anymore yep they are the worst thing
[1019.46 --> 1026.98]  ever yep there is nothing that i can learn in a keynote that i can't learn and like by yeah i don't know
[1026.98 --> 1033.30]  the the most valuable thing i think we could do from a keynote um and the the keynote that i went to
[1033.30 --> 1039.14]  was an nvidia one and what i did was i just periscope live streamed the whole thing which like
[1040.34 --> 1044.90]  i did that because i don't think it was being live streamed right the the stream that i did uh
[1044.90 --> 1049.46]  twitch stream of at the nvidia event when i didn't have a table and was like crammed in these tiny
[1049.46 --> 1054.34]  freaking seats in the back trying to hold my camera up while supporting my laptop was horrible i don't
[1054.34 --> 1059.54]  even really know why people watched i tried to like i tried to even get reactions from like jay and
[1059.54 --> 1063.62]  the other people that are sitting beside me and i turned the camera and the hdmi cable would disconnect
[1064.90 --> 1070.26]  because it wasn't a very stable connection um but there's like live tweets but then we don't have to
[1070.26 --> 1080.42]  be there in order to do that right i don't know um so this is actually this is actually sort of uh an
[1080.42 --> 1087.86]  ongoing an ongoing scandal so i don't know if some of you have seen it but sourcefed is claiming that
[1087.86 --> 1094.34]  google manipulated search results um in favor of hillary clinton it's actually a very well
[1094.34 --> 1099.78]  constructed video a very compelling sounding argument for uh for how big this has become i'm
[1099.78 --> 1104.18]  surprised it doesn't have way more views yeah it's actually only got about a quarter million views let's
[1104.18 --> 1111.22]  go ahead and pop that up on our screen here so they basically say okay look uh here's the popularity
[1111.22 --> 1118.82]  of certain um search terms for example hillary clinton indictment and hillary clinton india you
[1118.82 --> 1125.62]  can see indictment is much more popular than india according to google's own interest over time and
[1125.62 --> 1132.90]  they point out that when you actually enter hillary clinton ind into google search it comes up with indiana
[1132.90 --> 1141.14]  india independent voters indiana campaign absolutely nothing about indictment as a suggested search with the
[1141.62 --> 1150.82]  argument being made by sourcefed being that you should be suggesting search topics based on autocomplete
[1150.82 --> 1159.62]  based on what people are actually searching for that would start with those letters um so this is this
[1159.62 --> 1166.50]  is very quickly turning into they also showed like i think it was yahoo and bing typing the exact same thing
[1166.50 --> 1173.86]  and yahoo and bing reacted the exact same way that they would have expected yeah so indictment was the top uh
[1173.86 --> 1179.94]  suggested with that said i wouldn't use bing search as an indication of what is relevant necessarily
[1179.94 --> 1184.74]  although they make again a good point it's very well constructed video actually i watched the whole thing
[1184.74 --> 1192.02]  start to finish i was like wow that was very cogent um anyway so they make the argument that if there's
[1192.02 --> 1195.30]  three people in a room and i think it went something along don't quote me on this again
[1195.30 --> 1200.74]  three people in a room and one of them says i'm in a room and two of them say i'm on the room's on fire
[1200.74 --> 1204.98]  you know you should probably go with the two people who are saying hey the room's on fire and not the
[1204.98 --> 1212.02]  person that it's what's relevant information i guess is the point um now the defense up on the verge
[1212.02 --> 1218.98]  already google denies oh and there's there's like there's like a whole like um illuminati thing about
[1218.98 --> 1227.22]  how um larry page uh funded or owns a company that i think that's actually no no it's true yeah yeah
[1227.22 --> 1233.22]  yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean to be clear i'm not saying illuminati confirmed like you know uh mr peanut on
[1233.22 --> 1240.50]  the peanut butter jar the american dad not the illuminati yeah it's this like tech-based company
[1240.50 --> 1247.06]  that larry page is funding that is helping hillary's campaign that is being uh contracted
[1247.06 --> 1253.78]  by hillary's campaign something to the tune of 177 000 177 000 in a quarter which sounds like a lot
[1253.78 --> 1260.10]  of money to normal people like you and me but this is important right now in the context of larry page
[1260.10 --> 1265.70]  that means nothing he probably keeps that amount of money in every pair of shoes in the event that he
[1265.70 --> 1271.46]  gets robbed and he needs to you know grab some money for walking around out of somewhere that
[1271.46 --> 1280.98]  the robber wouldn't have gotten it from yeah that sucks it's right here then and we're back illuminati
[1280.98 --> 1288.42]  freaking confirmed you were waiting on that the whole time right hillary clinton showed up outside the door
[1288.42 --> 1296.74]  of our warehouse walked in with like armed guards behind her dressed in black and told us well not
[1296.74 --> 1303.22]  us told our computer yeah you blue screen right now or we are not walking out of this place yeah
[1304.42 --> 1311.38]  and it did it happened josh was there okay so the last thing happened our computer blue screen i'm not
[1311.38 --> 1315.94]  really sure what the deal was with that something to do with attempted switch from dpc
[1315.94 --> 1319.62]  which is something to do with maybe a real tech wireless driver we don't have any real tech devices
[1319.62 --> 1324.42]  in this computer mini card it seems to be like one of those catch-all dump don't we don't have any of
[1324.42 --> 1330.18]  those that's that's for sure so let's get back into um into what what i was talking about what the hell
[1330.18 --> 1339.46]  was i talking about before okay um so right uh medium doc where was i going with this okay so the verge has
[1339.46 --> 1344.90]  uh the verge has a good uh follow-up that basically says google denies altering search suggestions for
[1344.90 --> 1352.02]  hillary clinton and points out that some of the examples that source fed sites uh for example uh
[1352.02 --> 1359.78]  hillary clinton cri doesn't come up with crime in fact apply across the board google avoids auto
[1359.78 --> 1370.10]  completing the word crime or criminal um so that they can avoid um making disbarging comments about people
[1370.10 --> 1376.18]  who may not have actually committed a crime or may not be a criminal in fact they do so they they've
[1376.18 --> 1382.42]  pointed this out this is uh who's this guy matt cuts is the currently on leave from his position as
[1382.42 --> 1390.74]  head of google's web spam team um so they do this for everyone else including people that have actually
[1390.74 --> 1397.30]  been charged and convicted very interesting um he also points out that those looking for negative
[1397.30 --> 1403.62]  stories don't necessarily type hillary's last name they actually mostly search apparently for i don't
[1403.62 --> 1409.14]  really entirely know why he would know this if he's on leave no you might still well you might still know
[1409.14 --> 1415.14]  enough about the inner workings to come up with some examples that demonstrate the opposite well okay
[1415.14 --> 1420.34]  the first part totally the the part where they're all looking for hillary not hillary clinton is like
[1420.34 --> 1425.46]  what well you can look for that though um like you can search for relevance like you can search for
[1425.46 --> 1434.02]  um how hot it showed yes they did people were searching for that so basically um oh and so another
[1434.02 --> 1439.06]  thing they pointed out is that many results pop in when you type in donald trump racist but results
[1439.06 --> 1449.30]  also appear for hillary clinton racist um so there you go so basically the conclusion in the verge article
[1449.30 --> 1453.38]  here is they're likely trying to walk the line between providing as much information as they can
[1453.38 --> 1459.38]  and not stepping into a sort of gray legal area by say suggesting that someone could be a criminal
[1460.02 --> 1466.58]  um so here's a state a spokesperson's full statement on the matter google autocomplete does not favor any
[1466.58 --> 1473.06]  candidate or cause claims to the contrary simply misunderstand how you type in donald trump rac yeah
[1473.06 --> 1477.62]  it comes with with donald trump racist if you type hillary clinton rac it comes with
[1477.62 --> 1485.06]  rachel race issue rachel maddow race 2016. oh that's interesting i wonder if that is a regional thing as well
[1487.14 --> 1493.06]  yeah donald trump rac racist snl racist commercial racist articles racist rally it's all racist
[1493.06 --> 1500.02]  i don't know that racism is necessarily a hot button topic for hillary i doubt it i'm just saying
[1500.02 --> 1504.34]  that was said in there yeah that's very interesting doesn't seem true so here hold on we should we should
[1504.34 --> 1509.94]  probably do the demo live if we're going to uh if we're going to talk about this so hillary i don't
[1509.94 --> 1516.66]  even necessarily know because like so there you have it uh so racist costume is my sixth fifth
[1516.66 --> 1523.54]  suggestion all right mine only goes down to four browser thing probably oh no no i'm actually on the
[1523.54 --> 1529.46]  resolution thing or like uh uh zoom thing i'm actually on google's website too you're doing the
[1529.46 --> 1539.06]  browser suggestions okay so there you go oh okay so no no yep no look at so that's a browser thing yeah
[1539.06 --> 1546.02]  because i'm in firefox here in chrome oh yeah okay there you go so age email young news
[1548.18 --> 1554.50]  news twitter wife donald glover okay let's help it out a little bit news twitter wife net worth so
[1554.50 --> 1559.78]  there's nothing particularly incriminating there but it looks like as you continue to dig in and find
[1559.78 --> 1568.98]  examples you can find stuff that um appears to be a bit of an issue so there is an article
[1568.98 --> 1576.18]  over on medium.com that appears to have been done without help from google so here we go um search
[1576.18 --> 1580.18]  trends are a significant factor in how autocomplete works isn't the entire basis for source friends
[1580.18 --> 1585.14]  claiming yet according to their logic google must be favoring donald trump as well because they've got
[1585.14 --> 1593.22]  donald trump ra completely leaves out the quite common search term donald trump rape um which was the
[1593.22 --> 1600.66]  whole alleged thing with uh ivana trump where she eventually took back the statement but she claimed
[1600.66 --> 1608.90]  that he raped her so i guess i didn't follow that closely enough yeah so donald trump la okay so we've
[1608.90 --> 1614.74]  got donald trump lawsuits and donald trump laughing what does it come with latest latest news latest last
[1614.74 --> 1620.82]  night laughing so at this point you're probably thinking this is a great point at this point you're
[1620.82 --> 1625.06]  probably thinking to yourself whoa you're just choosing random words and searching them and he's
[1625.06 --> 1630.74]  like yeah that's right i'm doing exactly what totally makes sense yeah which does make sense so i can
[1630.74 --> 1636.34]  definitely see how source fed came to the conclusion they did because you right there sitting there
[1636.34 --> 1640.82]  we're like well hold on a second what about this this conflicts with that remembering that we're in
[1640.82 --> 1646.82]  a different region and i know that google does specifically target suggestions region by region
[1646.82 --> 1652.98]  uh so outside of america you might get very very different types of suggestions to do with any of
[1652.98 --> 1663.30]  the presidential candidates um versus someone who's actually in the u.s so do i believe that google is 100
[1663.86 --> 1670.58]  ethical no do i believe that they would be stupid enough this might not be a targeted thing to do
[1670.58 --> 1679.54]  something this blatant right um no i i i think this would be really dumb i also have a really hard
[1679.54 --> 1685.46]  time believing that hillary clinton is necessarily the candidate that like google as a whole would have
[1685.46 --> 1694.74]  decided is like ideal um so i mean she seems pretty impressionable better than trump i guess
[1694.74 --> 1702.90]  uh yeah that's such a yeah that's a can of worms actually this is interesting i had um sort of
[1702.90 --> 1710.74]  changing topics i had dinner uh at computex with uh like a self-professed like die-hard trump supporter
[1711.38 --> 1718.18]  and um basically the conversation went something along the lines of people are like where's the tech
[1718.18 --> 1723.14]  talk this is tech by the way just saying the google stuff yeah yeah the google stuff and what i'm telling
[1723.14 --> 1729.54]  you about right now was a conversation i had at computex tech is right in there um so basically
[1729.54 --> 1735.14]  he he like was just out of absolutely nowhere we were talking about something to do with amd's
[1735.14 --> 1740.18]  strategy for fire pro cards and distribution channels or something like that legitimately tech conversation
[1740.82 --> 1746.18]  and then he goes something something something you know my boy donald something something something
[1746.18 --> 1752.50]  and my boy and then he's like well and we were like oh okay so you're a trump supporter
[1752.50 --> 1756.90]  like as if it was not obvious at that point and he goes yeah you know blah blah blah blah blah of
[1756.90 --> 1763.14]  course i am and why what are you like well canadian he's like oh you're socialist then like well you
[1763.14 --> 1773.62]  know what a not necessarily yeah uh for one thing and b um who cares because at a business dinner the
[1773.62 --> 1781.06]  last thing that i'm going to be talking about is socialism for donald trump that is like completely inappropriate
[1782.50 --> 1788.90]  so so yeah but uh hey he's not afraid to speak his mind just like his boy donald so i'll give him that
[1790.58 --> 1798.66]  um however inappropriate or appropriate it might be weren't we supposed to be talking about the 4k
[1798.66 --> 1806.50]  ready playstation yeah i have no no idea how we got how did we i think we stopped no i think we stopped i think we were done
[1806.50 --> 1813.14]  no no no we never made it past the headline we talked about e3 and no because because i saw this
[1813.14 --> 1818.10]  over here and i realized it wasn't on the dock yeah we never got there i'm going through what we did
[1818.10 --> 1822.82]  talk about we talked about three we talked about going to e3 and why we don't anymore yeah we suck at
[1822.82 --> 1828.34]  that so we said it won't be at e3 which was in the headline yeah and then we're like we won't be at e3
[1828.34 --> 1834.82]  either yeah okay so let's talk about the playstation 4 console upgrade to be clear there doesn't seem
[1834.82 --> 1840.50]  to be any indication that this is an upgrade in the sense that you can upgrade your existing console
[1840.50 --> 1846.98]  it looks like there will be an upgraded playstation 4 that will include a faster processor 4k resolutions
[1846.98 --> 1855.70]  oh man i got such a kick out of the endless endless playstation fanboys back at the time of launch that
[1855.70 --> 1863.54]  were like yeah 4k support is coming actually it's not actually it isn't because because actually the
[1863.54 --> 1871.46]  hdmi port on the playstation it's not going to output it so so there's that um yeah so technically
[1871.46 --> 1875.94]  4k support is coming to playstation yes if you buy a completely new device just not yours um
[1876.82 --> 1883.30]  it'll offer 4k resolution support and improved graphics presumably it will also have support for
[1883.30 --> 1890.50]  playstation vr although i don't know if playstation vr is going to be supported on the existing
[1890.50 --> 1896.90]  playstation 4 do you know this no i don't know this that has been an interesting why are your things
[1896.90 --> 1901.70]  like off your screen that's weird i don't know if that's a known thing
[1904.90 --> 1911.30]  yeah i i actually i actually don't know so 500 headband to display blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1911.30 --> 1917.30]  upcoming virtual reality headset for the ps4 console but what's interesting is that the only
[1917.30 --> 1922.58]  confirmation that we have is that there will be an upgraded ps4 they're not actually calling it
[1922.58 --> 1929.62]  something else yeah so if they said psvr is for the playstation 4 i mean if this is like a oh man
[1929.62 --> 1934.90]  because there has been some confusing stuff that's gone on in console generations before you know mini
[1934.90 --> 1941.70]  versions and you know cooler running versions and halo versions and and all kinds of different
[1941.70 --> 1946.34]  different stuff that actually in some cases can have very different hardware and software limitations
[1946.34 --> 1950.82]  i mean early playstation 3s had backwards compatibility with hardware you can install linux on
[1950.82 --> 1954.90]  them they're actually still really cool and then that completely got kicked in the ass those things
[1954.90 --> 1960.34]  are worth money on ebay they are because you can make them computers like there's a isn't there like a military
[1961.30 --> 1966.82]  data center or server or something that's playstation 3s i i think it's like defunct now but i'm sure but
[1966.82 --> 1972.02]  like okay it was a thing wasn't there i mean um might have just been experimental that's also very
[1972.02 --> 1978.10]  possible anyway the console will be priced higher than the current 350 dollars for the existing ps4
[1978.10 --> 1982.98]  and it will be better um so there you go and speaking of things that will be better
[1982.98 --> 1993.62]  all of our talking points for squarespace yay so we are no longer allowed to say you should or build
[1993.62 --> 1999.94]  it beautiful so we need a moment of silence yeah

[2031.62 --> 2033.46]  i'm just trying to keep it the same
[2037.46 --> 2039.62]  you know what we could probably make this work
[2040.82 --> 2047.46]  and if you should no no you're not supposed to say it and if if no hold on but
[2049.30 --> 2053.78]  no i can't i can't i thought maybe i could make it so that the you should could be implied but
[2053.78 --> 2061.86]  the sentence would actually work without it but i don't think i can right oh i'm like sad now yeah
[2062.58 --> 2067.38]  cover pages i was trying to do like the thing so that like we would only take part of it away from
[2067.38 --> 2072.50]  them and then we could like slowly wean it off over time cover pages is a feature that allows you to
[2072.50 --> 2078.34]  set up a beautiful one page online presence in minutes you can start a trial no credit card required

[2094.50 --> 2095.62]  you should keep doing it
[2098.34 --> 2107.62]  there we go uh also in the lineup today is i fix it i fix it is probably the sponsor the actual legitimate
[2107.62 --> 2113.94]  sponsor that actually sponsors the show there are closer ones if you're looking for a kit they're
[2113.94 --> 2122.10]  like right there there's an entire bin of them right there i fix it is probably the sponsor who
[2122.10 --> 2129.54]  actually sponsors the show that i get accused of like of like discreetly working in product placements
[2129.54 --> 2136.82]  for more often than any other because i legitimately use our i fix it stuff all the time i fix it.com is
[2136.82 --> 2142.10]  your complete diy electronics repair solution from there yeah over there that's what i said see he's
[2142.10 --> 2147.30]  going over there now from their 19 000 free step-by-step repair guides to their huge inventory
[2147.30 --> 2152.58]  of replacement parts and tools we've used i fix it stuff for everything from screwdrivers for taking
[2152.58 --> 2160.10]  stuff apart to suction cups for taking stuff apart to um well like more better screwdrivers for taking
[2160.10 --> 2164.82]  stuff apart to lots of different bits for the screw these are actually this is like an old kit too but
[2164.82 --> 2170.02]  we've got like tons of it's funny the old kit is the one we have here because i took the new one home
[2170.02 --> 2175.30]  it's got more driver bits it's got the one i was looking for yeah better spudgers it's got the wrong
[2175.30 --> 2180.34]  one more suction cups it's just generally like super awesome uh we've ordered replacement parts from them
[2180.34 --> 2186.98]  for putting the imac uh the 5k imac that i reviewed back together after i opened it up in order to take
[2186.98 --> 2191.06]  it apart for some reason why did i think that was a good idea anyway i took it apart and put it back
[2191.06 --> 2196.98]  together and all their tools are backed by i fix it lifetime warranty the pro tech toolkit the good
[2196.98 --> 2203.70]  one that i can't show you because it's at home is 69.95 and the best part is you can get 10 bucks oh
[2203.70 --> 2210.34]  nope ah my talking points are wrong five bucks off on a purchase of ten dollars or more my talking points
[2210.34 --> 2216.42]  are exactly correct i just saw the 10 and i jumped the gun there speaking of jumping the gun
[2216.42 --> 2222.90]  i have a link to the cooler master store here that i am supposed to follow
[2223.46 --> 2232.74]  ah yes my friends so cmstore-usa.com has all kinds of interesting stuff everything from cooler master
[2233.22 --> 2239.06]  and uh basically yes everything from cooler master a lot of it's their free form modular stuff expected
[2239.06 --> 2246.26]  to find that like if you saw the cooler master uh video from uh computex you would have seen some of
[2246.26 --> 2251.22]  these things already so those things are made by primo chill actually yeah so these are a little like
[2251.22 --> 2257.78]  you can change the look of the front of your case and the uh power supply basement area to this like
[2257.78 --> 2263.70]  crazy blue thing if that's not your style there's a bunch of other stuff you can do you can get official
[2263.70 --> 2269.22]  stuff from cooler master too which includes like the this crazy handle on the top of the case this
[2269.22 --> 2275.70]  actually ties in really well to the thing that i was criticizing about asus's concept pc that they had
[2275.70 --> 2283.38]  at the show that that one that all assembles with hard pcbs um and the problem is that they were like
[2283.38 --> 2290.26]  oh yeah we'll have like modular upgrades for uh rear io so that an older motherboard could have like usb
[2290.26 --> 2294.74]  type c and you would just have this module that you slot in and i was like well by the time the
[2294.74 --> 2299.70]  distributor and the retailer and the shipper remember you have to get it to a distributor then to a
[2299.70 --> 2304.10]  retailer then to the customer all take their cut these things are going to be inordinately expensive
[2304.10 --> 2308.58]  you might as well just buy a new motherboard wouldn't you need a controller for that too um the controller
[2308.58 --> 2312.98]  is actually in the like upgrade module that's what i'm saying so it's gonna be really expensive yeah so so
[2312.98 --> 2318.34]  well okay so the product manager for the claims it wasn't but i was like yes it sure um
[2318.34 --> 2326.66]  um so cooler master by stocking because that's been a big problem for cases too i bought a windowed
[2326.66 --> 2337.70]  side panel for an antech p160 so that was 12 years ago um anyway so i did that it took like five weeks
[2337.70 --> 2344.18]  to special order because there was like one in the entire country and that's the way it was then and
[2344.18 --> 2350.10]  that's the way it is today when it comes to accessories for computer cases because you just
[2350.10 --> 2355.54]  can't stock enough of them in all the right distribution areas in order to have timely
[2355.54 --> 2359.94]  fulfillment of those orders be possible and that was a windowed side panel i mean it's a relatively
[2359.94 --> 2366.26]  common thing we're not talking like like a freaking you know like slashed like front panel thing
[2366.26 --> 2373.46]  so i actually see cooler masters cooler master store as an interesting solution to that problem
[2373.46 --> 2378.42]  because cooler master themselves is handling this doesn't have to stock a ton of them yeah they can
[2378.42 --> 2383.86]  just say okay let's stock five it doesn't matter or ten does it is they buy the things from the
[2383.86 --> 2390.02]  makers and then resell them too which is pretty cool so you know that like who a master is tracking
[2390.02 --> 2394.50]  their stock and like all this other kind of stuff which actually makes sense so i think it's pretty
[2394.50 --> 2400.02]  cool so the other thing we're supposed to mention i guess is the um uh the master case maker five
[2400.58 --> 2407.06]  so make it what you will i know luke you especially had a lot of skepticism in your brain and in your
[2407.06 --> 2412.26]  heart and probably in your pants about cooler masters whole maker branding and there are still some
[2412.26 --> 2416.10]  products here we're still doing a cooler master sponsor spot but i'm not afraid to criticize them
[2416.10 --> 2420.26]  during a sponsor spot there are still some cooler master products that i look at the maker branding and i
[2420.26 --> 2426.26]  just go like what exactly is maker about this but i've got to give them the vision for the case at
[2426.26 --> 2429.86]  ces they announced that they were going to have this store here we are six months later they have
[2429.86 --> 2436.42]  products in it so they are working on it they are trying to make it actually like maker in some way
[2436.42 --> 2444.50]  yeah i don't understand how like uh beautiful honestly looking power supply uh happens to be maker but
[2444.50 --> 2449.78]  i do appreciate that they did follow up on the store thing i i like it probably would have helped
[2449.78 --> 2453.94]  if i said it in the original video but the first time i covered their free form modular system stuff
[2453.94 --> 2460.26]  yeah was last computex not the most recent one and i gave them like a year or whatever and i talked
[2460.26 --> 2466.10]  to you about it not that long ago yeah like where is that where is that store thing because it's not
[2466.10 --> 2471.94]  here yet and then it showed up like three weeks or a month before computex or something and i was like all right
[2471.94 --> 2477.86]  okay okay all right you made it not by much but you made it but we'll give you that one cooler master
[2477.86 --> 2485.38]  you made it get it yep you made it i got it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah make it beautiful
[2487.38 --> 2492.74]  maker it beautiful all right let's talk about beautiful community interaction the original article
[2492.74 --> 2503.22]  here is from engadget riot used league of legends chat logs to spot bad staff apparently looking
[2503.22 --> 2508.58]  closely at what employees say online it's a good thing i don't do that or ed probably wouldn't have a
[2508.58 --> 2516.90]  job anymore so riot games looked at employees chat logs and found a correlation between their behavior in
[2516.90 --> 2522.82]  and out of game they worked with google's work staff analytics team and picked through the last 12
[2522.82 --> 2531.06]  months of each staffers league of legends gameplay records and chat logs they found that a quarter of
[2531.06 --> 2538.74]  the people they had fired in the last year so they had fired prior to knowing had shown unusually high
[2538.74 --> 2545.78]  levels of toxic behavior in game armed with this information riot used it to proactively address the
[2545.78 --> 2552.26]  problem with remaining staff so they singled out 30 employees all of whom were actually fairly new to
[2552.26 --> 2557.30]  the company and gave them two options those who got a stern warning and those who should be let go
[2558.10 --> 2562.34]  and then during the meetings many employees expressed regret at how they behaved in game
[2562.34 --> 2568.74]  they received essays from employees vowing to change their ways and the report ended with riot's
[2568.74 --> 2574.98]  intention to request league of legends usernames from all future hires for similar analysis
[2575.78 --> 2588.42]  so yeah like social media investigation by potential and current employers just got real very very
[2588.42 --> 2594.18]  real like i wouldn't be and you know what it's it's funny because if you'd asked me yesterday
[2595.06 --> 2601.86]  what is social media i would have said i don't know twitter facebook youtube um and a lot of people
[2601.86 --> 2606.50]  don't even think of youtube like i only think of it because youtube is my primary social platform
[2607.06 --> 2612.98]  um yeah yeah i guess because you yeah okay a lot of people watch a video i mean what percentage leave
[2612.98 --> 2618.58]  a comment under the video it feels more like a tv viewing thing yes instead of a intercommunication thing
[2618.58 --> 2625.06]  like yes but it absolutely is yeah it is a social media platform um i'm not saying it isn't i would
[2625.06 --> 2636.10]  not have said the game i played last saturday night boom so let's get a straw poll going on here like
[2637.86 --> 2641.94]  oh straw poll is what riot did okay
[2641.94 --> 2651.38]  oh and i'm not putting in turnip because i've this is like the requesting kind of a big deal here
[2652.98 --> 2659.62]  seems a little weird does it not for future employees okay so before we before we get into
[2659.62 --> 2665.70]  the answer to that question um let me say this when i applied at ncix
[2665.70 --> 2674.10]  i actually went out of my way to include my forum username yeah so they could review
[2674.90 --> 2681.78]  my posting history on their site i'm not going to say who but uh certain people on like the forum
[2681.78 --> 2686.58]  and certain people that i know through twitch and stuff yeah i've included their handles for the
[2686.58 --> 2691.86]  linus tips forum for certain jobs that they have gotten and that has been part of it so i
[2691.86 --> 2697.78]  really for other jobs yeah i i actually do totally see does one of them have the initial cc
[2700.42 --> 2707.22]  fairly prominent member real initials oh uh i'll talk to you later oh okay okay i'm just i'm idly
[2707.22 --> 2712.18]  curious yeah yeah i'll talk to you later no problem telling you but i'll talk to you okay um and like
[2712.18 --> 2718.50]  it's worked and it's helped them and i understand the voluntary giving of those things yeah and like
[2718.50 --> 2725.54]  having riot be like it's a good thing if you give us your username is probably i i just i think it's
[2725.54 --> 2728.74]  because aren't there certain legal requirements about what you're even allowed to ask for like
[2728.74 --> 2736.34]  you can you can spin it both i i sincerely doubt a gamer handle is even covered but i could see right
[2736.34 --> 2742.42]  spinning it both ways because they could spin it to every candidate this way if you give us your league
[2742.42 --> 2752.02]  of legends username it enables us to help you the good candidate get a job but the implication the
[2752.02 --> 2761.30]  implied back side of that story is that it helps weed out potential jackasses during the interview
[2761.30 --> 2767.14]  process so so some questions that you can't ask is what is your real religious affiliation are you
[2767.14 --> 2772.26]  pregnant what is your political affiliation what is your race color or ethnicity although if you're
[2772.26 --> 2778.98]  in an interview uh anyways sometimes it's not obvious sure most people think my wife is uh i think
[2778.98 --> 2785.78]  i get a lot of people saying she might be filipina but she's not sure um that's a good point how old
[2785.78 --> 2791.86]  are you are you disabled are you married do you have uh children or plan to uh are you in debt do you
[2791.86 --> 2800.98]  you drink or smoke socially socially i guess um so so in that social drink yeah so in that sense
[2802.74 --> 2809.46]  if riot asks for your username they could very indirectly get the answer to like everything
[2809.46 --> 2814.34]  there they could get the answers to pretty much all of that especially because that probably includes
[2814.34 --> 2820.10]  whispers what if it doesn't though let's say it doesn't let's assume let's assume let's let's give
[2820.10 --> 2824.02]  the benefit of the doubt let's say it doesn't include whispers right okay so let's say it only
[2824.02 --> 2832.34]  includes public chat but by the time you post that information on a public server have you
[2833.46 --> 2838.18]  yeah have you have you put that information on your forehead no because there's also implied anonymity
[2839.22 --> 2845.62]  through your username you're not playing as minus sebastian right you're playing as whatever i do
[2845.62 --> 2851.30]  because i give up but sure yeah but like okay you know what i mean though yeah yeah yeah i give up too
[2851.30 --> 2857.94]  um i don't actually use my real but yeah yeah i give up uh i twitch stream what am i supposed to do
[2857.94 --> 2864.98]  um but yeah like i don't know okay so let's let's hear from the viewers this is split pretty much right
[2864.98 --> 2873.62]  down the middle i saw that we've got 53 of you saying it's okay riot has the right to know what you and
[2873.62 --> 2879.06]  you know what it might be in their eula somewhere riot has the right to know before you work for them
[2879.06 --> 2886.18]  that's our neighbor what you posted on their privately owned servers which is an interesting
[2886.18 --> 2894.26]  point riot probably has terms in their eula that entitle them to ownership of everything that gets posted
[2894.26 --> 2899.30]  in much the same way that linustech tips.com owns anything you post on it sure through the end user
[2899.30 --> 2903.86]  license that doesn't have to do with you forfeiting the information of your username right but you
[2903.86 --> 2911.22]  knowingly and willingly posted that with maybe you figured you were anonymous but you weren't
[2911.22 --> 2917.78]  according to the end user license agreement you willingly and knowingly posted that publicly yeah yeah
[2917.78 --> 2923.38]  but so it's still it's still not forfeiting your username because you could falsify your personal data
[2923.38 --> 2929.06]  that's true signing up but if the eula says you're not allowed to do that eula's also
[2929.06 --> 2938.02]  don't hold up like ever that's true they don't but if riot's company policy is that all employees
[2938.02 --> 2944.50]  subject to termination if they fail to comply need to follow the eula but can you can you go around
[2944.50 --> 2949.94]  let's say if there was i'm going into theoreticals here yeah if that list of stuff that i just said
[2949.94 --> 2957.46]  included gamer tag for whatever reason would circumventing that by saying that they have to follow the
[2957.46 --> 2963.06]  eula is that legal i guess john and it i don't think it comes down to legality or not legality
[2963.06 --> 2972.26]  because ultimately you can you can control what an employee posts on your privately owned servers as
[2972.26 --> 2977.78]  a company yeah it's not about control though this is reading the last 12 months right so going back
[2977.78 --> 2982.34]  yeah i'm looking at it well ultimately because there could be a code of conduct within the company where
[2982.34 --> 2987.86]  you have to act a certain way yeah like costco has a code of ethics yeah they have like an entire
[2987.86 --> 2993.46]  handbook it's like this thick it's like here's uh you know here's the value up to which you can accept
[2993.46 --> 3001.30]  a dinner from someone here's this that that that that and that um you know you know what's funny is i have
[3001.30 --> 3011.78]  actually kind of talked myself into it you're also uh an employer no but even outside of that because
[3012.42 --> 3017.94]  while i because we've talked about this before yeah and i don't remember what stance i took but
[3018.50 --> 3027.06]  you know whatever well we have uh to give some insight we have uh not necessarily changed opinions but
[3027.06 --> 3031.86]  but added information to what we thought about a person that was going through an interview process
[3031.86 --> 3038.34]  with us by looking at their social media yes oh long time ago you were in on that did i was it
[3038.34 --> 3044.26]  it was their twitter account yeah okay okay so this was a long time ago did they tweet at us i i think
[3044.26 --> 3050.26]  the twitter account was was given to us okay so it was given to us yeah okay but we clearly have no problem
[3050.26 --> 3056.82]  looking at social media for things now with that said i personally don't really like this the
[3056.82 --> 3062.90]  reason why i don't really like this is because of the implied anonymity of your username if you post
[3062.90 --> 3069.38]  something on twitter or to a public facebook account that is very searchable and is directly attached to
[3069.38 --> 3073.86]  your name i think of course that's searchable by your employer i don't think you have to forfeit
[3073.86 --> 3082.58]  those accounts but they're under your name and are searchable so whatever so i don't like
[3082.58 --> 3093.30]  the idea of creeping something that wasn't provided yeah especially if it's a third party so if riot was
[3093.30 --> 3097.22]  saying you have to provide your facebook username because i've heard of employers demanding this
[3098.18 --> 3104.34]  you have to you have to you know what's your facebook yeah and we intend to look at it like if
[3104.34 --> 3111.62]  they demanded that that's one thing and that to me is actually very different from demanding to know
[3111.62 --> 3115.38]  what potential employees or current employees because they only did this for current employees
[3115.38 --> 3119.62]  and then the potential employees is moving forward now so they did this for current employees yeah
[3119.62 --> 3123.78]  what your current employees are posting on a server you own yeah i was just going to say that's also a
[3123.78 --> 3130.02]  different thing because it's their platform and i could definitely see this this might change my
[3130.02 --> 3136.10]  opinion a little bit because it's their platform that's like how they are treading on your turf
[3136.10 --> 3142.34]  yeah it's how they are representing your brand i was applying this to like any gamer tag right so
[3142.34 --> 3148.18]  like if you played wow and league of legends they would want to have both of them you know what i
[3148.18 --> 3152.34]  mean yeah but that's not what they're asking no i know because they wouldn't have the ability to do
[3152.34 --> 3160.10]  that anyway right so but i think that would be more wrong anyway yeah i think so too i think what an
[3160.10 --> 3165.54]  employee on your turf wanting to know your stuff for your own servers i actually totally see that if if
[3165.54 --> 3168.74]  someone wanted to apply to work here and we're on the forum i would want to know what their account
[3168.74 --> 3172.90]  was and i would want to see how they conducted themselves on the forum i wouldn't ask for their
[3172.90 --> 3178.66]  other accounts so i actually i guess i do agree with it i just don't agree with it as a a gamer tag in
[3178.66 --> 3186.82]  general a gamer tag in general feels like it should just be this is my escapism land yeah that's what i
[3186.82 --> 3190.74]  was trying to defend it's your anonymous area you should just and sometimes you role play
[3190.74 --> 3200.66]  role playing is a thing how i behave as a gamer tag shouldn't necessarily be the be all and end all
[3200.66 --> 3205.86]  of someone how it's how someone interprets who i am and what i am as a person but i also see where
[3205.86 --> 3212.74]  riot's coming from which is if you're role playing an asshole they to the community of our paying
[3212.74 --> 3218.50]  customers who you're trying to apply for and will be representing in some way or another yeah who you're
[3218.50 --> 3223.54]  ultimately serving at your like freaking day job that we're paying for right is going to want someone
[3223.54 --> 3229.78]  who uh well like compared to a negative person they would want someone who's trying to make the
[3229.78 --> 3236.66]  community better because that's the exact same kind of deal as the person in the interview uh who is
[3236.66 --> 3243.54]  actively trying to find ways and offer up ways that they could improve the company and who have
[3243.54 --> 3248.34]  pre-thought about these things like like the the standard thing like if you're applying for a
[3248.34 --> 3253.86]  social media position being like oh i have these ideas for improving your social media situation
[3253.86 --> 3257.14]  because i've already looked at what you're doing and analyzed what you're doing and thought about
[3257.14 --> 3261.94]  it and tried these practices and whatnot that's a very good thing to bring to that interview um
[3262.66 --> 3268.34]  bringing to that interview that you obviously didn't care and are contributing to a toxic environment
[3268.34 --> 3272.82]  just not twitchplace pokemon says someone was role playing at me real hard in an overwatch match
[3272.82 --> 3280.18]  i played last night we're not saying that role playing an is okay we're just saying that
[3281.46 --> 3286.02]  i think we specifically didn't yeah it might not necessarily be who you are as a person yeah
[3286.66 --> 3295.70]  um okay team viewer confirms number of abused user accounts is significant uh so your original article
[3295.70 --> 3303.38]  here is from bleeping computer.com they apologize but they still say they were not compromised which
[3303.38 --> 3311.14]  is something that has yet to be actually proven even though redditors and some blogs out there have
[3311.78 --> 3319.06]  offered up some evidence that looks fairly compelling to suggest that they were indeed compromised so uh
[3319.86 --> 3325.06]  what well they were definitely compromised the the question is whether or not team viewer
[3326.02 --> 3332.18]  was compromised like their records that that's the compromise yeah um but team viewer accounts
[3332.18 --> 3338.98]  were definitely we're definitely compromised so the suggested course of action it right now is to
[3338.98 --> 3344.02]  protect your accounts with secure passwords that are frequently changed have reliable anti-malware
[3344.02 --> 3348.34]  and security solutions in place at all times and enable two-factor authentication that's what team
[3348.34 --> 3354.18]  viewer is suggesting um there's other stuff that you can do uh the way that i was once compromised
[3354.18 --> 3360.66]  well not not me personally i've never been compromised i'm not compromising not i don't know what i'm
[3360.66 --> 3365.30]  talking about anyway anyway the way the linus tech tips channel was compromised was through a keylogger
[3365.30 --> 3370.98]  um where i did not have two-factor authentication enabled because i don't remember if it was available
[3370.98 --> 3376.90]  yet i doubt it was back then it was a long time ago anyway um so through a keylogger so one of the
[3376.90 --> 3381.86]  other ways that you can avoid getting your password sniped by a keylogger is by having something like
[3381.86 --> 3386.74]  a password keeper like lastpass that's one thing that people are questioning is they're saying
[3387.94 --> 3390.42]  i had a two-step enabled and they still got in
[3392.18 --> 3395.14]  we don't have any confirmations of these things but hearing that is bad
[3395.78 --> 3402.90]  um one one thing that i'm gonna say is uh not to bring this up again but quite a while ago we had a
[3402.90 --> 3412.18]  breach on the line of sectors forum which is super mega sucked um and even if that wasn't our fault
[3414.02 --> 3420.10]  you still have to kind of uh be a little more proactive you should probably considering this is
[3420.10 --> 3426.02]  an exploit that's going against your software sure their breach isn't your fault but it's still an
[3426.02 --> 3433.46]  exploit that is widely significantly going against your software you should probably inform your
[3433.46 --> 3439.54]  users yep that this could be a problem suggest password changes proactively through an email
[3439.54 --> 3445.30]  suggest two-step they have my email address one thing that can't reach me was like busted our email
[3445.30 --> 3450.66]  reputation by making sure that we hammered emails out as fast as we could to all of our users to let
[3450.66 --> 3454.90]  them know which actually hurt us in the longer term no one from hot no one at a microsoft domain got an
[3454.90 --> 3460.74]  email from us for months for a very long time including password reset emails yeah which was a
[3460.74 --> 3465.14]  nightmare thanks microsoft we were just trying to help people and then they ignored us for months
[3465.14 --> 3472.02]  with trying to get anyway anyways um so pretty much the way the attack works is people are breaking into
[3472.02 --> 3478.34]  your team viewer into your computer with team viewer and then they are using presumably saved passwords on
[3478.34 --> 3485.06]  your computer please don't do that um for example if you have a password keeper i don't understand why
[3485.06 --> 3489.46]  this isn't a default option but actually while you're in your next security audit can you run around and
[3489.46 --> 3494.74]  make sure everyone has it set to time out after a very short period of time make sure your password
[3494.74 --> 3500.66]  keeper times out like for the love of everything that is valuable to you time out your password keeper
[3500.66 --> 3505.70]  that's the whole point so what they're doing is they're going into whether it's you're using chrome to save your
[3505.70 --> 3510.02]  password which by the way is really stupid um or firefox save your passwords which by the way is even
[3510.02 --> 3515.86]  super stupider because it saves it in plain text in a file in like data roaming local whatever it is
[3516.42 --> 3522.34]  um what was i oh yeah so then they're using your safe passwords to drain your bank account and your
[3522.34 --> 3528.50]  paypal which there's not a whole lot that um anyone can do about once it's done if the action was
[3528.50 --> 3538.10]  effectively done by you um right we've got a lot of topics left some of which i like really did want
[3538.10 --> 3551.38]  to uh like what talk about real quick here um where'd it go um um where did it go
[3551.38 --> 3559.78]  how about maybe up no i've had like i had something i really wanted to do like tied into the team viewer
[3559.78 --> 3564.18]  one i had like a segue and everything and it's completely not in my mind anymore this
[3566.26 --> 3576.50]  no okay no it was cool this no that's cool too but not not as cool um oh well
[3576.50 --> 3584.34]  oh this oh this no oh that ties in yeah no and no it was like something else like it might not have
[3584.34 --> 3589.70]  actually oh this is a doc uh oh yeah wait no no this oh this apparently got rejected
[3590.90 --> 3598.90]  i don't know i don't know why uh why did that get rejected um i don't know i actually don't know
[3598.90 --> 3609.78]  oh um oh okay well i don't know why it was rejected so i'm not gonna go too far into it but uh
[3610.42 --> 3615.78]  twitch troll donates fifty thousand dollars to streamers paypal allegedly refuses to refund
[3615.78 --> 3620.50]  maybe we don't actually have confirmation on whether paypal is refunding it or not
[3620.50 --> 3626.34]  ah yeah okay nick nick is nick is filling it in for me conflicting reports okay so i was gonna try and
[3626.34 --> 3630.34]  tie that and well i think that pretty much wraps it up for the lan show i do want to do a call out
[3630.34 --> 3636.90]  for nerd sports guys if you haven't already uh check it out over on vessel they offer a seven day free
[3636.90 --> 3644.02]  trial night vision ah that makes sense uh they offer a seven day free trial where you can see uh linus

[3649.54 --> 3655.62]  creators and it should also be noted that nerd sports uh all five episodes of which are up there
[3656.34 --> 3662.98]  and for whatever reason not particularly searchable there it is one word apparently uh all five of
