[0.00 → 18.50] All right guys, welcome to the WAN show. It is that time again this week, the time that I set aside to spend with you, all of you out there in Twitch streaming land.
[18.50 → 29.74] And oh crap, I've got the tab open on my laptop, and I'm like 20 seconds behind, and I can hear myself and okay, I've managed to make it so that I'm not going crazy anymore, which is nice.
[30.38 → 40.42] I am unfortunately without Luke this week, which is a real shame, but he's basically got some stuff he's got to deal with this week and I totally get it.
[40.42 → 57.02] So I'm going to hopefully have someone join me in a short while here. And you know, it's funny, I was planning to have the show go completely smoothly with no hitches in his absence the way that he claims that it always goes when I'm not around.
[57.02 → 75.40] But I will confess to you now, I have not yet actually tested my screen share. So this is the moment of truth. Will I be having an easy, well not easy, I mean, you know, live-streaming is very difficult, very, very difficult?
[75.40 → 88.04] But will I be having a seamless show today or no? Oh, look at that. Nailed it. Yes, my friend. So we've got a lot of great topics for you today. There's been some big news and there's been some little news.
[88.90 → 97.78] Researchers built a 1000 core processor. I'll be talking about that and why it probably doesn't mean a lot to you and won't for quite some time.
[97.78 → 120.08] YouTube's terms of service have been updated. It's mostly around their harassment and cyberbullying policy. So that is going to have potentially huge ramifications for some YouTubers out there who are basically making a living out of harassment and cyberbullying.
[120.08 → 134.34] Twitch brings CAA and trademark claim against bot operators. Apparently they are a persistent frustration. That is some strong language coming from their senior vice president marketing.
[134.34 → 150.84] Okay. And in much huger news that's not necessarily directly, purely tech related, but will absolutely have an effect on technology and how that works, especially for Europeans moving forward.
[150.84 → 163.64] The UK has voted to leave the EU. It is final, but there are some important other notes about it that we're going to be talking a little bit about later.
[163.64 → 176.26] So without further ado, let's get on Twitch chat here and see if, wow, no one is complaining. That is amazing.
[177.48 → 184.32] And here come all the complaints. So let's roll the intro so that I can just, you don't even have to watch me pretending not to read them.
[193.64 → 193.80] 2010
[223.64 → 226.98] and those are all the same, but the blank ones.
[229.18 → 231.26] One of these days, one of these days,
[231.26 → 234.10] we're going to become a real professional media company
[234.10 → 236.68] and we're not going to make little mistakes like,
[236.74 → 237.30] who am I kidding?
[237.52 → 238.32] That's never happening.
[238.42 → 240.94] All right, so let's jump right into our first topic here.
[241.02 → 243.80] The original article here is from Gadget.
[243.80 → 248.26] Researchers build a 1,000 core processor
[248.26 → 251.68] that they call the Kilo Core.
[251.68 → 254.30] Yep, that makes sense.
[254.96 → 258.26] So in a nutshell, what a Kilo Core
[258.26 → 262.26] or a many, many core processors would be optimized for
[262.26 → 265.14] is, as you can well imagine,
[265.64 → 269.56] performing many, many parallel operations.
[269.56 → 274.10] So that's many, many, many, many small things all at once.
[274.18 → 278.66] This is not going to have pretty much any relevance to you,
[278.66 → 281.84] the person sitting there who wants to play games
[281.84 → 285.66] or encode video that you edited,
[286.06 → 289.84] or, I mean, really most of what you would consider
[289.84 → 291.96] to be a home use for a computer.
[292.04 → 293.72] This is not going to have any relevance for you.
[293.72 → 296.76] I don't want to say ever,
[296.94 → 298.60] because ever is a huge word,
[298.80 → 302.10] but for a very, very long time,
[302.18 → 304.92] because the limitation of the way
[304.92 → 307.32] that we currently code software
[307.32 → 310.72] is usually, when it comes to performance,
[311.12 → 314.30] the single-threaded performance of the CPU
[314.30 → 317.16] or CPUs that are being used to handle the workload.
[317.16 → 320.70] It will take an enormous change
[320.70 → 322.62] in the way that programming is done
[322.62 → 327.16] for something like this hyper-low-power Kilo Core processor
[327.70 → 331.12] to have much relevance to someone who wants to,
[331.36 → 333.66] even, you know, general web browsing
[333.66 → 337.16] can consume a lot of CPU horsepower these days.
[337.26 → 340.90] But there are things that it can be used for,
[341.02 → 343.08] sorting through data, encryption.
[343.08 → 346.18] One of the applicability sort of notes
[346.18 → 348.08] that I have in here is encoding videos,
[348.22 → 349.96] but that is heavily dependent
[349.96 → 353.04] on the codec being used for one thing
[353.04 → 354.80] and for, well, I mean,
[354.90 → 357.58] how many video streams you're trying to encode.
[357.70 → 361.52] So if you could make a thousand-core processor
[361.52 → 364.76] that is powerful enough for each of the cores
[364.76 → 367.40] to handle an individual encoding stream,
[367.50 → 370.60] holy crap, I mean, I could see a site like Twitch
[370.60 → 375.04] or like YouTube being all over that kind of technology.
[375.16 → 378.00] It's like, you mean we can have a thousand cores,
[378.18 → 381.18] each of which can handle an incoming video encoding request
[381.18 → 383.60] from a file upload by itself?
[383.96 → 385.48] And these things can consume,
[385.70 → 389.78] let's see, 0.7 watts total?
[389.92 → 392.68] I mean, the whole thing could run on an AA battery.
[392.86 → 394.62] And this is without the benefit
[394.62 → 397.00] of the latest manufacturing process node.
[397.00 → 400.66] So this was actually built on 32 nanometre technology,
[400.88 → 404.30] which is quite archaic at this point in time.
[404.68 → 406.40] Though it should be noted that a mere, what,
[406.48 → 408.14] I don't know, four or five years ago,
[408.16 → 410.54] that would have been considered state of the art.
[410.78 → 416.10] So the processor handles 115 billion instructions per second.
[416.28 → 419.00] And part of what makes it operate so efficiently at the core
[419.00 → 422.30] is that the cores transfer data to each other directly
[422.30 → 424.64] rather than on a shared cache of memory.
[424.64 → 427.88] Though, again, it should be noted that that will only be more efficient
[427.88 → 432.58] for certain workloads where the cores need to share data directly with each other
[432.58 → 436.16] and where you can build enough interconnects for the cores
[436.16 → 440.04] to not have to leap over multiple other cores
[440.04 → 441.46] in order to access another one.
[441.82 → 442.58] Very, very cool.
[442.80 → 444.54] So let's just see if there's a
[445.06 → 447.62] is there like a picture I can show you or anything like that?
[447.62 → 449.06] It looks like most of the news articles,
[449.16 → 450.90] this one's over on bgr.com,
[450.90 → 455.74] are just pulling generic CPU pictures off of Shutterstock here.
[456.18 → 459.50] Ooh, flight attendants and passengers get away with this all the time.
[460.32 → 460.86] Fascinating.
[461.72 → 462.14] Love it.
[462.36 → 463.08] Thank you for that.
[463.16 → 466.82] Love those sponsored articles under the actual article that I'm trying to read.
[468.20 → 468.96] All right.
[468.96 → 472.96] So the original source here is Dexerto.com,
[473.64 → 477.52] a site that we've never actually referred to before as far as I'm aware.
[478.14 → 479.58] Just go ahead and make sure that's paused.
[481.50 → 487.00] So there have been some changes to the YouTube terms of service that target harassment.
[487.24 → 488.50] Now, to be clear,
[488.66 → 493.58] I don't have a strong objection to changing terms of service
[493.58 → 496.74] to prevent cyberbullying or harassment.
[496.74 → 499.60] And honestly, I don't know why we really even call it cyberbullying.
[499.74 → 500.62] Bullying is bullying.
[501.22 → 503.10] And calling it e-bullying,
[503.30 → 504.10] it's almost like,
[504.18 → 506.46] or cyberbullying is almost like softening it.
[506.54 → 509.22] I mean, what's actually, you know,
[509.56 → 511.66] what would be considered more adulterous?
[512.34 → 514.72] Sex or cybersex?
[515.38 → 518.60] You know, what do we consider to be more sport-like?
[519.06 → 521.46] Sports or e-sports?
[521.60 → 523.94] And I don't personally believe that cyberbullying
[523.94 → 529.32] has the potential to be any less harmful than any other type of bullying.
[529.44 → 532.08] And in fact, I think it can make you feel much more trapped
[532.08 → 534.30] because you can't even escape from it online.
[534.66 → 538.54] So anyway, YouTube has made some changes to the terms.
[538.94 → 545.44] In cases where harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack,
[545.76 → 548.38] it can be reported and will be removed.
[548.38 → 554.22] So this is referring specifically to a video that a user would upload.
[554.38 → 558.76] So harassment may include abusive videos, comments, and messages,
[559.22 → 562.44] revealing someone's personal information, which is great.
[562.64 → 565.06] I mean, doxing is never okay.
[565.64 → 568.26] Maliciously recording someone without their consent.
[568.64 → 569.34] That's interesting.
[569.52 → 571.60] How do you determine that it is malicious?
[571.60 → 577.46] And I mean, what does that do for an awful lot of YouTube videos
[577.46 → 578.32] that are just like,
[578.48 → 581.96] this person failed, look how stupid they are.
[583.06 → 585.06] That's interesting.
[585.20 → 590.12] That could have serious ramifications for content that will be uploaded
[590.12 → 591.88] and a lot of content that's already on the site.
[592.26 → 596.46] Making hurtful and negative comments and videos about another person
[596.46 → 600.16] deliberately posting content in order to humiliate someone.
[600.88 → 605.66] Unwanted sexualization, which encompasses sexual harassment
[605.66 → 608.00] or sexual bullying in any form.
[608.66 → 613.50] And incitement to harass other users or creators.
[614.64 → 619.18] Interesting note is that, what's that channel called?
[619.32 → 620.12] Drama Alert?
[620.56 → 621.04] Yeah.
[621.16 → 621.54] Or something?
[621.74 → 623.56] Killer Keen star.
[623.56 → 629.04] Yeah, Drama Alert got a new host within minutes?
[629.48 → 630.52] Minutes of this announcement?
[630.72 → 631.78] Hours of this announcement?
[631.92 → 632.26] Hi, Nick.
[632.30 → 632.86] Welcome to the show.
[633.24 → 633.82] Hello, everyone.
[634.38 → 636.74] That's partially due to that and partially due to the fact
[636.74 → 639.10] that he's just a really, you know.
[639.12 → 639.82] Remember, hold on.
[639.86 → 640.84] We're uploading this to YouTube.
[641.04 → 641.98] No personal attacks.
[642.10 → 642.86] Okay, no harassment.
[642.86 → 645.08] He is allegedly not a very nice person.
[645.38 → 645.78] Allegedly.
[646.88 → 649.22] And a lot of people have been posting videos
[649.22 → 650.48] essentially attacking him.
[650.48 → 654.08] So it's like a two-fold thing, I think, with that.
[654.18 → 655.98] But yes, they did replace their hosts.
[656.08 → 659.64] It's funny how swords can have two edges on them, isn't it?
[660.30 → 661.86] I mean...
[661.86 → 664.10] It cuts both ways, as the kids say.
[665.12 → 667.46] Actually, I think that's a somewhat dated expression.
[667.68 → 668.12] Which kids?
[668.18 → 668.68] Yeah, which...
[668.68 → 669.58] The 70-year-old kids?
[669.58 → 672.48] Oh, come on.
[672.52 → 673.44] I'm not 70.
[674.02 → 678.48] Anyway, you can report people that are breaking the new and updated terms of service
[678.48 → 680.16] using YouTube's reporting tool.
[680.44 → 685.52] Speaking of which, I actually need to deal with a false flag on one of our stupid videos.
[685.80 → 685.94] Oh?
[686.36 → 687.58] Yeah, every...
[688.22 → 692.24] It's basically, it's like just, you know, no, this isn't valid.
[692.24 → 697.92] Especially once you're a verified YouTuber.
[698.18 → 700.84] It's pretty simple to deal with a lot of those types of reports.
[701.46 → 705.12] But every once in a while, someone will say that our video needs closed captioning.
[706.24 → 707.12] Which...
[707.12 → 708.22] That would be nice.
[708.88 → 709.52] Yeah, yeah.
[709.88 → 711.24] We've looked into it before.
[711.38 → 712.72] It's just really expensive.
[712.90 → 714.32] No, they're saying it needs it.
[714.76 → 717.94] Some videos legally must have closed captioning.
[717.94 → 725.36] If they've been uploaded as broadcast television in the United States, then they must be closed
[725.36 → 726.02] captioned.
[726.38 → 730.42] So, for us, it's just a matter of going, no, actually, it doesn't need that.
[730.42 → 735.10] I think it's also in Canada, if it's supposed to be used as like a public resource, then I
[735.10 → 736.56] think it has to have closed captioning as well.
[736.64 → 741.30] So, there are some terms of service-y funny stuff that, you know, every once in a while
[741.30 → 741.82] happens.
[741.82 → 746.80] But this is pretty, potentially pretty far-reaching.
[746.80 → 750.92] I mean, fortunately, it doesn't have an impact on us.
[751.28 → 756.60] But what it does do is it highlights for us, and I mean, really for any online content creator,
[756.72 → 761.14] once again, the powerlessness that we have.
[761.24 → 766.66] I mean, on the one hand, you think, yeah, you know, internet video, you know, kind of
[766.66 → 769.96] freedom of expression, say whatever you want.
[769.96 → 776.64] But at the end of the day, what people have to realize is that YouTube.com is Google's
[776.64 → 776.96] playground.
[777.66 → 781.14] And if you want to play in Google's playground, you've got to play by Google's rules.
[781.52 → 787.42] And while this, again, doesn't affect us because we don't harass or bully people on the Linus
[787.42 → 792.88] Tech Tips channel because a, well, okay, there are certain manufacturers that you could argue
[792.88 → 794.54] that I wasn't very nice to their product.
[794.54 → 795.50] But that's not personal.
[795.66 → 796.52] That's the product.
[797.94 → 799.74] But these terms are pretty open-ended.
[800.10 → 800.32] Yep.
[800.52 → 806.34] And that's like my huge concern with it is what are they going to constitute as bullying?
[806.96 → 808.94] Are they going to constitute satire as bullying?
[809.20 → 809.52] Yeah.
[809.52 → 810.94] Because that's a massive concern.
[811.64 → 816.72] And I think that, you know, I'm not like someone who's like, oh, this is the beginning
[816.72 → 818.06] of the end for YouTube or anything.
[818.24 → 821.10] But it brings up a lot of concerning questions.
[821.40 → 825.28] And censorship is often the lead to the death of a platform.
[826.34 → 830.72] So I think that as long as YouTube has the resources in place to actually handle this properly
[830.72 → 834.62] and they're just going to make sure that they review everything before they do it,
[834.66 → 838.48] unlike their copyright system, they don't have a great history of doing this.
[838.48 → 843.40] As long as they handle it properly, I think it's a good thing for the platform.
[843.50 → 847.66] Because let's be honest, lately there has been a lot of questionable content on the platform.
[849.20 → 852.82] But it has a huge potential to go bad.
[852.96 → 856.90] With that said, they are making strides towards improving these things.
[856.90 → 862.90] For example, it used to be that if someone filed a copyright claim against you,
[863.88 → 865.74] your monetization got pulled.
[865.74 → 871.42] Even though the video might stay up during the appeal period, but your monetization got pulled.
[871.62 → 873.24] So, for example...
[873.24 → 876.68] The monetization would go to the person who was claiming it, right?
[876.82 → 877.74] I don't think so.
[877.86 → 881.34] In some situations, I think, if it was like someone who...
[881.34 → 882.96] Auto detection of music, yes.
[883.76 → 886.14] But depending on what it was, sometimes monetization...
[886.14 → 892.70] And I've had monetization just pulled for other reasons during a dispute or an appeal period.
[892.70 → 895.86] For example, this is actually a great example.
[895.98 → 897.20] It's an older one now.
[897.70 → 902.00] But I'm just going to pull up the video because this was...
[902.00 → 906.16] I was so freaking mad about this at the time.
[906.24 → 908.24] Obviously, it's water under the bridge at this point.
[908.24 → 909.86] I love my YouTube overlords.
[912.50 → 913.30] We love you.
[913.38 → 914.28] Please don't shut us down.
[914.28 → 916.12] Yeah, please don't shut down my channel.
[916.20 → 916.80] But check this out.
[916.88 → 919.42] So, this is one of my older videos.
[919.54 → 922.48] This is back from 2012.
[922.92 → 924.88] And I have no idea how loud this is for you guys.
[924.88 → 928.88] But this is my unboxing of the original Racer Blade.
[930.00 → 931.80] So, let's go ahead and full screen this baby.
[931.90 → 932.90] Yeah, check that out.
[932.96 → 933.82] It was a...
[933.82 → 934.26] What was it?
[934.42 → 935.00] A 15...
[935.00 → 935.70] 17 inch?
[935.70 → 936.24] Something like that.
[936.28 → 937.32] Yeah, it was a big old thing.
[937.40 → 938.92] It had like this weird...
[938.92 → 939.86] Weird...
[939.86 → 942.62] This was called the Switchblade interface.
[943.64 → 947.30] So, Racer Blade thin and light gaming notebook featuring...
[947.30 → 949.88] And you guys can't read all the way over here because we were covering it.
[949.94 → 950.66] And I'll just move us.
[951.00 → 953.54] Featuring Switchblade unboxing.
[953.54 → 965.36] So, what happened with this video was that YouTube actually flagged it automatically for dangerous content containing weapons.
[967.42 → 969.28] So, I'm going to pull up...
[969.28 → 970.86] Yeah, yeah.
[970.96 → 973.68] So, I'm going to pull up the analytics for this video.
[973.84 → 977.90] And I'll explain exactly why I was so upset about it.
[977.90 → 987.62] So, the way that my compensation structure worked at NCI at the time was I had a monthly quota for how many videos I had to make.
[987.62 → 992.62] So, I think it was as high as 45 at one time.
[992.78 → 994.82] 45 unboxing was like my quota.
[995.06 → 996.38] And I got a flat rate.
[996.48 → 997.50] And it was very little.
[997.56 → 1000.62] It was like $10 per unboxing or something like that.
[1000.68 → 1003.18] Like it was a pretty low rate or like $15 or something.
[1003.74 → 1006.82] But remember, the production values weren't what they are now.
[1006.94 → 1007.48] It was like...
[1007.48 → 1008.50] It was one shot.
[1008.88 → 1009.68] Me and my wife.
[1009.68 → 1009.92] The camera.
[1010.44 → 1010.70] Okay.
[1010.82 → 1011.98] Sometimes there were two shots.
[1012.86 → 1014.04] If you made a mistake.
[1014.68 → 1016.56] Sometimes there weren't two shots if I made a mistake.
[1016.66 → 1020.00] So, let's be careful with how we say the two shots ended up in the video.
[1020.10 → 1025.18] Back in the day, if Linus made a mistake, sometimes it was the person behind the camera waving frantically going,
[1025.68 → 1025.98] Stop.
[1026.18 → 1026.44] Stop.
[1026.64 → 1026.92] Stop.
[1027.04 → 1028.04] And then the shot would cut.
[1028.10 → 1028.94] And then he'd come back and go,
[1029.20 → 1030.84] Okay, actually, yeah, I was wrong.
[1030.88 → 1031.58] It's actually this.
[1031.64 → 1032.96] And they would just leave that in the video.
[1032.96 → 1035.96] So, for all you knew viewers out there, if you think it's bad now...
[1035.96 → 1036.64] Yeah.
[1037.86 → 1038.10] Of.
[1038.10 → 1038.22] Of.
[1038.98 → 1040.06] So, let's go.
[1040.20 → 1042.60] Let's pull up my analytics for this video here.
[1042.90 → 1045.26] And I will show you guys why I was so upset.
[1045.38 → 1045.62] Okay.
[1045.86 → 1048.36] So, I got a flat rate for the videos that I made.
[1048.56 → 1054.00] And then what I also got was a cut of the YouTube AdSense.
[1054.54 → 1057.92] So, that was how we ended up with ads on the videos.
[1058.40 → 1060.10] So, here are the first...
[1060.80 → 1062.90] I don't know however many days this is.
[1062.98 → 1065.96] Like 20 days some odd of this video.
[1066.50 → 1067.96] It got pulled immediately.
[1067.96 → 1070.24] Because of the word Switchblade.
[1071.12 → 1074.40] And in the first five days.
[1074.82 → 1077.74] For me, in 2012.
[1078.28 → 1078.58] Okay.
[1079.12 → 1081.36] Like 70,000, 80,000 views.
[1081.44 → 1082.58] Like how many views is this?
[1083.02 → 1087.68] About 80,000 to 90,000 views in the first week was unheard of.
[1087.90 → 1089.28] That was a big deal.
[1089.36 → 1090.82] That was like huge for me.
[1091.54 → 1095.26] Also, the CPMs, I believe, were higher on the platform at the time.
[1095.76 → 1097.90] And a variety of other reasons why this was really upsetting.
[1098.42 → 1099.98] But it just got pulled.
[1100.70 → 1102.10] It just got completely pulled.
[1102.22 → 1103.42] I got nothing for it.
[1103.42 → 1109.16] And even though, like, my appeal was like, yo, this is clearly a laptop computer.
[1109.58 → 1111.16] And nothing to do with razors.
[1111.48 → 1112.76] Nothing to do with blades.
[1112.96 → 1114.86] And nothing to do with Switchblade knives.
[1114.86 → 1118.06] Hey, put this back.
[1119.02 → 1121.12] But they would just turn the monetization off.
[1121.30 → 1121.94] And it's just gone.
[1122.06 → 1122.30] Poof.
[1123.06 → 1126.80] So the point of that really long story was they're improving.
[1126.98 → 1127.96] They're getting better.
[1128.34 → 1128.64] It's true.
[1128.76 → 1132.00] But it's not perfect yet.
[1132.00 → 1136.22] And I totally, totally hope that they don't screw this up.
[1137.20 → 1137.62] All right.
[1137.68 → 1141.10] Speaking of screwing things up, the original article here is from Polygon.
[1141.22 → 1145.38] And I'll let Nick go ahead and introduce this topic here.
[1145.42 → 1146.20] I haven't even read this one.
[1146.26 → 1146.92] You haven't read this one?
[1146.94 → 1147.24] Oh, okay.
[1147.28 → 1147.94] This is a Colton topic?
[1148.02 → 1148.30] That's fine.
[1148.48 → 1149.48] We'll jump into this one.
[1149.56 → 1149.72] That's cool.
[1149.72 → 1154.74] So last Friday, Twitch filed a lawsuit against seven individuals slash organizations that
[1154.74 → 1156.04] are in business of selling bots.
[1156.50 → 1161.28] These bots are designed to artificially inflate the viewer and follower counts of Twitch streamers.
[1161.86 → 1166.46] They are a persistent frustration, in the words of their marketing senior vice president,
[1166.60 → 1167.88] Matthew Di Pietro.
[1169.30 → 1174.00] And they have announced that they are now creating a very real problem on the platform.
[1174.00 → 1179.96] So these bots have been used to deny streamers partnerships or harass other broadcasters.
[1180.54 → 1185.48] And Twitch employs technological solutions that detect and remove false viewer or bots currently.
[1186.16 → 1191.26] So the lawsuit represents a third layer in their strategy against bots here.
[1191.26 → 1197.94] And yeah, among the allegations, there are federal trademark infringement, unfair competition, cyber
[1197.94 → 1201.66] squatting, fraud, breach of contract, and tortious interference.
[1201.66 → 1206.96] So they're seeking injunctions against the bot makers, including the transfer of the possession of their domains.
[1207.48 → 1216.02] They're ordering barring payment processors from providing them with service and restitution, legal fees, and punitive damages.
[1216.02 → 1226.46] I mean, bots are a huge problem for pretty much any platform that is trying to monetize views or ad impressions.
[1227.06 → 1233.80] Because, I mean, there's a reason that, I don't know if you know this, but the Google AdSense terms of service
[1233.80 → 1240.82] basically do not care why bot traffic is viewing ads on your site.
[1241.58 → 1243.22] So this is like a terrifying thing.
[1243.22 → 1247.42] This is not actually why we lost our Google AdSense account.
[1247.50 → 1252.00] That had to do with people posting racy images on the forum.
[1252.50 → 1253.02] Lewd pictures.
[1253.20 → 1261.62] Lewd pictures on the forum that, like, buried in a thread of, you know, it was like a 400-page desktop wallpaper thread.
[1261.80 → 1264.70] And it's like, you know, you need to be monitoring.
[1267.18 → 1267.62] Yeah.
[1267.74 → 1268.56] Yeah, it is what it is.
[1268.60 → 1271.80] So that's why you don't see Google Ads on the Linus Tech Tips forum anymore.
[1271.80 → 1279.12] But this is an interesting fact is that their terms of service don't give a crap why there are bots viewing them
[1279.12 → 1280.98] or why there are bots clicking on the ads.
[1281.22 → 1286.12] They are going to go after you with a shoot first, ask questions later approach.
[1286.22 → 1287.02] You'll get cut off.
[1287.14 → 1297.14] And it will be up to you to prove that someone else was maliciously coding bots and creating bots to browse and click on your ads.
[1297.14 → 1301.70] So like that, because it really hurts the value of Google's product.
[1301.70 → 1305.30] For their purposes, that approach makes sense.
[1305.30 → 1311.50] Because if the burden of proof is on them, and they have no way to prove whether it was you that was batting,
[1311.58 → 1313.16] because let's be honest, they don't.
[1313.20 → 1313.40] Nope.
[1313.76 → 1315.40] Then they can never take it away.
[1315.52 → 1319.86] So as soon as they put the burden of proof on you, that allows them to actually take it away in any case that there's batting.
[1319.94 → 1324.16] And the reason why batting is a huge issue is because, like Alana said, when you're trying to sell a product like an ad,
[1324.16 → 1329.54] if there are rumours out there even that some of the ads are being batted,
[1330.04 → 1334.60] the advertisers are coming after you and going, why am I paying you for nothing?
[1334.96 → 1336.44] Yeah, paying for absolutely nothing.
[1336.58 → 1336.80] Literally.
[1337.18 → 1338.56] With Twitch, it's more complicated.
[1338.92 → 1339.06] Yeah.
[1339.10 → 1347.14] Because, I mean, you can't just go, you know, oh, Twitch streamer X, Y, or Z, you know,
[1347.42 → 1350.60] yo, you're banned from the platform until...
[1350.60 → 1356.42] Because, I mean, malicious actions towards Twitch streamers that have nothing to do with them.
[1356.58 → 1357.24] So common.
[1357.44 → 1364.22] You know whether it's as silly as, you know, fake pizza deliveries or, you know,
[1364.22 → 1368.34] getting into a much more malicious territory, things like swatting.
[1369.04 → 1370.72] This is a huge thing.
[1370.82 → 1379.42] It's something about that community that thinks, you know, trolling the on-air personality is somehow appropriate.
[1379.42 → 1387.30] So for Twitch to come in and start going heavy-handed, like anyone who has bots viewing their stream,
[1387.48 → 1390.52] you know, you're banned, you're cut off, your partnership, you know,
[1390.60 → 1393.10] your subscriber revenue is getting with hell.
[1393.20 → 1395.58] I mean, that would be grossly unfair.
[1395.96 → 1396.06] Yeah.
[1396.06 → 1397.94] So...
[1397.94 → 1406.12] The issue is so multifaceted on Twitch, too, because as a new viewer to a game, you're going
[1406.12 → 1409.96] to click on probably one of the top broadcasters within that game category.
[1410.50 → 1415.12] So if someone's batting, they're not only trying to get more ad revenue by displaying a higher view count,
[1415.20 → 1418.78] they might even just be trying to get more exposure to get featured or whatever it is.
[1418.78 → 1421.78] So, yeah, it's just such a...
[1422.42 → 1426.88] I mean, like what I'm trying to say is maybe the person who's batting isn't even doing it maliciously.
[1427.30 → 1431.54] Maybe they're trying to help the content creator in their own disturbed way.
[1431.84 → 1432.96] Which is terrible, by the way.
[1432.96 → 1433.54] Which is horrible.
[1433.68 → 1435.12] Yes, please don't do that.
[1435.34 → 1436.70] That's like the worst thing.
[1436.82 → 1437.02] Yeah.
[1437.02 → 1447.50] Yeah, click fraud, view fraud, any kind of fraud is so hard for a content creator, especially a smaller one.
[1447.92 → 1449.08] I mean, for...
[1449.08 → 1455.04] Actually, this is a great opportunity for me to get into what happened with our Amazon Associates account.
[1455.04 → 1468.78] But anytime a content creator runs afoul of a much larger entity, whether we're talking about Google, Amazon, Twitch, owned by Amazon, speaking of much larger entities,
[1469.88 → 1471.74] it can be so hard.
[1471.80 → 1473.58] And I understand the reasons for this.
[1473.64 → 1475.42] I mean, you got to think about it.
[1475.50 → 1484.04] Like a program like, you know, an Amazon Associates or like the creator management team at a company like Google, which is like, you know...
[1484.04 → 1492.84] So there's Alphabet and then there's Google and then there's YouTube and then there's like sales and marketing and content acquisition and content development.
[1492.84 → 1495.20] And then there's this tiny little team like talent management.
[1495.68 → 1501.26] And there are literally millions of creators in some cases, at least hundreds of thousands.
[1501.32 → 1502.62] That much we know for sure.
[1503.22 → 1513.94] So for even someone like me, where I would like to think that I'm fairly significant, I think I'm in the top 500 and change of YouTubers.
[1514.84 → 1517.60] Um, let's say top 600 to be safe.
[1517.70 → 1522.84] Even for me, getting in touch with a partner manager took until about a year and change ago.
[1523.56 → 1525.52] Just to give you guys some idea.
[1525.62 → 1527.14] That was how long it took them to reach out to me.
[1527.40 → 1527.80] Get this.
[1527.88 → 1529.68] They reached out to me about the Tech Quickie channel.
[1530.30 → 1531.22] Did I tell you that?
[1531.38 → 1531.60] Yeah.
[1531.76 → 1534.54] They weren't actually reaching out about the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[1534.78 → 1536.40] We completely slipped through the cracks.
[1536.40 → 1537.32] Let's be fair though.
[1537.42 → 1544.00] The like the contact email on that, on that channel is extremely messy.
[1544.80 → 1546.26] So like it's possible.
[1546.34 → 1546.66] No, no.
[1546.72 → 1547.36] I would have noticed.
[1547.46 → 1548.18] It's possible.
[1548.18 → 1550.80] I get notifications on my phone for every email.
[1551.02 → 1551.38] All right.
[1551.50 → 1551.80] All right.
[1551.80 → 1552.88] I would have noticed.
[1553.02 → 1553.18] Okay.
[1553.18 → 1556.68] I was like, wow, they talked to me.
[1557.30 → 1558.26] Oh, be still my heart.
[1558.78 → 1562.64] So, um, so especially for a small content creator anytime.
[1562.88 → 1563.24] So, okay.
[1563.28 → 1565.80] Anyway, it's tiny teams managing this stuff.
[1565.94 → 1568.82] They only have so much bandwidth to manually review things.
[1568.82 → 1573.42] So a lot of this stuff is done by automated systems and to get someone to review, it has
[1573.42 → 1575.34] to be done in a priority fashion.
[1576.04 → 1577.84] So if you have 500 subscribers on YouTube.
[1578.04 → 1578.76] Good luck.
[1578.88 → 1581.70] Like I lost my channel four and a half years ago.
[1581.86 → 1583.64] It took me over a month to get it back.
[1584.20 → 1588.10] It took YouTube literally five years to ever get in touch with me about anything.
[1588.58 → 1596.10] Um, and when, uh, so getting into the Amazon thing, when I was found to be in breach of Amazon's
[1596.10 → 1602.76] associates, terms of service, my appeal process was basically, yo, can we talk about this on the phone?
[1604.02 → 1605.70] Yo, no.
[1606.74 → 1610.26] Um, good luck elsewhere.
[1610.88 → 1616.42] So it is, so it can be pretty tough now with that said, so, so leading back into, because,
[1616.42 → 1624.20] you know, we consider ourselves to be something of a, of a key online video program when it
[1624.20 → 1629.16] comes to technology, um, and I know a few people who know a few people who know a few people
[1629.16 → 1632.44] who were willing to stick their necks out on my behalf.
[1632.76 → 1638.82] Um, I do actually have some news to share, uh, as far as the whole Amazon thing goes.
[1639.10 → 1648.16] Um, so last week I did announce that Amazon associates, our Amazon links were, were dead.
[1648.28 → 1650.52] Our account was dead and everything was dead.
[1650.52 → 1657.40] Um, since that time I have managed to get on the phone with someone, and it looks like we
[1657.40 → 1660.76] are going to work together to move forward.
[1660.76 → 1666.52] I've actually got some, some notes that, uh, that I put together about sort of what, what
[1666.52 → 1667.52] has exactly gone on.
[1667.52 → 1673.40] So it was pointed out to me that anyone is allowed, even unless you've been found to be
[1673.40 → 1676.84] like clearly maliciously abusing the program.
[1676.84 → 1684.04] Um, anyone is allowed to change their business model and to a compliant business model and reapply.
[1684.04 → 1691.24] Um, so we've actually been approved as of yesterday morning for a new account.
[1691.24 → 1696.28] Um, and you know, here's what I have to say to you guys.
[1696.28 → 1698.60] This does mean there'll be a new ID.
[1698.60 → 1704.52] Uh, you won't have seen that anywhere yet because we're working very carefully to go through our,
[1704.52 → 1710.44] everything and make sure that all of our practices, all of our editors know, you know, how to call
[1710.44 → 1711.48] it out correctly.
[1711.48 → 1714.44] Um, you know, all of our writers know how to call it out correctly.
[1714.44 → 1719.40] So we want to make sure that we are 100% above board because I do not imagine for a second
[1719.40 → 1727.48] that I have a longer, a longer leash than, uh, you know, about this, uh, if, if we were to ever
[1727.48 → 1729.96] violate the terms of the agreement again.
[1729.96 → 1733.64] Um, but here's what I'll say.
[1733.64 → 1739.00] If you're a creator out there who is using the Amazon associates program, or if you're looking
[1739.00 → 1743.24] into the Amazon associates program, because honestly, in spite of the stress that I've gone
[1743.24 → 1747.88] through in the last week, I still highly recommend participating in the program.
[1747.88 → 1750.44] It is a great, great program.
[1750.44 → 1755.40] It's a great way to make additional revenue without compromising any integrity.
[1755.40 → 1759.48] That's one of the things that I love about it is that because Amazon carries everything,
[1760.04 → 1763.72] I can recommend something on Amazon without there being any conflict.
[1763.72 → 1764.04] Yeah.
[1764.92 → 1765.88] Because they carry everything.
[1765.88 → 1766.84] Because they carry everything.
[1766.84 → 1771.80] I don't care if you buy the LG G5 or the, you know, one plus three, I don't give a crap.
[1771.80 → 1773.40] You just go buy it there.
[1773.40 → 1773.88] Buy one.
[1773.88 → 1774.44] Yeah.
[1774.44 → 1774.84] Buy four.
[1774.84 → 1775.40] Buy both.
[1775.40 → 1775.96] Yeah.
[1775.96 → 1778.68] Um, so here's what I'll say.
[1779.80 → 1781.72] Carefully study the terms of the agreement.
[1781.72 → 1782.36] Yeah.
[1782.36 → 1786.28] Carefully clicking on all the hyperlinks within the terms of the agreement,
[1786.28 → 1790.20] because there are sub terms of the agreement within the terms of the agreement.
[1790.20 → 1791.40] Review them all.
[1791.40 → 1797.80] Uh, some of it is kind of vaguely worded, but I understand why they do this.
[1797.80 → 1799.40] And it's to prevent abuse.
[1799.40 → 1802.12] You can't cover every eventuality.
[1803.08 → 1804.20] I get that.
[1804.20 → 1809.72] So some of the terminology does seem a little gray, but here's the advice that I,
[1809.72 → 1811.64] and this is my personal advice.
[1811.64 → 1813.16] This is not coming from Amazon.
[1813.16 → 1817.48] I'm making it very clear that I'm not affiliated with Amazon in any way other than that.
[1817.48 → 1819.72] I am a participant in the Amazon associates program.
[1820.20 → 1822.68] That's something that they, they say that you're supposed to say.
[1822.68 → 1823.64] So there you go.
[1823.64 → 1825.00] It's in the terms of service.
[1825.40 → 1831.00] Um, the way to read it is keeping in mind the spirit of the agreement,
[1831.00 → 1837.00] which is that you are to show your viewers or your audience applicable products on Amazon,
[1837.00 → 1841.96] especially ones that you like or recommend, and you are to provide them with a means to
[1841.96 → 1845.48] quickly buy it by clicking on a link that you provide them.
[1845.48 → 1851.48] So if you keep that in mind while you read through it, the rules are much easier to understand.
[1852.12 → 1853.48] So, uh, there you have it.
[1853.48 → 1855.64] Uh, we have, we have learned our lesson.
[1856.20 → 1861.72] Um, we were extraordinarily lucky that we have some friends of some friends who were,
[1861.72 → 1866.84] who were very generous to put their necks out and vouch for us being good people who were not
[1866.84 → 1868.36] maliciously abusing the program.
[1868.36 → 1873.56] So a huge shout-out to, uh, to all the people who quietly helped us with this.
[1873.56 → 1874.44] Thank you for that.
[1874.44 → 1878.52] And, uh, look forward to seeing more Amazon links under our videos moving forward.
[1879.56 → 1880.04] Yay.
[1880.04 → 1881.00] Yay.
[1881.00 → 1886.20] And another, uh, thing is one of the people that I was talking to about it said like some
[1886.20 → 1891.24] of the people that work in that program are like people from all walks of life, all stages of life.
[1891.24 → 1898.84] So some of them like don't necessarily, I guess, understand the newer relations and stuff.
[1898.84 → 1899.24] Right.
[1899.24 → 1905.24] So like, keep in mind that you have to just live within the terms as they're there and,
[1905.24 → 1907.24] and then some just in case.
[1907.24 → 1907.96] So yeah.
[1907.96 → 1908.20] Yeah.
[1908.20 → 1909.00] Lesson learned.
[1909.00 → 1910.76] And, uh, it was a good one.
[1910.76 → 1911.32] Yeah.
[1911.32 → 1917.48] Speaking of lesson learned, I wonder what lessons will be learned from this.
[1917.48 → 1917.64] Yeah.
[1917.64 → 1921.80] Original source here is from the BBC.com.
[1921.80 → 1922.76] Yeah.
[1922.76 → 1929.16] The United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Union.
[1929.16 → 1932.04] Holy actual freaking crap.
[1932.04 → 1932.84] Asterisk.
[1932.84 → 1935.88] It's going to take like, it's going to take like, at least two years.
[1936.92 → 1939.88] And the referendum is not technically legally binding.
[1939.88 → 1945.80] Although anyone in the House of Commons that goes against it is probably committing like career
[1945.80 → 1946.68] political suicide.
[1947.32 → 1952.12] So it's probably pretty much almost like definitely going to happen.
[1952.12 → 1952.52] Unbelievable.
[1952.52 → 1953.00] Yeah.
[1953.00 → 1953.40] Yeah.
[1953.40 → 1954.04] Unbelievable.
[1954.04 → 1954.44] Unbelievable.
[1954.44 → 1960.04] So, I mean, there, there's a lot of incredible stuff here.
[1960.04 → 1964.28] Like if you guys were like me, you were probably glued to your phone last night.
[1964.28 → 1970.44] Uh, just looking at all the mind-blowing stats around this and, and all the speculation going
[1970.44 → 1972.12] on, but here are a few key ones.
[1972.92 → 1977.56] 71.8% of eligible voters attended.
[1980.76 → 1988.76] I have never, I mean, I know that it broke UK records, but I mean, does that, does that break
[1989.56 → 1990.28] every record?
[1991.64 → 1991.88] Yeah.
[1991.88 → 1992.52] People cared.
[1992.52 → 1994.36] Holy crap.
[1994.36 → 1999.24] And, and that's with like extreme weather conditions, like flooding happening.
[1999.24 → 1999.64] Yeah.
[1999.64 → 2004.44] So if like the weather was all good, we probably would have been closer to like 75 or 80%.
[2005.32 → 2006.44] Unbelievable.
[2006.44 → 2007.48] Unheard of.
[2007.48 → 2012.44] And even more crazy is just how divided the country was.
[2012.44 → 2017.48] So in the end it was a mere 52 to 48% vote.
[2017.48 → 2018.84] It was incredibly close.
[2019.80 → 2021.72] England was just a touch higher.
[2022.68 → 2024.36] On the leave side of things.
[2024.36 → 2029.88] Wales was right there in the thick of things at the average 52 and a half voted leave, 47
[2029.88 → 2030.68] and a half stay.
[2030.68 → 2036.04] Uh, Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU, which is going to have some
[2036.04 → 2042.52] very interesting ramifications for the Scotland, uh, England relationship over the next little bit.
[2042.52 → 2052.68] Uh, with Scotland going as far as to say, uh, yo, um, we might've actually, you know, done the wrong thing
[2052.68 → 2054.92] when we stayed in the UK a little while ago.
[2054.92 → 2058.28] We might be, uh, referencing, reference-umming again.
[2058.84 → 2061.48] Um, this is interesting.
[2061.48 → 2061.88] Okay.
[2061.88 → 2062.20] No.
[2062.20 → 2069.64] Uh, one of my, uh, one of my, one of my favourite Québécois over there sent me this Wikipedia article
[2069.64 → 2074.60] on the Quebec referendum, which was actually another, uh, Exit, I guess we could call it.
[2074.60 → 2080.92] When, when Quebec voted on whether to leave Canada and become an independent country for the first time.
[2080.92 → 2087.64] Um, this was on October 30th, 1995 and 93.52% of people turned out to vote.
[2087.64 → 2088.52] Oh my goodness.
[2088.52 → 2091.96] Um, the no option carried by 50.58%.
[2091.96 → 2095.80] So yes, there have been closer and, um.
[2095.80 → 2098.92] That's like 50.58.
[2098.92 → 2099.24] Yeah.
[2099.24 → 2100.84] I had forgotten how close that was.
[2100.84 → 2101.72] So, okay.
[2101.72 → 2102.20] All right.
[2102.20 → 2103.00] Thanks, A-Prime.
[2103.00 → 2104.04] You got me there.
[2104.04 → 2104.76] You got me there.
[2104.76 → 2105.24] Wow.
[2105.24 → 2108.92] Um, I, I should, I should have studied up my Canadian history better.
[2108.92 → 2111.80] So what does all this mean?
[2111.80 → 2117.64] First, let's talk a little bit about what being a member of the EU has meant in, in purely technological terms.
[2117.64 → 2128.12] Um, cheaper airfares, um, easier, uh, easier studying and travelling and living abroad, uh, on the mainland, in mainland Europe.
[2128.12 → 2128.60] Yeah.
[2128.60 → 2133.32] Um, cheaper, uh, cell phone, cheaper cell phone service.
[2133.32 → 2142.76] So the way that the EU has cracked down on roaming charges within, uh, European Union members has been a huge benefit to EU countries.
[2142.76 → 2149.48] I have, I have been to the EU, um, and travelling over borders, extraordinarily easy.
[2149.48 → 2150.04] So easy.
[2150.04 → 2151.00] Very, very cool.
[2152.44 → 2159.00] Essentially what the EU does, the European Union does, is turned the partner countries into a single market.
[2159.00 → 2165.64] So, they're essentially eliminating borders in a lot of ways for goods, services, people, money.
[2166.20 → 2171.00] Um, especially with the Euro, which was implemented, what, like 10, 15 years ago, something like that.
[2171.00 → 2171.88] I can't remember when the Euro got implemented.
[2171.88 → 2172.84] Not too long ago.
[2172.84 → 2176.84] But it wasn't like, it was not, it was in my adult lifetimes.
[2176.84 → 2177.00] Yeah.
[2177.00 → 2177.64] Yeah.
[2177.64 → 2182.12] Like, I remember going to Paris and there still being Franks when I graduated from high school.
[2182.12 → 2183.40] Uh, Bronx.
[2183.40 → 2184.04] Oh, whatever.
[2184.36 → 2192.28] Um, so it began after World War II, and it was all about economic cooperation, um, and has, and has become more than that since.
[2192.28 → 2195.64] So the overall goal is to boost trade, create jobs at lower prices.
[2196.20 → 2196.60] All right.
[2196.60 → 2201.00] So why then did United Kingdom residents vote to leave?
[2201.00 → 2205.00] So they claimed they were being held back, said it imposed too many rules on businesses,
[2205.00 → 2208.52] and charged billions of pounds per year in membership fees for little return.
[2208.52 → 2212.76] Uh, wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people
[2212.76 → 2214.12] coming to work and live in the country.
[2214.12 → 2218.60] Because that's one of the things, as much as many Britons have been enjoying, uh, you know,
[2218.60 → 2222.76] going and working or living over the, uh, the English Channel there.
[2223.32 → 2227.72] Well, the same is true of anyone else who wants to go and live in the UK.
[2228.28 → 2234.44] They also objected to the move towards what they saw as the creation of a United States of Europe.
[2234.44 → 2238.20] So to speak to the membership fees, there was like a note that I read where
[2238.52 → 2244.36] I think in 2014 slash 15, you know, the fiscal year 2014 slash 15, um,
[2245.48 → 2251.40] the, the UK was charged something like 8.8 billion pounds in membership fees.
[2251.88 → 2262.68] And they were able to trace back about 5.5 billion pounds, uh, of actual benefit for UK citizens or UK residents.
[2262.68 → 2266.68] Um, so that includes stuff like university grants, housing grants, et cetera.
[2266.68 → 2272.28] Um, so there's a significant cost to them, um, for actually being a part of the union.
[2272.28 → 2276.68] And that cost is essentially absorbed by some of the other members of the union that contribute a bit less.
[2278.76 → 2283.64] So, yeah, I can, I mean, empirically, I can kind of understand the argument there,
[2283.64 → 2291.08] but that's looking at that one statistic in a vacuum and ignoring, you know, the free trade that it allows,
[2291.08 → 2293.72] the free travel, free, you know, free movement.
[2293.96 → 2296.92] And you know what, but there's a lot of people who don't give a crap about that.
[2296.92 → 2297.48] That's true.
[2297.48 → 2299.32] And for them, whatever.
[2299.32 → 2303.56] If they just want to stay in Leeds or wherever and, and live out their life there,
[2303.56 → 2305.96] then maybe it's better for them to just have a UK.
[2305.96 → 2309.00] So, uh, here's a few more interesting, interesting tidbits.
[2309.00 → 2312.60] The pound has fallen to its lowest since a night or fell.
[2312.60 → 2313.80] I don't know if it stayed there, actually.
[2313.80 → 2317.16] I haven't looked recently, but it fell to its lowest since 1985.
[2317.80 → 2326.84] Uh, fun fact, um, our, our amazon.co.uk, uh, affiliate, uh, payouts haven't been cashed in a really long time.
[2326.84 → 2327.24] I heard.
[2327.72 → 2328.04] Yeah.
[2328.60 → 2334.36] So, so we actually like just lost, uh, like, like a really long time.
[2334.36 → 2334.92] I know.
[2334.92 → 2338.68] So we just lost like a lot, a couple of thousand pounds or something, I think.
[2338.68 → 2339.08] A lot.
[2339.08 → 2339.48] Yeah.
[2339.48 → 2339.80] A lot.
[2339.80 → 2341.16] I don't know how much exactly, but it's a lot.
[2341.16 → 2345.00] I don't know how much exactly, but it's like, it's like not insignificant.
[2345.00 → 2346.68] So thanks for that Brexit.
[2346.68 → 2353.40] Um, the treasury forecast to rise between 0.7 and 1.1% in mortgage borrowing costs.
[2353.40 → 2360.76] So like that might not seem significant, but I think it works out to somewhere around a thousand pounds a year extra.
[2360.76 → 2361.72] Ouch.
[2361.72 → 2364.20] And like possibly years added to your mortgage.
[2364.20 → 2367.64] So like compound interest dog, that sucks.
[2369.16 → 2370.12] Like, yeah.
[2370.12 → 2372.20] Where the hell did this come from?
[2372.20 → 2373.40] Emergency pun.
[2374.28 → 2378.44] The EU now has one GB more space.
[2379.80 → 2381.40] I did not put that there.
[2381.40 → 2384.28] Whoever did, whoever did is fired.
[2384.28 → 2386.28] So it's pretty funny though.
[2386.28 → 2387.64] It was probably ghosted.
[2387.64 → 2389.32] So you can't technically fire him.
[2390.04 → 2390.68] Damn it.
[2390.68 → 2393.00] All right.
[2393.00 → 2394.12] Well, that's okay.
[2394.12 → 2394.60] One GB.
[2394.60 → 2395.64] I see you.
[2395.64 → 2396.44] One GB more space.
[2396.44 → 2397.80] I see what you did there.
[2397.80 → 2398.04] I see you, bro.
[2398.04 → 2399.00] Thank you for that.
[2399.00 → 2399.48] All right.
[2399.48 → 2400.60] Speaking of thank you for that.
[2400.60 → 2403.56] Thank you to tunnel bear for sponsoring the WAN show.
[2403.56 → 2406.68] The tunnel bear is the easy-to-use VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[2406.68 → 2410.52] It lets you tunnel to 20 different countries, allowing you to browse the internet.
[2410.52 → 2411.40] Thank you for that, Nick.
[2411.40 → 2414.52] And use online services as though you are in a different country.
[2414.52 → 2418.60] You just choose the country in the app, turn it on and boom, your connection gets encrypted
[2418.60 → 2422.44] with the AES 256-bit encryption and your public IP address gets switched.
[2422.44 → 2425.40] So you show up as though you are from somewhere else.
[2425.40 → 2431.08] Something that could end up being more relevant for Great Britain citizens than it used to be.
[2431.08 → 2433.16] I mean, think about this.
[2433.16 → 2437.56] Things like content law could now be dramatically different between Britain.
[2437.56 → 2439.24] See, this is where I'm tying it back into tech.
[2439.24 → 2441.24] It's a lot of people asking in the Twitch chat.
[2441.24 → 2446.12] Content law could be very different in Great Britain than it is in the rest of the EU.
[2446.12 → 2446.52] Yeah.
[2446.52 → 2447.00] Holy crap.
[2447.00 → 2448.84] You could have completely different...
[2450.28 → 2451.08] Oh, man.
[2452.60 → 2455.88] Oh, you could have completely different like censorship layers.
[2455.88 → 2458.84] You could have all kinds of stuff that a VPN could be beneficial for.
[2460.12 → 2460.44] Man.
[2461.24 → 2464.04] Oh, this is going to be an interesting 10 years.
[2465.24 → 2469.32] Anyway, tunnel bear makes it easy with no port configuration, DNS or any other nonsense.

[2486.36 → 2489.24] Speaking of no credit card required.
[2489.24 → 2493.16] Have you ever run a small business for yourself?
[2493.16 → 2499.88] Whether you do tiling or teach dance lessons in your attic or don't do it in the attic.
[2499.88 → 2500.60] That would be very warm.
[2500.60 → 2501.40] You do dog hairdressing.
[2501.40 → 2507.72] Or dog hairdressing or plumbing or small time computer repair or even medium time computer repair.
[2507.72 → 2510.60] Maybe you make trinkets like dream catchers.
[2510.60 → 2511.16] Yes, yes.
[2511.16 → 2513.96] All things Luke's parents, Luke's family has done.
[2513.96 → 2515.88] I don't know about dream catchers.
[2515.88 → 2517.64] I don't know about dream catchers specifically.
[2517.64 → 2519.48] Seems like it might be a thing.
[2519.48 → 2520.84] It seems believable, doesn't it?
[2520.84 → 2521.40] Yeah.
[2521.40 → 2528.28] Anyway, FreshBooks is a great way for you to spend more time actually making money

[2564.04 → 2565.88] card through FreshBooks directly.

[2606.44 → 2607.72] I can't even you should.
[2607.72 → 2608.60] Yes, you should.
[2608.60 → 2611.96] You know, the whole about which I am no longer allowed to say
[2614.36 → 2615.24] Jeff Bridges.
[2615.24 → 2616.60] Jeff Bridges.
[2616.60 → 2621.72] I think the whole point of that is that you're not supposed to say anything about it in the
[2622.52 → 2623.56] I'll just I'll be over here.
[2623.56 → 2625.16] You're a lot more fun to troll in person.
[2625.16 → 2625.72] This is great.
[2625.72 → 2626.60] I should bring you on.
[2626.60 → 2629.00] I should bring you on the show for the ad spots every time.
[2629.56 → 2633.48] So Squarespace is the way to build a beautiful website.
[2633.48 → 2635.24] That's all about you.
[2635.24 → 2636.60] It reflects who you are.
[2636.60 → 2640.60] You just choose one of the templates, which are actually surprisingly flexible.
[2640.60 → 2647.16] You know, once you, you know, gussy them up with pictures here and text there, and you've got a cool little logo designer.
[2647.16 → 2649.32] You can make your own little simple logo.
[2649.32 → 2657.24] It ends up looking pretty darn unique, and you can do all this even without a deep amount of coding skill.

[2684.12 → 2689.96] You're just like, you know what? I just want people to know what my hours of operation and my menu are.
[2689.96 → 2690.36] Boom!
[2690.36 → 2691.56] We got chicken fingers.
[2691.56 → 2696.92] Yeah, get that up in a couple of minutes, and don't think about it anymore, because our website,
[2696.92 → 2700.68] lennismediagroup.com, hosted on Squarespace for the last like four years.

[2740.52 → 2743.40] I mean, I can't get in trouble for saying what's on their site.

[2763.40 → 2764.12] Holy crap.
[2764.12 → 2764.84] That's...
[2764.84 → 2766.68] Wow.
[2766.68 → 2769.72] That's actually kind of incredible.
[2769.72 → 2771.16] We need to, we need to charge more.
[2772.68 → 2774.04] They may actually watch this.
[2774.04 → 2775.08] I'm kidding.
[2775.96 → 2778.76] Now you're going to be the one who gets us in trouble with the sponsors.
[2778.76 → 2779.64] That's great.
[2779.64 → 2781.16] Now it doesn't have to be me anymore.
[2781.16 → 2782.04] That's fantastic.
[2782.04 → 2782.60] I love it.
[2782.60 → 2783.64] Random question.
[2783.64 → 2783.88] Yes.
[2783.88 → 2787.80] This is, I was thinking this when you were doing this, but if you had to open a restaurant,
[2787.80 → 2789.08] what kind of restaurant would you open?
[2789.08 → 2792.84] I would open a food restaurant.
[2793.40 → 2794.52] And it's great because...
[2794.52 → 2795.32] A food restaurant.
[2795.32 → 2800.36] American Dad actually has an episode where the main character, Stan, opens what he calls
[2800.36 → 2801.32] the food restaurant.
[2801.32 → 2801.56] Yeah.
[2801.56 → 2803.08] Or his food restaurant.
[2803.08 → 2805.56] And his food restaurant is stupid.
[2805.56 → 2809.64] And I wouldn't open a food restaurant like that because his served like, I don't know what it is,
[2809.64 → 2811.40] like chocolate dipped chicken wings or whatever.
[2811.40 → 2812.52] Like just, just dumb stuff.
[2813.64 → 2822.12] So my food restaurant would be kind of like, kind of like what I think restaurants like
[2822.12 → 2829.16] White Spot try to do where they'll have like a chicken teriyaki dish, and they'll have like a fish and
[2829.16 → 2832.52] chips, and they'll have like a butter chicken.
[2832.52 → 2833.88] So like a variety restaurant.
[2833.88 → 2840.68] They have a variety, except the problem is that they do everything in sort of this super non-authentic
[2841.40 → 2847.80] pandering to, to, you know, Midwestern, you know, white people sort of way.
[2847.80 → 2851.64] It's like you're trying butter chicken if you didn't actually want to eat butter chicken.
[2851.64 → 2852.92] Yeah, exactly.
[2852.92 → 2859.40] So, so my food restaurant would be kind of like a like an all-star team.
[2859.40 → 2860.12] Yeah.
[2860.12 → 2863.56] So it would, it would kind of have, it would have meals.
[2863.56 → 2864.04] Yeah.
[2864.04 → 2866.68] So I don't actually know that we would do family style dishes.
[2866.68 → 2868.84] I think it would be individual, individual meals.
[2868.84 → 2873.88] And I would want those individual meals to like, like it would, I would kind of say, okay,
[2873.88 → 2875.72] we're going to have a larger than normal kitchen.
[2875.72 → 2876.04] Yeah.
[2876.04 → 2879.72] We're going to have to kind of absorb some, some operating overhead there.
[2879.72 → 2880.04] Yeah.
[2880.04 → 2882.44] Um, you're going to have a couple of different
[2882.44 → 2883.72] chefs with different backgrounds.
[2883.72 → 2883.96] Yeah.
[2883.96 → 2885.40] You'll have to have a little bit of background.
[2885.40 → 2889.00] I think you'll have to bring in some consultants whenever you want to introduce a new dish,
[2889.00 → 2893.80] because you're not going to expect your, you know, Cajun specialist to all of a sudden
[2893.80 → 2895.80] be able to whip up an amazing Thai dish.
[2895.80 → 2896.36] Yeah.
[2896.36 → 2902.12] But I would say, okay, let's absorb some extra operating overhead here and let's be able
[2902.12 → 2908.76] to put together kind of set, set meals so that any group of people can come and dine.
[2908.76 → 2915.32] And, you know, if I'm going out with, you know, um, like a, like a Taiwanese partner or something,
[2915.32 → 2921.64] I can take them there, and they can get some, you know, some dim sum or some, you know,
[2921.64 → 2924.28] Singaporean style, Taiwanese chicken or whatever.
[2924.28 → 2928.68] And I can have a burger and both of those things will legitimately be somewhat authentic and good.
[2929.24 → 2931.24] That would be the objective of my restaurant.
[2931.24 → 2931.88] Okay.
[2931.88 → 2933.00] What would your restaurant be?
[2933.00 → 2934.12] I'm curious now.
[2934.12 → 2937.24] I don't, I don't think this is very on topic, but that's okay.
[2937.24 → 2937.80] I'm curious.
[2937.80 → 2938.28] That's okay.
[2938.28 → 2940.68] I mean, it's a similar thing.
[2940.68 → 2943.48] Luke and I actually talked about this like a while ago.
[2943.48 → 2950.20] And essentially what we came up with was like, there's very like Americanized dishes in each
[2950.20 → 2950.68] culture.
[2950.68 → 2951.24] Yep.
[2951.24 → 2955.96] So like sweet and sour pork from Chinese food, chicken, teriyaki, California roll,
[2955.96 → 2956.84] California roll.
[2956.84 → 2957.16] Yep.
[2957.16 → 2965.08] Essentially having like Canadian food, just being like the variety of other cultures of food that
[2965.08 → 2968.92] we all bring together and call Canadian food because we have a lot of awesome cultures here
[2968.92 → 2969.88] with a lot of awesome food.
[2969.88 → 2970.04] Yep.
[2970.04 → 2970.36] That's true.
[2970.36 → 2971.16] Especially Vancouver.
[2971.16 → 2971.48] It's great.
[2971.48 → 2975.08] Actually there was another great restaurant idea that I had a while back.
[2975.64 → 2979.24] I would want it to be like an icebreaker restaurant.
[2979.24 → 2980.68] I think I'd call it icebreakers.
[2982.12 → 2983.16] And the idea.
[2983.16 → 2985.00] Around here they think it was a hockey themed restaurant.
[2985.00 → 2985.32] Well, probably.
[2985.32 → 2986.44] Like a hockey themed sports bar.
[2987.48 → 2988.76] Icebreakers with a Z.
[2988.76 → 2991.24] It's like, we serve only club steel, you know?
[2993.72 → 2994.12] Wow.
[2994.12 → 2995.64] So my restaurant.
[2995.64 → 2998.28] Actually, this was another perfect idea I thought that I had.
[2998.76 → 3001.64] Every dish would be really awkward to eat.
[3002.68 → 3005.88] So like a plate of spaghetti that is one long noodle.
[3005.88 → 3006.52] Right.
[3006.52 → 3013.64] And the idea would be that you would go there with a date knowing that no one is going to be able to
[3014.44 → 3019.80] perfectly consume every meal without getting something dribbling down their arm or on their chin or whatever.
[3020.04 → 3024.12] There's like an ad that somebody pretty much like did that.
[3024.12 → 3024.52] Really?
[3024.52 → 3028.12] Except what it was, was they were like, okay, we're going to pair these people up.
[3028.12 → 3031.40] And then the person, like they had to feed each other the food.
[3031.80 → 3032.04] Okay.
[3032.04 → 3037.16] So they found like food that both people liked, and then they had to feed each other the food on like a first date.
[3037.16 → 3040.04] So it was like awkward, but not essentially.
[3040.04 → 3040.52] That sounds fun.
[3041.40 → 3043.96] People in the chat are just spamming RX 480.
[3045.08 → 3046.68] I don't know what I'm supposed to say about it.
[3046.68 → 3047.56] Yeah, there are rumors.
[3047.56 → 3048.04] Yeah.
[3048.84 → 3050.12] Which we can't talk about.
[3050.12 → 3050.92] So here's the thing.
[3051.48 → 3052.84] Actually, this is a good topic.
[3052.84 → 3056.44] Uh, why aren't we talking about RX 480?
[3056.44 → 3060.60] Because we do talk about pre-release hardware rumours very frequently.
[3060.60 → 3061.64] Yeah.
[3061.64 → 3065.00] So we're not talking about it because we know the answer.
[3066.68 → 3070.36] We can talk about rumours when we don't know the answer.
[3070.36 → 3070.76] Yeah.
[3070.76 → 3077.08] But once we've signed a non-disclosure agreement that says we are going to independently evaluate the product,
[3077.08 → 3080.84] that is not going to affect the way that we look at this product,
[3080.84 → 3090.36] but we are not going to say anything about it until such time as the broad release of information is allowed to go out as specified by, in this case, AMD.
[3091.32 → 3095.48] So once we've signed that, we can't talk about it until it's time to talk about it.
[3095.48 → 3095.88] Yeah.
[3095.88 → 3102.52] So a lot of people have asked, you know, why is it that every tech channel has a video on the GTX 1080 at exactly the same time?
[3102.52 → 3103.00] Yeah.
[3103.00 → 3104.04] That is why.
[3104.04 → 3106.84] And some people wonder why embargoes are in place.
[3106.84 → 3113.96] And they're like, oh, this is, you know, it must be because companies are paying people to do a review or something like that.
[3113.96 → 3116.84] It's so that there's fair competition in the review market.
[3116.84 → 3117.32] Yeah.
[3117.32 → 3127.16] It's so that we don't get an advantage from being Linus Tech Tips and having, you know, 2.7 whatever subscribers getting seeded a card first.
[3127.16 → 3130.36] Or that we don't end up with a disadvantage because we're in Canada.
[3130.36 → 3131.24] Because we don't live in California.
[3131.24 → 3135.80] And our card gets, you know, held by customs for three days or something like that.
[3135.80 → 3145.32] So by having, usually it's anywhere from about five on the very low end, which is very frustrating, anywhere from about five to about 12 days.
[3145.32 → 3147.08] Usually that's how long you have with a product.
[3147.08 → 3150.84] So that allows enough time for something to go wrong.
[3150.84 → 3161.56] Like, you know, for someone's kid to get sick and need some chicken soup or whatever, for something to go wrong and for you to still get your coverage out at the same time as everyone else.
[3161.88 → 3163.80] Apparently I said 2.7 subscribers.
[3164.20 → 3164.94] Thank you, Twitch chat.
[3164.94 → 3166.22] 2.7 million subscribers.
[3166.22 → 3166.86] 2.7.
[3166.86 → 3168.94] I think you said 2.7 whatever subscribers.
[3168.94 → 3172.28] So you didn't remember it was millions, but you knew it was something.
[3172.28 → 3172.86] So good job.
[3173.42 → 3176.10] I mean, I thought it might be billions and then...
[3176.10 → 3182.34] Speaking of good job, cable company overcharges might be even worse than you realize.
[3182.46 → 3184.62] The original article here is from Ars Technica.
[3184.76 → 3185.66] Man, I love those guys.
[3186.12 → 3188.76] Look at that flying sheet of money.
[3188.98 → 3190.82] And the other flying sheet of money.
[3191.14 → 3192.90] And the other flying sheets of money.
[3193.06 → 3194.76] But this image is not about freedom.
[3194.94 → 3198.56] This image is about getting fleeced by your cable provider.
[3198.68 → 3200.62] Especially if you're an American.
[3200.86 → 3203.86] Not that I believe for a second that it's any better anywhere else.
[3204.36 → 3210.12] So a Senate report compares billing and service records and finds massive overcharges.
[3210.46 → 3210.68] Who?
[3210.76 → 3211.62] The cable companies?
[3211.62 → 3212.62] Oh my goodness.
[3212.74 → 3213.56] Who would have thought?
[3213.56 → 3216.78] Not chartering its new subsidiary Time Warner Cable.
[3217.40 → 3223.94] I have apparently been overcharging customers at least 7.2 million per year for equipment and service.
[3224.26 → 3225.64] The investigation is found.
[3226.18 → 3233.30] So Time Warner Cable overbilled customers nationwide an estimated $639,948.
[3233.30 → 3236.16] How did we get an estimate that goes right down to the single dollar?
[3236.16 → 3236.42] Anyway.
[3236.42 → 3240.44] Between January and April of this year.
[3241.44 → 3250.06] And these problems are bad because neither company had been issuing automatic refunds or credits to overcharged customers.
[3250.06 → 3266.16] So during the six and a half year time period examined by the committee, TWC and Charter made no effort to trace equipment overages to their origin unless customers specifically asked them to and did not provide notice or refunds to customers.
[3266.16 → 3272.50] Comcast has in the past overcharged customers, but they do a much better job at issuing refunds apparently than Time Warner Cable.
[3273.72 → 3277.96] Comcast told the subcommittee that it only had a billing error rate of 0.3%.
[3277.96 → 3279.90] Comcast told them.
[3280.36 → 3281.58] So it must be true.
[3282.00 → 3286.78] Time Warner Cable will begin investigating the overcharges only if customers bring it to their attention.
[3286.94 → 3290.88] So if you're a Time Warner Cable customer, give them a ring over there.
[3290.92 → 3292.42] And I don't mean this kind of ring.
[3292.48 → 3293.92] I mean the kind of ring that goes,
[3293.92 → 3295.18] Yo, dog, sup?
[3296.16 → 3303.54] I mean, I have a feeling that you would have to sit on like a hole for at least two hours to get through to them.
[3303.76 → 3304.50] Well, yeah, there's that.
[3304.58 → 3309.00] Yeah, you end up suffering more than the $4 that you probably individually got overcharged.
[3309.10 → 3316.70] Anyway, going forward, both companies will apparently provide customers with a notice if they are overcharged.
[3316.82 → 3317.48] Oh, that's good.
[3317.90 → 3323.96] I wish we could overcharge by like $7 million and just chill with it.
[3324.64 → 3324.88] Yeah.
[3324.88 → 3326.58] I'd be down.
[3327.54 → 3328.44] Actually, I wouldn't be down.
[3328.50 → 3329.38] That would be totally wrong.
[3329.54 → 3332.26] It would be totally wrong, but it would be dope if it wasn't.
[3332.26 → 3338.88] That was the thing that blew my mind with the charter and Time Warner Cable merger or whatever,
[3339.10 → 3347.90] where the Time Warner Cable CEO apparently had it written into his contract that he got some obscene amount of money should ownership of the company change.
[3348.44 → 3354.62] Three months later, he was already putting pen to paper for a change of ownership of the company.
[3354.62 → 3360.32] He was totally interested in bettering the company.
[3360.32 → 3360.84] Yeah.
[3361.50 → 3363.66] No conflict of interest there whatsoever.
[3363.66 → 3364.58] None whatsoever.
[3365.04 → 3369.96] You know, it's funny how many inherent conflicts of interest exist in the world.
[3369.96 → 3374.12] I mean, and this is all like sanctioned stuff.
[3374.34 → 3378.06] Like you recently, oh, are we able to talk about that?
[3378.26 → 3378.54] Sorry.
[3378.70 → 3383.24] Your big thing that happened recently that's been very exciting for you and kind of crazy.
[3383.48 → 3383.80] Oh.
[3384.20 → 3385.60] Like have you been, are you out?
[3385.80 → 3387.24] I didn't tell anyone.
[3387.24 → 3387.88] Oh, okay.
[3387.96 → 3388.16] Okay.
[3388.18 → 3389.18] We don't have to talk about that.
[3389.88 → 3390.52] Am I out?
[3391.90 → 3392.42] What?
[3393.24 → 3394.38] That's the terminology.
[3397.64 → 3398.16] Okay.
[3399.18 → 3400.20] I'm moving.
[3400.52 → 3405.84] I'm not changing my sexuality or something like that, which is what it sounded like you were saying.
[3406.14 → 3406.76] I'm moving.
[3407.46 → 3409.16] That's the big news.
[3409.16 → 3425.08] So when you deal with a realtor, okay, whether you're buying, whether you're leasing or whatever the case may be, when you deal with a realtor, ultimately there exists, as far as I can tell, an inherent conflict of interest.
[3425.08 → 3439.76] And to be clear, I have met some very good realtors, very good people, but there is an inherent conflict of interest because the seller or the leaser, not the lease or seller, whatever, I don't care.
[3439.86 → 3440.60] You guys get the point.
[3440.92 → 3445.28] So the seller or whoever's leasing the property pays the realtor fees.
[3445.28 → 3458.58] They pay that sort of on top of the or out of the amount, not on top of, sorry, out of the negotiated rate that the buyer ends up agreeing to pay.
[3459.56 → 3467.04] So the way it works is that, let's say, hypothetically, a house is $440,000, for example.
[3467.16 → 3468.06] Let's say, hypothetically.
[3468.06 → 3476.68] So what would happen is a typical real estate agent commission is, I think, somewhere in the one to quite a bit more than one.
[3476.72 → 3478.68] I think as high as like three or 4%.
[3478.68 → 3479.38] Yeah.
[3479.46 → 3480.06] I can't remember exactly.
[3480.06 → 3481.60] I think it depends on market conditions.
[3481.74 → 3491.52] Because like in Vancouver right now, I think it's somewhere in the one to four, whereas, you know, if housing prices were closer to $100,000 or $200,000, it would probably be a little higher.
[3492.42 → 3498.04] So basically what happens is the seller is responsible for paying.
[3498.06 → 3504.78] Paying that to their realtor that they have entered a covenant with or whatever the case may be to represent them.
[3505.34 → 3513.06] So that realtor ultimately, like there's this code of ethics or whatever, which is great for people who actually abide by those types of codes.
[3513.12 → 3514.44] But I've certainly met those who don't.
[3514.82 → 3517.86] There's this code of ethics that says that they have to represent you and blah, blah, blah.
[3517.94 → 3522.24] But the fact of the matter is they get paid no matter what.
[3522.80 → 3524.54] And they get paid by the seller.
[3524.68 → 3527.66] They get paid more if the rate is higher.
[3527.66 → 3530.88] So, okay, if they're representing the seller, then that's great.
[3531.58 → 3552.88] But there's a realtor potentially and often in many cases for the buyer as well who also gets paid by the seller, who also gets paid a proportion of the amount that the property sells for, and who the selling realtor has to split the commission with if there's a buying realtor present.
[3552.88 → 3555.48] So this creates all kinds of conflicts.
[3555.48 → 3568.54] Like choosing a buyer, which you're not supposed to do, based on them being self-represented, in which case the seller's realtor takes the entire commission versus another buyer who has a realtor who is sticking up for their best interest.
[3568.76 → 3574.58] There's dual agency, which is like the most broken thing ever, where one realtor represents both parties.
[3574.58 → 3579.08] It's becoming super illegal in like most of Canada because it's incredibly messed up.
[3579.10 → 3579.76] Not here yet.
[3579.80 → 3580.42] That's for sure.
[3580.50 → 3580.72] Nope.
[3582.10 → 3592.90] Where basically there are these negotiators on both sides, both of whom it is in their best interest to flip through properties as quickly as possible at as high a rate as possible.
[3592.90 → 3598.00] And I'm to believe, as a buyer especially, that this is somehow in my best interest.
[3598.26 → 3598.66] Ha!
[3599.36 → 3600.20] Good luck.
[3600.60 → 3607.96] Fortunately, my realtor is actually the dad of someone that my wife went to high school with and like their families know each other.
[3608.08 → 3609.98] And so there's some trust there.
[3610.54 → 3615.68] And he has not steered me wrong, which is good.
[3616.08 → 3616.62] But anyway.
[3617.10 → 3620.80] Let's move on to this fantastic article over here on Polygon.
[3620.80 → 3628.72] Counter-Strike player files suit against Valve over illegal gambling surrounding CSGO.
[3630.32 → 3631.40] Very interesting.
[3631.54 → 3637.16] I mean, it was a matter of time before skins and match.
[3637.24 → 3638.88] I mean, you've already got match fixing.
[3639.22 → 3645.98] So you're as close to real gambling as you can be before being declared real gambling that only adults can participate in.
[3645.98 → 3653.62] You know, age of majority and all that stuff that goes along with normal gambling sites and gambling participation and gambling establishments.
[3653.90 → 3655.64] There was also something that happened recently.
[3655.64 → 3673.56] Something along the lines of one of the betting sites had a deal with a streamer where they would tell him like when he was going to win so that he would bet higher on those and then like freak out when he won.
[3675.16 → 3678.74] Essentially just the scummiest thing I've ever heard of.
[3678.74 → 3682.82] So creating more glamour around the practice of betting.
[3683.32 → 3688.88] So Connecticut resident Michael John McLeod has filed a suit currently seeking class action status.
[3688.88 → 3692.34] And I don't actually see that being a difficult thing to achieve here.
[3692.38 → 3692.64] Nope.
[3692.64 → 3696.14] Against Valve and three skin gambling and selling sites.
[3696.34 → 3709.46] And the complaint alleges that Valve knowingly allowed and has been complicit in creating, sustaining, and facilitating a market where players and third parties trade weapon skins.
[3709.90 → 3719.38] It continues that they knowingly allowed, supported, and or sponsored illegal gambling by allowing millions of Americans to link their individual Steam accounts to third party websites.
[3719.38 → 3728.08] That's interesting because I mean, you know, there are plenty of legitimate uses for Valve's login credentials being valid on a third party website.
[3728.30 → 3731.96] Like, oh, say for example, I don't know, Linus Tech Tips Forum where you can use your Steam credentials.
[3732.28 → 3732.42] Yep.
[3732.52 → 3735.86] And all the encryption and account management is done over on Valve's side.
[3735.94 → 3736.88] We never even get it.
[3736.94 → 3738.58] We just get a hash or a token or whatever.
[3738.84 → 3742.56] And you can use your Valve two-factor authentication, all that good stuff.
[3742.94 → 3744.52] So there are plenty of legit uses for that.
[3744.58 → 3746.88] But I can see where they're kind of coming from here.
[3746.88 → 3759.16] In the esports gambling economy, this is further allegations, skins are like casino chips that have monetary value outside the game itself because of the ability to convert them directly into cash.
[3759.54 → 3766.52] It also alleges that some third party CSGO websites don't require age verification, which allows miners to bet as well.
[3768.06 → 3773.58] Bloomberg has reported that CSGO skin gambling is currently a $2 billion industry.
[3773.58 → 3787.64] So in sum, Valve owns the league, sells the casino chips, and receives a piece of the casino's income stream through foreign websites in order to maintain the charade that Valve is not promoting and profiting from online gambling.
[3787.84 → 3788.12] Wow.
[3789.32 → 3789.78] Uh-oh.
[3790.42 → 3792.54] I mean, I'm not a legal expert.
[3793.96 → 3797.36] We should get like, that should be added to our lower third, actually, just permanently.
[3797.52 → 3798.06] Not a lawyer.
[3798.06 → 3802.90] Next to my Twitter handle, it should just say, not a lawyer, at Linus Tech.
[3804.18 → 3804.28] Yeah.
[3805.78 → 3817.40] But I got to say, that sounds from just a sort of like a rational, reasonable person who's been observing kind of this weird environment over the last few years.
[3817.90 → 3822.42] That sounds not quite bulletproof, but pretty compelling.
[3822.42 → 3822.86] Yeah.
[3824.62 → 3825.14] Yeah.
[3826.50 → 3827.64] It's not great.
[3828.60 → 3830.70] Everyone's Twitch chat is like, sell your skins!
[3831.16 → 3832.42] Sell your skins now.
[3833.12 → 3833.74] Get out.
[3834.20 → 3834.68] I...
[3834.68 → 3837.18] Honestly, since...
[3837.18 → 3840.06] It's the tulip bubble of the 1800s or whatever.
[3840.06 → 3852.34] Since this whole thing began, I mean, I was always kind of questioning it because it's like, huh, don't you normally have to get like licenses to gamble and stuff?
[3852.42 → 3852.68] Yeah.
[3853.02 → 3854.84] It's like pretty tightly regulated in Canada.
[3855.18 → 3860.18] You have to spend a certain amount of your income on anti-gambling advertisement.
[3860.84 → 3864.58] Like, this is a really tightly regulated industry.
[3864.80 → 3865.10] It's a big deal.
[3865.10 → 3867.06] Like, a huge deal.
[3867.24 → 3872.16] And, you know, they've gotten away with it for so long just because I think people don't really understand.
[3872.36 → 3875.10] Like, the people who would come after them don't really understand what's happening.
[3875.64 → 3877.82] So this might shed a bit more light on that.
[3879.40 → 3881.96] Because, yeah, it is not a good thing, in my opinion.
[3881.96 → 3883.54] I mean, it's just...
[3883.54 → 3884.88] It's so accessible.
[3886.26 → 3896.02] Because it's literally using something that you get as a drop, potentially, in a game that you've paid for, and you're playing to get you tied into it.
[3896.18 → 3896.46] Mm-hmm.
[3896.46 → 3903.60] And whether Valve agrees or not that they are, quote-unquote, facilitating it, I mean, I think there's an argument to be made there.
[3903.70 → 3905.18] Again, not a lawyer.
[3905.64 → 3907.76] Don't understand law very well at all.
[3907.94 → 3908.24] Mm-hmm.
[3908.52 → 3912.88] But I think that there is an argument to be made against Valve in this situation.
[3913.12 → 3916.44] So it will be interesting to see what happens.
[3916.62 → 3917.32] That's for sure.
[3917.40 → 3918.54] To be clear, no means no.
[3919.14 → 3920.96] You said you didn't know the law very well.
[3921.00 → 3922.60] I'm just making sure you're at least aware of that.
[3922.60 → 3925.98] I'm just...
[3925.98 → 3928.60] I'm going to have all sorts of stuff on my Twitter about...
[3929.40 → 3930.18] Yeah.
[3930.34 → 3930.94] I'm just...
[3930.94 → 3931.34] I'm not.
[3931.80 → 3932.12] Oh, yeah.
[3932.20 → 3935.52] You can find him at Nicking or something like that.
[3935.58 → 3936.22] Is that right?
[3936.38 → 3937.34] Is there an underscore in there?
[3937.40 → 3937.66] No.
[3938.00 → 3939.06] That sounds right.
[3939.32 → 3939.54] All right.
[3939.66 → 3945.08] So Microsoft will use Steam to sell Windows games, not just its own store.
[3945.18 → 3945.54] Wow.
[3945.74 → 3948.96] A move from Microsoft that actually looks like they actually care.
[3949.30 → 3949.94] Very nice.
[3949.94 → 3952.10] The original article here is from Ars Technica.
[3952.60 → 3955.14] And a couple of their latest...
[3955.14 → 3956.42] Blah, blah, blah.
[3956.64 → 3957.00] Blah, blah, blah.
[3957.02 → 3958.06] A couple of their latest games.
[3958.28 → 3961.26] So Sforza 6 Apex and Killer Instinct have done well in the store.
[3961.48 → 3963.68] But Quantum Break did not.
[3964.18 → 3968.92] So maybe they're kind of going, oh, gee, maybe we don't have to be the only store that sells our games.
[3968.98 → 3970.38] Maybe we could give someone else a cut.
[3970.44 → 3972.16] Although Valve does take a very significant cut.
[3972.32 → 3972.42] Yep.
[3972.42 → 3985.08] But Phil Spencer said Microsoft will ship games on Steam again and noted that while some game releases have done well in Windows Store, Quantum Break wasn't our best PC release and Gears of War Ultimate Edition was okay.
[3985.88 → 3986.48] Awesome.
[3986.48 → 3993.20] I'm excited because I almost played nothing that isn't on Steam.
[3993.42 → 3994.56] It is so convenient.
[3994.66 → 3998.48] It's like it's prohibitive to not have your game on Steam nowadays.
[4000.56 → 4003.14] It just feels like Steam is the way to game.
[4004.02 → 4006.86] I mean, I guess there's Blizzard, Battle.net or whatever.
[4006.86 → 4008.86] But still.
[4009.62 → 4011.68] You can still technically launch those games, seriously.
[4011.86 → 4013.84] You just have to actually set it up.
[4014.02 → 4014.16] Yeah.
[4015.00 → 4017.90] We've got a couple other sort of rapid, fiery topics here.
[4018.78 → 4021.46] SanDisk made an iPhone case with built-in storage.
[4021.50 → 4024.36] Up to 128 gigs of extra storage.
[4024.46 → 4025.84] All it does is bulk up the phone.
[4025.96 → 4027.76] It's surprisingly little, actually.
[4027.96 → 4029.74] Not that badly.
[4029.74 → 4045.28] And instead of investing an additional $300 or whatever it is to get an iPhone with that amount of storage, you can just have a bumper case on it that has a little bit more bulk at the bottom by the lightning connector so that there can be a power pass-through and so that it can have a data interface to that storage.
[4045.52 → 4046.62] And off you go.
[4046.90 → 4050.40] The one problem with this is that you will be limited to USB 2 speeds.
[4051.38 → 4052.98] But, you know, hey.
[4053.52 → 4054.66] It requires a companion app.
[4055.46 → 4057.12] It can only store certain things.
[4057.22 → 4058.26] It backs up your camera roll.
[4058.26 → 4062.92] It does password protect your photos and any files that are on there, so that's nice.
[4063.40 → 4065.70] And you can also get a battery pack on it for an extra $40.
[4066.00 → 4067.64] Yeah, a 1900 mAh battery pack.
[4067.70 → 4070.78] I mean, that will turn your iPhone 6S into, like, a bit of a brick.
[4071.14 → 4073.22] But 32 gigs of storage is $60.
[4074.06 → 4075.48] 64 gigs is 100.
[4075.70 → 4077.64] And 128 is 130.
[4078.08 → 4082.20] See, this, by the way, Apple, is how pricing for additional flash storage should work.
[4084.54 → 4084.94] Yeah.
[4087.48 → 4087.84] Ugh.
[4087.84 → 4089.36] Yeah, it's kind of messed up.
[4090.16 → 4092.98] Um, yeah, I guess there's, I don't know.
[4093.10 → 4097.04] There's, like, some iPhone 7 rumours or something.
[4097.16 → 4099.06] I'm not really sure how much I care about that.
[4099.50 → 4102.32] There were a couple other things that I thought were pretty interesting.
[4102.82 → 4103.70] Where did they go?
[4105.28 → 4106.00] You know what?
[4106.04 → 4107.42] Now, let's call that it for the day.
[4107.42 → 4108.60] Thanks for watching, WAN Show.
[4108.70 → 4109.96] And a huge thanks to Nick.
[4110.02 → 4114.82] You guys, uh, again, you can find him over at, at Nicking over on Twitter.
[4114.90 → 4118.32] I'm going to post that in the, uh, I'm going to post that in the Twitch chat.
[4118.64 → 4120.38] Let's hope I don't have any lewd tweets on there.
[4120.56 → 4122.46] Yeah, let's hope you, let's hope you don't.
[4122.46 → 4122.86] Um.
[4122.86 → 4123.88] Google might shut me down.
[4124.04 → 4125.02] Thanks for watching, guys.
[4125.08 → 4126.26] We'll see you again next week.
[4126.38 → 4129.38] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4130.18 → 4130.46] Bye.
[4130.46 → 4130.74] Bye.
[4135.74 → 4136.82] Thanks for watching.
[4136.96 → 4138.14] Why is everyone talking about G2A?
[4138.82 → 4139.30] What'd they do?
[4139.68 → 4140.64] I mean, I'm sure it was simple.
[4141.96 → 4143.80] It's like, they're the same as always.
[4144.44 → 4146.08] And people are posting videos about it.
[4146.10 → 4147.10] Like, they have forever.
[4147.54 → 4147.94] Oh, okay.
[4148.00 → 4148.94] And nothing's going to happen.
[4149.32 → 4150.90] Like, nothing's going to happen forever.
[4151.34 → 4152.46] Unless there's been a change.
[4152.78 → 4153.78] Which I don't think there has.
[4154.10 → 4154.36] Right.
[4159.56 → 4160.36] Yeah, okay.
[4161.36 → 4163.14] People wanted us to talk about iPhone 7.
[4163.48 → 4164.86] Okay, um, fine.
[4165.66 → 4167.40] Um, iPhone 7 rumours.
[4167.72 → 4169.70] Expected to be a revision of iPhone 6.
[4170.06 → 4171.44] Wow, is that really a note on this?
[4172.64 → 4173.60] Okay, forget it.
[4174.00 → 4175.52] It doesn't have a headphone jack.
[4176.00 → 4176.74] That's the rumour.
[4176.82 → 4177.10] Surprise!
[4177.84 → 4178.02] Bye guys.
[4184.28 → 4184.48] Bye.
[4184.62 → 4184.90] Bye.
[4184.98 → 4185.32] Bye.
[4186.02 → 4186.58] Bye.
[4186.70 → 4187.00] Bye.
[4187.00 → 4187.30] Bye.
[4187.58 → 4187.64] Bye.
[4187.88 → 4188.24] Bye.
[4188.48 → 4188.56] Bye.
[4188.70 → 4188.90] Bye.
[4188.90 → 4190.02] Bye.
[4190.02 → 4190.94] Bye.
[4191.00 → 4191.68] Bye.
[4191.84 → 4192.68] Bye.
