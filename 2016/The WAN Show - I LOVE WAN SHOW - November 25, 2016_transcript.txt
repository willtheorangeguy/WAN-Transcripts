[0.00 --> 5.60]  You are now live streaming to Twitch Linus Tech.
[6.08 --> 6.86]  Linus Tech.
[6.96 --> 8.86]  Click here to open a browser to view the stream.
[9.16 --> 10.40]  Remember to mute the stream.
[10.48 --> 10.90]  I love it.
[11.26 --> 13.12]  They put that warning in just for me, didn't they?
[13.14 --> 14.20]  That remember is pretty solid.
[14.34 --> 15.32]  Yeah, I like it.
[15.44 --> 16.22]  Is this new?
[16.32 --> 17.10]  This is new, isn't it?
[17.78 --> 22.84]  That is a thing that I believe I put on last week when you weren't here last week.
[23.22 --> 23.96]  Where was I last week?
[23.96 --> 24.40]  Oh, yeah.
[24.40 --> 28.28]  You were in-person VR game watching.
[30.00 --> 31.72]  Yes, that's what you were doing.
[31.94 --> 37.42]  Yeah, which actually ended up not being what I thought it was because you don't watch from the crowd.
[38.12 --> 38.32]  No.
[38.80 --> 40.40]  So it was the same.
[41.20 --> 41.46]  Right.
[41.66 --> 44.24]  Anyways, we have lots of awesome topics this week.
[44.36 --> 45.14]  No, we don't.
[45.46 --> 48.12]  We have like jack-all.
[48.30 --> 50.58]  This is probably going to be the best show we've ever had.
[51.36 --> 57.32]  In SpaceX news, Elon Musk wins a $112 million NASA contract.
[57.32 --> 58.58]  Is this just all?
[58.90 --> 59.92]  Is that all there is?
[60.44 --> 62.92]  SpaceX, Mars Lander, Tesla.
[63.18 --> 65.32]  So it's all space and Elon Musk.
[65.54 --> 67.36]  Welcome to the Luke show.
[67.96 --> 68.38]  Really?
[68.58 --> 69.62]  Valve Game Awards?
[69.86 --> 71.68]  Things Luke is a fan of.
[71.72 --> 73.40]  This qualifies as news this week.
[75.30 --> 82.92]  Samsung adding new obtrusive ads to your old smart TV in more reasons to not buy a smart TV.
[83.50 --> 85.30]  You can't not buy a smart TV.
[85.30 --> 86.20]  New dumb TV.
[86.30 --> 87.00]  Is it not possible?
[87.14 --> 87.44]  No.
[87.44 --> 88.42]  I've been looking into it.
[88.42 --> 89.88]  Every TV is a smart TV.
[90.00 --> 91.50]  Can you dumb out your smart TV?
[91.50 --> 93.68]  You can unplug it from the internet.
[94.42 --> 96.56]  But then you can't Netflix and chill.
[97.36 --> 98.86]  But you could Chromecast that.
[99.16 --> 100.74]  You could Chromecast that.
[100.74 --> 104.88]  So you would have to pay for additional hardware.
[105.20 --> 106.00]  Black Friday deals.
[106.08 --> 108.08]  I think it's like $29 on B&H.
[108.84 --> 109.20]  For Chromecast?
[109.20 --> 110.28]  New Chromecast.
[110.40 --> 111.20]  New Chromecast.
[111.30 --> 112.18]  It's actually pretty solid.
[112.18 --> 112.58]  Okay.
[112.72 --> 116.44]  Well, I'm not even going to try and pick four standout deals.
[116.70 --> 117.52]  Or standout deals.
[117.78 --> 121.70]  Xbox One streaming comes to Oculus Rift on December 12th.
[121.70 --> 122.26]  Who cares?
[122.26 --> 123.80]  Not me.
[123.80 --> 126.06]  Oh, wow.
[127.06 --> 127.62]  All right.
[127.62 --> 135.98]  This is going to be our worst show ever.
[136.82 --> 138.48]  Which is like a pretty high bar.
[139.56 --> 143.82]  We can just talk about what we did.
[143.82 --> 150.10]  I don't even know if the screen is going to be a good one.
[150.10 --> 151.26]  I mean, maybe it's...
[151.26 --> 152.40]  I was having a good problem.
[153.18 --> 154.10]  Maybe they just don't care.
[157.38 --> 158.40]  Yeah, I know they're here.
[158.50 --> 159.12]  People are watching.
[159.14 --> 159.22]  Oh, oh, oh.
[159.26 --> 159.82]  Hold on, hold on.
[159.84 --> 160.56]  I've got to do the thing.
[161.20 --> 161.40]  Hey!
[161.40 --> 163.46]  Oh, the couch move thing is bad.
[163.52 --> 163.82]  Why?
[165.18 --> 165.58]  Why?
[165.58 --> 166.92]  This isn't even that complicated.
[167.78 --> 169.18]  Is it Colton's fault this time?
[170.16 --> 171.10]  I don't think so.
[171.12 --> 172.12]  It's not Colton's fault.
[172.46 --> 173.28]  Well, we'll blame Colton.
[173.28 --> 175.02]  Just edit the same file.
[175.98 --> 176.80]  Just move again?
[177.92 --> 178.72]  Well, that one didn't move.
[178.72 --> 181.58]  No, iFixit and ChefSteps are the same.
[182.18 --> 182.62]  Terrible.
[182.84 --> 183.20]  Terrible.
[183.38 --> 185.56]  WAN show, two out of ten.
[186.24 --> 187.22]  Two out of ten.
[187.60 --> 189.94]  Half an hour late with no explanation whatsoever.
[190.20 --> 190.42]  Yeah.
[190.90 --> 191.26]  Not going to explain why.
[191.26 --> 193.80]  And they can't even get the intro graphics in the right spot.
[194.38 --> 195.60]  At least the laptop's pink.
[195.78 --> 200.20]  Look, if this was pre-recorded, Ogman plays...
[200.20 --> 201.36]  Why wouldn't it be on time?
[201.62 --> 202.40]  Why wouldn't it be...
[202.40 --> 203.84]  Why is the camera not set up properly?
[203.86 --> 204.32]  Look at this.
[204.40 --> 205.04]  I think we...
[205.04 --> 207.28]  Well, you usually slouch.
[207.58 --> 208.46]  I think that's on purpose.
[208.62 --> 209.44]  I think that's by design.
[209.48 --> 210.60]  But, like, to be proper...
[210.60 --> 211.52]  I would have to slouch this.
[211.62 --> 212.66]  I don't know if I slouch that much.
[212.74 --> 213.36]  But if it...
[213.36 --> 214.30]  Well, no, you sit back.
[215.18 --> 215.46]  See?
[215.82 --> 216.78]  Well, you don't sit back that much.
[216.80 --> 217.42]  Okay, you know what?
[217.48 --> 219.28]  I think it tilted down.
[219.36 --> 220.64]  Anyway, the point is...
[220.64 --> 223.72]  If it was pre-recorded, wouldn't we have cut out the mistakes?
[225.58 --> 225.98]  No.
[226.32 --> 227.90]  We probably wouldn't.
[229.70 --> 230.14]  Okay.
[230.24 --> 234.72]  But in my defense, it's usually me editing this crap after the fact.
[234.92 --> 235.24]  Yeah.
[235.34 --> 237.14]  I don't know how video editing works.
[237.28 --> 237.50]  No.
[237.64 --> 240.02]  You're just adding to the idea that it's pre-recorded.
[240.02 --> 241.08]  And it's complicated.
[241.58 --> 241.84]  Yeah.
[242.32 --> 242.98]  And it's...
[242.98 --> 243.84]  No, really.
[243.98 --> 249.06]  Like, okay, it used to be very complicated back when XSplit didn't have an option to force constant frame rate.
[249.06 --> 250.24]  So that was a problem.
[250.38 --> 254.88]  So to the conspiracy theorists out there being like, oh, so everything is pre-recorded and then Linus edits it.
[255.56 --> 256.00]  No.
[256.44 --> 260.06]  If we edit the show, it's because, like, something screwed up.
[260.26 --> 262.26]  Like, we...
[262.26 --> 266.20]  The stream got disconnected or, like, a capture card stopped working or whatever the case may be.
[266.20 --> 269.96]  Or there was, like, personal information leaked or, like, something that was an actual problem.
[270.02 --> 272.16]  So the problem is that a lot of the time...
[272.16 --> 278.06]  I don't know how much you guys know about video recording, but if you don't gracefully terminate a video recording...
[278.06 --> 278.48]  There we go.
[278.48 --> 280.48]  It can be, like, pretty screwed up.
[280.84 --> 282.66]  And it can actually be very, very hard.
[282.78 --> 284.02]  You sometimes have to run it through.
[284.10 --> 290.38]  Like, I've used everything from FFmpeg to Handbrake to Vegas to Premiere to...
[290.38 --> 291.26]  What else have I used?
[291.30 --> 293.04]  I've even used, like, weird tools.
[293.44 --> 295.38]  Like, whoever, Media Converter or whatever.
[295.72 --> 299.98]  Like, sometimes I'll just have to run it through, like, multiple different transcoders.
[300.12 --> 301.50]  And then one of them will figure it out.
[301.50 --> 302.66]  One of them will figure it out.
[302.66 --> 302.68]  Hopefully.
[302.68 --> 306.14]  And then I'll be able to get it onto a timeline and stitch it together with the other stuff.
[306.26 --> 310.84]  Like, when WAN show needs to be edited, it's usually an enormous problem.
[311.16 --> 311.36]  Yeah.
[312.04 --> 312.68]  So, uh...
[313.68 --> 314.78]  So, wow.
[315.14 --> 315.94]  We have, like...
[315.94 --> 316.68]  Speaking of enormous problems...
[317.32 --> 318.36]  Nothing today.
[318.56 --> 319.72]  We don't have anything to talk about.
[319.86 --> 320.68]  Except...
[321.46 --> 323.32]  Black Friday deals and Floatplane.
[323.56 --> 324.74]  Black Friday deals.
[324.86 --> 326.16]  I mean, are there even...
[326.16 --> 326.48]  Whatever.
[326.48 --> 328.96]  Okay, so The Verge has Black Friday deals.
[329.84 --> 330.64]  Oh, I didn't check my...
[330.64 --> 331.40]  20 best deals.
[331.58 --> 332.92]  The 20 best deals.
[332.94 --> 333.96]  That's a good way to go.
[334.28 --> 335.02]  Is that a book?
[335.46 --> 336.50]  Atlas Obscura, yeah.
[336.94 --> 337.26]  Okay.
[337.36 --> 338.08]  There's two books there.
[338.52 --> 339.36]  And Field Notes.
[340.12 --> 341.24]  Field Notes space stuff.
[341.38 --> 341.72]  Ooh!
[343.28 --> 344.06]  You're a dork.
[344.38 --> 345.62]  I love Field Notes.
[346.46 --> 348.26]  The Vive is $100 off.
[348.40 --> 348.72]  Okay.
[348.72 --> 360.72]  If you were going to buy a Vive, then $100, I guess, is not a trivial discount in the grand scheme of the $1,000 plus PC and now $700 thing.
[361.42 --> 362.94]  You do get a Microsoft Store gift card.
[363.04 --> 365.66]  I'm sure someone has bought something from the Microsoft Store at some point.
[366.24 --> 369.22]  Hopefully not a game, because that seems to be going terribly.
[369.54 --> 370.60]  PS4 Slim.
[371.12 --> 371.60]  $250.
[372.36 --> 372.60]  Okay.
[373.58 --> 375.16]  Xbox One controllers for $40.
[375.56 --> 375.90]  Okay.
[375.90 --> 383.08]  So if you're a PC gamer and you want to play games on your PC with an Xbox One controller or a PlayStation 4 controller, for that matter.
[383.22 --> 384.94]  I'm surprised they don't have the Steam thing on here.
[385.04 --> 391.18]  I've heard that you can get a Steam controller and a Steam Link together for $50, which is, like, pretty solid.
[391.56 --> 392.86]  If you want a Steam controller.
[393.46 --> 394.72]  And a Steam Link.
[394.72 --> 395.44]  And a Steam Link.
[396.58 --> 398.08]  Maybe that's why it's not on here.
[400.22 --> 400.62]  Oh!
[400.92 --> 401.94]  Oh, damn!
[402.18 --> 402.54]  Rough.
[402.64 --> 403.24]  Oh, damn!
[403.24 --> 406.10]  Although Steam 6 is out, so you have one game that makes sense to play with it.
[406.28 --> 415.00]  There's a Pixel deal where you have to pay the entire cost of the phone up front, but then the difference gets deducted from your wireless bill month to month.
[415.68 --> 417.92]  So it's like they subsidize you.
[418.10 --> 418.98]  Hold on a second.
[419.20 --> 420.24]  You get...
[421.16 --> 423.34]  Like, is this a reverse subsidy?
[423.34 --> 425.74]  I don't really understand.
[427.04 --> 427.94]  That's pretty weird.
[428.12 --> 432.54]  The Apple Watch Series 1 is $200, and it's still totally not worth that.
[432.62 --> 434.30]  I am back to using it.
[434.36 --> 434.54]  Okay.
[434.80 --> 437.36]  Actually, that's something I can talk about a little bit here.
[437.36 --> 437.46]  Whoa.
[437.88 --> 439.16]  I'm back to using the Apple Watch?
[439.18 --> 439.62]  Yeah, why?
[440.12 --> 440.40]  Okay.
[440.54 --> 441.68]  So something...
[441.68 --> 445.70]  I've been trying to figure out an angle for my MacBook Pro review.
[446.04 --> 447.74]  Because there's a couple...
[447.74 --> 448.98]  Are you doing, like, Apple ecosystem?
[449.14 --> 452.16]  There's some problems with me reviewing the Mac Pro.
[452.16 --> 454.26]  Problem number one, I am not a Mac user.
[455.10 --> 455.74]  At all.
[456.42 --> 457.78]  Actually, that's the biggest problem.
[457.92 --> 459.12]  I am not a Mac user.
[459.44 --> 460.78]  I am not really an Apple user.
[460.78 --> 461.80]  Number one for a reason.
[462.50 --> 462.76]  Yeah.
[462.90 --> 463.06]  Yeah.
[463.16 --> 463.52]  That's...
[463.52 --> 463.90]  Yeah.
[464.34 --> 465.98]  That's number one.
[466.14 --> 468.28]  When you're number one, you don't need number two.
[470.64 --> 472.26]  So I'm pretty rusty.
[472.26 --> 477.06]  I actually did use a Mac for, like, six weeks back when I did my iMac videos.
[477.68 --> 479.78]  When they released the 5K iMac.
[480.00 --> 481.86]  But that was a really long time ago.
[482.16 --> 488.66]  And quite frankly, some of the stuff that continues to make me really mad, I had completely forgotten about.
[488.88 --> 493.48]  So today, I was, like, literally screaming over in the corner of the warehouse.
[493.54 --> 493.84]  Yep.
[494.22 --> 496.90]  Because there is no way...
[496.90 --> 497.38]  At least...
[497.38 --> 497.56]  Okay.
[497.78 --> 499.14]  I actually didn't Google it again.
[499.22 --> 500.80]  But I did research it last time.
[500.80 --> 504.66]  There is no way to force refresh Finder.
[505.30 --> 508.72]  So you know how in Explorer, it can kind of bug out sometimes.
[508.72 --> 509.98]  And you'll go and add a new folder.
[509.98 --> 511.24]  And it's just, like, not there.
[511.28 --> 512.54]  Or the rename doesn't take.
[513.12 --> 516.50]  And then when you go to click on it, it's like, this folder doesn't exist, even though you're looking at it.
[516.50 --> 519.16]  Because it's been renamed in the background somewhere.
[519.30 --> 520.46]  But you just got to refresh it.
[520.46 --> 521.32]  And it'll show up properly.
[521.46 --> 521.62]  Okay.
[521.62 --> 522.86]  You know how that can happen sometimes?
[522.94 --> 523.06]  Okay.
[523.10 --> 528.98]  So in Finder, if something changes within a folder and Finder doesn't realize it, you just wait.
[530.42 --> 532.48]  You just wait until it finds it.
[532.72 --> 533.42]  Because it's Finder.
[534.26 --> 535.90]  It's working on it actively.
[536.02 --> 536.74]  It's working on it.
[536.86 --> 538.24]  You don't have to worry about it.
[538.56 --> 538.84]  Yeah.
[538.84 --> 539.56]  It'll go for you.
[539.56 --> 542.46]  So there are some things that are driving me crazy.
[542.56 --> 543.70]  Anyway, so the point is.
[543.84 --> 544.08]  Sorry.
[544.26 --> 547.22]  CNET's Black Friday Buyer's Guide is the worst thing.
[548.10 --> 550.04]  It's just, you just have to, like, go.
[550.44 --> 551.30]  Yeah, check this out first.
[551.36 --> 551.92]  Sorry to, like.
[552.10 --> 553.84]  I was trying to research for the next topic.
[553.94 --> 555.50]  You derailed me so hard there.
[555.62 --> 556.54]  This is the worst.
[557.10 --> 559.60]  Like, okay, first off, there's that thing in the way.
[559.60 --> 562.94]  And then you can't, like, all the information is in the right-hand side.
[565.14 --> 566.22]  Oh, what's going on?
[566.30 --> 566.58]  Hold on.
[566.80 --> 567.80]  So you got to scroll here?
[568.04 --> 568.38]  Yeah.
[568.38 --> 570.68]  So there's, like, a little mini scroll wheel.
[570.84 --> 572.48]  And then there's just random picture.
[572.66 --> 576.52]  And then you just have to go, like, next slide to find the next product.
[576.68 --> 577.86]  There isn't, like, a list of products.
[580.16 --> 582.24]  And then there's, like, name.
[582.56 --> 586.50]  So if you just scroll to the wrong part, it's, like, at a really weird part of the page.
[589.12 --> 589.76]  Oh, sorry.
[589.82 --> 590.58]  I wasn't screen sharing.
[590.58 --> 591.44]  They missed all that.
[592.00 --> 593.02]  They missed all the epicness.
[593.10 --> 594.02]  You know what I'll tell you, though?
[594.78 --> 596.00]  Back to my topic.
[596.20 --> 596.60]  Yep, there we go.
[596.60 --> 599.30]  Having completely skipped yours, but this is terrible.
[599.58 --> 599.72]  Yeah.
[599.82 --> 601.92]  This is just – is this, like, a blank ad spot?
[602.70 --> 603.02]  Probably.
[603.22 --> 604.76]  Like, are they just not serving it?
[604.82 --> 606.26]  This isn't even, like, a proper topic.
[606.34 --> 608.98]  I just wanted to show how, like, really, really bad this is.
[609.02 --> 609.16]  Yeah.
[609.24 --> 609.64]  There you go.
[609.68 --> 610.26]  Oh, there it is.
[610.34 --> 610.62]  Okay.
[610.62 --> 615.42]  Anyway, back on the subject of – so, okay.
[615.72 --> 618.22]  So why – so I've switched to the iPhone 7.
[619.00 --> 620.74]  I have switched to the Apple Watch.
[620.74 --> 637.32]  And I'm using the MacBook Pro as best I can as a daily driver in order to – even if I'm going to have frustrations that come along with not being an experienced Mac user, I want to try to experience some of the best things about it.
[637.74 --> 639.94]  Stuff like continuity really is amazing.
[639.94 --> 644.66]  Being able to have a text message come in in my pocket and not even have to look at my wrist.
[644.78 --> 646.32]  Just have it pop up on my computer.
[646.50 --> 647.10]  Blippity bloppity.
[647.18 --> 647.60]  I'm done.
[648.10 --> 653.94]  I mean, I don't use text messages a lot anymore because that's, like, it's 2016.
[654.42 --> 657.66]  But anyway, the point is there is stuff about it that's really, really cool.
[657.86 --> 665.30]  And I want to make sure that I'm experiencing all of that best-case scenario stuff to help offset some of the things that I'm not going to like about it.
[665.56 --> 667.24]  The touchpad is amazing.
[668.12 --> 669.00]  Touchpad's amazing.
[670.48 --> 672.08]  I'm trying to think what else is amazing.
[673.70 --> 678.00]  There are things that I do like about the touch bar already.
[678.00 --> 679.46]  Yeah, I can see that being cool.
[680.44 --> 681.02]  Oh, shoot.
[681.06 --> 682.24]  I don't think I put down – oh, yeah.
[682.24 --> 683.62]  Okay, when you open up calculator.
[684.38 --> 690.64]  So even though you don't have a number pad because it's a laptop, the touch bar puts all of your functions.
[691.66 --> 692.38]  So plus, minus.
[692.50 --> 692.82]  Yeah, yeah.
[692.94 --> 695.80]  And because it's above the number pad, they're close.
[696.56 --> 698.94]  And I was like, oh, that's cool.
[699.24 --> 700.40]  That just saved me time.
[700.96 --> 706.08]  However, most of the time as I'm typing, it has word suggestions for some completely –
[706.08 --> 714.56]  who types such so slowly that it would be faster to move their hands off the keyboard and press a suggested word?
[715.36 --> 716.06]  Oh, man.
[716.18 --> 720.26]  And especially because spellcheck is built-in OS-wide, which is another thing I like.
[720.26 --> 723.64]  I don't even need it for autocorrect.
[723.74 --> 724.54]  Why is it there?
[727.42 --> 729.68]  So anyway, that's what I'm up to.
[729.68 --> 733.10]  Guys, Dion says that he types slow enough for that to help.
[733.90 --> 736.26]  And Beta Rage says he does.
[736.42 --> 738.14]  And Zach says that his dad does.
[738.30 --> 739.68]  So here's my feedback.
[740.52 --> 741.80]  Get faster at typing.
[742.46 --> 748.24]  There's websites that you can go to where you, like, type the names of words that are on, like, fish and stuff.
[748.72 --> 751.30]  They have them in elementary school, and they make it so that you type faster.
[751.38 --> 753.02]  They make it so it's fun to learn to type.
[753.16 --> 753.36]  Yeah.
[754.04 --> 755.86]  One of them is probably called learn to type.
[755.98 --> 757.42]  Typing is an important life skill.
[757.42 --> 762.28]  Now, with that said, I do see it as a pretty cool, like, disability feature.
[762.82 --> 764.98]  Like, if you actually can't type.
[765.50 --> 766.16]  Okay, yeah.
[766.22 --> 774.00]  Like, let's say you, like, you were in an accident and, like, you know, the last joint of a couple of your fingers got lopped off or something like that.
[774.00 --> 777.42]  So there's, like, a specific reason that is not trainable.
[778.22 --> 778.58]  Yes.
[778.78 --> 779.80]  To, like, why – yeah.
[779.98 --> 781.04]  Yeah, so I could see that.
[781.04 --> 784.74]  I could also see people just having a really hard time typing on that keyboard.
[785.22 --> 786.60]  Oh, because it's just terrible, yeah.
[787.20 --> 788.32]  I'm getting faster, though.
[788.32 --> 789.00]  I don't like say why.
[789.04 --> 790.04]  I'm getting faster on it.
[790.58 --> 795.14]  I'm still going to do – I'm going to actually speed test in my – like, that's going to be part of my review.
[795.38 --> 795.76]  Because for me –
[795.76 --> 796.64]  To be fair, this one's really bad, too.
[797.00 --> 797.70]  I like it.
[797.84 --> 798.58]  I'm really fast on this.
[798.58 --> 800.32]  This one specifically is worse than that.
[800.32 --> 801.06]  Oh, you're on the stealth.
[801.16 --> 801.38]  Yes.
[801.44 --> 801.94]  Oh, that's right.
[802.00 --> 802.20]  Okay.
[803.34 --> 803.70]  Anyway.
[803.82 --> 804.16]  Oh, right.
[804.20 --> 805.42]  Other issues that I'm running into.
[805.42 --> 812.86]  So I'm having such a hard time switching to it as a daily driver because of just how fundamentally broken certain things are.
[813.36 --> 815.78]  For example, browsing network shares.
[815.92 --> 818.78]  And, yes, they're SMB shares, but it should still be okay.
[819.48 --> 820.44]  Holy balls.
[820.52 --> 825.16]  If you go to a directory you've never been to before, you can wait, like, 20 seconds for the files to populate.
[825.16 --> 829.48]  And it's not even, like, thumbnails, like, where they'll start to pop in.
[830.22 --> 833.12]  It's just empty for, like, a long time.
[833.44 --> 835.74]  And then it's like, oh, I got it.
[836.56 --> 843.26]  Also, HDMI output is broken AF on many capture cards.
[843.52 --> 848.12]  So I'm not going to blame my AVIO 4K because – and these guys are awesome, by the way.
[848.18 --> 850.96]  They already have an alpha firmware test for capturing PS4 Pro.
[851.18 --> 851.52]  Nice.
[851.60 --> 852.66]  I don't know if I told you that.
[852.70 --> 852.98]  No, that's cool.
[852.98 --> 853.98]  I don't know if I told John that.
[853.98 --> 854.76]  I should tell John that.
[854.76 --> 855.36]  Aren't they Canadian?
[856.34 --> 861.54]  That would explain why it says made in Canada and why the number that they call me from is based in Ottawa.
[861.76 --> 862.22]  So, yeah.
[862.28 --> 863.12]  Anyway, they're cool guys.
[863.20 --> 863.54]  I have a fan.
[864.50 --> 869.84]  And they're the reason that our capture streams don't fall off the rails anymore.
[869.88 --> 870.46]  Anymore, yeah.
[870.46 --> 871.36]  And that even when I don't –
[871.36 --> 872.10]  I want to pass through one, though.
[872.16 --> 873.24]  When I don't test – I know.
[873.28 --> 873.82]  I told them that.
[873.88 --> 874.10]  Okay.
[875.10 --> 877.90]  Every time I don't test my screen capture, it just, like, works.
[878.28 --> 878.50]  Yeah.
[878.68 --> 879.66]  Anyway, these guys are great.
[881.12 --> 884.34]  They're already aware that the MacBook Pro cannot be captured.
[884.76 --> 885.98]  And it's not just them.
[885.98 --> 889.64]  If I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure they use these on the ISS.
[890.36 --> 890.64]  Really?
[891.54 --> 893.18]  Because I was doing research into them.
[895.12 --> 897.22]  But I just – I need pass through.
[897.90 --> 898.20]  Yeah.
[898.58 --> 898.84]  Yeah.
[898.84 --> 903.76]  Pass through would be a very, very good thing because it's really janky to use an HDMI splitter.
[904.16 --> 904.22]  Yes.
[904.48 --> 904.84]  Yeah.
[905.22 --> 907.18]  Like, I can do that, but I would just rather not.
[907.32 --> 907.52]  Yeah.
[908.32 --> 912.06]  So, that's where we're at on whatever I was talking about just now.
[913.02 --> 919.10]  Oh, I actually have a Newegg Black Friday deal that's also on NCIX.com.
[919.20 --> 921.02]  So, you can get it in the States or Canada.
[921.86 --> 923.60]  Intel has a crazy deal.
[923.60 --> 926.72]  These Black Friday deal things that we're calling out are not sponsored, just so everyone knows.
[926.78 --> 927.54]  Yeah, just so you know.
[927.66 --> 930.00]  This is just – I'm planning to buy a whack of them.
[931.48 --> 935.18]  I hate how Newegg will just glitch out because you're not in the States.
[935.24 --> 935.94]  Well, it's a render error.
[935.94 --> 937.12]  Just make it, like, go – yeah.
[937.34 --> 942.12]  I think it's a high DPI screen issue because it works fine on some of my computers and not others.
[942.14 --> 943.14]  But they should be able to fix that.
[943.14 --> 943.80]  Well, they should – yeah.
[943.94 --> 946.18]  Well, that's – and even if they can't fix it.
[946.18 --> 950.52]  So, just to show you guys what we're talking about, if you load a page –
[950.52 --> 951.58]  Don't think it's going to do – there we go.
[951.58 --> 952.62]  Oh, it worked this time.
[953.36 --> 953.76]  Yeah.
[953.88 --> 954.50]  Holy crap.
[954.50 --> 956.68]  So, sometimes the –
[956.68 --> 957.42]  What just happened?
[958.26 --> 958.60]  What?
[958.94 --> 960.10]  It just – oh, wow.
[960.20 --> 961.32]  It took me to Newegg.
[961.42 --> 962.50]  It took me back to the homepage.
[963.14 --> 964.32]  So much fail.
[965.16 --> 968.24]  It'll, like, gray out the screen to put that pop-up being like,
[968.24 --> 969.20]  well, you're in Canada.
[969.36 --> 970.48]  Do you mean .ca?
[971.42 --> 973.28]  But then not bring up the pop-ups.
[973.38 --> 975.34]  You just have to click somewhere and then it'll go away.
[975.34 --> 978.20]  Actually, no, because Newegg.ca is terrible.
[978.44 --> 978.70]  Yeah.
[979.32 --> 979.76]  Anyway.
[979.88 --> 980.16]  Yeah.
[980.84 --> 985.94]  This is on for, like, $300 off, which works out to, like, $450 Canadian off.
[986.54 --> 988.74]  So – or, like, $400, something along those lines.
[989.20 --> 992.88]  So, I'm actually – and it's limit two per customer, but I think I can game the system
[992.88 --> 995.30]  because I actually want to try and get 24 of them.
[995.76 --> 996.02]  Yeah.
[996.02 --> 1002.82]  So, I'm working on a plan to convert our SSD server to a pure NVMe server.
[1003.12 --> 1005.30]  We have 15 people that work here.
[1006.22 --> 1011.26]  Well, it's not so much just that as that there could be two ingest stations out there
[1011.26 --> 1016.24]  streaming high bitrate video onto it while six people are sitting in there editing off
[1016.24 --> 1016.44]  it.
[1016.44 --> 1016.60]  Oh, no.
[1016.60 --> 1017.86]  I meant in order to get that many of them.
[1018.94 --> 1019.34]  Oh.
[1019.44 --> 1020.12]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1020.12 --> 1023.04]  We're just going to have people buy them and expense them.
[1023.26 --> 1023.44]  Yeah.
[1023.80 --> 1024.58]  You can do that, right?
[1024.58 --> 1025.42]  Like, it's not illegal.
[1025.58 --> 1028.48]  It's just breaking Newegg's terms of service, which, quite frankly, what do I care?
[1029.44 --> 1035.12]  So, this is the machine I'm planning – it's really funny because in a video recently I
[1035.12 --> 1040.20]  basically made fun of people for browsing the Super Micro website recreationally.
[1040.20 --> 1044.40]  but it is 100% something that I do.
[1045.90 --> 1048.18]  So I'm planning to put it in one of these
[1048.18 --> 1051.90]  that I just discovered and had not seen before at all.
[1052.22 --> 1053.88]  24 NVMe drives.
[1053.96 --> 1056.50]  It's a 24-bay NVMe server,
[1056.70 --> 1059.32]  so you can install, I think, a half-height
[1059.32 --> 1063.82]  and two more full-height PCI Express cards off of risers.
[1064.34 --> 1067.10]  It's dual socket, 2011-3,
[1067.10 --> 1069.36]  and then it can take up to whatever that is,
[1069.36 --> 1070.84]  like 24 memory slots.
[1073.02 --> 1074.48]  Yeah, so I've talked to them.
[1074.70 --> 1076.28]  Oh, yeah, quad 10-gig LAN.
[1077.52 --> 1080.10]  So we will be definitely taking advantage
[1080.10 --> 1082.88]  of that bigger 10-gig switch that we got.
[1083.00 --> 1084.30]  That's really epic.
[1084.48 --> 1085.96]  So this thing is disgusting.
[1086.24 --> 1089.28]  Now, with that said, there are some issues
[1089.28 --> 1090.70]  that I do have to figure out.
[1091.14 --> 1093.42]  Unfortunately, the deal ends in like two days,
[1093.60 --> 1095.44]  so I don't have a lot of time to decide,
[1095.44 --> 1098.98]  and because Supermicro's American office is closed,
[1098.98 --> 1100.58]  as far as I can tell, Americans,
[1100.88 --> 1102.06]  like if you're American out there,
[1102.46 --> 1104.54]  you guys celebrate Thanksgiving for like a week, right?
[1105.60 --> 1107.80]  Like is it, as far as I can tell,
[1107.92 --> 1110.30]  everyone in America takes an entire week off
[1110.30 --> 1114.60]  for 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
[1116.48 --> 1117.22]  Pretty much?
[1117.28 --> 1118.14]  Like am I wrong?
[1118.14 --> 1120.62]  Like that's my experience when trying to contact,
[1120.82 --> 1121.62]  here's John.
[1121.88 --> 1122.30]  What's up?
[1122.36 --> 1124.00]  John, am I off here?
[1124.64 --> 1125.80]  How much time do we take off?
[1125.86 --> 1126.26]  What holiday?
[1126.40 --> 1128.10]  Like a week for 4th of July?
[1128.46 --> 1128.74]  No.
[1129.08 --> 1129.94]  Oh, come on.
[1130.46 --> 1130.58]  No.
[1130.80 --> 1132.74]  Like it's usually an extended weekend.
[1133.00 --> 1134.92]  An extended weekend, he calls it.
[1135.24 --> 1137.14]  But like does an extended weekend mean like
[1137.14 --> 1139.04]  a day on either side?
[1139.12 --> 1140.48]  Okay, not seven days.
[1140.54 --> 1140.84]  Okay.
[1141.24 --> 1142.26]  How long?
[1142.90 --> 1143.82]  How long do you think?
[1145.30 --> 1147.00]  If the 4th of July is on a weekend,
[1147.22 --> 1147.82]  it might be like a week.
[1147.82 --> 1148.74]  If it's on a weekend,
[1149.24 --> 1150.02]  three or four day weekend.
[1150.02 --> 1150.74]  Three or four day weekend.
[1151.70 --> 1153.00]  Okay, but like Thanksgiving?
[1154.20 --> 1155.40]  When I was in school.
[1155.80 --> 1156.80]  They can't hear you,
[1156.86 --> 1158.52]  so I have to kind of like translate.
[1158.88 --> 1159.54]  When I was in school,
[1159.64 --> 1161.12]  they did one day on each side.
[1161.28 --> 1161.58]  Okay.
[1161.96 --> 1164.34]  So Thanksgiving would be a five day weekend.
[1164.34 --> 1165.86]  It would be like a five day weekend.
[1165.98 --> 1167.26]  But Christmas, people,
[1167.46 --> 1168.64]  depending on who it is,
[1168.72 --> 1169.36]  it would take a lot of time.
[1169.36 --> 1169.80]  Okay.
[1170.16 --> 1170.46]  Okay.
[1170.60 --> 1171.58]  So anyway,
[1171.82 --> 1173.60]  getting in touch with anyone down there
[1173.60 --> 1175.32]  is kind of an issue right now.
[1175.80 --> 1178.78]  But I did get in touch with one of my reps
[1178.78 --> 1180.54]  who got this.
[1180.68 --> 1181.18]  I was like,
[1181.50 --> 1181.82]  okay,
[1182.38 --> 1184.76]  so what I don't know about this kind of configuration,
[1185.08 --> 1186.80]  because obviously you don't run out
[1186.80 --> 1187.88]  and buy a raid card.
[1189.22 --> 1189.62]  Duh.
[1191.86 --> 1192.26]  So.
[1192.54 --> 1194.02]  You, you know.
[1194.28 --> 1196.24]  Because my first question when Linus asked,
[1196.76 --> 1197.78]  or told me he was going to do it,
[1197.80 --> 1197.98]  I was like,
[1198.02 --> 1199.04]  how do you even plug them all in?
[1199.04 --> 1199.20]  Yeah.
[1199.20 --> 1202.22]  Windows Storage Spaces is a gigantic dog turd.
[1202.52 --> 1202.70]  Yeah.
[1202.80 --> 1204.00]  The last time I used it,
[1204.04 --> 1206.96]  though I haven't tried it on 2016 preview.
[1208.72 --> 1209.52]  I mean, okay,
[1209.58 --> 1211.26]  so the list kind of goes on here.
[1211.46 --> 1211.60]  Like,
[1211.74 --> 1212.98]  software raid in Windows
[1212.98 --> 1216.14]  is basically a terrible idea.
[1216.78 --> 1218.50]  And the performance hasn't been great
[1218.50 --> 1220.28]  when I've tooled around with it in the past.
[1220.60 --> 1222.22]  So I'm kind of sitting here going like,
[1222.46 --> 1222.96]  and yes,
[1222.98 --> 1224.42]  I'm aware of the issues with raid cards
[1224.42 --> 1225.06]  to all the people.
[1225.06 --> 1226.16]  I haven't looked at Twitch chat,
[1226.32 --> 1228.38]  but I'm sure that Twitch chat is full of people
[1228.38 --> 1229.68]  talking about how raid is dead.
[1230.12 --> 1230.26]  No,
[1230.32 --> 1231.58]  there is still a place for raid.
[1231.78 --> 1234.24]  What raid is not is foolproof.
[1234.24 --> 1234.68]  Yeah.
[1234.68 --> 1236.30]  So what you want is raid
[1236.30 --> 1238.50]  with some kind of real-time,
[1238.50 --> 1240.24]  real-time failover.
[1240.24 --> 1242.66]  So I actually have that.
[1242.74 --> 1243.06]  So anyway,
[1243.28 --> 1244.96]  so I call him up,
[1244.98 --> 1245.36]  and I'm like,
[1246.02 --> 1247.78]  so what am I going to run this on?
[1248.12 --> 1252.00]  Because I found one post somewhere
[1252.00 --> 1254.52]  that talked about free NAS and NVMe.
[1256.62 --> 1258.06]  So as far as I can tell,
[1258.18 --> 1259.70]  most people concerning themselves
[1259.70 --> 1260.82]  with a machine like this
[1260.82 --> 1262.56]  are not using it for video editing.
[1262.66 --> 1263.60]  They're using it as like,
[1263.86 --> 1265.14]  like a caching server
[1265.14 --> 1268.10]  for like very,
[1268.26 --> 1269.54]  very high traffic pages
[1269.54 --> 1270.42]  or something like that.
[1270.48 --> 1272.58]  Like they're looking for massive IOPS.
[1272.66 --> 1273.30]  They're probably running
[1273.30 --> 1274.40]  some kind of completely
[1274.40 --> 1275.76]  custom software solution.
[1276.44 --> 1277.54]  They could be running
[1277.54 --> 1278.50]  some kind of like,
[1278.62 --> 1278.86]  you know,
[1278.92 --> 1280.54]  tens and tens of thousands of dollars
[1280.54 --> 1282.54]  per piece of software
[1282.54 --> 1283.26]  or like,
[1283.46 --> 1283.78]  you know,
[1284.12 --> 1285.52]  SAN type of system
[1285.52 --> 1286.50]  or whatever the case may be.
[1286.58 --> 1287.16]  It would be like,
[1287.42 --> 1289.08]  it'd be like a solutions provider
[1289.08 --> 1291.96]  working with something like this.
[1291.96 --> 1292.30]  Anyway,
[1292.30 --> 1294.26]  so I'm just like,
[1294.36 --> 1294.62]  okay,
[1294.80 --> 1295.00]  so,
[1295.36 --> 1296.52]  but I have to decide now
[1296.52 --> 1297.48]  if I'm buying the drives.
[1298.02 --> 1298.86]  And he's like,
[1299.60 --> 1301.42]  just go for it.
[1302.04 --> 1302.44]  And I'm like,
[1302.50 --> 1304.08]  can you get in touch with someone
[1304.08 --> 1305.06]  who knows what we're supposed to run?
[1305.10 --> 1305.34]  He's like,
[1305.36 --> 1305.46]  yeah,
[1305.48 --> 1305.62]  no,
[1305.66 --> 1306.04]  I don't know,
[1306.12 --> 1307.30]  but I'm sure there's something.
[1307.56 --> 1307.80]  I'm like,
[1307.86 --> 1308.10]  dude,
[1308.66 --> 1310.46]  this is like $16,000.
[1311.38 --> 1311.90]  He's like,
[1311.96 --> 1312.08]  yeah,
[1312.10 --> 1312.68]  it'll be fine.
[1316.10 --> 1316.42]  Like,
[1316.48 --> 1318.02]  you're not being very reassuring right now.
[1318.50 --> 1318.96]  So anyway,
[1318.96 --> 1320.36]  I happen to have a handful
[1320.36 --> 1321.78]  of 750 series drives
[1321.78 --> 1323.40]  and I've been tooling around
[1323.40 --> 1325.06]  with just Windows as built in
[1325.06 --> 1326.48]  RAID 5 software.
[1326.48 --> 1326.88]  So what said,
[1327.00 --> 1327.54]  call Wendell?
[1328.06 --> 1329.08]  I could call Wendell.
[1329.10 --> 1330.20]  It's actually not a terrible idea.
[1330.34 --> 1331.16]  I actually,
[1332.06 --> 1333.90]  You'll end up with a Linux solution.
[1333.96 --> 1334.10]  No,
[1334.18 --> 1335.16]  I meant to message him.
[1335.44 --> 1335.66]  Yeah.
[1335.92 --> 1336.54]  And then I,
[1336.64 --> 1336.76]  no,
[1336.84 --> 1337.74]  I remember what happened.
[1337.78 --> 1338.90]  That's when I was looking for my phone.
[1339.20 --> 1339.56]  Oh.
[1339.70 --> 1340.58]  And then when I found my phone,
[1340.62 --> 1341.52]  I forgot to message him anyway.
[1341.52 --> 1341.72]  There you go.
[1341.96 --> 1342.84]  So yeah,
[1342.84 --> 1343.80]  I could call Wendell,
[1343.90 --> 1344.82]  but the problem is that
[1344.82 --> 1347.22]  I do already have
[1347.22 --> 1348.48]  a solution
[1348.48 --> 1350.92]  for our real-time synchronization
[1350.92 --> 1352.38]  that is working very,
[1352.56 --> 1353.28]  very well.
[1353.48 --> 1353.86]  Through Windows.
[1354.00 --> 1355.64]  And it is a Windows
[1355.64 --> 1356.64]  or,
[1357.50 --> 1358.96]  I forget what it is,
[1359.02 --> 1359.64]  but it's like
[1359.64 --> 1361.34]  something else
[1361.34 --> 1362.42]  and not Linux.
[1364.92 --> 1366.06]  What is it called?
[1366.82 --> 1367.82]  Is it called
[1367.82 --> 1368.70]  PierSync?
[1368.88 --> 1369.56]  Is that what I'm using?
[1369.56 --> 1369.96]  Yeah.
[1372.18 --> 1373.18]  So I ended up
[1373.18 --> 1374.58]  buying PierSync,
[1375.06 --> 1375.92]  which is like
[1375.92 --> 1379.08]  a $2,000 piece of software,
[1379.62 --> 1381.04]  which is ridiculous.
[1383.30 --> 1383.80]  But it were,
[1383.94 --> 1384.08]  okay,
[1384.18 --> 1385.38]  so it runs on
[1385.38 --> 1387.90]  Azure,
[1388.36 --> 1389.26]  Windows Server,
[1390.06 --> 1390.64]  NetApp,
[1391.12 --> 1393.80]  and Cloud on Tap.
[1394.60 --> 1395.70]  And that's it.
[1395.80 --> 1396.44]  And that's it.
[1396.72 --> 1397.90]  So it runs on Windows.
[1397.90 --> 1399.42]  So what it,
[1399.52 --> 1401.60]  but it's like amazing.
[1401.78 --> 1402.42]  It's bulletproof.
[1402.58 --> 1404.00]  This is not a sponsored piece.
[1404.12 --> 1405.54]  I paid for it.
[1405.98 --> 1406.10]  Although,
[1406.30 --> 1408.06]  I've gotten my money's worth
[1408.06 --> 1409.40]  with tech support
[1409.40 --> 1410.38]  because our use case,
[1410.66 --> 1411.14]  once again,
[1411.26 --> 1412.58]  was very unusual.
[1413.78 --> 1415.12]  And I found
[1415.12 --> 1416.14]  kind of a weird
[1416.14 --> 1417.06]  idiosyncrasy
[1417.06 --> 1417.70]  of the software
[1417.70 --> 1418.58]  that made it
[1418.58 --> 1419.20]  so that if I had
[1419.20 --> 1420.12]  an off-site backup
[1420.12 --> 1421.22]  that had a much,
[1421.26 --> 1422.38]  much slower link,
[1422.56 --> 1423.44]  it was basically
[1423.44 --> 1424.94]  nerfing my on-site backups
[1424.94 --> 1425.86]  and bottlenecking it.
[1426.04 --> 1426.32]  Okay.
[1426.32 --> 1426.84]  And there was like
[1426.84 --> 1427.38]  some tunable
[1427.38 --> 1428.12]  that I had to anyway.
[1428.34 --> 1428.56]  Nice.
[1428.66 --> 1429.60]  The point is,
[1430.32 --> 1431.86]  whenever I make a change
[1431.86 --> 1433.94]  to our SSD server,
[1434.26 --> 1435.08]  it is replicated
[1435.08 --> 1436.50]  within about two seconds
[1436.50 --> 1438.56]  to a mechanical server
[1438.56 --> 1439.08]  elsewhere.
[1439.50 --> 1441.14]  And it also allows me
[1441.14 --> 1442.38]  to have a recycle bin
[1442.38 --> 1445.12]  for a network storage device
[1445.12 --> 1446.80]  that is bulletproof.
[1446.92 --> 1447.68]  So if someone
[1447.68 --> 1448.74]  deletes something,
[1448.92 --> 1449.90]  it moves into
[1449.90 --> 1450.98]  a recycled folder
[1450.98 --> 1452.58]  on that other machine,
[1453.12 --> 1453.86]  even though we don't
[1453.86 --> 1454.60]  have to deal with
[1454.60 --> 1455.28]  actually having
[1455.28 --> 1456.20]  the space taken up
[1456.20 --> 1457.18]  by a recycle bin
[1457.18 --> 1459.46]  on the actual NAS box.
[1459.78 --> 1461.06]  So I'm really,
[1461.20 --> 1461.64]  really happy
[1461.64 --> 1462.90]  with how that's working
[1462.90 --> 1464.16]  and I really just
[1464.16 --> 1465.04]  don't want to touch it.
[1465.14 --> 1465.78]  So I would like
[1465.78 --> 1466.44]  to use Windows.
[1466.56 --> 1467.32]  And what that means
[1467.32 --> 1468.42]  is even if that software
[1468.42 --> 1469.40]  RAID 5 is garbage,
[1469.74 --> 1470.60]  what I'll probably do
[1470.60 --> 1471.50]  is take the existing
[1471.50 --> 1472.10]  WANX server
[1472.10 --> 1473.58]  and I'll have that
[1473.58 --> 1474.80]  as my real-time backup.
[1474.96 --> 1476.18]  So I'll be fully solid state
[1476.18 --> 1477.30]  on both the A machine
[1477.30 --> 1477.86]  and the B
[1477.86 --> 1478.66]  and the target machine.
[1479.30 --> 1480.64]  So that's kind of,
[1480.64 --> 1481.62]  that's kind of the plan.
[1481.84 --> 1482.96]  That's kind of what I'm thinking.
[1482.96 --> 1485.04]  I'm sure someone's
[1485.04 --> 1485.50]  going to tell me
[1485.50 --> 1485.98]  I'm wrong
[1485.98 --> 1486.38]  and hey,
[1486.74 --> 1487.70]  with my track record,
[1487.88 --> 1489.12]  you might be right.
[1489.24 --> 1490.90]  But with four drives
[1490.90 --> 1491.76]  running in a RAID 5
[1491.76 --> 1492.72]  over there right now,
[1493.16 --> 1495.08]  I am able to pull,
[1495.26 --> 1496.28]  not in a single,
[1496.82 --> 1498.56]  not with a single file transfer.
[1498.92 --> 1499.88]  Single file transfers,
[1500.02 --> 1500.68]  I'm reading at about
[1500.68 --> 1501.82]  two gigabytes per second
[1501.82 --> 1502.86]  and writing at about one.
[1503.12 --> 1504.70]  But with multiple file transfers,
[1504.84 --> 1505.88]  I can pull off of it
[1505.88 --> 1506.82]  at about two and a half,
[1506.90 --> 1508.24]  three gigabytes per second
[1508.24 --> 1509.06]  to a RAM disk
[1509.06 --> 1510.74]  and I can write to it
[1510.74 --> 1514.06]  at closer to one and a half
[1514.06 --> 1515.04]  gigabytes per second.
[1515.24 --> 1516.84]  So I'm super thrilled with that
[1516.84 --> 1519.30]  and I'm really pleased with,
[1519.42 --> 1520.34]  thanks to the IOPS
[1520.34 --> 1521.26]  of an NVMe device,
[1521.34 --> 1521.80]  or not NM,
[1521.98 --> 1522.98]  of NVMe devices,
[1523.28 --> 1524.58]  I'm really pleased with the way
[1524.58 --> 1526.42]  that it scales with multiple users
[1526.42 --> 1529.52]  instead of hitting a brick wall
[1529.52 --> 1531.12]  when you hit it with multiple users
[1531.12 --> 1532.28]  the way that mechanical does
[1532.28 --> 1533.52]  and to a much lesser extent,
[1533.72 --> 1534.94]  regular solid state,
[1535.28 --> 1536.54]  especially off of a RAID card
[1536.54 --> 1537.80]  where trim's not working correctly.
[1537.80 --> 1541.68]  So that's kind of my plan for that.
[1543.52 --> 1544.64]  That's going to be pretty nuts.
[1544.76 --> 1545.76]  We have no topics today,
[1545.82 --> 1546.88]  so I made a topic out of that.
[1546.96 --> 1547.32]  Are you going to do
[1547.32 --> 1548.18]  a holy shit episode
[1548.18 --> 1549.36]  about just unboxing
[1549.36 --> 1550.30]  all the NVMe drives?
[1550.44 --> 1552.12]  I think it makes a ton of sense.
[1552.22 --> 1553.48]  I think once the server
[1553.48 --> 1554.90]  and the NVMe drives arrive,
[1555.12 --> 1555.80]  that would be...
[1556.88 --> 1557.84]  Hold on, calculator.
[1558.32 --> 1559.08]  This is another thing
[1559.08 --> 1560.78]  that's really great about Apple.
[1561.94 --> 1562.62]  Watch this.
[1562.78 --> 1563.62]  Start menu works?
[1564.66 --> 1565.10]  Oh, okay.
[1565.14 --> 1566.08]  It actually worked that time.
[1566.20 --> 1566.60]  Oh, wow.
[1566.72 --> 1566.96]  Brilliant.
[1567.52 --> 1568.44]  Well, whatever.
[1568.94 --> 1570.04]  Search works.
[1570.90 --> 1571.42]  Oh, yeah.
[1571.72 --> 1572.88]  Search actually works,
[1572.92 --> 1573.62]  which is amazing.
[1574.18 --> 1575.44]  Start menu works.
[1575.62 --> 1576.76]  Search probably works.
[1576.80 --> 1577.74]  Yeah, Spotlight is awesome.
[1577.84 --> 1579.44]  The calculator probably works
[1579.44 --> 1580.90]  more than 75% of the time.
[1580.94 --> 1582.46]  The calculator works in windows.
[1582.46 --> 1583.36]  The calculator's bricked
[1583.36 --> 1584.70]  on my work machine and my house.
[1584.98 --> 1585.36]  Really?
[1585.42 --> 1586.74]  Literally can't open the application.
[1586.96 --> 1587.44]  If you do,
[1587.50 --> 1588.50]  it'll just load infinitely
[1588.50 --> 1589.42]  and you have to end the task.
[1590.08 --> 1590.36]  Oh.
[1590.96 --> 1592.12]  Well, get rekt, son.
[1592.42 --> 1592.68]  Yep.
[1592.68 --> 1596.04]  So it would be a 28.8 terabyte NVMe.
[1596.04 --> 1597.64]  NAS box,
[1597.92 --> 1598.76]  which would be pretty sick.
[1599.54 --> 1600.14]  That's ridiculous.
[1600.26 --> 1602.16]  Yeah, I think that justifies a holy shit,
[1602.24 --> 1603.70]  but then I would also want to do a video
[1603.70 --> 1605.56]  benchmarking it
[1605.56 --> 1607.06]  and showing it in use.
[1607.20 --> 1608.06]  Remember the, like,
[1608.14 --> 1609.12]  really old,
[1609.82 --> 1611.70]  like, viral nerd video
[1611.70 --> 1612.36]  of that dude
[1612.36 --> 1613.52]  linking all the SSDs
[1613.52 --> 1614.18]  into that machine?
[1614.60 --> 1615.64]  He's got, like, colored hair
[1615.64 --> 1617.34]  and they make a weird song out of it
[1617.34 --> 1617.92]  and it's, like,
[1617.92 --> 1619.56]  his whole office singing and stuff?
[1619.82 --> 1620.10]  No.
[1620.10 --> 1620.90]  Isn't it all, like,
[1620.90 --> 1622.20]  Samsung SSDs or something?
[1622.34 --> 1623.06]  I have no idea.
[1623.06 --> 1624.22]  He, like, copies a CD
[1624.22 --> 1625.66]  before he can drop it out of a window?
[1626.88 --> 1627.32]  No.
[1627.60 --> 1628.50]  You don't remember this?
[1628.94 --> 1629.50]  I think it's, like,
[1629.54 --> 1632.00]  24 SSDs in RAID 0 or something.
[1634.84 --> 1635.62]  Let me, like,
[1635.66 --> 1636.68]  this used to be, like,
[1638.20 --> 1638.84]  just the hottest thing.
[1638.84 --> 1640.26]  Why don't I do a rapid fire topic
[1640.26 --> 1641.10]  while you go ahead
[1641.10 --> 1642.52]  and look that up?
[1643.00 --> 1643.30]  Yeah.
[1643.30 --> 1644.98]  It sounds like the hottest thing.
[1645.02 --> 1645.28]  Samsung,
[1645.60 --> 1647.30]  what happens when you RAID
[1647.30 --> 1649.24]  24 SSD hard disks?
[1650.06 --> 1651.88]  It has 2.3 million views.
[1652.36 --> 1654.10]  It was uploaded in 2011.
[1655.36 --> 1656.82]  There's Paul the IT genius
[1656.82 --> 1657.38]  with, like,
[1657.44 --> 1658.40]  reddish-pinkish hair.
[1659.28 --> 1659.80]  Oh.
[1660.46 --> 1661.16]  What happens?
[1661.16 --> 1661.94]  That's it, yeah.
[1662.14 --> 1662.82]  Okay, all right.
[1662.82 --> 1663.50]  Let's pull this up.
[1663.60 --> 1664.36]  Let's pull this up.
[1664.72 --> 1665.20]  I'm game.
[1667.48 --> 1668.62]  Being marketing people,
[1668.72 --> 1669.28]  we thought of some
[1669.28 --> 1670.58]  pretty rubbish adverts.
[1673.30 --> 1677.00]  Something something.
[1677.70 --> 1678.24]  So he, like,
[1678.32 --> 1679.26]  builds the computer.
[1682.48 --> 1683.36]  Hacksaw's
[1683.36 --> 1684.72]  mounting for his
[1684.72 --> 1685.36]  almond cooler.
[1688.00 --> 1688.88]  He's using
[1688.88 --> 1689.86]  skull trail
[1689.86 --> 1690.76]  for some reason.
[1695.94 --> 1696.94]  And then...
[1698.62 --> 1700.90]  Yep, okay.
[1701.06 --> 1701.86]  Well, that's...
[1701.86 --> 1702.68]  And then go to the,
[1702.68 --> 1703.20]  like,
[1703.24 --> 1703.72]  near the end.
[1704.70 --> 1705.90]  Because they turn it into,
[1706.04 --> 1706.10]  like,
[1706.12 --> 1707.00]  a song and stuff,
[1707.08 --> 1707.66]  but you've got to get to,
[1707.72 --> 1709.70]  like...
[1709.70 --> 1710.92]  So he's, like,
[1711.10 --> 1712.54]  showing...
[1712.54 --> 1713.36]  loading pictures,
[1713.62 --> 1714.30]  and then he shows, like,
[1714.46 --> 1714.76]  jumping
[1714.76 --> 1716.84]  with all the SSDs
[1716.84 --> 1717.90]  and the computer keeps running.
[1718.00 --> 1718.44]  This is, like,
[1718.48 --> 1719.80]  very early on SSDs
[1719.80 --> 1720.60]  and people don't realize
[1720.60 --> 1721.68]  that that doesn't matter at all.
[1722.92 --> 1723.24]  Okay.
[1723.24 --> 1723.52]  Hell yeah.
[1724.06 --> 1724.62]  Hell yeah.
[1724.76 --> 1725.76]  This is where they, like,
[1726.22 --> 1727.32]  just have weird music
[1727.32 --> 1728.58]  and they just go, like,
[1728.68 --> 1729.02]  whoa.
[1729.02 --> 1729.32]  Whoa.
[1732.68 --> 1733.64]  Okay.
[1734.30 --> 1734.90]  I...
[1734.90 --> 1735.98]  I loved this video.
[1736.08 --> 1737.04]  I somehow missed
[1737.04 --> 1738.46]  this little piece of, uh...
[1738.46 --> 1739.14]  I watched this video
[1739.14 --> 1740.06]  so many times.
[1740.14 --> 1741.42]  I shared it to so many people.
[1742.20 --> 1742.56]  Man.
[1742.64 --> 1744.70]  Apparently 2.3, uh...
[1744.70 --> 1746.28]  2.3 million of them.
[1746.52 --> 1746.82]  Yep.
[1747.54 --> 1747.98]  Yep.
[1748.54 --> 1749.18]  This was, like,
[1749.24 --> 1750.52]  before anyone I knew
[1750.52 --> 1751.86]  had even seen an SSD.
[1752.38 --> 1752.70]  Right.
[1752.78 --> 1753.90]  And this dude had 24.
[1754.58 --> 1755.40]  And I was just like,
[1755.40 --> 1757.94]  whoa, it's so fast.
[1758.20 --> 1758.94]  So you can...
[1758.94 --> 1760.08]  You could just remake that video.
[1761.44 --> 1762.00]  There you go.
[1762.02 --> 1762.80]  I probably won't,
[1762.86 --> 1763.30]  but thank you.
[1763.30 --> 1763.82]  2.3 million views?
[1763.96 --> 1764.50]  I like the...
[1764.50 --> 1764.72]  Yeah.
[1764.90 --> 1765.98]  2.3 million views?
[1767.00 --> 1768.18]  You won't remake that video?
[1768.60 --> 1769.10]  All right.
[1769.18 --> 1771.08]  Let's get on to the, uh...
[1771.08 --> 1771.60]  In Paul,
[1771.68 --> 1773.48]  the IT genius's name?
[1774.42 --> 1775.42]  In Paul's name,
[1775.50 --> 1776.92]  we remake the...
[1776.92 --> 1778.48]  You're just not gonna let me
[1778.48 --> 1779.66]  move on to any real topics.
[1779.66 --> 1780.88]  There's no real topics.
[1781.26 --> 1782.02]  Well, okay.
[1782.68 --> 1784.68]  Elon Musk won a contract,
[1784.68 --> 1785.98]  which is fascinating.
[1786.46 --> 1787.06]  That's new.
[1787.14 --> 1788.28]  That's never happened before.
[1788.30 --> 1790.18]  An ocean surveying satellite.
[1790.50 --> 1791.06]  Sweet.
[1791.22 --> 1792.38]  The cost of launching the probe
[1792.38 --> 1794.34]  is valued at 112 million.
[1794.50 --> 1796.38]  That is assuming that, uh,
[1796.74 --> 1797.94]  President-elect Trump
[1797.94 --> 1799.20]  doesn't completely cut
[1799.20 --> 1799.96]  all the funding
[1799.96 --> 1801.04]  for Earth observation.
[1801.40 --> 1802.62]  And just for you
[1802.62 --> 1804.30]  fact-checkers out there,
[1804.34 --> 1806.02]  that is more than the cost
[1806.02 --> 1808.62]  of, uh, 24 NVMe SSDs.
[1810.32 --> 1810.84]  Barely.
[1812.10 --> 1813.04]  But it is.
[1813.04 --> 1813.90]  Um...
[1813.90 --> 1814.78]  We've done the math.
[1815.42 --> 1816.60]  So, designed to scan
[1816.60 --> 1817.34]  the planet's oceans
[1817.34 --> 1818.50]  and provide the first-ever
[1818.50 --> 1819.36]  global survey
[1819.36 --> 1820.86]  of Earth's surface water.
[1822.06 --> 1823.16]  Satellite something-something.
[1823.40 --> 1824.98]  SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets.
[1825.14 --> 1825.54]  Wow.
[1825.78 --> 1826.16]  Okay.
[1826.42 --> 1827.82]  Uh, comes at a higher value
[1827.82 --> 1829.20]  than previous launch contracts.
[1829.30 --> 1830.50]  NASA has awarded to SpaceX.
[1830.50 --> 1832.50]  Um...
[1832.50 --> 1834.52]  Cool.
[1835.18 --> 1835.66]  Nice.
[1836.18 --> 1836.94]  Uh, well, okay.
[1837.06 --> 1838.54]  This one's also from The Verge.
[1839.28 --> 1839.88]  Here we go.
[1840.32 --> 1841.64]  Samsung is adding new
[1841.64 --> 1843.10]  obtrusive ads
[1843.10 --> 1844.82]  to your old smart TV.
[1845.00 --> 1846.54]  Apparently, they feel
[1846.54 --> 1848.06]  they did not make enough money
[1848.06 --> 1848.88]  on that TV
[1848.88 --> 1850.04]  the first time
[1850.04 --> 1850.94]  they sold it to you.
[1851.12 --> 1852.32]  So, now they need
[1852.32 --> 1853.28]  to put some ads on it.
[1853.28 --> 1854.68]  So, this was like
[1854.68 --> 1857.20]  top of Reddit
[1857.20 --> 1858.14]  and all this kind of stuff
[1858.14 --> 1860.12]  and the Reddit thread's name
[1860.12 --> 1860.66]  was like
[1860.66 --> 1862.08]  right when your
[1862.08 --> 1863.86]  return policy ends
[1863.86 --> 1864.60]  they start
[1864.60 --> 1865.90]  giving you ads
[1865.90 --> 1866.72]  and all this kind of stuff.
[1867.40 --> 1868.50]  And, uh,
[1868.50 --> 1869.16]  they don't seem
[1869.16 --> 1870.12]  completely wrong.
[1871.24 --> 1872.50]  Which is pretty brutal.
[1873.04 --> 1874.24]  I have zero interest
[1874.24 --> 1874.96]  in a smart TV
[1874.96 --> 1875.58]  at all.
[1875.72 --> 1876.68]  One, I don't watch TV.
[1877.06 --> 1877.28]  So,
[1877.74 --> 1879.10]  slow clap for that one.
[1879.20 --> 1879.50]  But then,
[1879.60 --> 1880.54]  if I was going
[1880.54 --> 1881.20]  to watch something
[1881.20 --> 1881.80]  like Netflix
[1881.80 --> 1882.34]  or whatever,
[1882.66 --> 1883.78]  I would do it
[1883.78 --> 1884.70]  through a Chromecast
[1884.70 --> 1885.42]  because it would be
[1885.42 --> 1886.28]  a better and easier
[1886.28 --> 1887.24]  experience anyways.
[1887.64 --> 1888.44]  You know what?
[1888.48 --> 1889.18]  The Netflix app
[1889.18 --> 1890.78]  on my smart TV
[1890.78 --> 1891.96]  is actually very good.
[1892.20 --> 1893.22]  Is it literally easier
[1893.22 --> 1893.68]  than like
[1893.68 --> 1894.92]  while you're sitting down
[1894.92 --> 1895.90]  just saying
[1895.90 --> 1896.68]  what you want to watch
[1896.68 --> 1897.90]  and then it just happens?
[1898.68 --> 1899.04]  Um,
[1899.66 --> 1900.60]  it has an air mouse
[1900.60 --> 1901.64]  so that's really nice.
[1902.60 --> 1902.98]  Because like,
[1903.06 --> 1903.50]  I don't,
[1903.60 --> 1903.92]  okay,
[1904.00 --> 1904.72]  I haven't decided
[1904.72 --> 1905.48]  what I'm going to watch
[1905.48 --> 1906.28]  before I sit down.
[1906.58 --> 1906.84]  Oh.
[1906.98 --> 1907.56]  Like, I browse.
[1907.94 --> 1908.54]  Oh, I don't.
[1908.74 --> 1908.96]  Yeah.
[1909.10 --> 1909.74]  And I have like
[1909.74 --> 1910.26]  children.
[1910.48 --> 1911.06]  So, there's like
[1911.06 --> 1911.54]  debate.
[1912.30 --> 1912.74]  Oh.
[1915.34 --> 1916.10]  These things
[1916.10 --> 1917.18]  that I don't experience.
[1917.54 --> 1918.56]  That makes sense.
[1918.66 --> 1918.86]  Yeah.
[1919.38 --> 1920.00]  So like.
[1920.18 --> 1920.60]  And there's like
[1920.60 --> 1921.34]  research to see
[1921.34 --> 1921.82]  if it's actually
[1921.82 --> 1922.76]  okay to watch maybe.
[1923.38 --> 1923.78]  Um,
[1924.18 --> 1924.58]  yeah,
[1924.66 --> 1925.22]  sometimes.
[1925.60 --> 1925.78]  Although.
[1926.06 --> 1926.54]  I guess you probably
[1926.54 --> 1926.96]  already know.
[1927.06 --> 1927.80]  I could do that
[1927.80 --> 1928.46]  on my phone
[1928.46 --> 1930.62]  while we're like
[1930.62 --> 1931.58]  looking at things.
[1931.78 --> 1932.54]  We also have
[1932.54 --> 1932.84]  four,
[1933.02 --> 1934.10]  five now people
[1934.10 --> 1934.68]  sitting down
[1934.68 --> 1935.34]  in front of the TV
[1935.34 --> 1935.82]  at one time.
[1935.82 --> 1936.60]  That's so many people.
[1936.68 --> 1937.58]  So like one of them
[1937.58 --> 1938.20]  could be,
[1938.20 --> 1938.92]  could be checking
[1938.92 --> 1939.66]  rotten tomatoes
[1939.66 --> 1940.54]  while the other
[1940.54 --> 1941.04]  one of them
[1941.04 --> 1941.40]  is like,
[1941.44 --> 1941.52]  oh,
[1941.56 --> 1942.28]  what about this one?
[1942.32 --> 1942.54]  Why don't you
[1942.54 --> 1943.22]  check this one?
[1943.46 --> 1944.18]  Are you going to have to move?
[1944.28 --> 1945.00]  Could be a collaborative.
[1945.80 --> 1946.16]  Maybe.
[1948.60 --> 1949.50]  I don't want to talk about it.
[1949.50 --> 1950.56]  Could you guys think about that?
[1951.68 --> 1952.08]  So,
[1952.44 --> 1952.78]  okay.
[1953.18 --> 1954.30]  We've thought about it,
[1954.36 --> 1955.56]  but we've both come
[1955.56 --> 1956.96]  to very different conclusions.
[1956.96 --> 1958.28]  So,
[1958.28 --> 1959.58]  we have both come
[1959.58 --> 1960.32]  to the conclusion
[1960.32 --> 1961.16]  that we,
[1961.26 --> 1962.08]  I never thought about this.
[1962.10 --> 1963.26]  That we don't have to move.
[1964.36 --> 1964.84]  However,
[1965.04 --> 1965.98]  we have arrived
[1965.98 --> 1966.86]  at that conclusion
[1966.86 --> 1968.58]  in two very unique
[1968.58 --> 1969.40]  and different ways.
[1970.82 --> 1971.26]  Okay.
[1971.48 --> 1972.34]  Would you like to hear
[1972.34 --> 1973.02]  my conclusion
[1973.02 --> 1974.38]  or Yvonne's conclusion first?
[1974.38 --> 1974.50]  Both,
[1974.64 --> 1975.42]  but yours first.
[1975.48 --> 1975.74]  Okay,
[1975.82 --> 1976.72]  so my conclusion
[1976.72 --> 1978.04]  is that
[1978.04 --> 1979.58]  the two kid,
[1979.66 --> 1981.06]  the two same-sex kids
[1981.06 --> 1982.58]  can share a room
[1982.58 --> 1983.28]  forever,
[1983.28 --> 1984.84]  which will encourage them
[1984.84 --> 1985.96]  to move out sooner.
[1985.96 --> 1987.16]  Okay.
[1988.82 --> 1989.30]  Okay.
[1989.76 --> 1990.52]  That sounds,
[1990.96 --> 1991.26]  yeah,
[1991.36 --> 1991.64]  okay.
[1992.24 --> 1993.48]  Yvonne's theory
[1993.48 --> 1994.56]  is that
[1994.56 --> 1996.02]  I am not going to have
[1996.02 --> 1997.38]  an office upstairs anymore
[1997.38 --> 1998.72]  and I'm not going to have
[1998.72 --> 1999.52]  a server room
[1999.52 --> 2000.68]  adjoining said office
[2000.68 --> 2002.78]  and my world's most
[2002.78 --> 2003.86]  comfortable gaming setup,
[2004.04 --> 2005.28]  which is over on the other side
[2005.28 --> 2006.12]  of said office,
[2006.28 --> 2007.98]  will no longer be accessible to me
[2007.98 --> 2009.46]  because that will be the room
[2009.46 --> 2010.44]  that the kids will share
[2010.44 --> 2012.06]  and I will be stuck
[2012.06 --> 2013.30]  with one of those bedrooms
[2013.30 --> 2014.96]  for me and her
[2014.96 --> 2015.94]  to have our computers
[2015.94 --> 2016.28]  setups
[2016.28 --> 2017.18]  and for me to have
[2017.18 --> 2018.28]  all of my server crap,
[2018.46 --> 2020.36]  which clearly is stupid.
[2021.50 --> 2022.48]  That is stupid.
[2022.60 --> 2022.88]  Also,
[2023.00 --> 2024.26]  Windows is forced restarting
[2024.26 --> 2024.80]  my computer.
[2025.26 --> 2025.92]  Right now.
[2025.96 --> 2027.02]  While I'm live on a show.
[2027.18 --> 2028.46]  There's no delay option.
[2029.74 --> 2030.26]  Jeez.
[2030.86 --> 2031.14]  Yep.
[2031.14 --> 2032.60]  Man,
[2032.64 --> 2033.78]  I don't want Windows 10 anymore.
[2033.86 --> 2034.24]  Anyways,
[2034.52 --> 2034.94]  that's,
[2035.02 --> 2035.40]  that's,
[2036.14 --> 2036.56]  wow.
[2036.82 --> 2037.06]  Yeah.
[2037.20 --> 2038.14]  Are you actually going to lose
[2038.14 --> 2038.64]  all your stuff?
[2038.74 --> 2039.50]  Another option
[2039.50 --> 2041.36]  would be to give up
[2041.36 --> 2043.12]  all three of the rooms upstairs
[2043.12 --> 2043.80]  and they could all have
[2043.80 --> 2044.44]  their own rooms,
[2044.54 --> 2044.76]  but,
[2044.76 --> 2046.26]  I don't know.
[2046.26 --> 2048.00]  I guess it depends on how mad
[2048.00 --> 2048.74]  the teenage
[2048.74 --> 2051.44]  eating,
[2051.74 --> 2052.56]  pooping machines
[2052.56 --> 2054.20]  are
[2054.20 --> 2054.86]  and how,
[2054.92 --> 2056.06]  how forcefully that,
[2056.16 --> 2057.08]  how hopefully they never
[2057.08 --> 2057.70]  find this show
[2057.70 --> 2058.34]  where I even say
[2058.34 --> 2059.06]  I'm considering it
[2059.06 --> 2060.14]  because if they ask me,
[2060.36 --> 2060.88]  I'm going to be like,
[2061.06 --> 2061.32]  nope,
[2061.48 --> 2062.28]  because these two rooms
[2062.28 --> 2062.98]  are kid rooms.
[2063.10 --> 2064.42]  You divide up the space
[2064.42 --> 2064.88]  in them as,
[2065.00 --> 2065.94]  as you see fit.
[2065.94 --> 2066.74]  But like,
[2066.82 --> 2067.62]  once they're older,
[2067.72 --> 2068.98]  those rooms aren't that big.
[2069.08 --> 2069.26]  No,
[2069.34 --> 2069.80]  they're not.
[2070.12 --> 2071.02]  Like at all.
[2071.34 --> 2071.54]  No,
[2071.62 --> 2072.06]  they're really not.
[2072.30 --> 2073.96]  Our house in general
[2073.96 --> 2075.82]  has a storage space issue.
[2076.12 --> 2076.34]  Yeah.
[2076.50 --> 2077.54]  Like in the downstairs,
[2078.24 --> 2078.80]  think about it.
[2078.82 --> 2078.98]  Yeah,
[2079.06 --> 2079.20]  no,
[2079.20 --> 2079.94]  there's the pantry
[2079.94 --> 2081.28]  off the kitchen
[2081.28 --> 2082.08]  in the back room.
[2082.36 --> 2083.48]  Which is not huge.
[2083.50 --> 2083.84]  Which is like,
[2083.84 --> 2084.94]  not even big enough
[2084.94 --> 2086.00]  for all the food,
[2086.26 --> 2086.76]  for all the people
[2086.76 --> 2087.34]  that need to live
[2087.34 --> 2087.96]  in that house,
[2088.06 --> 2088.32]  really.
[2089.02 --> 2089.94]  Part of the problem
[2089.94 --> 2091.06]  is that the kitchen layout
[2091.06 --> 2092.58]  was redone by the previous owners
[2092.58 --> 2093.30]  who were dinks.
[2094.26 --> 2094.66]  So,
[2094.90 --> 2095.68]  so there's like,
[2095.68 --> 2095.94]  Oh,
[2095.98 --> 2096.54]  that kitchen layout
[2096.54 --> 2097.36]  totally makes sense.
[2097.46 --> 2097.88]  There's like,
[2098.02 --> 2099.06]  a lot of room
[2099.06 --> 2100.22]  for wine glasses.
[2101.02 --> 2102.04]  And there's like,
[2102.82 --> 2103.88]  not a lot of room
[2103.88 --> 2105.14]  for cooking supplies.
[2108.26 --> 2108.70]  Yeah.
[2109.22 --> 2110.16]  So there's that.
[2110.54 --> 2111.26]  So then downstairs,
[2111.70 --> 2112.82]  we also have that
[2112.82 --> 2114.30]  one tiny hall closet
[2114.30 --> 2115.36]  next to the laundry room.
[2115.48 --> 2116.54]  And that's it.
[2116.92 --> 2117.14]  Yeah.
[2117.18 --> 2117.92]  And that has like,
[2118.12 --> 2119.50]  winter coats and shoes in it.
[2119.58 --> 2119.78]  Yeah.
[2119.78 --> 2121.08]  And it's already completely full.
[2121.14 --> 2121.64]  It has like,
[2121.72 --> 2122.88]  the built-in vacuum hose.
[2123.12 --> 2123.34]  Like,
[2123.40 --> 2124.12]  it's full.
[2125.12 --> 2125.56]  Upstairs,
[2125.72 --> 2126.78]  there's two small closets
[2126.78 --> 2127.36]  in the bedrooms.
[2127.74 --> 2128.62]  The walk-in closet,
[2128.84 --> 2129.10]  again,
[2129.20 --> 2130.38]  this was a remodeling choice
[2130.38 --> 2131.42]  made by the previous owners.
[2131.70 --> 2133.12]  The walk-in closet
[2133.12 --> 2135.04]  was torn out
[2135.04 --> 2136.14]  to make room
[2136.14 --> 2138.08]  for a gigantic bathroom
[2138.08 --> 2139.68]  with two sinks.
[2140.02 --> 2140.96]  It's pretty nice.
[2140.96 --> 2142.82]  A two-person standing shower
[2142.82 --> 2144.70]  and a really nice bathtub
[2144.70 --> 2145.46]  with like,
[2145.54 --> 2146.90]  tile on all sides
[2146.90 --> 2147.66]  and it's like,
[2147.70 --> 2148.40]  awesome and everything.
[2148.86 --> 2149.46]  It's really nice.
[2149.50 --> 2150.16]  But it means that
[2150.16 --> 2151.04]  you take up a lot of the space
[2151.04 --> 2151.58]  in that room
[2151.58 --> 2152.20]  with just like,
[2152.28 --> 2153.28]  wardrobes and stuff
[2153.28 --> 2154.02]  because there's no closet anymore.
[2154.02 --> 2154.82]  I'm pretty sure your bathroom
[2154.82 --> 2155.50]  is bigger than
[2155.50 --> 2156.80]  one of the kids' rooms will be.
[2159.18 --> 2159.58]  So,
[2159.80 --> 2160.30]  so anyway,
[2160.62 --> 2161.54]  that was it
[2161.54 --> 2162.72]  until we put the,
[2162.76 --> 2164.74]  the ladder up to the attic.
[2165.00 --> 2165.18]  Yeah.
[2165.18 --> 2165.94]  And then we got a little bit
[2165.94 --> 2166.70]  of space up there.
[2166.76 --> 2166.94]  Yeah.
[2167.02 --> 2167.68]  But other than that,
[2167.78 --> 2168.72]  there was nothing.
[2168.82 --> 2169.10]  There was no,
[2169.20 --> 2169.90]  well,
[2170.48 --> 2171.04]  and it doesn't help
[2171.04 --> 2171.72]  that I turned those
[2171.72 --> 2172.48]  two little closets
[2172.48 --> 2173.10]  in the office
[2173.10 --> 2174.96]  into a server room
[2174.96 --> 2176.06]  and world's most
[2176.06 --> 2177.02]  comfortable gaming setup.
[2177.50 --> 2179.00]  So I have contributed
[2179.00 --> 2180.20]  to my own problem here.
[2180.30 --> 2180.52]  Yes.
[2180.60 --> 2181.10]  This is a thing
[2181.10 --> 2181.76]  that I acknowledge.
[2181.88 --> 2182.06]  Yeah.
[2182.74 --> 2184.24]  I really don't want to move,
[2184.40 --> 2185.54]  but I have actually,
[2185.72 --> 2186.38]  and I don't think
[2186.38 --> 2187.26]  Yvonne wants to move either.
[2187.26 --> 2187.92]  It's really funny
[2187.92 --> 2188.54]  you're bringing this up
[2188.54 --> 2189.56]  because I have legitimately
[2189.56 --> 2190.52]  looked into
[2190.52 --> 2191.70]  what it would cost
[2191.70 --> 2193.30]  to jack up the house
[2193.30 --> 2194.50]  and put a basement under it
[2194.50 --> 2196.38]  and it is not trivial.
[2196.38 --> 2196.86]  No.
[2197.70 --> 2198.00]  No.
[2198.14 --> 2199.46]  Those are really expensive.
[2199.66 --> 2200.20]  It can be done.
[2200.72 --> 2201.08]  But like,
[2201.18 --> 2201.78]  even aside.
[2201.78 --> 2202.78]  That would be sweet though.
[2202.84 --> 2204.14]  Even aside from the
[2204.14 --> 2205.70]  like deep into six figures
[2205.70 --> 2207.26]  that that's going to cost,
[2207.46 --> 2207.94]  like it would be
[2207.94 --> 2209.06]  an additional mortgage item.
[2209.20 --> 2209.92]  It wouldn't be like
[2209.92 --> 2210.80]  write a check item.
[2211.06 --> 2211.26]  Yeah.
[2211.48 --> 2212.82]  In addition to that,
[2213.32 --> 2214.52]  when they pick it up
[2214.52 --> 2215.90]  and when they put it back down.
[2215.90 --> 2216.66]  Structural issues.
[2217.20 --> 2218.78]  Not so much structural issues.
[2218.96 --> 2219.86]  They're pretty good at it.
[2219.98 --> 2220.18]  Okay.
[2220.18 --> 2221.36]  But all your drywall cracks.
[2222.16 --> 2222.28]  Well,
[2222.42 --> 2223.90]  okay.
[2223.90 --> 2224.66]  Okay.
[2224.80 --> 2225.42]  I didn't mean
[2225.42 --> 2226.94]  like structural integrity.
[2227.14 --> 2227.48]  I meant like.
[2227.52 --> 2227.66]  Yeah.
[2227.86 --> 2228.10]  Yeah.
[2228.22 --> 2228.98]  Structural integrity
[2228.98 --> 2229.92]  should be okay.
[2230.02 --> 2230.26]  Yeah.
[2230.38 --> 2231.48]  But like you basically
[2231.48 --> 2232.30]  have to re-drywall
[2232.30 --> 2233.18]  your entire house
[2233.18 --> 2235.78]  and like probably re-floor it.
[2236.02 --> 2237.72]  Like you basically
[2237.72 --> 2239.14]  don't do that.
[2239.38 --> 2240.28]  There's like a
[2240.28 --> 2241.66]  very compelling reason.
[2241.66 --> 2243.74]  But even if we were like,
[2243.84 --> 2244.28]  okay,
[2244.96 --> 2246.96]  let's move to the Philippines
[2246.96 --> 2248.72]  for six months
[2248.72 --> 2251.56]  and just tear it down
[2251.56 --> 2253.38]  and build something else entirely.
[2253.70 --> 2254.64]  Because like by the time
[2254.64 --> 2254.98]  you're spending,
[2255.10 --> 2256.16]  by the time you're re-mortgaging
[2256.16 --> 2257.24]  and spending that much money,
[2258.38 --> 2259.46]  screw it.
[2259.50 --> 2260.26]  Let's go on holiday
[2260.26 --> 2261.10]  for half a year
[2261.10 --> 2261.90]  while they rebuild
[2261.90 --> 2263.02]  a new house on the property
[2263.02 --> 2264.42]  or something stupid like that.
[2264.66 --> 2265.20]  I don't even know
[2265.20 --> 2266.54]  if we'd be able to do that
[2266.54 --> 2268.36]  because that whole area
[2268.36 --> 2269.68]  is like a planned neighborhood.
[2269.68 --> 2271.00]  And there's going to be
[2271.00 --> 2272.00]  all those bylaws
[2272.00 --> 2273.74]  about what color your house can be
[2273.74 --> 2275.56]  and what the facing looks like
[2275.56 --> 2277.02]  and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2277.82 --> 2278.98]  I might have to move.
[2279.10 --> 2280.18]  I would hate to move.
[2280.32 --> 2282.16]  I love where I live.
[2282.26 --> 2283.40]  You should have had less kids.
[2285.20 --> 2286.26]  Because there's going to be
[2286.26 --> 2287.36]  a big conflict there.
[2288.38 --> 2289.42]  You know it too.
[2290.12 --> 2291.50]  Or you're going to completely lose.
[2291.50 --> 2292.30]  You know this to be true.
[2292.38 --> 2292.74]  You do.
[2292.88 --> 2293.72]  Or you're going to completely
[2293.72 --> 2294.60]  lose your office.
[2295.14 --> 2297.10]  And if you completely lose your office,
[2297.30 --> 2298.62]  that room will be
[2298.62 --> 2300.44]  far cooler
[2300.44 --> 2301.68]  than all the other ones.
[2302.44 --> 2303.72]  Front facing window.
[2304.20 --> 2305.38]  Two little side rooms
[2305.38 --> 2306.74]  that are like sick.
[2307.08 --> 2308.92]  And a bigger area by itself.
[2310.36 --> 2311.92]  So which kid gets that?
[2312.06 --> 2312.72]  That's going to create
[2312.72 --> 2313.92]  a huge conflict.
[2314.06 --> 2314.48]  First born.
[2315.30 --> 2315.74]  Birthright.
[2315.92 --> 2316.68]  That's pretty much
[2316.68 --> 2317.42]  the only way to do it.
[2317.50 --> 2318.36]  That's still going to create it.
[2318.70 --> 2319.10]  Probably.
[2319.38 --> 2320.24]  But that's still going to create
[2320.24 --> 2320.26]  a huge issue.
[2320.26 --> 2321.42]  I mean that was honestly,
[2321.66 --> 2322.62]  what I'll tell you though
[2322.62 --> 2324.84]  is in our house growing up,
[2325.04 --> 2325.98]  that was how it worked.
[2325.98 --> 2328.50]  So my older sister
[2328.50 --> 2330.00]  got the first crack
[2330.00 --> 2330.86]  at the basement.
[2331.52 --> 2332.86]  So the way it worked
[2332.86 --> 2333.60]  was our basement.
[2333.70 --> 2334.22]  So you like,
[2334.30 --> 2335.46]  you cue through essentially?
[2335.82 --> 2336.68]  Was amazing.
[2336.96 --> 2337.22]  Okay.
[2337.56 --> 2338.16]  So you went,
[2338.24 --> 2339.28]  it was set up as a suite.
[2339.94 --> 2341.56]  So you went down the stairs
[2341.56 --> 2342.16]  and there was like
[2342.16 --> 2343.00]  a shared laundry room.
[2343.08 --> 2343.30]  Yeah.
[2343.36 --> 2344.56]  Which is like an amazing way
[2344.56 --> 2345.78]  for a suite to work by the way.
[2346.46 --> 2347.34]  And then there was
[2347.34 --> 2348.06]  a second door,
[2348.18 --> 2350.08]  like kind of an airlock style thing.
[2350.16 --> 2351.06]  So this laundry room
[2351.06 --> 2352.34]  and then there was another door.
[2352.42 --> 2353.02]  That's how I had,
[2353.12 --> 2354.46]  that's how most of the places
[2354.46 --> 2355.38]  that I've...
[2355.38 --> 2356.44]  So that opened up
[2356.44 --> 2357.74]  into a really big
[2357.74 --> 2360.06]  kind of like living room den area.
[2360.20 --> 2361.02]  And then there was
[2361.02 --> 2361.84]  a small hallway
[2361.84 --> 2364.64]  to a gigantic dining room
[2364.64 --> 2365.22]  that had like a,
[2365.26 --> 2365.44]  it was,
[2365.52 --> 2366.22]  even though it was a basement,
[2366.58 --> 2367.18]  the way my parents,
[2367.24 --> 2368.26]  they built the house themselves.
[2368.44 --> 2369.12]  The way they did it
[2369.12 --> 2369.98]  was really smart
[2369.98 --> 2370.58]  in certain ways.
[2371.08 --> 2371.76]  Not in others.
[2372.08 --> 2373.96]  So they actually lifted the,
[2374.06 --> 2376.38]  they lifted the basement up a bit
[2376.38 --> 2377.92]  so that it made the house
[2377.92 --> 2378.64]  really tall,
[2378.64 --> 2380.38]  but there were no building restrictions
[2380.38 --> 2381.44]  in the middle of like
[2381.44 --> 2382.42]  butt hump nowhere
[2382.42 --> 2383.42]  and Maple Ridge anyway.
[2383.64 --> 2384.62]  So who was going to care?
[2385.06 --> 2386.00]  But they lifted it up
[2386.00 --> 2387.34]  about three feet,
[2387.58 --> 2388.36]  three and a half feet
[2388.36 --> 2389.20]  above the ground
[2389.20 --> 2390.10]  so you could have windows
[2390.10 --> 2390.56]  in the basement.
[2390.74 --> 2390.86]  Yeah.
[2391.06 --> 2392.40]  So in the dining room
[2392.40 --> 2392.72]  in the,
[2392.78 --> 2393.80]  in the downstairs kitchen,
[2393.80 --> 2395.62]  you actually had like bay windows,
[2396.08 --> 2397.10]  which was like super nice
[2397.10 --> 2398.22]  looking out into kind of like
[2398.22 --> 2399.66]  the sky backyard area.
[2399.80 --> 2400.64]  So then there was a kitchen
[2400.64 --> 2401.74]  and then there was
[2401.74 --> 2402.42]  a single bedroom
[2402.42 --> 2403.00]  with a bathroom.
[2404.10 --> 2405.34]  And the idea was kind of,
[2405.38 --> 2406.04]  you could have like
[2406.04 --> 2406.90]  kind of a master bedroom
[2406.90 --> 2407.54]  and then you could have
[2407.54 --> 2408.54]  like a sleep space outside
[2408.54 --> 2409.74]  or whatever the case may be.
[2409.74 --> 2411.36]  So anyway,
[2411.76 --> 2412.62]  she had a shot
[2412.62 --> 2413.48]  at that bedroom
[2413.48 --> 2414.76]  and the outside den
[2414.76 --> 2415.74]  was like a playroom
[2415.74 --> 2416.92]  TV watching area
[2416.92 --> 2417.94]  and then you had
[2417.94 --> 2418.80]  your own kitchen,
[2419.34 --> 2420.02]  fully functional.
[2420.28 --> 2421.22]  It always worked.
[2422.00 --> 2423.64]  And she took the attic.
[2425.16 --> 2426.34]  She took the attic.
[2426.34 --> 2426.56]  Right,
[2426.62 --> 2427.56]  because you had the basement,
[2427.70 --> 2427.96]  didn't you?
[2427.98 --> 2428.92]  She took the attic.
[2429.88 --> 2430.08]  So,
[2430.48 --> 2430.88]  okay,
[2430.98 --> 2431.82]  in her defense,
[2432.16 --> 2433.34]  the attic was bigger
[2433.34 --> 2434.92]  because it was
[2434.92 --> 2436.28]  an entire story
[2436.28 --> 2437.62]  of the house.
[2437.62 --> 2439.08]  then again,
[2439.66 --> 2440.60]  so was the basement.
[2441.04 --> 2441.38]  Yeah.
[2441.84 --> 2443.66]  But like the roof sloped.
[2445.34 --> 2446.58]  But it had like
[2446.58 --> 2447.48]  pulled down like
[2447.48 --> 2449.02]  ladder style stairs
[2449.02 --> 2450.20]  to get in and out of it.
[2450.80 --> 2451.24]  And,
[2451.34 --> 2452.22]  like it's like
[2452.22 --> 2453.84]  she wasn't thinking at all.
[2454.34 --> 2456.76]  And to get into your bedroom,
[2457.00 --> 2458.06]  if you're out late,
[2458.34 --> 2459.60]  you had to walk past
[2459.60 --> 2461.02]  my parents' bedroom.
[2462.04 --> 2463.06]  What an idiot.
[2463.06 --> 2466.98]  I had my own entrance.
[2469.24 --> 2470.34]  What a tool.
[2470.96 --> 2471.76]  So anyway,
[2472.28 --> 2473.04]  we did it
[2473.04 --> 2474.12]  on the birthright system.
[2474.34 --> 2474.62]  Okay.
[2474.72 --> 2475.90]  So when I moved out,
[2476.08 --> 2476.76]  someone else,
[2476.86 --> 2477.54]  the next one down
[2477.54 --> 2478.08]  was eligible
[2478.08 --> 2479.58]  for the basement bedroom.
[2479.72 --> 2479.90]  Yeah.
[2480.34 --> 2480.78]  But,
[2480.86 --> 2482.94]  everyone accepted it.
[2483.52 --> 2484.12]  So we'll see.
[2484.64 --> 2485.02]  We'll see.
[2485.28 --> 2486.66]  I especially accepted it.
[2486.66 --> 2487.30]  I was thrilled.
[2487.40 --> 2488.12]  So you don't get an office.
[2489.06 --> 2490.60]  I don't want to talk about that.
[2490.82 --> 2491.74]  Because like everything's
[2491.74 --> 2492.32]  too expensive.
[2492.72 --> 2493.24]  Or server room.
[2493.24 --> 2494.00]  Like moving,
[2494.72 --> 2495.14]  honestly,
[2495.42 --> 2496.72]  moving will be too expensive.
[2496.90 --> 2497.74]  Where would you put your server?
[2499.96 --> 2501.38]  I could put it in the garage,
[2501.48 --> 2502.94]  but I'd have to rewire everything.
[2503.98 --> 2504.32]  And then,
[2504.50 --> 2504.84]  honestly,
[2505.00 --> 2506.24]  with Corning's Thunderbolt cables,
[2506.34 --> 2507.62]  I could even move all the systems
[2507.62 --> 2508.48]  to the garage still.
[2508.74 --> 2510.66]  I have thought about this a fair bit.
[2511.10 --> 2511.66]  I could see.
[2511.66 --> 2512.58]  I knew you would have thought about it.
[2512.58 --> 2513.62]  That's why I'm pushing the topic.
[2513.84 --> 2514.64]  So what I was thinking
[2514.64 --> 2515.46]  is I would,
[2515.60 --> 2517.08]  off of the studs in the garage
[2517.08 --> 2518.70]  to keep them away from the cars,
[2518.86 --> 2520.08]  like kind of like tire storage,
[2520.56 --> 2521.66]  is I would build out
[2521.66 --> 2522.26]  You could make...
[2522.26 --> 2523.26]  like a cabinet,
[2523.58 --> 2524.80]  like a rack style thing.
[2524.80 --> 2525.34]  Yeah, yeah, okay.
[2525.42 --> 2526.84]  And I would still rack mount everything.
[2527.12 --> 2528.40]  And then if I had it in the garage,
[2528.50 --> 2530.50]  the garage actually does stay relatively cool,
[2530.60 --> 2531.32]  even in the summer.
[2532.58 --> 2534.72]  Because it's not right up against the roof.
[2535.30 --> 2535.70]  So,
[2536.04 --> 2536.36]  yes,
[2536.38 --> 2537.60]  I have given some thought to it.
[2537.70 --> 2537.88]  But,
[2538.04 --> 2538.26]  yes,
[2538.26 --> 2540.18]  I will be highly resistant to it anyway.
[2540.18 --> 2540.58]  But,
[2540.64 --> 2540.70]  yeah,
[2540.78 --> 2542.20]  moving is basically impossible.
[2542.54 --> 2543.66]  That's why I've like
[2543.66 --> 2545.68]  casually looked into...
[2545.68 --> 2546.36]  every one...
[2546.36 --> 2546.74]  every like,
[2546.74 --> 2547.70]  probably six months,
[2547.96 --> 2548.44]  I go like,
[2548.50 --> 2549.18]  what would it take
[2549.18 --> 2551.12]  for me to get my own place?
[2551.26 --> 2551.72]  And then I'm like,
[2551.82 --> 2552.20]  oh yeah,
[2552.80 --> 2553.40]  I live in BC.
[2554.30 --> 2554.52]  Yep.
[2554.78 --> 2555.10]  Okay.
[2555.18 --> 2557.08]  Especially the Vancouver part of BC.
[2557.58 --> 2558.82]  And the problem is that
[2558.82 --> 2560.96]  even if I were to look at a new place,
[2561.08 --> 2561.26]  like,
[2561.40 --> 2561.62]  so,
[2562.00 --> 2562.58]  you know what,
[2562.60 --> 2563.76]  there's really no point hiding this.
[2563.80 --> 2564.42]  It's not like,
[2564.48 --> 2565.82]  it's not like no one can look it up.
[2565.96 --> 2566.14]  So,
[2566.56 --> 2568.68]  places in the area that I live
[2568.68 --> 2570.70]  go for like a million dollars now.
[2571.74 --> 2572.40]  A mere,
[2573.02 --> 2573.58]  what was it,
[2573.58 --> 2575.20]  six years ago,
[2575.74 --> 2576.34]  that number
[2576.34 --> 2578.38]  was a little over half of that.
[2580.84 --> 2581.24]  So,
[2581.74 --> 2582.02]  okay,
[2582.14 --> 2583.18]  so that's problem number one.
[2583.46 --> 2583.62]  So,
[2583.70 --> 2585.42]  so if I wanted to upgrade...
[2585.42 --> 2585.44]  So,
[2585.50 --> 2585.76]  like,
[2586.04 --> 2587.64]  good luck trying to catch up to that.
[2587.84 --> 2587.96]  Yes.
[2587.96 --> 2588.52]  You'd have to save
[2588.52 --> 2591.20]  500 something-ish grand.
[2591.62 --> 2592.42]  And theoretically,
[2592.42 --> 2592.84]  I,
[2592.84 --> 2593.90]  I sell my place
[2593.90 --> 2594.16]  and I,
[2594.16 --> 2595.34]  and I make up a lot of that money.
[2595.48 --> 2597.28]  But that only buys me a place
[2597.28 --> 2598.68]  in the place where I am.
[2598.68 --> 2599.48]  So,
[2599.48 --> 2601.44]  if I'm trying to upgrade
[2601.44 --> 2602.76]  to something bigger...
[2602.76 --> 2603.66]  Because you want more rooms.
[2603.76 --> 2604.94]  Because I want more rooms,
[2605.34 --> 2606.88]  then I have to pay
[2606.88 --> 2608.86]  proportionally more.
[2609.24 --> 2609.38]  Like,
[2609.44 --> 2610.04]  it gets,
[2610.12 --> 2611.12]  it gets to the point
[2611.12 --> 2612.06]  where it's more expensive
[2612.06 --> 2613.14]  even to upgrade
[2613.14 --> 2614.12]  unless you're willing
[2614.12 --> 2614.94]  to remortgage.
[2615.02 --> 2615.20]  Which,
[2615.28 --> 2615.86]  quite frankly,
[2616.02 --> 2616.64]  when I'm done
[2616.64 --> 2617.92]  being mortgaged,
[2618.00 --> 2618.18]  I'm,
[2618.18 --> 2618.78]  I'm done.
[2618.92 --> 2619.10]  Like,
[2619.44 --> 2620.48]  I don't want to be,
[2620.48 --> 2620.88]  like,
[2620.98 --> 2622.40]  45 and,
[2622.76 --> 2623.20]  like,
[2623.20 --> 2624.46]  having a new mortgage.
[2624.64 --> 2624.92]  That's,
[2625.06 --> 2625.20]  that,
[2625.20 --> 2627.30]  I get very,
[2627.30 --> 2629.10]  I get very stressed out
[2629.10 --> 2630.00]  about debt.
[2630.10 --> 2630.22]  Yeah,
[2630.26 --> 2630.50]  me too.
[2631.44 --> 2632.66]  I want it to be done
[2632.66 --> 2633.50]  as quickly as possible
[2633.50 --> 2634.30]  and I have no desire
[2634.30 --> 2635.24]  to go back into debt.
[2636.04 --> 2636.80]  Especially because
[2636.80 --> 2637.86]  I've already had
[2637.86 --> 2638.38]  all the stress
[2638.38 --> 2639.04]  that I can handle
[2639.04 --> 2639.66]  with all the debt
[2639.66 --> 2640.46]  that I've had to go into
[2640.46 --> 2641.60]  on the business side of things.
[2641.68 --> 2642.94]  You've heard some of my stress
[2642.94 --> 2643.44]  about debt.
[2643.60 --> 2643.90]  Yes.
[2645.44 --> 2645.84]  So,
[2645.84 --> 2647.22]  so basically,
[2647.52 --> 2647.76]  right,
[2647.86 --> 2648.02]  okay,
[2648.02 --> 2648.98]  so problem number two
[2648.98 --> 2649.86]  is that
[2649.86 --> 2651.34]  anything with a bigger house
[2651.34 --> 2652.96]  is usually newer construction
[2652.96 --> 2654.32]  because that's in vogue now
[2654.32 --> 2656.20]  and any newer construction,
[2656.44 --> 2656.96]  unless you're doing
[2656.96 --> 2657.62]  something custom
[2657.62 --> 2658.20]  or you're buying,
[2658.36 --> 2658.44]  like,
[2658.64 --> 2659.52]  like an estate,
[2659.86 --> 2660.56]  like something on,
[2660.68 --> 2660.76]  like,
[2660.78 --> 2661.72]  an acre or two
[2661.72 --> 2662.48]  with gardens
[2662.48 --> 2663.28]  and waterfalls
[2663.28 --> 2663.82]  and crap
[2663.82 --> 2665.04]  is pretty terrible.
[2665.04 --> 2666.12]  Is on a tiny lot.
[2666.36 --> 2666.82]  That too.
[2667.74 --> 2668.68]  I want,
[2668.90 --> 2670.12]  for the foreseeable future,
[2670.22 --> 2671.52]  my kids or grandkids
[2671.52 --> 2672.88]  to have a yard to play in
[2672.88 --> 2673.64]  and that's something
[2673.64 --> 2674.80]  that's not in fashion anymore.
[2675.02 --> 2675.34]  So,
[2675.40 --> 2676.42]  if you want a bigger house,
[2676.78 --> 2677.42]  you have to have
[2677.42 --> 2678.24]  a smaller lot
[2678.24 --> 2679.26]  unless you're willing
[2679.26 --> 2679.64]  to pay,
[2679.70 --> 2679.88]  like,
[2680.12 --> 2680.76]  way more money
[2680.76 --> 2681.88]  than makes any sense.
[2682.30 --> 2682.66]  So,
[2682.88 --> 2683.88]  I don't want to move.
[2684.80 --> 2685.70]  I don't want to move.
[2686.00 --> 2687.46]  I don't want to jack up my house
[2687.46 --> 2690.00]  and I don't want to give up my office.
[2690.14 --> 2691.00]  Do you want to talk about Floatplane?
[2692.30 --> 2694.04]  We should probably do our sponsor spots first,
[2694.10 --> 2694.22]  though.
[2694.30 --> 2694.52]  Funny,
[2694.62 --> 2695.20]  funny thing.
[2695.38 --> 2697.40]  We have 6,400 viewers right now,
[2697.48 --> 2698.32]  which is about as many,
[2698.42 --> 2699.02]  if not more,
[2699.36 --> 2701.30]  as when we actually talk about technology.
[2701.72 --> 2701.88]  Yeah.
[2702.34 --> 2703.10]  This was the,
[2703.16 --> 2703.34]  like,
[2703.52 --> 2705.02]  Linus is trying to make up for topics
[2705.02 --> 2706.38]  so he's going to talk very quickly
[2706.38 --> 2707.34]  and constantly show.
[2708.86 --> 2709.70]  I'm really good at it.
[2709.70 --> 2710.82]  It's worked really well.
[2711.06 --> 2711.84]  I'm not complaining.
[2712.44 --> 2713.16]  I'm just observing.
[2713.16 --> 2713.42]  Well,
[2713.46 --> 2713.86]  you know what?
[2713.90 --> 2714.22]  I mean,
[2714.24 --> 2715.20]  it's been a long time
[2715.20 --> 2716.66]  since we've done a show like this
[2716.66 --> 2717.42]  where it's just,
[2717.56 --> 2717.76]  like,
[2717.82 --> 2718.90]  kind of life updates
[2718.90 --> 2720.10]  and that kind of stuff.
[2720.18 --> 2721.14]  But this is sort of
[2721.14 --> 2722.88]  the show
[2722.88 --> 2724.16]  that I sort of pitched
[2724.16 --> 2725.00]  the other day.
[2725.16 --> 2725.44]  Yeah.
[2725.58 --> 2725.72]  The,
[2725.78 --> 2725.92]  like,
[2725.98 --> 2726.40]  car talk,
[2726.48 --> 2727.48]  the original car talk
[2727.48 --> 2728.42]  kind of idea thing.
[2728.48 --> 2729.34]  The car talk show.
[2729.50 --> 2729.80]  Yeah.
[2730.16 --> 2731.24]  We don't talk about cars.
[2731.30 --> 2731.76]  Don't worry.
[2731.86 --> 2732.26]  It wouldn't be.
[2732.40 --> 2732.42]  Yeah,
[2732.48 --> 2732.64]  no.
[2732.64 --> 2734.20]  It wouldn't be nearly as bad as that.
[2734.20 --> 2734.52]  Okay,
[2734.60 --> 2735.50]  the idea came from
[2735.50 --> 2736.44]  he would drive me home
[2736.44 --> 2738.06]  because I couldn't afford transport.
[2738.06 --> 2739.68]  You could afford it.
[2739.72 --> 2740.96]  It just took a really long time
[2740.96 --> 2742.50]  and usually wasn't running anymore
[2742.50 --> 2743.82]  by the time we were finished working.
[2744.16 --> 2744.28]  Yeah,
[2744.52 --> 2745.74]  I couldn't afford transport
[2745.74 --> 2746.58]  that I could take.
[2746.62 --> 2747.46]  Whole other issue.
[2747.46 --> 2751.20]  And then we would talk
[2751.20 --> 2751.48]  in the,
[2751.54 --> 2751.68]  like,
[2751.74 --> 2752.84]  actually really long time
[2752.84 --> 2753.36]  that it would take
[2753.36 --> 2754.12]  to get me home.
[2755.16 --> 2757.18]  So that's where the idea came from.
[2758.96 --> 2759.36]  Okay,
[2759.58 --> 2760.28]  iFixit.
[2760.54 --> 2760.70]  Oh,
[2760.74 --> 2761.20]  what's this?
[2761.38 --> 2762.28]  We have new
[2762.28 --> 2764.26]  Essential Electronics Toolkit,
[2764.58 --> 2764.90]  which is,
[2764.90 --> 2765.06]  like,
[2765.10 --> 2766.20]  a chopped down version
[2766.20 --> 2767.88]  and probably a lot cheaper.
[2767.88 --> 2769.80]  The Electronics Repair Starter Kit.
[2769.88 --> 2770.38]  You know what?
[2770.94 --> 2772.82]  Even though this is a sponsor spot,
[2773.50 --> 2774.78]  I'm not going to lie,
[2775.38 --> 2776.68]  I'm going to be pretty critical
[2776.68 --> 2777.84]  if I don't like this thing.
[2778.00 --> 2778.20]  Oh,
[2778.30 --> 2778.50]  dang.
[2778.84 --> 2779.20]  Because
[2779.20 --> 2782.64]  the iFixit ProTech Toolkit
[2782.64 --> 2783.42]  is,
[2783.44 --> 2783.78]  like,
[2784.10 --> 2785.58]  actually amazing
[2785.58 --> 2786.96]  and has saved my butt
[2786.96 --> 2787.94]  a lot of times.
[2788.64 --> 2789.12]  And
[2789.12 --> 2791.34]  I am personally
[2791.34 --> 2792.32]  of the mind
[2792.32 --> 2793.70]  when it comes to tools
[2793.70 --> 2796.24]  that you buy properly once
[2796.24 --> 2798.60]  and you take really good care of them
[2798.60 --> 2800.12]  and you don't lose them
[2800.12 --> 2801.16]  and
[2801.16 --> 2803.48]  that is the way to be
[2803.48 --> 2804.24]  about tools
[2804.24 --> 2805.70]  and they serve you really well
[2805.70 --> 2806.50]  for a long time.
[2806.50 --> 2807.30]  That is why
[2807.30 --> 2809.92]  this screwdriver
[2809.92 --> 2811.42]  has been in my life
[2811.42 --> 2814.48]  for almost 15 years now.
[2815.36 --> 2816.46]  This exact screwdriver.
[2816.74 --> 2817.88]  That's why I invested
[2817.88 --> 2819.68]  in a $100 screwdriver
[2819.68 --> 2820.94]  and that's why
[2820.94 --> 2821.86]  I'm not afraid
[2821.86 --> 2822.94]  to spend the $60
[2822.94 --> 2823.50]  or $70
[2823.50 --> 2824.78]  or whatever it is
[2824.78 --> 2826.74]  for the ProTech Toolkit.
[2828.66 --> 2829.22]  Now,
[2829.48 --> 2830.98]  with that said,
[2831.10 --> 2831.82]  let's have a look
[2831.82 --> 2832.94]  at their value option
[2832.94 --> 2834.82]  and see what we think of it here.
[2834.82 --> 2836.76]  So it's,
[2836.86 --> 2838.50]  one thing I like about it already
[2838.50 --> 2839.46]  is that the kit
[2839.46 --> 2840.24]  is pretty flat
[2840.24 --> 2841.48]  which is a little bit nicer
[2841.48 --> 2842.60]  for sliding into a bag.
[2842.66 --> 2843.18]  The back of it
[2843.18 --> 2843.98]  is totally flat.
[2844.06 --> 2844.56]  The front of it
[2844.56 --> 2845.52]  is a little bit of a thing.
[2845.52 --> 2846.28]  I just mean it's thinner.
[2846.50 --> 2847.12]  Yeah, yeah.
[2847.68 --> 2848.28]  So I like that so far.
[2848.28 --> 2849.02]  It has a magnetic.
[2849.36 --> 2850.26]  I'll take that from you.
[2851.52 --> 2852.50]  You can take this.
[2853.00 --> 2853.68]  I take that?
[2853.90 --> 2854.92]  Yes, because it's,
[2854.96 --> 2855.98]  oh no, yours is actually fine.
[2856.08 --> 2857.08]  Oh no, yeah, mine's good.
[2857.62 --> 2858.70]  I wish I could kind of
[2858.70 --> 2859.52]  show this to you guys.
[2859.76 --> 2860.56]  Do you want to hold them up
[2860.56 --> 2861.40]  while I go through them?
[2862.40 --> 2862.76]  Okay.
[2863.34 --> 2864.46]  So you get one of their
[2864.46 --> 2865.46]  plastic pry tools.
[2865.76 --> 2867.24]  If this was the original
[2867.24 --> 2868.26]  ProTech tool kit,
[2868.34 --> 2869.44]  not the new version.
[2869.74 --> 2870.48]  Oh yeah, you have them.
[2870.92 --> 2871.56]  So you get one of their
[2871.56 --> 2872.18]  little pry tools.
[2872.54 --> 2873.62]  Then I would actually object
[2873.62 --> 2874.66]  pretty strongly to this.
[2875.14 --> 2876.02]  But the new ones
[2876.02 --> 2876.90]  are a lot more durable
[2876.90 --> 2878.24]  and they don't break as often.
[2879.04 --> 2880.40]  These guys are pretty smart though.
[2880.46 --> 2881.00]  You push here
[2881.00 --> 2881.76]  and it pops up.
[2882.70 --> 2882.90]  I like that.
[2882.90 --> 2883.78]  I think it's the bottom
[2883.78 --> 2884.68]  for all of them
[2884.68 --> 2885.50]  which is kind of cool.
[2886.50 --> 2888.32]  You get one pair of tweezers
[2888.32 --> 2889.60]  and I'll give them credit.
[2889.88 --> 2890.76]  This is the only pair
[2890.76 --> 2891.34]  that I use.
[2891.94 --> 2894.54]  The angled sharp nose ones.
[2894.70 --> 2895.66]  And I've used this
[2895.66 --> 2897.18]  for everything from
[2897.18 --> 2898.18]  grabbing a screw
[2898.18 --> 2898.78]  out of somewhere
[2898.78 --> 2899.58]  that's hard to reach
[2899.58 --> 2900.76]  like a non-magnetic screw
[2900.76 --> 2902.20]  to I've actually used it
[2902.20 --> 2903.62]  for motherboard socket repair.
[2904.16 --> 2904.56]  Oh wow.
[2904.62 --> 2905.52]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[2905.54 --> 2905.88]  It's fine enough
[2905.88 --> 2907.26]  that I was able to get in there.
[2907.40 --> 2908.60]  I didn't have a needle on me
[2908.60 --> 2909.98]  which is my preferred tool for that.
[2910.06 --> 2911.68]  And I was able to make do with this.
[2912.04 --> 2912.64]  I've had to do it
[2912.64 --> 2913.96]  with like a credit card before.
[2913.96 --> 2915.64]  I've made it work.
[2915.90 --> 2916.44]  That's terrible.
[2916.66 --> 2917.10]  I know.
[2917.96 --> 2919.00]  You've got their
[2919.00 --> 2920.04]  Oh, there it goes.
[2920.52 --> 2921.56]  You've got their pry tool
[2921.56 --> 2922.56]  the little like
[2922.56 --> 2924.00]  not sharp knifey tool.
[2925.00 --> 2926.28]  I believe these ones
[2926.28 --> 2927.88]  are what are actually called spudgers.
[2928.02 --> 2928.80]  I can never remember
[2928.80 --> 2929.24]  but anyway
[2929.24 --> 2930.08]  it's got like
[2930.08 --> 2932.52]  like a prying thing
[2932.52 --> 2933.16]  on one side
[2933.16 --> 2933.64]  and then it's got
[2933.64 --> 2934.28]  a pokey thing
[2934.28 --> 2935.04]  on the other end.
[2935.76 --> 2936.94]  Use that for everything
[2936.94 --> 2937.62]  from
[2937.62 --> 2938.42]  what's it called?
[2938.48 --> 2939.02]  Yeah, that is called
[2939.02 --> 2939.48]  a spudger.
[2939.96 --> 2940.98]  Everything from like
[2940.98 --> 2942.08]  pressing reset buttons
[2942.08 --> 2942.72]  and routers
[2942.72 --> 2943.98]  to pretty much you name it.
[2944.10 --> 2945.14]  This is enough stuff
[2945.14 --> 2946.48]  outside of a
[2946.48 --> 2947.58]  like heat gun
[2947.58 --> 2948.82]  to replace the screen
[2948.82 --> 2950.02]  on a pixel.
[2951.08 --> 2952.42]  Some guitar picks.
[2953.12 --> 2953.78]  Which is pretty solid.
[2953.98 --> 2954.62]  Suction cup.
[2954.72 --> 2955.28]  The suction cup
[2955.28 --> 2955.94]  is actually something
[2955.94 --> 2956.68]  I was pretty upset
[2956.68 --> 2957.44]  was not included
[2957.44 --> 2958.16]  with the original
[2958.16 --> 2958.82]  ProTech toolkit
[2958.82 --> 2960.40]  so it's nice to see that.
[2960.96 --> 2962.20]  It's enough to work on a phone
[2962.20 --> 2963.10]  not enough to work on
[2963.10 --> 2964.14]  like an iMac or something
[2964.14 --> 2964.40]  but
[2964.40 --> 2965.62]  That's why I called out
[2965.62 --> 2966.20]  the pixel over there.
[2966.20 --> 2966.58]  All right.
[2966.90 --> 2967.80]  Now let's look
[2967.80 --> 2969.46]  let's look at the bits here
[2969.46 --> 2970.52]  because that is
[2970.52 --> 2971.66]  that is what I'm
[2971.66 --> 2972.48]  pretty worried about.
[2973.56 --> 2974.00]  So
[2974.00 --> 2975.44]  you've got
[2975.44 --> 2977.04]  torques from T4
[2977.04 --> 2978.86]  to TR10
[2978.86 --> 2980.10]  and the R1s
[2980.10 --> 2981.20]  are the security torques.
[2981.54 --> 2982.56]  That'll cover
[2982.56 --> 2983.30]  taking apart
[2983.30 --> 2984.46]  SSDs
[2984.46 --> 2986.60]  many many laptops
[2986.60 --> 2993.06]  No Tri-Wing.
[2993.48 --> 2994.36]  No Tri-Wing.
[2994.78 --> 2995.74]  I'm pretty disappointed
[2995.74 --> 2997.12]  that there's no Tri-Wing.
[2997.32 --> 2998.22]  That means you won't be
[2998.22 --> 2999.72]  repairing any Nintendo devices
[2999.72 --> 3001.04]  though Nintendo
[3001.04 --> 3002.02]  are the main ones
[3002.02 --> 3002.70]  that I know of
[3002.70 --> 3003.80]  that use Tri-Wing.
[3004.26 --> 3005.26]  You've got a P2
[3005.26 --> 3006.72]  and a P5 Pentalobe
[3006.72 --> 3008.22]  so that should take care
[3008.22 --> 3009.42]  of your Apple needs.
[3010.36 --> 3011.76]  You've got a couple slots
[3011.76 --> 3012.46]  three slots
[3012.46 --> 3013.36]  including a very
[3013.36 --> 3014.44]  very very slim one
[3014.44 --> 3015.34]  a SIM removal.
[3015.86 --> 3016.68]  See I would have rather
[3016.68 --> 3017.62]  seen a Tri-Wing
[3017.62 --> 3018.78]  instead of the SIM removal
[3018.78 --> 3019.66]  but
[3019.66 --> 3020.74]  for some people
[3020.74 --> 3021.58]  I guess that'll be handy.
[3021.58 --> 3022.58]  I do like that they have
[3022.58 --> 3023.20]  the SIM removal.
[3023.20 --> 3024.58]  And you use the SIM removal?
[3024.78 --> 3025.04]  Mm-hmm.
[3025.18 --> 3026.16]  Okay well I carry
[3026.16 --> 3026.78]  like a handful
[3026.78 --> 3027.66]  of SIM removal tools
[3027.66 --> 3028.26]  in my backpack
[3028.26 --> 3029.14]  otherwise
[3029.14 --> 3029.92]  so maybe that's why
[3029.92 --> 3030.34]  I don't care about it.
[3030.34 --> 3031.04]  For the last while
[3031.04 --> 3032.40]  I've finally freed myself
[3032.40 --> 3033.70]  thank goodness
[3033.70 --> 3034.66]  but for the last while
[3034.66 --> 3035.78]  I've been using Sony phones
[3035.78 --> 3036.38]  Right.
[3036.48 --> 3037.12]  And they don't need them.
[3037.36 --> 3037.68]  Okay.
[3037.90 --> 3039.20]  So I would never have one on me
[3039.20 --> 3040.02]  and if I did actually
[3040.02 --> 3040.74]  happen to need one
[3040.74 --> 3041.48]  I would just go to the iPhone.
[3041.50 --> 3042.06]  And then you've got
[3042.06 --> 3042.88]  five Philips head
[3042.88 --> 3043.44]  all the way from
[3043.44 --> 3044.58]  triple zero to two.
[3045.00 --> 3046.56]  So if I were to give
[3046.56 --> 3047.40]  iFixit
[3047.40 --> 3048.50]  some constructive feedback
[3048.50 --> 3049.62]  which I'm sure
[3049.62 --> 3050.60]  they're not asking for
[3050.60 --> 3051.56]  during a sponsored spot
[3051.56 --> 3052.58]  but if I were to do so
[3052.58 --> 3054.30]  I would drop
[3054.30 --> 3055.98]  the size two Philips
[3055.98 --> 3056.84]  and I would drop
[3056.84 --> 3057.98]  the SIM removal tool
[3057.98 --> 3060.36]  and I would replace those
[3060.36 --> 3061.60]  with a couple triwings
[3061.60 --> 3062.28]  but then again
[3062.28 --> 3062.92]  that's probably
[3062.92 --> 3064.12]  like the gamer
[3064.12 --> 3065.84]  centric
[3065.84 --> 3066.24]  Yeah.
[3066.50 --> 3066.84]  thinking
[3066.84 --> 3067.88]  part of me.
[3067.88 --> 3068.92]  and like
[3068.92 --> 3070.38]  not just because
[3070.38 --> 3071.44]  I'm a Nintendo fanboy
[3071.44 --> 3072.34]  but they don't break
[3072.34 --> 3072.78]  that much.
[3075.06 --> 3076.20]  I just put a new
[3076.20 --> 3077.20]  optical drive in my Wii.
[3077.40 --> 3077.92]  Yeah you.
[3078.22 --> 3079.22]  The only DS
[3079.22 --> 3080.00]  I've ever owned
[3080.00 --> 3081.02]  had the shoulder buttons
[3081.02 --> 3081.40]  die
[3081.40 --> 3082.90]  just like everyone else's
[3082.90 --> 3083.40]  DS from that generation.
[3083.40 --> 3083.94]  They don't break that much
[3083.94 --> 3085.04]  for normal people.
[3086.16 --> 3087.46]  All I played was Mario Kart.
[3087.46 --> 3088.52]  We talked
[3088.52 --> 3089.02]  how long ago
[3089.02 --> 3089.88]  did we talk about this?
[3090.40 --> 3091.18]  I don't know.
[3091.40 --> 3092.50]  You can fix everything
[3092.50 --> 3093.28]  but everything breaks
[3093.28 --> 3093.76]  around you.
[3093.76 --> 3096.44]  It's not even his fault.
[3096.90 --> 3097.44]  He'll just like
[3097.44 --> 3098.10]  be near it
[3098.10 --> 3098.80]  and it will stop
[3098.80 --> 3099.74]  for stop working
[3099.74 --> 3100.40]  for literally
[3100.40 --> 3101.64]  no apparent reason
[3101.64 --> 3102.18]  at all.
[3102.40 --> 3103.50]  Like the Wancho computer.
[3103.74 --> 3104.24]  Why did it have
[3104.24 --> 3104.96]  so many problems?
[3105.18 --> 3106.12]  I have literally
[3106.12 --> 3107.30]  no idea.
[3108.70 --> 3110.08]  I stream like a lot.
[3110.26 --> 3110.74]  Like it doesn't
[3110.74 --> 3111.58]  I don't have
[3111.58 --> 3112.56]  I don't know anyone
[3112.56 --> 3113.30]  that has the amount
[3113.30 --> 3114.16]  of problems that we've had.
[3114.40 --> 3115.02]  I don't know anyone
[3115.02 --> 3115.94]  that has like a tenth
[3115.94 --> 3116.82]  the amount of problems
[3116.82 --> 3117.20]  that we had.
[3117.44 --> 3118.08]  And every single time
[3118.08 --> 3118.68]  it would just be like
[3118.68 --> 3120.52]  what the heck
[3120.52 --> 3121.42]  is going on?
[3121.46 --> 3122.16]  And he'd find some
[3122.16 --> 3122.92]  like weird way
[3122.92 --> 3123.68]  and it would fix it
[3123.68 --> 3124.14]  and it would be like
[3124.14 --> 3124.88]  oh okay great.
[3125.32 --> 3126.44]  But we shouldn't
[3126.44 --> 3127.06]  have had to do that.
[3127.34 --> 3127.70]  Exactly.
[3128.42 --> 3129.26]  I don't know.
[3129.46 --> 3130.06]  So the screwdriver
[3130.06 --> 3131.34]  is their old style
[3131.34 --> 3132.14]  which I definitely
[3132.14 --> 3132.84]  don't prefer
[3132.84 --> 3134.66]  but is still functional
[3134.66 --> 3136.96]  and a pro tip
[3136.96 --> 3137.62]  for those of you
[3137.62 --> 3138.76]  who are using it.
[3138.88 --> 3139.16]  Yeah.
[3139.38 --> 3140.14]  This is actually
[3140.14 --> 3140.60]  pretty important.
[3140.68 --> 3141.68]  You want to jam things
[3141.68 --> 3142.22]  in the top
[3142.22 --> 3142.78]  whenever you need
[3142.78 --> 3143.28]  more torque.
[3143.40 --> 3143.64]  Yes.
[3143.80 --> 3144.54]  That's how you do it
[3144.54 --> 3145.26]  because these rubber
[3145.26 --> 3146.06]  o-rings slip.
[3146.32 --> 3146.58]  Yes.
[3146.80 --> 3147.78]  So overall
[3147.78 --> 3149.00]  That will save you.
[3149.18 --> 3150.02]  At the price
[3150.02 --> 3151.18]  at 20 bucks
[3151.18 --> 3152.08]  not bad.
[3152.08 --> 3152.30]  20 bucks.
[3152.80 --> 3153.34]  Not bad.
[3153.34 --> 3154.40]  This will cover
[3154.40 --> 3156.24]  what casuals
[3156.24 --> 3156.82]  will need
[3156.82 --> 3158.40]  but I personally
[3158.40 --> 3159.30]  and again
[3159.30 --> 3159.68]  like
[3159.68 --> 3161.14]  it is my job
[3161.14 --> 3161.86]  to sell this
[3161.86 --> 3162.34]  today
[3162.34 --> 3162.88]  but I
[3162.88 --> 3164.40]  sort of don't care.
[3164.98 --> 3165.98]  I personally
[3165.98 --> 3167.10]  would go for
[3167.10 --> 3167.64]  the ProTech
[3167.64 --> 3168.44]  toolkit anyway
[3168.44 --> 3169.40]  just because
[3169.40 --> 3170.58]  I think that
[3170.58 --> 3171.54]  at that price
[3171.54 --> 3172.66]  it's pretty reasonable
[3172.66 --> 3173.98]  considering that
[3173.98 --> 3174.76]  that's kind of
[3174.76 --> 3175.50]  it's like in that
[3175.50 --> 3176.42]  it's in that magic
[3176.42 --> 3177.76]  how much money
[3177.76 --> 3179.08]  you would have to spend
[3179.08 --> 3179.88]  if you paid someone
[3179.88 --> 3180.88]  to repair your stupid
[3180.88 --> 3181.50]  thing anyway.
[3182.00 --> 3182.20]  Yeah.
[3183.30 --> 3184.52]  That being said
[3184.52 --> 3186.20]  if you're shopping
[3186.20 --> 3187.70]  for someone
[3187.70 --> 3189.54]  20 bucks
[3189.54 --> 3190.28]  That's true.
[3190.40 --> 3190.60]  Christmas
[3190.60 --> 3192.38]  not a bad drop
[3192.38 --> 3193.62]  get them started
[3193.62 --> 3194.34]  not as good
[3194.34 --> 3194.88]  as the ProTech
[3194.88 --> 3195.20]  toolkit
[3195.20 --> 3195.66]  but it's not
[3195.66 --> 3196.28]  supposed to be.
[3196.84 --> 3197.02]  Yeah.
[3197.10 --> 3197.40]  Okay.
[3197.50 --> 3198.04]  That's fair.
[3198.04 --> 3199.66]  Okay.
[3199.78 --> 3200.20]  We have another
[3200.20 --> 3200.90]  sponsor spot
[3200.90 --> 3201.46]  that I promise
[3201.46 --> 3202.02]  will be shorter
[3202.02 --> 3202.44]  I'm sorry
[3202.44 --> 3203.08]  that turned into
[3203.08 --> 3203.80]  like an unboxing
[3203.80 --> 3204.72]  Are you sure?
[3205.68 --> 3206.32]  Well I don't know
[3206.32 --> 3206.76]  if it'll be sure
[3206.76 --> 3207.38]  Yeah you could talk
[3207.38 --> 3207.86]  about this thing
[3207.86 --> 3208.34]  forever.
[3208.52 --> 3209.36]  Literally forever.
[3210.36 --> 3210.86]  So okay.
[3211.06 --> 3211.36]  We should get the background
[3211.36 --> 3211.82]  first.
[3212.32 --> 3213.34]  First he bought one
[3213.34 --> 3213.72]  Yes.
[3213.82 --> 3214.36]  Then they didn't
[3214.36 --> 3215.02]  deliver it
[3215.02 --> 3216.08]  Forever.
[3217.28 --> 3218.88]  Then Colton was like
[3218.88 --> 3219.68]  hey who should we
[3219.68 --> 3220.06]  work with
[3220.06 --> 3220.40]  and he's like
[3220.40 --> 3221.20]  yeah I love this thing
[3221.20 --> 3221.70]  it's so amazing
[3221.70 --> 3222.50]  I don't even have it yet
[3222.50 --> 3223.36]  but I'm already in love
[3223.36 --> 3223.64]  with it
[3223.64 --> 3224.62]  my pants are so tight
[3224.62 --> 3225.02]  right now.
[3225.12 --> 3225.46]  Pretty much.
[3225.46 --> 3227.50]  So they reached out
[3227.50 --> 3228.44]  and they sent us one
[3228.44 --> 3229.78]  before Luke ever
[3229.78 --> 3230.44]  even got one.
[3230.54 --> 3231.20]  By a lot
[3231.20 --> 3231.58]  again.
[3232.78 --> 3233.58]  Then I had to
[3233.58 --> 3234.56]  bring it back to work
[3234.56 --> 3235.48]  oh that was so
[3235.48 --> 3235.90]  heartbreaking.
[3236.08 --> 3236.38]  Anyways
[3236.38 --> 3237.46]  when you're cooking
[3237.46 --> 3238.98]  meat
[3238.98 --> 3240.20]  which isn't at all
[3240.20 --> 3240.82]  the only thing
[3240.82 --> 3241.48]  that you can cook
[3241.48 --> 3242.42]  with this thing
[3242.42 --> 3243.64]  You haven't even
[3243.64 --> 3244.34]  said what it is.
[3244.58 --> 3245.46]  So it is a
[3245.46 --> 3246.28]  sous vide cooker
[3246.28 --> 3247.02]  but like
[3247.02 --> 3248.26]  an immersion cooker
[3248.26 --> 3248.86]  but like almost
[3248.86 --> 3249.26]  no one knows
[3249.26 --> 3249.92]  what that actually means
[3249.92 --> 3250.42]  unless they already
[3250.42 --> 3250.84]  have one.
[3251.84 --> 3252.68]  When you're
[3252.68 --> 3253.78]  cooking meats
[3253.78 --> 3254.54]  you
[3254.54 --> 3255.06]  what you're
[3255.06 --> 3255.68]  the goal
[3255.68 --> 3256.42]  is to make
[3256.42 --> 3258.64]  the whole thing
[3258.64 --> 3259.44]  get to a minimum
[3259.44 --> 3259.92]  temperature
[3259.92 --> 3260.82]  including the very
[3260.82 --> 3261.14]  middle
[3261.14 --> 3262.04]  which is rather
[3262.04 --> 3262.74]  difficult to do
[3262.74 --> 3263.24]  and you're using
[3263.24 --> 3264.74]  heat that is much
[3264.74 --> 3265.94]  higher than what
[3265.94 --> 3266.50]  you're actually
[3266.50 --> 3267.64]  trying to get to.
[3267.90 --> 3268.48]  I'm just mouthing
[3268.48 --> 3268.96]  sous vide
[3268.96 --> 3270.22]  because it's fun.
[3271.42 --> 3273.34]  So you usually
[3273.34 --> 3274.92]  will overheat
[3274.92 --> 3275.48]  the outside
[3275.48 --> 3277.20]  just to get
[3277.20 --> 3278.00]  to the temperature
[3278.00 --> 3278.60]  that you're trying
[3278.60 --> 3279.18]  to get to
[3279.18 --> 3280.10]  in the middle.
[3280.82 --> 3281.72]  What a sous vide
[3281.72 --> 3282.54]  allows you to do
[3282.54 --> 3284.32]  is you vacuum
[3284.32 --> 3285.60]  seal or evacuate
[3285.60 --> 3286.20]  the air
[3286.20 --> 3286.60]  out of a
[3286.60 --> 3287.42]  Ziploc bag
[3287.42 --> 3288.50]  so that the
[3288.50 --> 3289.10]  Ziploc bag
[3289.10 --> 3289.50]  is touching
[3289.50 --> 3290.12]  right next
[3290.12 --> 3291.92]  to the meat
[3291.92 --> 3293.24]  and then you
[3293.24 --> 3293.84]  dip it into
[3293.84 --> 3294.18]  water.
[3294.60 --> 3294.88]  The sous vide
[3294.88 --> 3295.58]  cooker is
[3295.58 --> 3297.38]  extremely precise
[3297.38 --> 3298.06]  and will keep
[3298.06 --> 3298.52]  the water
[3298.52 --> 3299.38]  at an extremely
[3299.38 --> 3299.60]  precise temperature.
[3299.60 --> 3300.14]  Hold on actually
[3300.14 --> 3300.74]  this is really
[3300.74 --> 3301.06]  important.
[3301.16 --> 3301.52]  We interrupt
[3301.52 --> 3302.10]  this program
[3302.10 --> 3302.82]  to bring you
[3302.82 --> 3303.36]  this question
[3303.36 --> 3304.48]  from RTChaser07.
[3304.48 --> 3305.10]  Can you cook
[3305.10 --> 3305.96]  Hot Pockets in it?
[3305.96 --> 3309.00]  I think you
[3309.00 --> 3309.46]  could.
[3310.04 --> 3310.52]  I think you
[3310.52 --> 3310.68]  could.
[3310.74 --> 3311.34]  You can't cook
[3311.34 --> 3311.94]  a turkey
[3311.94 --> 3313.32]  unless you cut
[3313.32 --> 3313.88]  it first
[3313.88 --> 3314.40]  and then you
[3314.40 --> 3314.88]  can cook it.
[3314.98 --> 3315.40]  Okay sorry
[3315.40 --> 3315.86]  carry on.
[3316.04 --> 3316.56]  Yeah yeah
[3316.56 --> 3317.28]  you can't cook
[3317.28 --> 3317.62]  a turkey
[3317.62 --> 3318.18]  because there
[3318.18 --> 3318.68]  would be like
[3318.68 --> 3319.42]  pockets in
[3319.42 --> 3320.92]  there because
[3320.92 --> 3321.44]  of where like
[3321.44 --> 3322.92]  the organs
[3322.92 --> 3323.28]  are.
[3324.20 --> 3324.72]  Or would have
[3324.72 --> 3324.98]  been.
[3325.22 --> 3325.58]  Or would have
[3325.58 --> 3325.82]  been.
[3326.08 --> 3326.62]  So like that
[3326.62 --> 3327.10]  wouldn't really
[3327.10 --> 3327.84]  work because
[3327.84 --> 3328.22]  the heat
[3328.22 --> 3328.50]  wouldn't be
[3328.50 --> 3328.78]  able to go
[3328.78 --> 3329.04]  all the way
[3329.04 --> 3329.16]  through.
[3329.30 --> 3329.74]  Okay carry
[3329.74 --> 3330.14]  on carry
[3330.14 --> 3330.38]  on.
[3330.74 --> 3331.58]  It makes
[3331.58 --> 3332.48]  it essentially
[3332.48 --> 3333.24]  so all that
[3333.24 --> 3333.54]  you have to
[3333.54 --> 3334.26]  do is put
[3334.26 --> 3334.82]  like your
[3334.82 --> 3335.46]  meat and
[3335.46 --> 3335.94]  some herbs
[3335.94 --> 3336.38]  and spices
[3336.38 --> 3336.86]  in a little
[3336.86 --> 3337.74]  bag with
[3337.74 --> 3338.12]  some olive
[3338.12 --> 3338.40]  oil.
[3338.58 --> 3338.94]  I always
[3338.94 --> 3339.26]  put my
[3339.26 --> 3339.54]  meat in
[3339.54 --> 3339.82]  a bag
[3339.82 --> 3340.20]  with olive
[3340.20 --> 3340.46]  oil.
[3340.78 --> 3341.18]  Put that
[3341.18 --> 3341.70]  in a pot
[3341.70 --> 3342.34]  put this
[3342.34 --> 3342.68]  thing in
[3342.68 --> 3343.22]  it and
[3343.22 --> 3343.54]  in the
[3343.54 --> 3344.50]  app which
[3344.50 --> 3345.26]  is amazing
[3345.26 --> 3345.86]  go like
[3345.86 --> 3346.46]  I want it
[3346.46 --> 3346.92]  to look
[3346.92 --> 3347.64]  like that.
[3347.92 --> 3348.32]  It has a
[3348.32 --> 3349.02]  visual doneness
[3349.02 --> 3349.74]  thing and
[3349.74 --> 3350.14]  then it just
[3350.14 --> 3351.10]  does it for
[3351.10 --> 3351.34]  you.
[3351.82 --> 3352.50]  You sear it
[3352.50 --> 3353.10]  for like
[3353.10 --> 3354.14]  20 seconds
[3354.14 --> 3355.08]  serve and
[3355.08 --> 3355.42]  it will
[3355.42 --> 3356.38]  probably be
[3356.38 --> 3357.10]  one of the
[3357.10 --> 3357.78]  best cooks
[3357.78 --> 3358.36]  of that
[3358.36 --> 3359.10]  meat that
[3359.10 --> 3359.70]  you've had.
[3360.44 --> 3360.76]  Yeah it is
[3360.76 --> 3361.24]  actually really
[3361.24 --> 3361.68]  good and
[3361.68 --> 3362.10]  it's available
[3362.10 --> 3362.62]  now for
[3362.62 --> 3363.38]  holiday gifting.
[3363.56 --> 3363.76]  Check it
[3363.76 --> 3364.04]  out at
[3364.04 --> 3365.02]  chefsteps.com
[3365.02 --> 3365.86]  slash
[3365.86 --> 3366.48]  jewel.
[3366.94 --> 3367.12]  Which is
[3367.12 --> 3367.96]  probably good
[3367.96 --> 3369.06]  because I
[3369.06 --> 3369.74]  ordered mine a
[3369.74 --> 3370.42]  long time ago
[3370.42 --> 3370.88]  and I finally
[3370.88 --> 3371.28]  got it.
[3372.30 --> 3373.04]  Alright which
[3373.04 --> 3373.58]  brings us
[3373.58 --> 3374.28]  finally to
[3374.28 --> 3374.96]  Cooler Master.
[3375.28 --> 3375.74]  Check out the
[3375.74 --> 3376.20]  Cooler Master
[3376.20 --> 3376.92]  store for all
[3376.92 --> 3377.78]  your Cooler Master
[3377.78 --> 3378.78]  case, cooler,
[3378.90 --> 3379.82]  power supply, and
[3379.82 --> 3381.36]  peripheral needs.
[3381.60 --> 3382.16]  It features
[3382.16 --> 3383.28]  exclusives like
[3383.28 --> 3384.24]  the Master Keys
[3384.24 --> 3385.92]  Pro L RGB
[3385.92 --> 3386.86]  Crystal Edition
[3386.86 --> 3387.80]  which I'm
[3387.80 --> 3388.34]  going to have to
[3388.34 --> 3389.12]  Google because I
[3389.12 --> 3389.84]  actually don't know
[3389.84 --> 3390.46]  what that is.
[3390.52 --> 3391.32]  Master Keys?
[3391.50 --> 3392.42]  Master Keys Pro
[3392.42 --> 3394.00]  L RGB Crystal
[3394.00 --> 3394.44]  Edition.
[3394.64 --> 3395.32]  I'm assuming
[3395.32 --> 3396.90]  it's a keyboard.
[3397.24 --> 3397.76]  Oh that actually
[3397.76 --> 3398.68]  looks pretty cool.
[3398.90 --> 3399.16]  Yeah.
[3400.50 --> 3401.06]  Nice.
[3401.24 --> 3402.34]  Oh way to go
[3402.34 --> 3403.28]  Cooler Master.
[3403.82 --> 3404.60]  That's the best.
[3404.74 --> 3405.52]  I love how it's not
[3405.52 --> 3406.40]  in English even
[3406.40 --> 3406.76]  though you're on
[3406.76 --> 3407.66]  the dot com site.
[3407.66 --> 3408.40]  Let's try again.
[3409.64 --> 3410.16]  Nice.
[3411.44 --> 3411.90]  Wow.
[3411.90 --> 3413.04]  Best 404 page
[3413.04 --> 3413.88]  I've ever seen.
[3414.52 --> 3415.04]  Wow.
[3415.24 --> 3416.36]  So much wow.
[3416.50 --> 3417.32]  Okay this one works.
[3417.54 --> 3418.14]  Look at that.
[3418.76 --> 3419.64]  It's actually kind
[3419.64 --> 3420.16]  of beautiful.
[3421.78 --> 3423.02]  Blue, brown, or red
[3423.02 --> 3423.50]  switches.
[3424.62 --> 3425.06]  Okay.
[3425.28 --> 3425.60]  Alright.
[3425.84 --> 3427.00]  That's pretty hip.
[3428.44 --> 3429.36]  On the fly macro
[3429.36 --> 3430.44]  and profile support.
[3430.64 --> 3431.40]  Individual lighting.
[3431.62 --> 3432.56]  That's pretty cool.
[3433.00 --> 3433.36]  Okay.
[3433.58 --> 3433.86]  Alright.
[3434.58 --> 3434.96]  Okay.
[3435.16 --> 3435.46]  Alright.
[3435.58 --> 3436.40]  And they're so clear
[3436.40 --> 3437.08]  that you can see the
[3437.08 --> 3437.92]  color of the switch.
[3438.04 --> 3438.74]  That's actually pretty
[3438.74 --> 3439.08]  sweet.
[3439.20 --> 3440.10]  Okay Cooler Master.
[3440.30 --> 3441.06]  You got our attention
[3441.06 --> 3441.36]  now.
[3441.42 --> 3442.00]  What else you got?
[3442.00 --> 3442.62]  They're highlighting
[3442.62 --> 3443.34]  some Black Friday
[3443.34 --> 3444.06]  weekend deals
[3444.06 --> 3445.18]  including 25%
[3445.18 --> 3445.90]  off keyboards
[3445.90 --> 3447.54]  cases and more
[3447.54 --> 3448.66]  with coupon code
[3448.66 --> 3450.70]  BF2016.
[3451.08 --> 3452.48]  Best friend 2016.
[3452.66 --> 3452.90]  Oh no.
[3453.02 --> 3453.88]  It's probably Black Friday
[3453.88 --> 3454.28]  isn't it?
[3454.34 --> 3454.60]  Yes.
[3454.78 --> 3455.06]  Okay.
[3455.12 --> 3455.64]  That makes sense.
[3456.04 --> 3458.56]  Visit cmstore-usa.com
[3458.56 --> 3459.36]  to learn more about
[3459.36 --> 3459.98]  Cooler Master's
[3459.98 --> 3460.76]  wide range of products
[3460.76 --> 3461.44]  and maybe pick up
[3461.44 --> 3462.26]  something for yourself
[3462.26 --> 3463.10]  this holiday season.
[3463.52 --> 3464.38]  What a greedy
[3464.38 --> 3466.00]  ad notes Colton.
[3466.56 --> 3467.28]  Some people
[3467.28 --> 3468.18]  for some people
[3468.18 --> 3469.02]  the holiday season
[3469.02 --> 3469.66]  is about buying
[3469.66 --> 3470.32]  for others.
[3471.36 --> 3471.50]  Yeah.
[3471.60 --> 3472.00]  Colton.
[3472.38 --> 3473.30]  Not for Colton.
[3473.86 --> 3474.08]  Yeah.
[3474.16 --> 3474.54]  I wouldn't buy
[3474.54 --> 3475.10]  for Colton.
[3475.10 --> 3476.52]  Sorry Colton's wife.
[3476.60 --> 3477.22]  What a jerk.
[3477.96 --> 3478.72]  I don't know if I can
[3478.72 --> 3479.24]  say her name.
[3479.32 --> 3479.92]  Hate that guy.
[3480.98 --> 3481.54]  Alright.
[3482.36 --> 3483.92]  So another funny story.
[3484.52 --> 3485.30]  We have more
[3485.30 --> 3487.70]  viewers now
[3487.70 --> 3488.98]  than we did
[3488.98 --> 3489.90]  before we started
[3489.90 --> 3491.06]  doing ad spots.
[3492.42 --> 3493.48]  I'm convinced
[3493.48 --> 3494.20]  that the more
[3494.20 --> 3496.52]  fun we have
[3496.52 --> 3497.22]  just like
[3497.22 --> 3499.22]  having fun
[3499.22 --> 3499.94]  of like
[3499.94 --> 3500.84]  okay I was actually
[3500.84 --> 3501.64]  ready to make fun
[3501.64 --> 3502.32]  of that keyboard.
[3502.32 --> 3503.02]  like I was super
[3503.02 --> 3503.54]  ready for that.
[3503.56 --> 3504.36]  But it was sweet.
[3504.40 --> 3504.98]  But it was actually
[3504.98 --> 3505.40]  pretty good.
[3505.48 --> 3505.66]  Anyway.
[3506.00 --> 3506.64]  I'm convinced
[3506.64 --> 3507.80]  that the more fun
[3507.80 --> 3508.70]  we have with the ads
[3508.70 --> 3508.72]  It's sweet if that's what you're
[3508.72 --> 3509.62]  going for.
[3510.02 --> 3511.14]  The closer it is
[3511.14 --> 3512.08]  to being just as
[3512.08 --> 3512.56]  off topic
[3512.56 --> 3513.22]  as the entire
[3513.22 --> 3513.84]  rest of the show.
[3513.98 --> 3514.86]  You can't tell
[3514.86 --> 3515.50]  the difference
[3515.50 --> 3516.74]  because you're like
[3516.74 --> 3517.10]  wow
[3517.10 --> 3517.74]  they're pretty
[3517.74 --> 3518.56]  informal about
[3518.56 --> 3519.10]  these ads.
[3519.10 --> 3520.82]  they're literally
[3520.82 --> 3521.72]  like attacking
[3521.72 --> 3522.54]  the companies
[3522.54 --> 3524.00]  that are giving
[3524.00 --> 3524.90]  them ads.
[3527.20 --> 3527.74]  Look
[3527.74 --> 3530.16]  if they wanted
[3530.16 --> 3530.94]  a professional
[3530.94 --> 3531.72]  ad read
[3531.72 --> 3533.16]  they know
[3533.16 --> 3533.64]  where to go
[3533.64 --> 3534.18]  for that
[3534.18 --> 3535.52]  and if they
[3535.52 --> 3537.32]  want this approach
[3537.32 --> 3538.92]  then by all means
[3538.92 --> 3539.60]  give us money.
[3539.84 --> 3539.96]  Yeah.
[3540.18 --> 3540.50]  Why not?
[3540.76 --> 3541.04]  There you go.
[3541.88 --> 3542.44]  Okay.
[3542.78 --> 3544.10]  Let's talk about
[3544.10 --> 3545.68]  the float plane club.
[3545.90 --> 3547.02]  So you finally
[3547.02 --> 3548.02]  get a topic today.
[3548.18 --> 3548.42]  Yeah.
[3548.42 --> 3548.94]  Yeah.
[3549.14 --> 3550.64]  I'm going Linus's screen.
[3550.80 --> 3551.50]  I'm putting us
[3551.50 --> 3552.34]  in the background.
[3552.88 --> 3553.78]  This is all about
[3553.78 --> 3554.42]  I'm just going to
[3554.42 --> 3555.22]  illustrate whatever
[3555.22 --> 3556.00]  it is you're talking
[3556.00 --> 3556.52]  about here.
[3556.62 --> 3556.94]  Okay.
[3557.06 --> 3558.02]  So under the
[3558.02 --> 3559.74]  forums section
[3559.74 --> 3560.96]  you'll see the hub
[3560.96 --> 3562.52]  and the hub is where
[3562.52 --> 3563.54]  like we expect
[3563.54 --> 3564.30]  most people on the
[3564.30 --> 3564.78]  site to go
[3564.78 --> 3565.12]  because
[3565.12 --> 3565.84]  Holy crap.
[3565.96 --> 3566.36]  Go away.
[3566.48 --> 3567.56]  Off topic is there
[3567.56 --> 3568.54]  and there's almost
[3568.54 --> 3569.94]  1.2 million posts
[3569.94 --> 3571.16]  because it's off topic
[3571.16 --> 3572.02]  and there's like
[3572.02 --> 3572.86]  the memes thread
[3572.86 --> 3573.66]  and the cars thread
[3573.66 --> 3574.70]  and the holy crap
[3574.70 --> 3575.54]  that's a big thread
[3575.54 --> 3576.00]  and the graphics
[3576.00 --> 3577.10]  cards is still pretty good.
[3577.56 --> 3577.92]  It is.
[3578.06 --> 3578.22]  Yeah.
[3578.22 --> 3578.66]  It is.
[3578.72 --> 3579.28]  But off topic.
[3579.50 --> 3580.70]  Off topic is ginormous.
[3580.92 --> 3581.62]  But there's also
[3581.62 --> 3582.64]  the float plane club
[3582.64 --> 3583.08]  rip vessel.
[3583.32 --> 3583.76]  Whoa.
[3583.90 --> 3584.74]  What is that?
[3584.88 --> 3585.02]  What?
[3585.32 --> 3585.68]  Oh.
[3585.94 --> 3586.24]  Oh.
[3586.34 --> 3587.48]  That is so like
[3587.48 --> 3588.50]  savage man.
[3588.62 --> 3589.10]  Rip vessel.
[3589.30 --> 3589.88]  Rip vessel.
[3590.14 --> 3590.46]  Savage.
[3590.76 --> 3591.04]  Anyways.
[3591.78 --> 3592.20]  So
[3592.20 --> 3594.08]  you can go in there.
[3594.32 --> 3595.30]  Well I'm working on it.
[3595.34 --> 3595.48]  Okay.
[3595.52 --> 3596.34]  I'm trying to make
[3596.34 --> 3597.44]  your terrible sight
[3597.44 --> 3597.90]  look good.
[3598.40 --> 3598.84]  Wow.
[3598.84 --> 3599.02]  No.
[3599.02 --> 3599.08]  No.
[3600.40 --> 3600.80]  No.
[3600.80 --> 3601.06]  I just
[3601.06 --> 3601.62]  I know
[3601.62 --> 3603.62]  the output is 1080p
[3603.62 --> 3604.72]  but I'm high DPI
[3604.72 --> 3605.64]  so like it was
[3605.64 --> 3606.38]  it was a little small
[3606.38 --> 3607.12]  for them to see us.
[3607.28 --> 3607.30]  Okay.
[3607.56 --> 3607.78]  Okay.
[3607.78 --> 3608.46]  I'm just bugging you.
[3608.68 --> 3608.84]  Oh.
[3609.52 --> 3610.96]  I'm just bugging you.
[3611.08 --> 3611.60]  It's okay.
[3611.70 --> 3612.52]  We're still friends.
[3613.36 --> 3614.32]  Hello darkness
[3614.32 --> 3615.26]  my old friend.
[3616.30 --> 3616.74]  Anyways
[3616.74 --> 3618.18]  this is the float plane club
[3618.18 --> 3619.30]  and we have an interesting
[3619.30 --> 3620.50]  announcement for you guys.
[3620.72 --> 3621.02]  Yes we do.
[3621.02 --> 3622.12]  I wonder if Eric and Catboiler
[3622.12 --> 3623.66]  are just screaming right now
[3623.66 --> 3624.28]  because they're like
[3624.28 --> 3625.76]  everything's gonna break.
[3626.46 --> 3627.68]  Eric the tech guru
[3627.68 --> 3628.62]  and Catboiler
[3628.62 --> 3631.50]  the amazing dude
[3631.50 --> 3632.54]  but should probably
[3632.54 --> 3633.72]  get a different name.
[3633.82 --> 3634.02]  Yeah.
[3634.14 --> 3635.08]  I mean it's against our
[3635.08 --> 3636.42]  it's against our forum
[3636.42 --> 3637.94]  like terms
[3637.94 --> 3639.18]  to change your username
[3639.18 --> 3640.14]  but Catboiler
[3640.14 --> 3641.56]  you have my personal permission.
[3641.90 --> 3642.00]  Yeah.
[3642.04 --> 3643.02]  I'll change it for you.
[3643.88 --> 3644.88]  Apparently it came out
[3644.88 --> 3645.72]  of a name generator
[3645.72 --> 3646.76]  and also like
[3646.76 --> 3647.84]  a cat almost like
[3647.84 --> 3648.54]  killed him
[3648.54 --> 3649.28]  when he was younger.
[3649.28 --> 3650.44]  A cat almost killed him.
[3650.44 --> 3651.08]  He cut his artery
[3651.08 --> 3651.62]  or something.
[3651.92 --> 3652.78]  It was like actually
[3652.78 --> 3653.28]  a big deal.
[3653.42 --> 3653.56]  I don't
[3653.56 --> 3654.34]  sorry if I screwed up
[3654.34 --> 3654.72]  the story.
[3655.62 --> 3655.98]  Anyways
[3655.98 --> 3656.90]  they have been
[3656.90 --> 3657.96]  absolutely great.
[3658.80 --> 3659.70]  Catboiler came in
[3659.70 --> 3660.10]  and was like
[3660.10 --> 3660.82]  hey so
[3660.82 --> 3662.60]  I have an idea
[3662.60 --> 3663.32]  for how you should
[3663.32 --> 3663.74]  do everything
[3663.74 --> 3664.32]  and I read it
[3664.32 --> 3664.68]  and I was like
[3664.68 --> 3665.00]  You haven't explained
[3665.00 --> 3665.82]  what this is at all yet.
[3665.82 --> 3666.08]  Holy crap
[3666.08 --> 3667.04]  it's a lot better than ours.
[3667.14 --> 3667.52]  So
[3667.52 --> 3668.44]  Rip Vessel
[3668.44 --> 3669.54]  we tried to make our own.
[3671.02 --> 3671.34]  So
[3671.34 --> 3672.72]  I guess that's actually like
[3672.72 --> 3674.24]  Right now
[3674.24 --> 3675.16]  it's a sub forum
[3675.16 --> 3676.82]  on the Linus Tech Tips forum
[3676.82 --> 3678.16]  It won't always be that.
[3678.22 --> 3679.38]  It will not always be that.
[3679.44 --> 3680.42]  Because that sucks.
[3680.44 --> 3680.86]  Yeah
[3680.86 --> 3682.86]  We're aware that this is not
[3682.86 --> 3683.82]  the ideal solution
[3683.82 --> 3684.20]  like
[3684.20 --> 3685.42]  there aren't
[3685.42 --> 3686.80]  there's not a graceful way
[3686.80 --> 3687.22]  to
[3687.22 --> 3688.98]  give people notifications.
[3689.22 --> 3689.90]  Are we going to show them
[3689.90 --> 3690.62]  like an early video?
[3690.72 --> 3691.70]  They're able to see
[3691.70 --> 3692.62]  all the videos here
[3692.62 --> 3693.20]  for one
[3693.20 --> 3694.10]  so they know what videos
[3694.10 --> 3694.60]  are coming up.
[3694.70 --> 3694.86]  Yeah
[3694.86 --> 3695.70]  I don't know if we thought
[3695.70 --> 3695.78]  about that.
[3695.78 --> 3696.18]  That's fine.
[3696.40 --> 3697.14]  One of my favorite ones
[3697.14 --> 3698.16]  to show off is
[3698.16 --> 3698.90]  Brandon's
[3698.90 --> 3699.82]  because whenever he films
[3699.82 --> 3700.50]  anything
[3700.50 --> 3701.90]  it looks better than
[3701.90 --> 3702.82]  all the other videos
[3702.82 --> 3704.34]  because he's filming
[3704.34 --> 3704.62]  and editing his own video.
[3704.62 --> 3705.08]  Because he cares more
[3705.08 --> 3705.80]  about his own stuff
[3705.80 --> 3706.06]  Yeah.
[3706.38 --> 3706.80]  Basically.
[3707.22 --> 3708.38]  So check this out.
[3708.38 --> 3709.36]  Notice how it's orange?
[3709.92 --> 3711.10]  The color's a little off.
[3711.26 --> 3711.96]  We're going to fix that.
[3712.16 --> 3713.22]  Yeah I did not notice
[3713.22 --> 3713.72]  it was orange.
[3713.84 --> 3714.50]  I thought it was just
[3714.50 --> 3715.66]  like a broken YouTube
[3715.66 --> 3716.72]  clone.
[3716.86 --> 3717.50]  We'll figure it out.
[3717.50 --> 3717.98]  Okay.
[3718.48 --> 3718.96]  Okay.
[3719.24 --> 3721.04]  So right now
[3721.04 --> 3722.54]  what we are about to witness
[3722.54 --> 3724.18]  is a video running
[3724.18 --> 3725.68]  off of
[3725.68 --> 3726.90]  how much detail
[3726.90 --> 3727.52]  can you give them
[3727.52 --> 3728.06]  about this
[3728.06 --> 3729.22]  like solution
[3729.22 --> 3729.74]  you guys
[3729.74 --> 3730.56]  clutched together
[3730.56 --> 3731.70]  in like three weeks?
[3731.90 --> 3732.32]  Cat Boiler.
[3732.60 --> 3733.36]  Backend is
[3733.36 --> 3734.70]  Cat Boiler.
[3734.92 --> 3735.12]  Yeah.
[3735.48 --> 3735.88]  100%.
[3735.88 --> 3736.36]  So it's
[3736.36 --> 3737.76]  we have edge servers
[3737.76 --> 3738.44]  Yeah.
[3738.54 --> 3739.00]  that are like
[3739.00 --> 3739.98]  distributing things.
[3740.10 --> 3740.18]  Yeah.
[3740.22 --> 3740.56]  So
[3740.56 --> 3743.36]  I'm going to be light
[3743.36 --> 3744.16]  about the details
[3744.16 --> 3744.72]  for now
[3744.72 --> 3745.52]  just because
[3745.52 --> 3746.78]  Can they expect a video
[3746.78 --> 3747.60]  about how it works
[3747.60 --> 3748.14]  at some point?
[3749.22 --> 3749.50]  Yeah.
[3749.84 --> 3750.16]  Okay.
[3750.44 --> 3750.70]  Okay.
[3750.70 --> 3751.38]  But give us some
[3751.38 --> 3752.26]  give us some idea
[3752.26 --> 3752.78]  how you guys
[3752.78 --> 3753.44]  built a video delivery.
[3753.44 --> 3754.06]  We have a little bit
[3754.06 --> 3755.02]  of load balancing
[3755.02 --> 3755.62]  going on.
[3755.76 --> 3756.02]  We have
[3756.02 --> 3757.06]  we have the edge servers
[3757.06 --> 3757.90]  that don't really use
[3757.90 --> 3759.04]  their CPUs very much.
[3759.14 --> 3759.52]  Are they all
[3759.52 --> 3760.24]  on the same continent?
[3760.64 --> 3762.16]  They all are currently
[3762.16 --> 3762.92]  in the same continent.
[3763.30 --> 3763.92]  They will not
[3763.92 --> 3765.32]  always be
[3765.32 --> 3766.04]  but we haven't figured
[3766.04 --> 3767.22]  out geo-targeting yet.
[3767.38 --> 3768.28]  So once that gets
[3768.28 --> 3768.68]  figured out
[3768.68 --> 3769.50]  then we'll spawn
[3769.50 --> 3770.50]  some in other areas
[3770.50 --> 3770.92]  but they're all
[3770.92 --> 3771.84]  North America right now.
[3772.06 --> 3772.94]  That being said
[3772.94 --> 3774.08]  I do know
[3774.08 --> 3775.10]  outside of North America
[3775.10 --> 3775.88]  people that have
[3775.88 --> 3776.26]  watched
[3776.26 --> 3777.30]  full bitrate
[3777.30 --> 3778.26]  1080p streams
[3778.26 --> 3779.82]  and had no problem
[3779.82 --> 3780.52]  at all.
[3780.74 --> 3781.42]  So I'm pretty sure
[3781.42 --> 3782.02]  it's fine
[3782.02 --> 3783.56]  but we will make it
[3783.56 --> 3785.18]  better for people
[3785.18 --> 3785.28]  as time goes on.
[3785.28 --> 3785.76]  We're going to make it
[3785.76 --> 3786.26]  great again.
[3786.78 --> 3787.46]  We're going to make
[3787.46 --> 3790.02]  early access
[3790.02 --> 3791.24]  private high bitrate
[3791.24 --> 3791.98]  video streams
[3791.98 --> 3792.58]  great again.
[3793.72 --> 3794.82]  Should I just
[3794.82 --> 3795.90]  watch it
[3795.90 --> 3796.98]  watch it totally break.
[3798.58 --> 3800.18]  Oh no.
[3801.56 --> 3802.40]  Oh god.
[3803.40 --> 3804.18]  Oh it's horrible.
[3804.18 --> 3806.18]  Do you think
[3806.18 --> 3806.62]  one of them
[3806.62 --> 3807.32]  was literally
[3807.32 --> 3807.90]  breaking it
[3807.90 --> 3808.44]  in the background
[3808.44 --> 3809.16]  so that we would
[3809.16 --> 3809.68]  have to go through
[3809.68 --> 3809.98]  this?
[3810.22 --> 3810.34]  Maybe.
[3810.54 --> 3811.32]  I'm on edge.
[3811.48 --> 3812.18]  Is that a problem?
[3812.26 --> 3813.00]  Oh god that might
[3813.00 --> 3813.44]  be a problem.
[3813.60 --> 3814.40]  Who goes on edge?
[3814.80 --> 3815.20]  Oh right.
[3815.36 --> 3816.06]  We had to do that.
[3816.26 --> 3816.82]  That makes sense.
[3821.30 --> 3822.32]  Anyways the other
[3822.32 --> 3823.12]  part of the story
[3823.12 --> 3824.26]  is that it's still
[3824.26 --> 3824.96]  very much
[3824.96 --> 3826.30]  in development.
[3826.34 --> 3826.86]  It's alpha.
[3827.18 --> 3827.46]  Yeah.
[3827.66 --> 3828.52]  It's alpha right now.
[3828.62 --> 3828.78]  Okay.
[3828.94 --> 3830.00]  Can you do the thing?
[3830.00 --> 3830.66]  Can I?
[3831.12 --> 3831.62]  Do you know the thing?
[3831.74 --> 3832.68]  No I don't have
[3832.68 --> 3833.50]  your sharing working
[3833.50 --> 3834.24]  right now anyway.
[3834.84 --> 3836.30]  So bear with me.
[3836.56 --> 3838.56]  I'm going to do this thing.
[3838.72 --> 3839.22]  I don't have your
[3839.22 --> 3839.98]  screen sharing working
[3839.98 --> 3840.36]  right now.
[3840.82 --> 3841.36]  No I just want to see
[3841.36 --> 3841.84]  if it works with me.
[3842.16 --> 3842.98]  No no it's fine.
[3843.04 --> 3843.34]  It's fine.
[3843.40 --> 3843.70]  It's fine.
[3843.76 --> 3844.04]  It's fine.
[3844.10 --> 3844.50]  We got this.
[3844.56 --> 3844.92]  We got this.
[3845.04 --> 3845.14]  Okay.
[3845.50 --> 3846.14]  Buy time.
[3846.36 --> 3846.66]  Buy time.
[3846.70 --> 3846.98]  Anyways.
[3847.32 --> 3848.06]  So we've been
[3848.06 --> 3849.18]  developing this thing.
[3849.38 --> 3850.24]  How it started
[3850.24 --> 3852.76]  was that people
[3852.76 --> 3853.66]  that were on Vessel
[3853.66 --> 3854.64]  were served a video
[3854.64 --> 3855.34]  right before Vessel
[3855.34 --> 3855.78]  went down
[3855.78 --> 3856.38]  saying that they could
[3856.38 --> 3857.22]  sign up for a newsletter.
[3857.22 --> 3858.56]  And we sent an email
[3858.56 --> 3859.32]  to those people
[3859.32 --> 3860.00]  saying like hey
[3860.00 --> 3861.08]  we're trying to do this thing.
[3861.08 --> 3861.96]  We tried to send an email
[3861.96 --> 3862.40]  to those people.
[3862.40 --> 3862.74]  We tried.
[3862.82 --> 3863.98]  It only worked for some of them
[3863.98 --> 3866.02]  because we got super flagged
[3866.02 --> 3866.52]  pretty quick.
[3868.30 --> 3869.66]  We're trying to do this thing.
[3869.74 --> 3870.50]  It's in early production
[3870.50 --> 3870.86]  right now.
[3871.04 --> 3871.54]  But what you're going
[3871.54 --> 3871.92]  to be able to do
[3871.92 --> 3873.54]  is download the videos
[3873.54 --> 3876.34]  at probably lower resolution
[3876.34 --> 3878.10]  but much much higher bit rate.
[3878.22 --> 3879.04]  Like our 720p
[3879.04 --> 3880.18]  looked better than YouTube's
[3880.18 --> 3881.84]  1080p right away.
[3882.34 --> 3883.40]  And that still works
[3883.40 --> 3884.54]  even if this continues
[3884.54 --> 3885.30]  to not work
[3885.30 --> 3887.48]  which would be
[3887.48 --> 3888.42]  you know pretty good.
[3889.06 --> 3889.18]  Oh!
[3889.40 --> 3889.72]  Oh!
[3889.94 --> 3890.32]  There we go!
[3890.32 --> 3890.82]  Yay!
[3891.86 --> 3893.50]  There we go!
[3894.18 --> 3894.58]  Okay.
[3895.34 --> 3896.72]  So that's 360p.
[3897.32 --> 3897.96]  Which I mean
[3897.96 --> 3899.30]  they're watching on Twitch
[3899.30 --> 3899.42]  anyway.
[3899.42 --> 3900.76]  We can chance it again
[3900.76 --> 3903.00]  and see there you go.
[3903.10 --> 3904.14]  Oh look at that.
[3904.32 --> 3904.82]  Look at that
[3904.82 --> 3906.44]  black bar brand and magic.
[3906.84 --> 3907.18]  Yeah.
[3907.56 --> 3907.86]  Okay.
[3907.86 --> 3908.20]  So like
[3908.20 --> 3909.34]  Okay here we go.
[3909.40 --> 3909.68]  Hold on.
[3909.76 --> 3910.08]  Hold on.
[3910.18 --> 3910.76]  Oh dang.
[3910.98 --> 3912.30]  Oh we're stepping it up
[3912.30 --> 3912.60]  to 480p.
[3912.60 --> 3914.40]  So it does that weird thing
[3914.40 --> 3915.10]  so we're going to
[3915.10 --> 3916.16]  maybe try to figure that out
[3916.16 --> 3916.74]  at some point.
[3916.92 --> 3917.06]  Yes.
[3917.24 --> 3917.48]  Yes.
[3918.16 --> 3918.92]  Step it up again.
[3919.04 --> 3919.48]  Step it up.
[3919.48 --> 3920.20]  720p.
[3920.28 --> 3920.72]  Stepping it.
[3920.78 --> 3921.32]  Stepping it.
[3921.32 --> 3922.56]  Oh man.
[3922.76 --> 3924.80]  Oh is that 720p?
[3924.80 --> 3925.28]  Streaming.
[3925.46 --> 3926.38]  720p stream.
[3927.24 --> 3927.80]  Oh damn.
[3928.06 --> 3928.52]  What else we got?
[3928.54 --> 3929.08]  Do 1080.
[3929.34 --> 3930.78]  Do the last step.
[3930.86 --> 3931.10]  Hold on.
[3931.16 --> 3932.16]  Should we show off
[3932.16 --> 3933.02]  the thumbnail?
[3933.02 --> 3933.40]  Risk it.
[3933.44 --> 3933.96]  The thumbnail?
[3934.14 --> 3934.70]  Thumbnail preview?
[3934.88 --> 3936.40]  Oh thumbnail scrubbing.
[3936.90 --> 3937.86]  Thumbnail scrubbing.
[3938.18 --> 3938.46]  Hold on.
[3938.46 --> 3939.04]  The whole way.
[3939.24 --> 3940.00]  I want to see Brandon
[3940.00 --> 3940.92]  touch that camera.
[3941.52 --> 3942.48]  So let's skip to that part.
[3942.54 --> 3943.70]  Oh look at that buffer speed.
[3943.70 --> 3944.56]  Oh beautiful.
[3945.26 --> 3945.98]  Oh look at it.
[3946.04 --> 3946.72]  Look at it buffered.
[3946.82 --> 3947.24]  It's playing.
[3947.36 --> 3947.84]  Look at that.
[3948.00 --> 3948.30]  Oh wow.
[3948.30 --> 3948.62]  Oh yes.
[3948.68 --> 3949.86]  This isn't even 1080p either.
[3950.60 --> 3951.14]  Hold on.
[3953.40 --> 3954.30]  It takes a sec.
[3954.44 --> 3955.00]  Give it a sec.
[3955.08 --> 3955.46]  Give it a sec.
[3955.46 --> 3955.80]  Give it a second.
[3956.18 --> 3956.66]  Hold on.
[3956.72 --> 3956.90]  Wait.
[3957.02 --> 3957.52]  There you go.
[3957.52 --> 3958.06]  Oh oh.
[3958.44 --> 3958.84]  Oh.
[3958.84 --> 3960.06]  Oh we are live.
[3960.12 --> 3961.58]  We are live at 1080p.
[3961.62 --> 3962.12]  Look at Brandon
[3962.12 --> 3962.98]  touching that camera.
[3963.04 --> 3963.50]  Look at him.
[3963.60 --> 3964.88]  Oh he's like massaging
[3964.88 --> 3964.90]  the buttons.
[3964.90 --> 3965.68]  I could watch Brandon
[3965.68 --> 3966.66]  touch cameras all day.
[3966.66 --> 3968.42]  It's a touch screen.
[3968.76 --> 3969.08]  Wow.
[3969.64 --> 3970.44]  Brandon could touch
[3970.44 --> 3971.96]  my touch screen any day.
[3972.20 --> 3973.74]  Look it's a 50D versus a
[3973.74 --> 3973.96]  wait.
[3974.46 --> 3976.26]  Look it's a 60D versus a 5D.
[3977.34 --> 3977.76]  Anyways.
[3978.22 --> 3979.82]  So Eric has done
[3979.82 --> 3980.54]  a ton of work
[3980.54 --> 3982.42]  on like the CMS
[3982.42 --> 3984.18]  so that like Nick
[3984.18 --> 3984.70]  and other people
[3984.70 --> 3985.16]  at the office
[3985.16 --> 3986.30]  can actually upload
[3986.30 --> 3987.52]  videos to this thing.
[3987.52 --> 3990.10]  and he's done work
[3990.10 --> 3991.18]  in other spaces as well
[3991.18 --> 3991.66]  like getting the
[3991.66 --> 3993.10]  transcoding stuff to work.
[3993.76 --> 3994.74]  Cat Boiler has been
[3994.74 --> 3996.02]  all over the place
[3996.02 --> 3996.78]  in terms of how
[3996.78 --> 3997.52]  everything works.
[3997.76 --> 3998.44]  He's covering.
[3998.54 --> 3999.44]  Boiling cats over here.
[3999.50 --> 4000.98]  Boiling cats over there.
[4002.14 --> 4003.36]  Plucking cats that are
[4003.36 --> 4004.48]  already boiled over there.
[4004.62 --> 4005.52]  He theorized and
[4005.52 --> 4007.30]  actually did the whole
[4007.30 --> 4008.46]  like actual infrastructure
[4008.46 --> 4009.34]  which makes this work
[4009.34 --> 4010.44]  at all which is great.
[4011.86 --> 4012.78]  Mortis has been
[4012.78 --> 4013.82]  really helpful guiding
[4013.82 --> 4014.58]  over the whole time.
[4014.70 --> 4015.38]  He's like in school
[4015.38 --> 4016.12]  and stuff right now.
[4016.30 --> 4016.44]  Yeah.
[4016.44 --> 4018.90]  In his very limited
[4018.90 --> 4019.54]  spare time
[4019.54 --> 4020.58]  he's actually done a lot
[4020.58 --> 4021.24]  in trying to like
[4021.24 --> 4022.42]  help guide how it's
[4022.42 --> 4022.80]  going to integrate
[4022.80 --> 4023.36]  with the forum
[4023.36 --> 4024.08]  and all this kind of stuff
[4024.08 --> 4024.86]  and then he's going to be
[4024.86 --> 4025.98]  a much bigger part of it
[4025.98 --> 4027.68]  over the next little while
[4027.68 --> 4028.54]  once his school's
[4028.54 --> 4029.40]  in kind of a break.
[4030.52 --> 4031.92]  So people have been
[4031.92 --> 4033.18]  really busting their butts
[4033.18 --> 4034.62]  getting this working
[4034.62 --> 4035.72]  and it's working.
[4035.88 --> 4036.80]  Tech side of things
[4036.80 --> 4038.26]  these guys have been
[4038.26 --> 4039.40]  unbelievable.
[4039.84 --> 4039.96]  Yeah.
[4040.36 --> 4041.44]  But what we actually
[4041.44 --> 4042.74]  still haven't quite
[4042.74 --> 4043.48]  figured out
[4043.48 --> 4044.66]  is the business
[4044.66 --> 4045.74]  side of things.
[4046.08 --> 4046.42]  Oh yeah.
[4046.44 --> 4047.16]  What we're actually
[4047.16 --> 4048.26]  going to do
[4048.26 --> 4049.56]  with the technology.
[4049.94 --> 4050.58]  I haven't been worried
[4050.58 --> 4051.50]  about that part at all.
[4051.50 --> 4054.08]  So what we want
[4054.08 --> 4055.58]  because Floatplane Club
[4055.58 --> 4056.60]  is three bucks a month
[4056.60 --> 4057.20]  right now
[4057.20 --> 4058.38]  and it's only
[4058.38 --> 4058.96]  but it's only for
[4058.96 --> 4059.94]  Linus Media Group stuff.
[4060.04 --> 4060.96]  We have no way of
[4060.96 --> 4062.78]  having other content creators
[4062.78 --> 4063.46]  on the platform.
[4063.62 --> 4064.12]  Like it's just through
[4064.12 --> 4064.52]  the forum.
[4064.68 --> 4065.04]  Everything's
[4065.04 --> 4066.46]  someone just asked if
[4066.46 --> 4067.48]  Cat Boiler uses a
[4067.48 --> 4068.10]  sous vide cooker.
[4068.20 --> 4068.78]  Sous vide cookers
[4068.78 --> 4069.30]  don't boil.
[4069.50 --> 4070.12]  I just needed to
[4070.12 --> 4071.62]  You had to say that.
[4071.68 --> 4072.12]  I just had to
[4072.12 --> 4073.04]  Well I'm glad you
[4073.04 --> 4073.56]  clarified that.
[4073.56 --> 4073.98]  Thank you.
[4074.10 --> 4075.10]  I don't think they have
[4075.10 --> 4076.40]  a setting for whole cat
[4076.40 --> 4076.80]  anyway.
[4077.04 --> 4077.20]  No.
[4077.20 --> 4079.56]  Okay so we still
[4079.56 --> 4080.98]  don't know exactly
[4080.98 --> 4082.16]  what we're going to do
[4082.16 --> 4082.64]  with it
[4082.64 --> 4084.34]  but the objectives
[4084.34 --> 4085.86]  are pretty clear.
[4085.86 --> 4087.72]  We want members
[4087.72 --> 4089.06]  of the Floatplane Club
[4089.06 --> 4090.48]  which will likely
[4090.48 --> 4091.58]  serve the same
[4091.58 --> 4092.64]  kind of purpose
[4092.64 --> 4093.98]  at least for now
[4093.98 --> 4095.96]  for Linus Media Group
[4095.96 --> 4097.78]  as something like
[4097.78 --> 4099.30]  Patreon and Vessel
[4099.30 --> 4101.40]  kind of rolled into one.
[4102.32 --> 4104.02]  And we're going to be
[4104.02 --> 4105.10]  combining it
[4105.10 --> 4105.96]  with the existing
[4105.96 --> 4107.46]  contributor badge system
[4107.46 --> 4108.28]  that we had on the
[4108.28 --> 4109.56]  Linus Tech Tips forum
[4109.56 --> 4111.94]  so that you can start to
[4111.94 --> 4113.30]  So for example
[4113.30 --> 4114.40]  bronze, silver, and gold
[4114.40 --> 4115.62]  contributors already get
[4115.62 --> 4116.74]  Floatplane Club access
[4116.74 --> 4117.08]  Yeah.
[4117.28 --> 4118.48]  But bronze contributors
[4118.48 --> 4119.78]  who are paying $5 a month
[4119.78 --> 4121.12]  also get no banner ads
[4121.12 --> 4121.62]  on the forum.
[4121.84 --> 4122.68]  So we're going to try
[4122.68 --> 4123.42]  and figure out
[4123.42 --> 4124.78]  how to turn
[4124.78 --> 4126.60]  Floatplane Club
[4126.60 --> 4128.24]  and forum contributors
[4128.24 --> 4130.48]  into some kind of a larger
[4130.48 --> 4131.42]  sort of system
[4131.42 --> 4132.26]  that would take the place
[4132.26 --> 4132.86]  of what something like
[4132.86 --> 4133.28]  a Patreon
[4133.28 --> 4134.68]  and something like
[4134.68 --> 4135.64]  a Vessel would have
[4135.64 --> 4136.70]  in the past for us.
[4137.44 --> 4138.38]  So we're trying to think
[4138.38 --> 4139.52]  of like other ways
[4139.52 --> 4140.64]  to give benefits
[4140.64 --> 4142.20]  to other people
[4142.20 --> 4142.70]  on the platform
[4142.70 --> 4143.82]  and should we talk
[4143.82 --> 4144.72]  about some of those ideas?
[4144.90 --> 4145.98]  Yeah, so some of the benefits
[4145.98 --> 4147.00]  I'm just going to stick
[4147.00 --> 4148.34]  to Floatplane Club
[4148.34 --> 4149.20]  benefits for now.
[4149.40 --> 4150.62]  So some of those benefits
[4150.62 --> 4151.90]  include early access
[4151.90 --> 4152.58]  although
[4152.58 --> 4154.72]  what's kind of cool
[4154.72 --> 4156.38]  and also makes it
[4156.38 --> 4157.06]  not as compelling
[4157.06 --> 4157.76]  about this
[4157.76 --> 4158.96]  is that we are
[4158.96 --> 4160.20]  way dialing back
[4160.20 --> 4161.26]  the way that we're
[4161.26 --> 4162.82]  handling early access.
[4163.46 --> 4164.58]  So if we think
[4164.58 --> 4165.54]  something's time sensitive
[4165.54 --> 4167.58]  it's going simultaneous release
[4167.58 --> 4168.50]  because there's no
[4168.50 --> 4169.72]  contractual obligation
[4169.72 --> 4170.82]  anymore for us
[4170.82 --> 4172.42]  to release
[4172.42 --> 4173.80]  things one week
[4173.80 --> 4174.32]  early on
[4174.32 --> 4175.14]  on this platform.
[4175.34 --> 4176.54]  So that has been
[4176.54 --> 4177.88]  frustrating for both
[4177.88 --> 4178.90]  sides of the equation.
[4179.26 --> 4179.32]  Yeah.
[4179.60 --> 4180.70]  Sometimes there would be
[4180.70 --> 4181.54]  something that like
[4181.54 --> 4182.40]  we really thought
[4182.40 --> 4182.90]  should have been
[4182.90 --> 4183.56]  pretty timely
[4183.56 --> 4184.34]  but we had done
[4184.34 --> 4185.62]  too many simultaneous
[4185.62 --> 4187.12]  releases in a short window
[4187.12 --> 4188.04]  so we like
[4188.04 --> 4189.16]  couldn't release it
[4189.16 --> 4189.62]  simultaneous
[4189.62 --> 4190.24]  and it was like
[4190.24 --> 4191.34]  okay that's pretty rough
[4191.34 --> 4192.36]  people really need
[4192.36 --> 4193.14]  to see this on YouTube
[4193.14 --> 4193.86]  because it's like
[4193.86 --> 4194.54]  an embargo product
[4194.54 --> 4195.28]  that just came out.
[4195.74 --> 4196.86]  So benefit number one
[4196.86 --> 4198.20]  is we want to manage
[4198.20 --> 4199.42]  our releases better.
[4200.18 --> 4201.60]  And that's for everyone.
[4202.26 --> 4203.30]  Benefit number two
[4203.30 --> 4204.24]  is we want to provide
[4204.24 --> 4205.50]  a higher quality stream
[4205.50 --> 4206.44]  than what you can get
[4206.44 --> 4207.58]  on YouTube for free.
[4207.58 --> 4209.62]  And I mean that
[4209.62 --> 4210.34]  in the sense that
[4210.34 --> 4210.94]  it won't have any
[4210.94 --> 4212.06]  baked in ads anymore
[4212.06 --> 4212.84]  so our pre-roll
[4212.84 --> 4213.74]  and our integration ads
[4213.74 --> 4214.12]  at the end
[4214.12 --> 4214.86]  those will be gone
[4214.86 --> 4216.92]  and we want the quality
[4216.92 --> 4217.58]  to look better.
[4218.10 --> 4218.98]  Benefit number three
[4218.98 --> 4220.98]  is for the foreseeable future
[4220.98 --> 4221.84]  we want to continue
[4221.84 --> 4223.42]  to offer downloads
[4223.42 --> 4225.06]  DRM free
[4225.06 --> 4226.64]  to Floatplane Club members.
[4227.20 --> 4228.20]  So and what I would
[4228.20 --> 4229.22]  love to figure out
[4229.22 --> 4230.70]  and it's not complicated
[4230.70 --> 4231.74]  it's just a matter of
[4231.74 --> 4233.00]  getting it together
[4233.00 --> 4234.68]  is how to make it
[4234.68 --> 4235.50]  so people could just
[4235.50 --> 4236.90]  subscribe to an RSS feed
[4236.90 --> 4238.12]  download the video
[4238.12 --> 4240.20]  and drop it into Plex
[4240.20 --> 4241.04]  with all the metadata
[4241.04 --> 4242.42]  populated so they could
[4242.42 --> 4243.56]  watch it off their Plex server.
[4243.84 --> 4243.92]  Yeah.
[4244.10 --> 4245.20]  For Floatplane Club members
[4245.20 --> 4246.16]  we would consider
[4246.16 --> 4247.24]  for personal use
[4247.24 --> 4248.56]  that to be within
[4248.56 --> 4249.96]  the license
[4249.96 --> 4251.00]  that they have
[4251.00 --> 4252.08]  for the content.
[4252.20 --> 4252.92]  For personal use
[4252.92 --> 4253.28]  but yeah.
[4253.42 --> 4254.32]  That they're subscribed to
[4254.32 --> 4255.40]  for personal use.
[4256.26 --> 4257.34]  So DRM free
[4257.34 --> 4258.34]  is another one of the benefits
[4258.34 --> 4259.52]  that we want to have
[4259.52 --> 4261.00]  for this whole concept.
[4261.62 --> 4263.00]  And then there was another one
[4263.00 --> 4263.82]  that I was thinking
[4263.82 --> 4264.12]  right.
[4264.54 --> 4265.68]  And then finally
[4265.68 --> 4267.56]  at some point
[4267.56 --> 4268.20]  in the future
[4268.20 --> 4269.00]  we would like
[4269.00 --> 4269.88]  to find a way
[4269.88 --> 4271.48]  to make it ad supported
[4271.48 --> 4273.16]  and this is getting
[4273.16 --> 4274.20]  way ahead of ourselves
[4274.20 --> 4275.04]  I know.
[4275.68 --> 4276.68]  We would like to find
[4276.68 --> 4277.20]  some way
[4277.20 --> 4278.24]  to make it ad supported
[4278.24 --> 4279.90]  so that the benefit
[4279.90 --> 4281.22]  could be for us
[4281.22 --> 4282.56]  that we are able
[4282.56 --> 4283.54]  to pull people
[4283.54 --> 4284.26]  off platform.
[4284.48 --> 4285.04]  Ad supported
[4285.04 --> 4286.42]  for people who aren't
[4286.42 --> 4287.34]  Floatplane members.
[4287.46 --> 4287.60]  Yes.
[4287.90 --> 4288.68]  Just to make that
[4288.68 --> 4289.74]  optionally ad supported.
[4289.90 --> 4290.06]  Yeah.
[4290.46 --> 4291.96]  So like a free tier
[4291.96 --> 4292.80]  that is ad supported.
[4292.80 --> 4293.08]  Yeah.
[4293.64 --> 4294.68]  So the benefit
[4294.68 --> 4295.62]  for us would be
[4295.62 --> 4296.88]  that we actually
[4296.88 --> 4298.94]  engage directly
[4298.94 --> 4299.60]  with our viewers
[4299.60 --> 4300.10]  and the benefit
[4300.10 --> 4300.68]  for viewers
[4300.68 --> 4301.28]  would be
[4301.28 --> 4302.46]  no more YouTube
[4302.46 --> 4303.60]  subscription box
[4303.60 --> 4304.26]  nonsense.
[4305.48 --> 4307.14]  So that is
[4307.14 --> 4308.70]  that is
[4308.70 --> 4309.86]  where we are
[4309.86 --> 4310.76]  kind of
[4310.76 --> 4311.36]  And that's a big
[4311.36 --> 4311.72]  maybe.
[4312.16 --> 4313.10]  That's a huge
[4313.10 --> 4313.76]  maybe because
[4313.76 --> 4314.24]  it depends
[4314.24 --> 4314.84]  we would probably
[4314.84 --> 4315.50]  have to double
[4315.50 --> 4316.76]  or triple our sales team.
[4316.96 --> 4317.82]  We would have to get
[4317.82 --> 4318.46]  other creators
[4318.46 --> 4319.12]  on board.
[4319.12 --> 4320.26]  There would be
[4320.26 --> 4321.18]  a lot of things
[4321.18 --> 4321.98]  we would have to do
[4321.98 --> 4323.56]  but we have
[4323.56 --> 4325.24]  we have some
[4325.24 --> 4325.98]  interesting tech
[4325.98 --> 4326.76]  we just need to figure
[4326.76 --> 4327.58]  out how to do with it
[4327.58 --> 4328.02]  what to
[4328.02 --> 4328.96]  how to do with it
[4328.96 --> 4330.46]  how to English it
[4330.46 --> 4331.08]  at all.
[4332.76 --> 4333.88]  And that's where
[4333.88 --> 4334.98]  that's kind of
[4334.98 --> 4335.40]  that's kind of
[4335.40 --> 4336.10]  where we're at on it.
[4336.40 --> 4337.28]  I haven't actually
[4337.28 --> 4338.08]  been paying close
[4338.08 --> 4338.96]  attention to
[4338.96 --> 4339.96]  what Twitch chat
[4339.96 --> 4340.52]  has had to say
[4340.52 --> 4340.90]  about it
[4340.90 --> 4343.32]  but basically
[4343.32 --> 4346.38]  yeah I mean
[4346.38 --> 4347.12]  what else is there
[4347.12 --> 4347.44]  to say?
[4347.44 --> 4347.74]  I mean
[4347.74 --> 4348.84]  there's a lot of stuff
[4348.84 --> 4349.64]  still to be worked on
[4349.64 --> 4350.46]  like one thing
[4350.46 --> 4351.38]  is if you're
[4351.38 --> 4352.36]  if you load
[4352.36 --> 4353.36]  the thread
[4353.36 --> 4354.72]  and you look at
[4354.72 --> 4355.44]  the video and stuff
[4355.44 --> 4356.06]  it all works
[4356.06 --> 4357.08]  and then if you go
[4357.08 --> 4358.14]  to like the last
[4358.14 --> 4358.86]  page of the thread
[4358.86 --> 4359.46]  and then back to
[4359.46 --> 4359.98]  the first page
[4359.98 --> 4360.36]  of the thread
[4360.36 --> 4361.20]  it won't work anymore
[4361.20 --> 4362.02]  you have to refresh
[4362.02 --> 4362.72]  yeah and like
[4362.72 --> 4363.58]  we know why
[4363.58 --> 4365.50]  and we'll figure
[4365.50 --> 4366.00]  it out
[4366.00 --> 4368.06]  the downloads
[4368.06 --> 4368.82]  thing is a little
[4368.82 --> 4369.90]  janky right now
[4369.90 --> 4371.06]  but that is actually
[4371.06 --> 4371.84]  very close to being
[4371.84 --> 4372.14]  finished
[4372.14 --> 4372.88]  Catbuller's been
[4372.88 --> 4373.68]  figuring that out
[4373.68 --> 4375.04]  just like everything
[4375.04 --> 4375.42]  else
[4375.42 --> 4377.82]  so like there's
[4377.82 --> 4378.62]  there's still a bunch
[4378.62 --> 4379.50]  of work to be done
[4379.50 --> 4380.62]  but it's
[4380.62 --> 4382.10]  it's coming along
[4382.10 --> 4383.18]  incredibly fast
[4383.18 --> 4384.10]  and it's already
[4384.10 --> 4385.58]  to be completely honest
[4385.58 --> 4387.00]  a pretty good
[4387.00 --> 4387.66]  experience
[4387.66 --> 4388.90]  there are some
[4388.90 --> 4389.22]  problems
[4389.22 --> 4389.66]  like I know
[4389.66 --> 4391.30]  Jake was using
[4391.30 --> 4392.64]  an iPhone 6s
[4392.64 --> 4394.10]  with Chrome installed
[4394.10 --> 4395.34]  and it didn't seem
[4395.34 --> 4396.08]  to work for him
[4396.08 --> 4396.72]  so there's like
[4396.72 --> 4397.58]  some use cases
[4397.58 --> 4398.66]  that don't work
[4398.66 --> 4399.44]  super awesome
[4399.44 --> 4401.30]  I wonder if they
[4401.30 --> 4401.86]  have changed
[4401.86 --> 4402.58]  some stuff
[4402.58 --> 4404.26]  what do you mean
[4404.26 --> 4406.84]  because this isn't
[4406.84 --> 4407.72]  playing on Safari
[4407.72 --> 4408.28]  right now either
[4408.28 --> 4408.92]  and I played one
[4408.92 --> 4409.24]  yesterday
[4409.24 --> 4410.50]  one thing that we
[4410.50 --> 4411.20]  need to do is
[4411.20 --> 4412.14]  get a dev server
[4412.14 --> 4415.30]  because we're doing
[4415.30 --> 4416.24]  live changes
[4416.24 --> 4417.18]  on everything
[4417.18 --> 4418.14]  so when things
[4418.14 --> 4418.94]  break it's just
[4418.94 --> 4420.22]  like oh crap
[4420.22 --> 4421.92]  everyone has that
[4421.92 --> 4422.84]  version right now
[4422.84 --> 4424.26]  so we'll be getting
[4424.26 --> 4425.16]  a dev server soon
[4425.16 --> 4426.00]  it's still all
[4426.00 --> 4426.64]  very early on
[4426.64 --> 4427.16]  we're what like
[4427.16 --> 4427.98]  three weeks in
[4427.98 --> 4430.06]  what did it work
[4430.06 --> 4430.72]  no that was a
[4430.72 --> 4431.12]  different thing
[4431.12 --> 4431.78]  sorry I was looking
[4431.78 --> 4432.28]  at something else
[4432.28 --> 4433.02]  okay that was a
[4433.02 --> 4433.50]  YouTube video
[4433.50 --> 4434.08]  because I definitely
[4434.08 --> 4434.90]  showed this to my
[4434.90 --> 4435.80]  dad like the other
[4435.80 --> 4436.74]  day yeah
[4436.74 --> 4437.78]  so I don't know
[4437.78 --> 4438.90]  still figuring it
[4438.90 --> 4439.44]  out but it's
[4439.44 --> 4439.86]  coming along
[4439.86 --> 4441.16]  incredibly fast
[4441.16 --> 4444.34]  and on a desktop
[4444.34 --> 4445.24]  at least it seems
[4445.24 --> 4446.02]  to work fairly well
[4446.02 --> 4446.78]  if you do have a
[4446.78 --> 4447.80]  problem refresh the
[4447.80 --> 4448.74]  page if that doesn't
[4448.74 --> 4450.20]  fix it let us know
[4450.20 --> 4450.66]  yeah
[4450.66 --> 4453.28]  pretty much
[4453.28 --> 4454.06]  it definitely works
[4454.06 --> 4454.64]  on Android
[4454.64 --> 4456.16]  so if you're like
[4456.16 --> 4458.96]  like Chrome on
[4458.96 --> 4461.34]  Android or Chrome
[4461.34 --> 4462.86]  on Windows then
[4462.86 --> 4463.20]  you're good
[4463.20 --> 4463.96]  yeah
[4463.96 --> 4465.76]  those ones are the
[4465.76 --> 4467.14]  main tested things
[4467.14 --> 4468.22]  which is probably
[4468.22 --> 4468.80]  the most of our
[4468.80 --> 4469.50]  views so yeah
[4469.50 --> 4472.16]  I just I wanted to
[4472.16 --> 4473.02]  demo it working on
[4473.02 --> 4474.16]  mobile and I was
[4474.16 --> 4474.78]  trying to do that
[4474.78 --> 4475.60]  and it didn't fly
[4475.60 --> 4478.24]  here we go
[4478.24 --> 4478.86]  woo
[4478.86 --> 4480.16]  look at it go
[4480.16 --> 4481.18]  1080p mobile
[4481.18 --> 4482.00]  yay
[4482.00 --> 4483.16]  so it's working on
[4483.16 --> 4483.44]  Android
[4483.44 --> 4484.44]  yeah
[4484.44 --> 4485.46]  which is why I
[4485.46 --> 4486.20]  always carry an
[4486.20 --> 4486.90]  iPhone and an
[4486.90 --> 4487.46]  Android phone
[4487.46 --> 4488.90]  so I think
[4488.90 --> 4489.54]  everyone should do
[4489.54 --> 4490.12]  that
[4490.12 --> 4491.62]  for float plane
[4491.62 --> 4492.18]  that way I can
[4492.18 --> 4493.08]  have better and a
[4493.08 --> 4493.72]  better Instagram
[4493.72 --> 4494.76]  experience on my
[4494.76 --> 4495.16]  iPhone
[4495.16 --> 4495.72]  there you go
[4495.72 --> 4496.82]  and I can watch
[4496.82 --> 4497.60]  float plane videos
[4497.60 --> 4499.40]  on my Android phone
[4499.40 --> 4500.26]  we'll figure that
[4500.26 --> 4501.66]  out at some point
[4501.66 --> 4504.00]  okay
[4504.00 --> 4504.38]  yeah
[4504.38 --> 4505.66]  so do we have
[4505.66 --> 4506.40]  any like actual
[4506.40 --> 4507.04]  topics for this
[4507.04 --> 4507.30]  week
[4507.30 --> 4510.26]  no
[4510.26 --> 4511.46]  blah blah blah
[4511.46 --> 4511.74]  blah blah
[4511.74 --> 4512.42]  Xbox One
[4512.42 --> 4513.16]  streaming comes to
[4513.16 --> 4513.96]  the Oculus Rift
[4513.96 --> 4515.16]  on December 12th
[4515.16 --> 4518.04]  does anyone care
[4518.04 --> 4519.90]  I mean
[4519.90 --> 4522.32]  I don't know
[4522.32 --> 4523.96]  free update
[4523.96 --> 4524.94]  well it better be
[4524.94 --> 4526.00]  free I don't think
[4526.00 --> 4526.64]  anyone's gonna pay
[4526.64 --> 4527.42]  for it
[4527.42 --> 4528.62]  I really really hate
[4528.62 --> 4529.90]  this like kind of
[4529.90 --> 4530.68]  description of virtual
[4530.68 --> 4531.02]  reality
[4531.02 --> 4532.56]  the free update
[4532.56 --> 4533.82]  will allow users to
[4533.82 --> 4534.80]  play Xbox One games
[4534.80 --> 4535.54]  in front of a
[4535.54 --> 4537.64]  huge virtual display
[4537.64 --> 4540.42]  have you ever had
[4540.42 --> 4541.70]  that feeling in VR
[4541.70 --> 4542.54]  and you're like
[4542.54 --> 4543.42]  wow this is a big
[4543.42 --> 4543.88]  screen
[4543.88 --> 4544.84]  like have you ever
[4544.84 --> 4545.46]  felt that
[4545.46 --> 4546.38]  yeah actually
[4546.38 --> 4546.70]  really
[4546.70 --> 4547.34]  yeah
[4547.34 --> 4548.50]  yeah I'll buy that
[4548.50 --> 4549.50]  I've had the
[4549.50 --> 4550.44]  experience that this
[4550.44 --> 4551.28]  is a huge
[4551.28 --> 4552.72]  relatively low
[4552.72 --> 4553.90]  definition virtual
[4553.90 --> 4554.46]  display
[4554.46 --> 4556.04]  like in like in
[4556.04 --> 4556.86]  like a theater
[4556.86 --> 4557.86]  mode
[4557.86 --> 4559.00]  I hate theater
[4559.00 --> 4559.22]  mode
[4559.22 --> 4559.86]  yeah no I don't
[4559.86 --> 4560.44]  I didn't say I
[4560.44 --> 4561.08]  like it I just
[4561.08 --> 4561.86]  said I felt like it
[4561.86 --> 4562.46]  was a really big
[4562.46 --> 4563.16]  virtual display
[4563.16 --> 4563.88]  I didn't think it
[4563.88 --> 4564.34]  was a great
[4564.34 --> 4564.92]  experience
[4564.92 --> 4565.42]  yeah
[4565.42 --> 4566.80]  so like is that
[4566.80 --> 4567.30]  the view
[4567.30 --> 4568.02]  because that's
[4568.02 --> 4568.56]  rough
[4568.56 --> 4569.16]  yeah I think
[4569.16 --> 4569.78]  it's supposed to
[4569.78 --> 4570.30]  be like
[4570.30 --> 4571.86]  I think it's
[4571.86 --> 4572.38]  you're supposed to
[4572.38 --> 4572.98]  be like sitting
[4572.98 --> 4573.60]  in like a
[4573.60 --> 4574.70]  cool like
[4574.70 --> 4575.72]  harbor or
[4575.72 --> 4576.16]  something and
[4576.16 --> 4576.56]  then you play
[4576.56 --> 4577.02]  a game on
[4577.02 --> 4578.06]  like it
[4578.06 --> 4579.94]  yeah I don't
[4579.94 --> 4580.36]  think it's a
[4580.36 --> 4580.94]  very I don't
[4580.94 --> 4581.44]  think a lot of
[4581.44 --> 4581.92]  people are gonna
[4581.92 --> 4582.38]  do that
[4582.38 --> 4582.90]  it's like yes
[4582.90 --> 4583.44]  I want something
[4583.44 --> 4584.00]  on my face
[4584.00 --> 4584.58]  so I can play
[4584.58 --> 4585.38]  Xbox games
[4585.38 --> 4586.00]  and like you
[4586.00 --> 4586.94]  own a Rift
[4586.94 --> 4588.60]  meaning and
[4588.60 --> 4589.34]  that was Forza
[4589.34 --> 4590.52]  so you own a
[4590.52 --> 4592.52]  Rift and a PC
[4592.52 --> 4593.26]  and a game that
[4593.26 --> 4593.90]  works on PC
[4593.90 --> 4594.62]  but you're gonna
[4594.62 --> 4595.36]  run it on your
[4595.36 --> 4597.06]  Xbox and use
[4597.06 --> 4597.56]  your Rift on
[4597.56 --> 4598.02]  your Xbox
[4598.02 --> 4600.20]  and play it
[4600.20 --> 4601.04]  in that house
[4601.04 --> 4601.46]  thing
[4601.46 --> 4604.04]  what?
[4604.74 --> 4605.82]  like I don't
[4605.82 --> 4606.10]  know
[4606.10 --> 4607.70]  ugh
[4607.70 --> 4609.28]  um
[4609.28 --> 4610.50]  wow
[4610.50 --> 4611.84]  okay
[4611.84 --> 4612.90]  this the
[4612.90 --> 4613.42]  original article
[4613.42 --> 4614.22]  here is from
[4614.22 --> 4615.34]  the next web
[4615.34 --> 4617.16]  dot com
[4617.16 --> 4618.86]  apparently you
[4618.86 --> 4619.70]  can delete
[4619.70 --> 4620.64]  yourself from
[4620.64 --> 4621.08]  the internet
[4621.08 --> 4621.70]  by pressing
[4621.70 --> 4622.26]  this button
[4622.26 --> 4624.20]  instantly get a
[4624.20 --> 4624.58]  list of your
[4624.58 --> 4625.30]  accounts matched
[4625.30 --> 4625.84]  with direct
[4625.84 --> 4626.64]  links to delete
[4626.64 --> 4626.88]  them
[4626.88 --> 4627.92]  sign in with
[4627.92 --> 4628.24]  Google
[4628.24 --> 4629.86]  um
[4629.86 --> 4631.24]  hey another
[4631.24 --> 4631.74]  Linus
[4631.74 --> 4634.66]  nice there you
[4634.66 --> 4635.00]  go
[4635.00 --> 4636.74]  I think it's
[4636.74 --> 4637.12]  Linus
[4637.12 --> 4638.96]  in Sweden
[4638.96 --> 4640.82]  so yeah he's
[4640.82 --> 4641.20]  Swedish
[4641.20 --> 4642.36]  just like all the
[4642.36 --> 4643.16]  other Linus's
[4643.16 --> 4643.56]  that would be
[4643.56 --> 4644.12]  kind of cool
[4644.12 --> 4644.54]  actually
[4644.54 --> 4645.04]  because you
[4645.04 --> 4645.76]  could get the
[4645.76 --> 4646.64]  links for like
[4646.64 --> 4648.30]  everything and
[4648.30 --> 4648.82]  not necessarily
[4648.82 --> 4649.52]  click all of
[4649.52 --> 4649.72]  them
[4649.72 --> 4651.54]  yeah so you
[4651.54 --> 4652.14]  log in with
[4652.14 --> 4652.46]  your Google
[4652.46 --> 4652.92]  account it
[4652.92 --> 4653.50]  scans for apps
[4653.50 --> 4653.94]  and services
[4653.94 --> 4654.42]  you've created
[4654.42 --> 4655.04]  an account for
[4655.04 --> 4656.04]  every account it
[4656.04 --> 4656.76]  finds gets paired
[4656.76 --> 4657.30]  with an easy
[4657.30 --> 4657.92]  delete link
[4657.92 --> 4658.52]  pointing to the
[4658.52 --> 4659.24]  unsubscribe page
[4659.24 --> 4659.80]  for that service
[4659.80 --> 4660.26]  within a few
[4660.26 --> 4660.96]  clicks you can be
[4660.96 --> 4661.52]  freed from it
[4661.52 --> 4662.38]  sounds great in
[4662.38 --> 4662.90]  theory but I
[4662.90 --> 4663.30]  haven't actually
[4663.30 --> 4664.00]  tried it so there
[4664.00 --> 4664.32]  you go
[4664.32 --> 4665.18]  speaking of things
[4665.18 --> 4665.70]  that sound great

[4731.62 --> 4732.14]  Everything Award
[4732.14 --> 4732.64]  is apparently
[4732.64 --> 4733.34]  No Man's Sky
[4733.34 --> 4734.58]  but I still
[4734.58 --> 4735.14]  think that's
[4735.14 --> 4735.64]  inaccurate
[4735.64 --> 4736.20]  because that
[4736.20 --> 4736.50]  would be
[4736.50 --> 4736.84]  more
[4736.84 --> 4737.22]  we didn't
[4737.22 --> 4737.50]  think of
[4737.50 --> 4737.78]  anything
[4737.78 --> 4738.28]  yeah
[4738.28 --> 4739.24]  and we
[4739.24 --> 4739.56]  didn't do
[4739.56 --> 4739.86]  it either
[4739.86 --> 4740.40]  yeah
[4740.40 --> 4741.56]  okay
[4741.56 --> 4742.60]  well now we're all
[4742.60 --> 4743.34]  on the same page
[4743.34 --> 4743.98]  we thought about
[4743.98 --> 4744.64]  a lot of stuff
[4744.64 --> 4745.34]  yeah
[4745.34 --> 4746.12]  and then stopped
[4746.12 --> 4746.52]  there
[4746.52 --> 4748.12]  the award
[4748.12 --> 4750.24]  we had a bunch
[4750.24 --> 4750.32]  we had a bunch of
[4750.32 --> 4750.70]  ideas
[4750.70 --> 4751.16]  and a bunch of
[4751.16 --> 4751.84]  people told us
[4751.84 --> 4752.50]  they were really
[4752.50 --> 4752.68]  good
[4752.68 --> 4754.46]  and we were like
[4754.46 --> 4755.00]  you know what
[4755.00 --> 4755.88]  those are good
[4755.88 --> 4756.34]  ideas
[4756.34 --> 4758.64]  we contemplated
[4758.64 --> 4758.98]  that
[4758.98 --> 4759.56]  and then we
[4759.56 --> 4759.96]  sold them
[4759.96 --> 4760.30]  the other
[4760.30 --> 4764.24]  wow why is the
[4764.24 --> 4765.44]  intro running at like
[4765.44 --> 4766.66]  the court
[4766.66 --> 4769.64]  why is my life
[4769.64 --> 4769.98]  hard
[4769.98 --> 4772.14]  why does nothing
[4772.14 --> 4772.50]  work
[4772.50 --> 4773.92]  why
[4773.92 --> 4782.70]  why
