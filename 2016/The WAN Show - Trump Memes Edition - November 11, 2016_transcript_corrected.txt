[0.00 → 1.16] Emma's ride. One second.
[1.70 → 6.88] It is WAN showtime again. Sorry, I had actually already clicked it before...
[6.88 → 8.88] All good. That name is public. Everything is cool.
[8.90 → 12.18] Before I asked if you were ready and...
[12.18 → 13.62] It's Trump's America. Do whatever you want.
[13.74 → 15.20] It is Trump's America.
[15.22 → 15.52] It's okay.
[16.04 → 18.88] It is Trump's America as of January 20th.
[19.02 → 23.38] And this is going to be the Trump-themed WAN show.
[23.46 → 25.28] We have a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[25.28 → 30.28] Okay. First up, our audio finally works.
[31.52 → 33.26] We got an old gray cable.
[33.58 → 33.94] Yes.
[34.14 → 38.76] Which isn't nearly as long as the new nicely braided cable that we had.
[38.98 → 39.24] Nope.
[39.46 → 42.78] So we got the beat up, a little bit grungy with some stains on it.
[42.90 → 44.72] Yep. But thicker is always better.
[45.20 → 45.48] Yeah.
[45.62 → 46.54] When it comes to cables.
[46.54 → 52.42] I mean, if we could get USB cables that were like four inches in diameter, that would be great.
[52.42 → 57.06] Have you seen those like subterranean, intercontinental...
[57.06 → 57.84] USB cables?
[58.14 → 58.40] Yeah.
[59.64 → 59.92] Right.
[59.98 → 60.42] They're pretty big.
[60.72 → 63.28] They're like this big.
[63.78 → 69.38] I mean, running over like a, you know, KVM over IP or whatever, that's stupid.
[69.80 → 70.00] Yep.
[70.08 → 72.14] You should just run huge USB cables.
[72.34 → 72.52] Yeah.
[73.36 → 77.54] Server interconnects where it's like a quarter the size of the server, and it just plugs into the bottom.
[78.16 → 78.88] Never have downtime.
[79.20 → 81.50] Yep. We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[81.50 → 88.64] One of them is that I am waiting to be able to log into Twitch TV so that I can post a thing in the Twitch chat.
[89.26 → 89.52] Nice.
[90.38 → 91.52] Which would be great.
[91.90 → 93.50] And another one is that...
[94.32 → 95.10] Wrong.
[95.44 → 96.26] Wrong. Yes.
[96.66 → 97.50] Donald Trump.
[97.78 → 101.02] I was going to say Hillary Trump, which I don't know.
[101.20 → 101.52] I don't know.
[101.62 → 103.68] Wouldn't that be an interesting outcome?
[103.90 → 107.18] Can you imagine all the worst things about both of them?
[107.18 → 112.16] The world would just implode.
[112.18 → 114.80] It's like a Donald Trump that was corrupt and untrustworthy.
[115.06 → 115.42] Oh.
[117.68 → 118.18] And what?
[119.58 → 123.22] You know what's hilarious is this is the third time we've had to do the intro to the show.
[123.40 → 124.94] And every one of them has been unique.
[125.10 → 126.38] And every one of them has been unique.
[126.92 → 128.56] Trump is an end...
[128.56 → 130.82] He's a bottomless pit of memes.
[130.82 → 131.12] Wrong.
[132.10 → 132.88] Bottomless pit of memes.
[133.24 → 133.26] Wrong.
[137.12 → 138.46] He's the best pit of memes.
[139.66 → 140.02] The best.
[140.02 → 143.92] So let's go ahead and let's just roll the intro.
[144.80 → 145.96] We've got nothing this week.
[146.14 → 147.82] We don't even have a working show yet.
[147.82 → 148.08] Wrong.
[148.08 → 175.88] START SIMPLY!
[175.88 → 180.88] Squarespace, Mack Weldon, and Savage Jerky.
[183.40 → 186.68] P.S. The Sriracha Bacon is amazing, Colton.
[188.20 → 189.04] Thank you, Colton.
[189.04 → 193.00] But actually, Colton, nobody cares about your endorsement.
[193.00 → 197.52] That is why people pay us for mine and Luke's endorsement
[197.52 → 198.74] and not yours.
[199.82 → 204.04] So yeah, the Smackdown just got laid.
[205.88 → 208.00] No one cares what you think, Colton. Thank you.
[208.16 → 208.52] Correct.
[209.18 → 212.54] All right, so let's go ahead and jump right into our topics.
[212.66 → 215.08] Our first topic is pretty straightforward.
[216.04 → 219.30] Those of you who are watching live will have seen this already,
[219.90 → 222.38] and the joke will be somewhat ruined here.
[222.38 → 225.62] But for the rest of you, there you have it.
[225.84 → 226.80] U.S. election.
[227.68 → 230.12] Yes, yes, that did happen.
[231.20 → 233.02] Oh, Canada.
[233.42 → 234.48] Yes, Trump won.
[234.48 → 242.64] And I have never felt better about being Canadian than I do today.
[244.00 → 248.82] There were no giant, insane protests after our last election.
[249.00 → 249.84] That's true.
[250.10 → 251.74] Honestly, it was pretty civil.
[252.30 → 252.62] Yep.
[253.14 → 257.14] With that said, if we were to lose a hockey game, for example,
[257.36 → 257.46] Oh.
[258.14 → 258.62] That.
[259.22 → 260.48] Don't even go there.
[260.48 → 263.30] That is a whole other ball of wax.
[263.44 → 263.94] Or win.
[264.30 → 265.20] Leader of our country.
[265.44 → 265.80] Yeah, that's right.
[266.98 → 268.08] Might even be worse.
[268.26 → 272.48] To be clear, just because I'm having a proud Canadian moment right now
[272.48 → 276.24] doesn't mean I don't occasionally have embarrassed Canadian moments.
[276.28 → 277.26] How are them Canucks doing?
[277.46 → 279.16] And apologetic Canadian moments.
[279.36 → 280.94] In that game that we like a lot.
[281.04 → 282.50] How are they doing right now?
[282.50 → 286.94] I have many apologetic Canadian moments, but that's part of the whole shtick.
[289.66 → 291.80] Matthew TG in the Twitch chat says,
[291.96 → 293.78] If Hillary had won, there would be no protests.
[293.90 → 295.22] Are you kidding?
[295.76 → 296.20] That's.
[296.72 → 302.58] No matter which way this went, there were going to be protests, my friend.
[302.58 → 303.06] Oh, man.
[303.72 → 305.74] There were absolutely going to be protests.
[306.06 → 306.42] Yeah.
[306.56 → 307.50] That was a thing.
[308.36 → 310.66] And that.
[311.72 → 313.10] Got people talking about field hockey.
[313.20 → 314.38] Is field hockey even a sport?
[314.68 → 314.94] No.
[315.22 → 315.74] Ice hockey.
[315.82 → 317.80] I know field hockey is a sport.
[318.78 → 321.84] It's just one that nobody anywhere cares about.
[323.18 → 326.52] It's not even one of those sports like cricket,
[326.52 → 332.66] where it's like a huge deal in India and like Britain and nowhere else.
[333.06 → 335.38] Field hockey is just irrelevant.
[335.68 → 335.88] Yeah.
[336.24 → 336.72] Sorry.
[336.92 → 338.60] Sorry to the one person watching.
[338.60 → 340.56] I wish lacrosse mattered more.
[340.76 → 343.42] After we did our nerd sports thing.
[343.48 → 344.08] Lacrosse is cool.
[344.18 → 346.08] I legitimately really tried to find a league.
[347.26 → 348.08] There's like nothing.
[348.28 → 349.56] That's my age.
[349.72 → 352.98] The only option I had was joining the professional team,
[353.02 → 355.02] which I'm clearly not good enough to join.
[355.48 → 356.08] Yeah.
[356.28 → 356.86] I think that's.
[357.38 → 358.70] Speaking of nerd sports.
[358.84 → 359.20] Okay.
[359.48 → 362.96] We actually do have some news items for this week.
[362.96 → 363.72] Hell yeah.
[364.28 → 369.94] So those of you who have been paying attention to vessel.com
[369.94 → 371.58] and what's been going on with that.
[372.18 → 372.76] What does it do now?
[373.34 → 377.52] You may have noticed that vessel.com doesn't exist anymore.
[378.98 → 381.98] I mean, they still apparently have the page up.
[382.16 → 382.76] Kind of.
[382.86 → 384.86] It's a parked page on like the goodbye letter.
[384.86 → 386.92] That says goodbye forever.
[387.66 → 389.06] Yesterday we signed the doxy.
[389.20 → 389.56] They didn't even.
[389.94 → 390.38] Yesterday.
[390.72 → 391.10] Yesterday.
[391.10 → 392.12] Nice.
[392.80 → 393.78] I mean, I guess they kind of expect you to.
[393.78 → 394.98] Yesterday, October 26.
[395.24 → 395.40] Yeah.
[395.50 → 395.74] Yesterday.
[397.66 → 400.54] That's going to be my yesterday forever.
[401.20 → 401.72] Wrong.
[404.36 → 405.80] Crooked Richard and me.
[407.08 → 409.70] Can't tell you the date we signed the document.
[410.34 → 411.28] Lion Richard.
[411.54 → 412.06] Yesterday.
[412.06 → 412.42] Yesterday.
[415.74 → 416.48] Oh, man.
[416.48 → 417.12] Oh, man.
[417.70 → 421.72] What was the thing that we added to that script that you were working on?
[421.72 → 422.28] Nasty and deplorable?
[423.12 → 423.52] Yeah.
[423.66 → 425.64] Nasty and deplorable people.
[426.32 → 427.44] Deplorable nasties.
[428.38 → 430.02] That's the kind of world we live in.
[430.68 → 431.44] Oh, man.
[431.62 → 433.04] I love them all.
[433.26 → 433.78] So good.
[433.84 → 435.10] As a Canadian, I love them all.
[435.16 → 435.38] Anyway.
[435.60 → 435.86] Infinite memes.
[435.86 → 442.08] So the point is, you know what's hilarious about this is I wanted to load up an episode
[442.08 → 443.04] of Nerd Sports.
[443.74 → 444.46] Oh, but you can't.
[444.46 → 447.16] So that I could show it on screen.
[448.32 → 449.10] Oh, but you can.
[449.32 → 450.28] Is that the news?
[450.60 → 451.68] Well, hold on a second.
[451.80 → 455.78] I don't know where to find it because normally I would just go on Vessel and bring it down.
[459.34 → 461.24] Oh, that's not a thing anymore.
[461.50 → 462.34] Hey, more logging.
[462.84 → 463.76] Security is good.
[463.76 → 465.14] So, you know what?
[465.26 → 468.36] Oh, you just got to keep telling yourself that every time you have to go through all
[468.36 → 469.52] the steps to log into anything.
[469.76 → 470.04] I know.
[470.20 → 471.30] It is so frustrating.
[471.66 → 472.94] Especially when you have like three factors.
[473.12 → 479.76] You know what's the stupidest part of all of these conversations is like ultimately the
[479.76 → 486.04] last time we got broken into had nothing to do with like bad security practices.
[486.24 → 487.90] Could they have been better?
[488.54 → 489.04] Yes.
[489.46 → 490.52] Are they better now?
[491.00 → 491.48] Yes.
[491.48 → 495.06] Are they incredibly inconvenient?
[495.98 → 496.40] Yes.
[499.28 → 500.12] Yes, they are.
[500.12 → 503.96] I think we might have actually one of the least convenient security setups that you could
[503.96 → 504.28] have.
[505.04 → 509.06] It is pretty darn difficult to break down, which is not a challenge.
[509.30 → 511.88] I'm sure it could be done and good for you.
[512.88 → 514.00] But, uh...
[514.00 → 514.72] Yeah.
[515.30 → 515.66] Yeah.
[515.98 → 517.28] Don't worry about that one.
[517.42 → 518.38] Yeah, but it is...
[518.38 → 518.60] That's cool.
[518.60 → 519.04] It is...
[519.04 → 520.60] He's saying it's a challenge for us.
[520.80 → 521.16] Yes.
[521.52 → 523.68] Oh, it's definitely a challenge for us.
[523.72 → 524.00] Okay.
[524.52 → 525.50] Oh, this is great.
[525.52 → 526.40] Does that have to stay?
[526.40 → 527.66] You know what we should do?
[528.36 → 528.96] Is we should...
[528.96 → 529.28] Just leave it?
[529.46 → 531.12] We should leave the Vessel graphic.
[531.42 → 533.24] You have it just like glitch out as it starts to play.
[533.24 → 533.92] At the beginning of the video.
[534.08 → 535.64] Only on Vessel, except not.
[535.64 → 540.62] So this is the curling episode where we played against a junior team, which is fantastic.
[542.00 → 543.36] By the way, they're fantastic.
[543.90 → 544.50] We're not.
[544.84 → 545.80] But no spoilers.
[546.36 → 549.38] I talked to my dad, who knows the team.
[550.00 → 552.34] He's actually played against the team that you guys played against.
[552.38 → 552.48] Yeah.
[552.48 → 553.90] Like a more real match.
[554.04 → 554.20] Yeah.
[554.20 → 560.20] And he said that the captain of their team said that the worst thing about you guys,
[560.28 → 563.68] because this was the only one that I missed, the worst thing about you guys was that you
[563.68 → 565.70] just refused to properly communicate.
[566.36 → 571.30] And I watched the episode, and it's actually like, it's entertaining enough that you have
[571.30 → 574.70] to watch the whole thing, but then it's actually difficult to watch just because it's like,
[575.70 → 576.34] wow.
[576.34 → 580.06] How is this possibly happening?
[580.78 → 584.30] We wouldn't have had to communicate so much if my teammates hadn't been so incompetent.
[584.76 → 587.10] You know, that's not too far off the base.
[588.94 → 590.28] After watching it, yeah.
[590.84 → 591.08] Yeah.
[591.50 → 591.70] Yeah.
[592.04 → 592.48] Okay.
[592.60 → 593.72] You know what?
[593.88 → 594.66] Just, okay.
[594.74 → 595.42] Watch it for Taryn.
[595.50 → 600.92] We're going to say to watch it, but we're going to say that with the accompanying news that
[600.92 → 610.46] we have purchased back from the bloated corpse that was once vessel.com, the rights to rebroadcast
[610.46 → 614.16] nerd sports wherever we see fit in whatever way we see fit.
[614.32 → 619.28] And you can expect that to be coming soon to a YouTube near you.
[619.36 → 619.68] Nice.
[619.68 → 622.88] Complete with the only one vessel title screen.
[624.94 → 625.70] Oh God.
[625.92 → 626.78] Should we put this on LTT?
[627.44 → 627.96] Or is it CSF?
[627.96 → 629.96] No, I think we'll probably throw it on Super fund.
[630.10 → 630.34] Okay.
[630.34 → 633.62] I think it'll probably go in the float plane club first though.
[634.16 → 634.64] Nice.
[634.94 → 638.48] Just so that if there's a way to do that.
[639.00 → 639.70] There is.
[640.14 → 640.70] Is there a way to do that?
[640.70 → 642.46] But we just shouldn't talk about that yet.
[642.46 → 642.74] Right.
[643.36 → 643.84] Okay.
[644.54 → 646.24] The secret float plane club.
[646.32 → 647.72] Don't look for what that is.
[647.84 → 648.06] Yeah.
[648.20 → 648.84] Don't bother.
[649.72 → 650.64] All right.
[650.66 → 651.16] Oh gosh.
[651.30 → 652.90] So anyway, nerd sports.
[653.08 → 659.44] And you know what's really like kind of funny is I remember joking because we talked a lot
[659.44 → 665.14] internally about the perception of us doing a vessel exclusive and how a lot of people probably
[665.14 → 665.84] wouldn't like it.
[665.84 → 669.38] And then we talked a lot after the fact about how a lot of people didn't like it.
[669.38 → 675.72] And something I said kind of flippantly, kind of half joking was...
[675.72 → 676.52] Maybe vessel will die.
[676.52 → 677.44] We'll just buy it back.
[677.76 → 681.04] Well, we're 12 months into this vessel experiment.
[682.24 → 685.32] We kind of, we have some access to the behind the scene numbers.
[685.32 → 691.36] I think it was a two-year exclusivity deal on nerd sports.
[691.78 → 695.10] And I was like, it probably won't take two years.
[697.14 → 698.70] So it took about seven months.
[700.66 → 701.82] So there's that.
[702.28 → 703.68] Was it even seven months?
[703.92 → 704.28] I don't know.
[704.28 → 705.56] When did we finish nerd sports?
[706.02 → 707.12] When did I go to Switzerland?
[707.58 → 708.32] I don't know.
[708.36 → 709.78] Because I still have the scars from that.
[709.78 → 713.50] I've told you that, right?
[713.56 → 714.04] My ankles?
[714.18 → 716.32] Both my ankles are permanently scarred from the ice hockey one.
[717.42 → 717.78] Really?
[718.04 → 718.26] Yeah.
[718.42 → 718.94] Look at this.
[719.04 → 720.24] I can't really show the camera very well.
[720.80 → 722.06] They're matching on the other side.
[722.06 → 723.22] They look like bruises.
[723.50 → 724.66] They do, but they're permanent scars.
[725.84 → 726.20] Really?
[726.62 → 727.92] Remember how I said my ankles hurt?
[728.32 → 728.68] Yeah.
[728.86 → 729.20] The laces.
[730.22 → 730.56] The laces?
[730.56 → 733.82] They actually dug chunks out of the sides of my ankles.
[734.22 → 737.76] Remember when I was like, you guys were like, you need to re-skate down the ice and do
[737.76 → 738.48] the slide again?
[739.00 → 739.18] Yeah.
[739.18 → 740.82] And I was like, I really don't want to.
[740.88 → 742.06] I really want to take my boots off.
[742.12 → 743.24] And they were like, we need this shot.
[743.26 → 744.20] And I was like, okay.
[744.44 → 747.32] There were chunks missing from the sides of my ankles by the end.
[747.36 → 747.88] That's gross.
[748.02 → 748.20] Yeah.
[748.52 → 753.36] So that night, I came back here at like one in the morning.
[753.78 → 754.14] Yeah.
[754.36 → 759.02] Brandon and I shot the end of the networking wall video with my ankles bleeding.
[759.60 → 765.04] And then we packed up and Brandon and I both left still that night to Switzerland.
[765.10 → 765.60] To Switzerland.
[765.60 → 770.32] So I was trying to nurse them on the plane, and you have to fly to freaking Switzerland.
[770.56 → 773.78] So I wasn't able to get like proper medical attention for a really long time.
[774.02 → 777.62] And then once I finally got there, I couldn't explain what my problem was, and I couldn't
[777.62 → 779.68] get to a natural doctor because language barriers.
[779.68 → 783.48] So I ended up trying to ask for polypoid.
[784.76 → 786.32] Polypoid isn't really a thing.
[789.16 → 790.18] Don't sell it there.
[790.18 → 792.18] So we had to like figure out what the problem was.
[792.26 → 797.10] And then I ended up like just showing this guy my like really gross at this point, like
[797.10 → 799.58] infected looking ankle thing.
[799.80 → 803.62] And he figured it out and gave me some random stuff.
[803.72 → 805.08] And then I talked to Yvonne later.
[805.20 → 806.48] Apparently I applied it wrong.
[807.34 → 809.30] I'm supposed to let it breathe, put it under a band aid.
[809.48 → 811.06] So I applied it wrong for about a week.
[811.62 → 813.76] And now I have permanent scars from nerd sports.
[813.76 → 816.24] So I will never forget about nerd sports.
[816.86 → 819.94] Well, that's good.
[820.80 → 821.54] I guess.
[821.84 → 822.24] Yeah.
[823.54 → 828.06] I'm just trying to think if nerd sports left any permanent emotional ones.
[828.46 → 829.74] I like how they're matching.
[830.20 → 831.94] Still symmetrical, you know.
[832.12 → 832.52] Right.
[832.70 → 832.88] Yeah.
[833.56 → 834.84] I mean, it's on the ankles.
[834.90 → 835.98] I guess it could be worse.
[836.88 → 837.16] Yeah.
[837.38 → 838.62] It could be on the candles.
[839.02 → 839.64] Oh, like.
[840.68 → 841.16] Yeah.
[841.16 → 842.62] At least your ankles look good.
[842.76 → 842.98] Yeah.
[842.98 → 843.84] Aside from that.
[845.68 → 847.42] That's where you thought I was going with that.
[847.46 → 847.78] Yeah.
[848.44 → 849.70] Not in Trump's America.
[852.42 → 852.86] Okay.
[852.86 → 856.56] So I guess actually we do have a somewhat.
[856.88 → 859.86] I should probably load the thing.
[860.98 → 861.54] Why?
[861.76 → 862.08] Why?
[862.18 → 863.04] Thank you.
[863.20 → 863.60] Okay.
[863.74 → 864.70] Let's bring up this page.
[865.26 → 865.86] CNBC reports.
[867.02 → 870.00] The Canadian immigration website crashes on election night.
[870.00 → 871.66] But just for fun.
[871.84 → 874.02] And I haven't, I haven't pretested this.
[874.12 → 874.76] Oh, is it up right now?
[875.46 → 876.36] Just for fun.
[876.46 → 876.92] I don't know.
[877.34 → 883.64] I'm going to search for Canadian immigration crashed 2012.
[883.64 → 884.64] Okay.
[887.10 → 887.58] Okay.
[887.80 → 888.04] No.
[888.18 → 889.80] Everything is from the last two days.
[890.46 → 891.66] That's a lot of results.
[893.52 → 894.00] Okay.
[894.20 → 894.72] Let's try it.
[894.76 → 895.52] Let's try this again.
[896.34 → 896.82] 2008.
[896.82 → 897.82] Okay.
[900.54 → 901.02] Okay.
[901.68 → 904.70] Because I seem to remember this has happened before.
[905.08 → 906.86] As far as I know, this happens literally every time.
[906.86 → 909.24] Yeah.
[909.58 → 911.44] Apparently maybe it's bigger this time.
[911.46 → 912.80] Anyway, the point is, okay.
[912.88 → 914.40] So there are a couple of points to make here.
[914.46 → 915.96] Number one is got real.
[916.48 → 924.44] You're not actually going to run off to Canada because you have a job and a house and a family
[924.44 → 927.18] and friends and relocating.
[927.32 → 928.00] And a spine.
[928.12 → 928.24] Wow.
[928.30 → 929.78] Did John not have any of those things?
[931.60 → 932.00] Oh.
[932.28 → 932.42] Rude.
[932.88 → 934.00] He brought stuff.
[934.16 → 934.72] That's true.
[934.72 → 938.54] He did bring family, and he did bring his stuff.
[938.66 → 938.98] Rude.
[939.08 → 941.28] And his car and he found a place to live here.
[941.68 → 947.60] So he has a new home after he stayed in my living room for like a week.
[948.62 → 949.02] Yes.
[949.08 → 949.88] Did you tell about that?
[950.24 → 950.44] No.
[950.60 → 950.74] What?
[950.82 → 950.96] Yeah.
[951.04 → 952.14] John stayed in my living room.
[952.16 → 952.40] Oh, yeah.
[952.50 → 952.64] Yeah.
[952.64 → 953.00] Yeah.
[953.00 → 953.32] Anyway.
[954.36 → 961.22] So like that's not a thing unless you are actually, I've told John this, but I admire what he did
[961.22 → 963.84] for a lot of the reasons that I just named.
[963.84 → 967.12] Because you've got your job and your family and your friends and like your life.
[967.12 → 967.60] You're settled.
[967.70 → 970.12] You've put down roots once you've reached kind of adulthood.
[970.40 → 975.72] And to pick all that up and kind of boldly go where no man has gone before except the
[975.72 → 977.46] 33 million or so Canadians that live here.
[977.46 → 978.62] But very few Americans.
[979.06 → 982.40] So 2008 was the highest surge ever.
[982.58 → 982.84] Okay.
[983.02 → 983.78] Higher than this one.
[984.28 → 985.06] Higher than this one.
[985.18 → 985.32] Yeah.
[985.40 → 985.82] There you go.
[985.82 → 990.38] So anyway, the point is like that kind of used to be a thing.
[990.86 → 996.76] Like, you know, the new world when all the Europeans who like hated their life over in
[996.76 → 998.84] Europe and were like, maybe the new world will be better.
[998.94 → 1002.78] And they got here, and it was like the wilderness and, you know, the frontier and all that.
[1002.94 → 1005.28] And they had their own completely different set of challenges.
[1005.28 → 1007.26] But ultimately, I think it worked out pretty well for them.
[1007.36 → 1007.82] All of that.
[1007.98 → 1009.52] It's not as much of a thing anymore.
[1009.52 → 1012.08] So no, you aren't actually going to pick up and go to Canada.
[1012.62 → 1015.44] And if you are, I will tell you this.
[1015.98 → 1022.56] As not someone who has immigrated to Canada, I was born here, but as someone who has facilitated
[1022.56 → 1030.42] the moving to Canada process now twice, once with John, which was much simpler because
[1030.42 → 1035.78] he's a highly educated American, which thanks to NAFTA, which by the way, might not be a
[1035.78 → 1045.58] thing anymore for much longer, thanks to NAFTA, his process for getting in here is easier,
[1045.96 → 1048.46] but like also ridiculous.
[1048.92 → 1054.46] So he had to do a bunch of stuff, and then he literally had to drive to the border, at
[1054.46 → 1059.24] which time a snap decision would be made, and he would either be let into the country with
[1059.24 → 1062.14] a work permit, or he would be sent packing back home.
[1062.30 → 1062.84] That's legitimately.
[1063.22 → 1065.08] That is what happened.
[1065.78 → 1072.30] Which is like, again, I admire John's bravery because it's not like, it's not like he got
[1072.30 → 1074.74] on a plane with like nothing with him.
[1074.74 → 1082.30] He drove from North Carolina to the Peace Arch border crossing in Vancouver, which for
[1082.30 → 1088.54] you Americans who aren't real good at Canadian geography is Northern Washington state pretty
[1088.54 → 1088.90] much.
[1089.54 → 1089.88] Okay.
[1091.20 → 1091.44] Yeah.
[1091.60 → 1094.08] Washington state, not Washington, the city, they're different.
[1094.08 → 1098.86] So insane.
[1099.22 → 1100.42] And then, okay.
[1100.54 → 1105.80] So if you don't qualify for immigration in the way that highly educated professionals, like
[1105.80 → 1112.08] people who have a law degree do, then the process is, takes months, can cost.
[1112.22 → 1117.36] So getting Dennis here involved a ton of paperwork.
[1117.36 → 1122.14] We had to prove that hiring Dennis wouldn't have any kind of impact on the Canadian labour
[1122.14 → 1125.84] market, which is a months long process.
[1126.32 → 1132.96] We had to pay thousands and thousands of dollars in legal fees, which is not like the same as
[1132.96 → 1134.38] us sponsoring him here.
[1134.38 → 1139.56] Like it's not, it's not that, but it was, it was, he had to have a job offer.
[1139.56 → 1147.08] He had to have a solid concrete job offer that had to be at a wage that's above the median wage for the
[1147.08 → 1148.44] position that he's going into.
[1148.56 → 1154.00] So we had to find some way to make YouTube sensation into a job code.
[1154.00 → 1161.00] And whole thing took like six months, cost thousands of dollars.
[1161.00 → 1166.04] And that was assuming that you have an employer who's willing to go through all of that for
[1166.04 → 1166.24] you.
[1166.48 → 1173.82] Just picking up your bags and walking to Canada is not a thing anymore than picking up your
[1173.82 → 1177.24] bags and walking into America from Mexico, except that it's probably actually much more
[1177.24 → 1177.92] difficult than that.
[1177.92 → 1178.56] Sidebar.
[1178.82 → 1179.10] Yes.
[1179.26 → 1181.14] We have a jobs' crisis.
[1182.14 → 1183.96] We have a financial crisis.
[1184.18 → 1185.42] Our economy is kind of in the hole.
[1185.42 → 1192.62] We lost like a huge amount of jobs and money from the oil market being totally screwed over.
[1193.18 → 1194.70] And housing is ridiculously expensive.
[1196.46 → 1197.90] That's less of an issue elsewhere.
[1198.38 → 1200.42] Not everywhere elsewhere.
[1201.20 → 1202.16] In Toronto as well.
[1202.26 → 1205.20] Well, yeah, but like that's the two Canadian cities.
[1205.20 → 1205.84] But where do you go?
[1205.84 → 1209.12] Because a lot of places where housing is cheap, jobs are a huge issue.
[1209.30 → 1209.50] Yes.
[1209.60 → 1209.76] Okay.
[1210.14 → 1210.64] Fair enough.
[1211.06 → 1211.16] Yeah.
[1211.34 → 1211.58] Yeah.
[1211.74 → 1214.26] No one can find a job in Ottawa unless they're bilingual.
[1214.44 → 1215.12] We all know this.
[1216.16 → 1216.60] All right.
[1216.74 → 1219.82] So basically, I guess that's that's OK.
[1219.96 → 1224.84] The farmer's daughter country market in Nova Scotia is offering what?
[1225.88 → 1226.16] This.
[1226.56 → 1227.14] No, it's this.
[1227.88 → 1232.30] Is offer a business in Canada is offering a job in two free acres of land if you relocate
[1232.30 → 1238.74] because they need workers and there aren't any available in the village of Waikoukamak located
[1238.74 → 1239.80] on Cape Breton.
[1240.30 → 1244.62] In a Facebook post, they stated, we can't give you big money, but we can give you an awesome
[1244.62 → 1245.08] life.
[1246.36 → 1249.04] The Facebook post reads, in the middle of freaking nowhere.
[1249.04 → 1251.48] We can offer you a great incentive to come and try us out.
[1252.08 → 1254.76] One thing our business does have is lots of land.
[1254.76 → 1258.88] If you want lots of land, go to northern parts of Canada.
[1259.10 → 1259.16] Yeah.
[1259.62 → 1265.60] And depending on how deregulated the fossil fuel industry gets, northern Canada might
[1265.60 → 1267.30] not be that cold for much longer.
[1267.96 → 1270.24] Think of it as an investment for your children.
[1273.50 → 1274.68] All right.
[1275.88 → 1280.76] Net neutrality is evidently suddenly on the chopping block.
[1280.76 → 1286.32] The original article here is from The Verge, Mr. Colin Fletcher.
[1288.56 → 1293.02] Sounds like a dishonest member of the left-wing media to me.
[1293.72 → 1294.10] Who?
[1294.26 → 1299.26] Against almost all expectations, Donald Trump, well, his name is Fletcher, so it sounds kind
[1299.26 → 1300.04] of lecherous.
[1301.02 → 1308.34] You know, the guy that made the claim about how MacBook Pros couldn't use more RAM because
[1308.34 → 1309.08] it would take too much power.
[1309.14 → 1309.54] You know that guy?
[1309.98 → 1310.20] Yeah.
[1310.20 → 1310.86] His last name?
[1310.88 → 1311.08] What?
[1311.30 → 1311.52] Schiller?
[1311.68 → 1311.98] Oh, yeah.
[1312.04 → 1312.42] Phil Schiller.
[1312.60 → 1313.06] Yeah, yeah.
[1313.06 → 1313.50] I know, right?
[1314.72 → 1319.12] Every time I watch him walk onto stage at an Apple event, I'm like, ah!
[1321.02 → 1323.16] Your name and what you do.
[1323.26 → 1325.16] They just go together so well.
[1325.46 → 1326.08] It's wonderful.
[1326.08 → 1330.34] It's like when you were born, like a star came down.
[1330.90 → 1335.84] It's almost like you are destined to be and do one thing.
[1337.76 → 1338.54] So good.
[1338.54 → 1340.08] So, so good.
[1340.08 → 1340.10] So good.
[1340.42 → 1344.58] Meanwhile, Twitch chat is full of, just like you, Linus.
[1347.46 → 1348.02] Se bast?
[1348.82 → 1350.42] No, just being a shill.
[1350.66 → 1350.86] Oh.
[1351.20 → 1351.42] Yeah.
[1351.42 → 1352.64] But your last name isn't.
[1352.96 → 1353.20] No.
[1353.88 → 1354.58] That doesn't work then.
[1354.64 → 1354.78] But.
[1355.14 → 1355.44] Wrong!
[1357.60 → 1359.10] Why are you so nasty?
[1360.24 → 1360.68] Explorable?
[1360.90 → 1361.36] Nasty.
[1361.52 → 1361.84] Wrong!
[1362.92 → 1363.98] I never said that.
[1363.98 → 1366.74] I'm going to start calling you Crooked Luke.
[1367.74 → 1369.18] Should we change our Twitter handles?
[1369.18 → 1369.44] Lion Luke!
[1369.78 → 1370.34] Lion Luke!
[1370.52 → 1370.80] You got to do that.
[1370.80 → 1372.18] I want to be Lion Linus!
[1372.28 → 1372.80] Oh, okay.
[1373.04 → 1373.26] Okay.
[1373.46 → 1373.84] Okay.
[1374.04 → 1374.52] That's fine.
[1375.60 → 1376.00] Yes.
[1376.52 → 1380.78] Lion Linus over here just bailed out on another topic before fully explaining the whole thing.
[1380.78 → 1385.78] It was Lion Ted and what was, what was the other, what was the other guy that ended up endorsing him?
[1386.34 → 1388.66] The other bitter, bitter primary rival.
[1390.18 → 1390.58] Marco.
[1391.58 → 1392.18] Oh, yeah.
[1392.20 → 1392.50] Rubio.
[1392.62 → 1392.84] Rubio.
[1392.90 → 1393.64] What did he call him?
[1393.76 → 1394.36] I don't remember.
[1395.18 → 1398.72] Like little boy, Rubio or Marco, like little Marco or something.
[1398.92 → 1399.74] Trump's insult for Marco.
[1400.36 → 1401.32] Trump's insult.
[1404.00 → 1404.70] What was it?
[1404.70 → 1407.78] Here are Trump and Rubio's most schoolyard insults.
[1408.18 → 1408.60] Oh, don't make that.
[1408.60 → 1409.60] Oh, I don't want a video.
[1410.88 → 1411.86] Come on.
[1412.16 → 1412.72] Little Marco.
[1412.94 → 1413.60] Little Marco.
[1413.80 → 1414.54] There we go.
[1415.34 → 1417.98] Little Luke is like kind of, it's more like little John though.
[1417.98 → 1419.34] It's more like endearing.
[1419.66 → 1421.28] Whereas like Lion Luke.
[1422.00 → 1423.54] I could be Crooked Linus, actually.
[1423.60 → 1424.22] I don't mind that.
[1424.36 → 1426.00] Lion Luke and Crooked Linus.
[1427.74 → 1428.22] Awesome.
[1428.58 → 1428.72] Yeah.
[1429.44 → 1430.10] All right.
[1430.18 → 1430.38] Sorry.
[1430.48 → 1431.84] Back to the net neutrality thing.
[1432.14 → 1436.50] So the release of the FCC's net neutrality rules in 2015 was one of the most progressive
[1436.50 → 1438.32] changes to the internet in recent memory.
[1438.88 → 1442.34] The rules barred data throttling and paid fast lanes.
[1443.14 → 1448.34] A Trump administration may mean that the Obama backed net neutrality rules get challenged
[1448.34 → 1449.88] or weakened going forward.
[1450.58 → 1452.80] Trump's fellow Republicans have criticized the rules.
[1452.80 → 1455.08] And remember, this is not just a Trump president.
[1455.38 → 1457.94] This is a Republican Senate and House.
[1457.94 → 1463.14] So it is going to be a very interesting four years.
[1464.18 → 1465.78] And there are a few ways to look at that.
[1467.06 → 1468.26] Well, there are two ways.
[1468.50 → 1469.38] No, there are lots of ways.
[1469.46 → 1470.18] Well, one of the ways.
[1470.60 → 1470.78] Wait.
[1470.96 → 1471.90] Is Lion Linus?
[1472.08 → 1473.40] Lots of things will get done.
[1473.48 → 1474.58] No, I want to be Crooked Linus now.
[1474.58 → 1475.02] Crooked Linus.
[1475.16 → 1475.56] Crooked Linus.
[1475.56 → 1476.94] You can be Lion Luke.
[1477.10 → 1477.26] Okay.
[1478.38 → 1484.08] Lots of things will get done because there will be, relatively speaking, I expect, little
[1484.08 → 1487.38] resistance to sort of the Republican Party agenda.
[1487.62 → 1492.54] That is to say, unless they create their own resistance, which does seem fairly plausible.
[1492.82 → 1493.50] That's possible.
[1493.88 → 1500.30] The other way of looking at it is, oh no, the Republicans are going to do a bunch of stuff
[1500.30 → 1502.30] that will be very, very difficult to undo.
[1503.96 → 1504.90] So there's that.
[1505.66 → 1511.52] So in 2014, Ted Cruz called net neutrality Obamacare for the internet.
[1512.16 → 1514.32] That doesn't even make any sense at all.
[1514.46 → 1519.64] Claiming it would slow down private sector innovation, which is not what it is and not
[1519.64 → 1520.14] what it does.
[1520.70 → 1521.14] Ugh.
[1522.44 → 1522.88] All right.
[1523.10 → 1523.46] All right.
[1523.78 → 1524.06] All right.
[1524.28 → 1526.10] The only reason why you say that is because you're Crooked Linus.
[1526.42 → 1526.76] I know.
[1527.06 → 1527.22] Yeah.
[1527.22 → 1531.00] Well, I obviously am getting paid by the Clinton campaign.
[1531.12 → 1531.28] Yeah.
[1532.02 → 1538.92] Which definitely still exists and is not drowning in a pool of its own tears right now.
[1539.08 → 1539.28] Yeah.
[1540.74 → 1546.10] Speaking of drowning in a pool of your own tears, GoPro has recalled its Karma drone.
[1546.42 → 1546.74] Oh.
[1547.28 → 1548.76] Might be part of the reason why we never got one.
[1549.32 → 1549.62] Yeah.
[1549.92 → 1550.32] Yeah.
[1550.82 → 1551.12] Yeah.
[1551.16 → 1552.82] I thought they were going to send us one.
[1552.82 → 1558.92] The $799 drone can randomly lose power during operation.
[1559.34 → 1566.20] Meanwhile, DJI completely upstaged the Karma one week after it launched anyway, meaning it
[1566.20 → 1566.92] is just...
[1566.92 → 1567.60] Are we getting that one?
[1567.78 → 1569.00] Yet another...
[1569.00 → 1569.92] I have no idea, actually.
[1569.92 → 1571.46] Because holy hell, that drone is awesome.
[1572.74 → 1574.66] Drone content does not do well.
[1575.16 → 1575.74] No one cares.
[1575.74 → 1579.70] We just need to make a title that has nothing to do with the video at all.
[1580.40 → 1581.92] And then it'll work out.
[1583.52 → 1584.26] Neither you nor I have that idea.
[1584.26 → 1585.18] Oh my god!
[1585.26 → 1586.34] I love it.
[1586.76 → 1588.62] All capitals, exclamation mark at the end.
[1588.74 → 1589.74] And then you're just going like...
[1590.74 → 1592.70] It'll work.
[1594.12 → 1594.88] I believe you.
[1595.28 → 1595.62] In you.
[1595.74 → 1596.26] I believe in you.
[1596.56 → 1598.62] Okay, let's get through this topic real quick here.
[1598.70 → 1600.50] And then I actually have an idea to pitch you.
[1600.70 → 1600.84] Okay.
[1600.96 → 1601.60] New channel idea.
[1602.22 → 1602.88] Channel idea?
[1602.98 → 1603.60] You'll like it.
[1604.22 → 1604.50] Oh.
[1604.50 → 1604.94] Okay.
[1605.24 → 1605.56] All right.
[1605.70 → 1607.62] So GoPro recalling the Karma drone.
[1607.84 → 1608.74] It loses power.
[1609.06 → 1612.98] Approximately 2,500 Karma units sold since October 23rd are affected.
[1613.76 → 1615.30] GoPro says, blah, blah.
[1615.52 → 1616.80] No reports of property damage.
[1616.92 → 1619.34] They can be returned to GoPro directly or wherever purchased for a full refund.
[1619.34 → 1623.32] Working with the Federal Aviation Authority and U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission on the recall.
[1623.98 → 1624.38] Wrong!
[1624.78 → 1625.14] Wrong!
[1625.82 → 1629.42] Suggests that the Karma shipments will resume as soon as the issue is solved.
[1629.52 → 1629.78] Wrong!
[1630.30 → 1630.66] Wrong!
[1631.96 → 1632.40] Wrong!
[1632.68 → 1634.28] It will take some time after that.
[1634.28 → 1634.68] Yes.
[1635.00 → 1635.88] It will take...
[1635.88 → 1638.26] And they have been endorsed by PETA.
[1639.30 → 1640.40] PETA has endorsed...
[1641.60 → 1642.08] Karma.
[1642.82 → 1643.30] Terrible.
[1643.44 → 1644.88] Karma for everyone.
[1645.00 → 1645.36] Terrible.
[1645.50 → 1645.70] Yep.
[1645.84 → 1651.38] And Border Patrol is going to keep animals out of Mexico.
[1651.62 → 1652.64] This is your channel idea?
[1652.86 → 1653.22] Okay.
[1653.40 → 1653.72] Okay.
[1653.80 → 1654.50] So hold on a minute.
[1654.68 → 1655.40] Hold on a minute.
[1655.74 → 1656.08] Okay.
[1656.08 → 1657.08] So...
[1657.08 → 1659.44] I love it.
[1659.62 → 1660.86] I'm 100% sold.
[1661.06 → 1661.68] I don't even...
[1661.68 → 1662.62] I literally don't need...
[1662.62 → 1665.20] I know where you're going to go with this, and I'm totally on board.
[1665.36 → 1665.88] So...
[1665.88 → 1667.24] Oh, I'm excited.
[1667.36 → 1669.30] We're thinking new channel.
[1669.42 → 1669.68] It's good.
[1669.68 → 1671.72] In response to what viewers seem to want.
[1672.68 → 1676.34] We're going to call it the honest unboxing channel.
[1676.34 → 1676.74] Yeah.
[1676.94 → 1678.96] Or like honest impressions channel.
[1679.14 → 1679.32] Yeah.
[1679.38 → 1679.62] Okay?
[1680.86 → 1682.34] Because quite honestly...
[1683.34 → 1684.52] There's that word again.
[1684.56 → 1684.94] Oh, dang.
[1685.78 → 1689.60] We get requests every day.
[1690.02 → 1691.26] Every day.
[1691.50 → 1700.78] From companies who want to send us something with a page of talking points to do a sponsored review or unboxing video.
[1700.78 → 1709.24] Now, the honest unboxing channel is where we will honestly tell you exactly what is on that page.
[1713.58 → 1715.74] It will be a pure cash grab.
[1716.50 → 1718.34] It will not shy away...
[1718.34 → 1718.56] Okay.
[1718.60 → 1719.42] This isn't what I thought it was.
[1719.42 → 1729.62] From its honesty about being absolutely nothing but a way to cash in on that money without putting it on the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[1730.78 → 1731.42] So...
[1731.42 → 1731.96] Honest unboxing channel.
[1731.96 → 1733.18] This is because you're Crooked Linus.
[1733.36 → 1735.04] This is because I am Crooked Linus.
[1735.20 → 1741.20] See, what I thought you were going to say is right now the environment seems to just be like people going,
[1741.88 → 1742.36] Whoa!
[1743.08 → 1744.04] It's a pixel.
[1744.20 → 1744.64] There's...
[1744.64 → 1745.48] Look at this.
[1745.86 → 1747.36] There's a fingerprint reader on the back.
[1747.38 → 1747.98] Is there glass on the back?
[1748.30 → 1748.74] What?
[1748.90 → 1750.38] Why did they put glass on the back?
[1750.40 → 1750.94] I have no idea.
[1751.04 → 1754.90] I'm not going to do any minutes of research to figure out that it has to do with intended transmission or anything.
[1754.92 → 1755.94] Is this a two-tone flash?
[1756.08 → 1756.98] That's insane.
[1757.08 → 1757.96] Two-tone flash.
[1758.04 → 1759.20] I mean, that...
[1759.20 → 1760.06] That's nuts.
[1760.34 → 1760.74] Whoa.
[1760.78 → 1761.90] Brain explosion.
[1763.18 → 1764.66] Glass on the front, too?
[1764.84 → 1765.64] Type-C USB?
[1766.08 → 1766.74] That's nuts.
[1766.82 → 1767.70] I mean...
[1767.70 → 1769.02] Why are the speakers down here?
[1769.06 → 1770.22] This might even...
[1770.22 → 1773.32] This might even adhere to the USB Type-C standard.
[1773.50 → 1773.78] Maybe.
[1773.88 → 1776.30] But I don't know, and I'm not going to figure it out before this video's over.
[1776.30 → 1777.14] Why would you do that?
[1777.36 → 1777.98] So...
[1777.98 → 1779.54] That would take effort and research.
[1780.46 → 1780.90] Right?
[1782.00 → 1782.48] Okay.
[1782.88 → 1783.98] Twitch chat loves it.
[1784.56 → 1786.22] Twitch chat loves it.
[1786.68 → 1788.10] Chill unboxing channel.
[1788.60 → 1789.28] So anyway...
[1789.28 → 1790.58] What else are people suggesting here?
[1790.64 → 1790.92] Hold on.
[1790.98 → 1791.14] No.
[1791.34 → 1791.64] No, no.
[1791.70 → 1792.00] Hold on.
[1792.04 → 1792.74] There's some great...
[1792.74 → 1794.66] There are some great suggestions for channel...
[1794.66 → 1795.82] It's moving too fast.
[1795.82 → 1796.20] Too fast.
[1796.20 → 1797.58] I can't even control it.
[1797.92 → 1799.82] I can't control the excitement.
[1800.48 → 1801.68] You're not crooked enough.
[1801.68 → 1804.34] So anyway...
[1804.34 → 1804.66] Wow.
[1804.78 → 1810.06] Knowing that and reading the Honest Unboxing channel, what I thought you were going to do is like...
[1810.06 → 1810.30] Okay.
[1810.62 → 1812.00] So there's a fingerprint reader on the back.
[1812.94 → 1815.48] That's not technically innovative or new, but...
[1815.48 → 1815.66] Yeah.
[1815.82 → 1817.66] It's good that it's on their Premiere phone, I guess.
[1817.66 → 1817.98] Because LG did it.
[1818.94 → 1819.26] Yeah.
[1819.46 → 1821.90] And the 6P had a fingerprint reader on the back, didn't it?
[1821.96 → 1822.10] Yeah.
[1822.16 → 1824.06] Which is literally like the one before this.
[1824.22 → 1824.38] Yeah.
[1824.38 → 1825.16] Everyone's talking about this one.
[1825.16 → 1827.22] It's not the one before because Nexus is totally different from Pixel.
[1828.14 → 1828.46] Right.
[1828.56 → 1829.42] But like, not really.
[1829.98 → 1830.70] Totally different.
[1830.88 → 1832.10] No, but remember, this is the actually honest one.
[1832.10 → 1832.26] Right.
[1832.26 → 1833.54] But the Nexus was made by Huawei.
[1833.80 → 1834.68] But this is the actually honest one.
[1834.68 → 1836.52] Except the ones that were made by HTC before that.
[1836.58 → 1837.70] This is the actually honest one.
[1837.96 → 1838.62] Oh, wait.
[1838.70 → 1838.94] Hold on.
[1838.96 → 1840.20] Are we honest or are we dishonest?
[1840.32 → 1841.26] This one is honest.
[1841.36 → 1841.78] It's honest.
[1841.92 → 1842.02] Yeah.
[1842.02 → 1842.16] Okay.
[1842.44 → 1844.78] So are we honest because we read off of a spec sheet?
[1844.94 → 1847.50] Or are we honest because we give our honest opinion?
[1847.68 → 1848.28] Honest opinion.
[1848.66 → 1849.54] But we already do that.
[1852.00 → 1853.00] But it's an unboxing.
[1853.68 → 1857.04] Oh, so it's an honest unboxing as opposed to an honest...
[1857.04 → 1858.56] Whatever it is that we do online is tech tips.
[1858.68 → 1859.12] Review.
[1859.46 → 1860.56] No one is quite sure anymore.
[1860.60 → 1860.88] Overview.
[1861.50 → 1861.94] Explanation.
[1861.94 → 1862.54] Kick farting.
[1862.76 → 1863.82] Kick farting thing.
[1864.02 → 1864.62] I don't know.
[1864.64 → 1865.14] Holy...
[1865.14 → 1866.14] Holy...
[1866.14 → 1866.72] Yeah.
[1867.50 → 1868.96] We bleep it because we're...
[1868.96 → 1869.86] Sorry if that hurt the headphones.
[1869.86 → 1871.28] We bleep it because we're kid friendly.
[1873.54 → 1875.08] And then we...
[1875.08 → 1879.24] And then we swear in the video, and we put like things that are like, bleep this.
[1879.78 → 1881.38] Bah, don't let this in.
[1881.38 → 1885.26] And then it goes through two stages of uploads.
[1886.66 → 1888.10] And still makes it through.
[1890.58 → 1891.50] Oh, man.
[1892.16 → 1893.16] Um...
[1893.16 → 1894.84] Man, I...
[1894.84 → 1895.54] Shill Quickie.
[1895.84 → 1896.60] Shill Quickie.
[1896.72 → 1897.84] That's a good name.
[1898.34 → 1899.66] That's a good name.
[1900.30 → 1901.16] Oh, man.
[1901.70 → 1902.56] What do you think?
[1902.92 → 1905.26] Every single video on there has to be sponsored.
[1905.26 → 1905.58] Yes.
[1906.02 → 1908.70] We will not make a video unless we get paid.
[1908.84 → 1909.04] Yeah.
[1909.34 → 1910.06] On that channel.
[1910.30 → 1910.86] For that...
[1910.86 → 1912.12] From the people with that product.
[1912.16 → 1912.48] Yes.
[1912.74 → 1914.84] Not from other unrelated companies.
[1914.94 → 1915.78] It has to be that company.
[1915.88 → 1917.88] Some kind of conflict of interest.
[1918.16 → 1918.34] Yeah.
[1918.40 → 1919.20] Must exist.
[1919.32 → 1924.28] You know, it's a valuable resource because you can see exactly what the marketing points are for that company.
[1924.34 → 1924.64] Yes.
[1925.06 → 1925.26] Yeah.
[1925.38 → 1926.40] And what's in the box.
[1926.50 → 1926.74] Yep.
[1927.06 → 1930.46] And what it might look like before you charged it and turned it on.
[1930.52 → 1930.92] Yes.
[1931.54 → 1932.86] Unless it comes with some charge.
[1933.04 → 1933.28] Yes.
[1933.44 → 1934.76] In which case we could turn it on.
[1934.76 → 1935.84] We could see the boot screen.
[1936.02 → 1936.16] Yep.
[1936.54 → 1937.58] But probably not more than that.
[1937.68 → 1938.78] Probably not much more than that.
[1938.78 → 1939.32] Take too long.
[1939.64 → 1940.46] It would take too long.
[1940.70 → 1940.84] Yeah.
[1941.00 → 1947.18] So the idea is we would do this as quickly and low efforts as possible.
[1947.40 → 1948.20] 10VP cameras.
[1948.58 → 1948.78] Yeah.
[1948.88 → 1949.40] If that.
[1949.60 → 1950.54] We'd upscale it.
[1950.68 → 1951.52] Lets webcam it.
[1951.84 → 1952.26] Oh, nice.
[1952.42 → 1953.18] We'd still upscale that.
[1953.20 → 1954.36] We'll go full Jenna Marbles.
[1954.54 → 1954.84] So get like...
[1954.84 → 1956.40] We're going to like to shoot it on a potato.
[1956.72 → 1957.02] Okay?
[1957.18 → 1958.12] And then upscale that.
[1958.20 → 1958.48] Yes.
[1958.58 → 1962.08] So that the file reads 4K and so that YouTube will say that it's 4K.
[1962.08 → 1964.54] And if you thought our audio quality was bad before,
[1964.76 → 1967.22] We can do better.
[1967.62 → 1968.76] We'll just like to use a phone.
[1969.26 → 1970.62] We'll just like tape it to our chest.
[1970.84 → 1971.04] No.
[1971.12 → 1972.04] Tape it to your back.
[1972.26 → 1972.56] Oh, nice.
[1972.56 → 1972.62] Okay?
[1972.66 → 1973.56] Your mouth is on the front.
[1974.10 → 1974.28] Yeah.
[1974.38 → 1974.54] Right?
[1974.76 → 1974.94] Yeah.
[1974.94 → 1976.30] So the microphone should be on the back.
[1976.40 → 1976.54] Yeah.
[1976.54 → 1977.60] Just like the iMac.
[1977.60 → 1983.88] Just like the iMac.
[1985.96 → 1986.40] No.
[1986.66 → 1989.18] The iMac's microphone is on the back of the device.
[1989.68 → 1993.14] On the back of a glass, metal, and PCB device.
[1994.40 → 1996.16] Moose Coop just said review my game.
[1996.28 → 1996.60] All right.
[1996.82 → 1998.56] You press 1 every time.
[1998.66 → 2000.14] If you ever press 2, you lose.
[2000.64 → 2000.92] There.
[2001.20 → 2001.74] Game over.
[2002.10 → 2003.24] It's a choosy your own adventure game.
[2003.28 → 2004.00] Always press 1.
[2004.86 → 2005.18] Really?
[2005.30 → 2006.20] He had me play his game.
[2006.40 → 2007.18] I love you, Moose Coop.
[2007.42 → 2008.32] He had me play his game.
[2008.66 → 2014.32] And I accidentally spammed 1 because I was trying to get the intro text to go by.
[2014.46 → 2015.40] And it was like, you win.
[2015.44 → 2016.20] And I was like, what?
[2017.28 → 2019.26] How did I just do that?
[2019.30 → 2020.08] So I reloaded the game.
[2020.14 → 2020.56] I did it again.
[2020.60 → 2021.98] I was like, what?
[2022.98 → 2023.98] So I reloaded it again.
[2024.04 → 2025.16] And then I was like, what if I press 2?
[2025.24 → 2026.18] And then I was like, you lose.
[2026.28 → 2026.50] Oh, no.
[2026.50 → 2027.94] So then I tried every single stage.
[2027.98 → 2028.74] You have to stop.
[2029.34 → 2030.82] Twitch chat is spamming 1.
[2030.82 → 2031.88] They're all getting banned.
[2034.48 → 2034.88] Okay.
[2035.32 → 2035.54] Yeah.
[2035.54 → 2039.94] If you guys want to know how to not get banned from the L2T bot in Twitch chat, don't talk
[2039.94 → 2040.26] ever.
[2040.62 → 2041.02] Yeah.
[2041.46 → 2043.36] That's definitely best.
[2043.78 → 2049.24] Don't talk about Han Solo or the 3D robotic solo drone.
[2049.46 → 2049.70] Yeah.
[2049.88 → 2051.14] Or like, you know.
[2051.20 → 2052.10] Anything that says solo.
[2052.10 → 2054.30] Soloing it because your girlfriend's out of town or whatever.
[2054.50 → 2055.52] Just no solo.
[2055.68 → 2056.02] Okay.
[2056.16 → 2057.28] We're never going to update the rules.
[2057.28 → 2061.34] So anytime a new big movie that we care a lot about comes out, we're going to put key
[2061.34 → 2062.56] points in it that are spoilers.
[2062.88 → 2063.04] Yeah.
[2063.12 → 2064.54] And then those will always stay in.
[2064.60 → 2068.26] We could end up with words like the in there.
[2068.26 → 2068.60] Oh, yeah.
[2068.62 → 2070.58] So best to just say nothing.
[2070.84 → 2071.58] Best to just not talk.
[2071.64 → 2071.82] Yeah.
[2073.76 → 2074.16] Yeah.
[2074.34 → 2074.60] No.
[2075.02 → 2075.40] No.
[2075.52 → 2077.56] It's just best to not.
[2077.56 → 2081.14] The amount of people getting permanently timed out right now is solid.
[2081.78 → 2081.84] I love it.
[2081.84 → 2082.68] Freaking fantastic.
[2082.68 → 2088.20] Speaking of getting a permanent timeout, not related to that at all.
[2088.78 → 2089.94] But wait.
[2090.16 → 2090.56] Oh, hold on.
[2090.60 → 2091.66] There's one I'm supposed to do first.
[2091.74 → 2092.74] It's not a permanent timeout.
[2092.82 → 2095.76] It's just a temporary timeout for sponsors.
[2096.44 → 2096.92] Yes.
[2097.26 → 2097.66] Squarespace.
[2098.52 → 2099.06] Squarespace.
[2100.22 → 2106.68] Visit at squarespace.com slash when and use offer code when to save 10%.
[2107.46 → 2107.70] Awesome.
[2107.70 → 2109.80] I was paid to tell you this.
[2109.90 → 2110.42] So good.
[2110.42 → 2116.50] Yes, my friends, I was paid to tell you that Squarespace offers 24-7 support via live chat
[2116.50 → 2117.52] and email in brackets.
[2117.52 → 2118.26] Literally the best.
[2118.34 → 2119.98] We don't offer telephone support.
[2120.48 → 2125.40] I was paid to tell you that only $12 a month, that's where they start at.
[2125.82 → 2132.40] Yes, my friends, don't believe what Lion Luke would tell you about how expensive Squarespace
[2132.40 → 2132.96] is.
[2133.56 → 2138.96] Squarespace starts at $12 a month, and you get a free domain if you buy Squarespace for a year.
[2138.96 → 2140.86] That's right, my friends.
[2141.52 → 2143.28] I need a new Twitter handle.
[2143.54 → 2145.12] I've got to be Crooked Linus from now on.
[2145.26 → 2145.42] Okay.
[2145.62 → 2147.16] You can change it without losing your followers.
[2147.30 → 2147.78] That's true.
[2147.94 → 2153.62] Every Squarespace site features responsive design so that, if you believe this anyway,
[2154.04 → 2158.42] so that your website will look great on a phone or on a screen, which you can't see because
[2158.42 → 2159.02] it's out of camera.
[2159.02 → 2160.24] No, no, you know what?
[2160.26 → 2161.10] I'm not going to show it to you.
[2161.26 → 2163.22] You're just going to have to believe that it's there, okay?
[2163.92 → 2167.60] Cover pages are a feature that allow you to set up a beautiful one-page online presence
[2167.60 → 2167.84] in minutes.
[2167.84 → 2168.32] Your favourite one.
[2168.58 → 2172.48] And everyone, everyone, even Donald Trump could do this.
[2172.92 → 2176.62] Everyone can now publish content in Apple News format directly from their Squarespace
[2176.62 → 2177.48] blog module.
[2177.80 → 2178.26] So good.
[2178.34 → 2179.06] He could do it.
[2179.10 → 2179.58] So good.
[2179.78 → 2180.48] He could do it.
[2180.56 → 2181.10] The best.
[2181.66 → 2186.54] Squarespace makes your Apple News format publishing directly.
[2186.66 → 2190.32] Sorry, I was reading another talking point and I didn't realize it was related to the
[2190.32 → 2190.76] one above it.
[2190.80 → 2193.48] And I just kind of went, I went off, I went off prompter.
[2193.90 → 2194.30] Okay.
[2194.42 → 2195.32] I went off prompter.
[2195.44 → 2196.04] You can't do that.
[2196.16 → 2198.12] And you can, you can.
[2198.30 → 2198.50] Nope.
[2198.70 → 2199.50] I can go off prompter.
[2199.52 → 2200.06] It's impossible.
[2200.22 → 2202.16] I will be President of the United States of America.
[2202.36 → 2202.72] Oh, dang.
[2202.72 → 2204.82] This is not the first prediction that I've made.
[2205.10 → 2210.42] Now, there may be laws about having to be a citizen or whatever, but I believe in anything.
[2210.42 → 2211.74] I believe anything is possible.
[2211.96 → 2215.80] And I believe that you can make any website possible on Squarespace.
[2216.40 → 2218.24] Squarespace.com slash WAN.
[2218.50 → 2220.26] Offer code WAN to save 10%.
[2220.26 → 2221.14] Squarespace.
[2221.68 → 2222.26] The best.
[2222.52 → 2223.04] The best.
[2223.10 → 2223.88] What is that?
[2224.00 → 2224.78] Because it's the best.
[2225.16 → 2226.18] We have the best websites.
[2230.86 → 2234.40] We are so not getting any of these sponsors again, ever.
[2234.72 → 2236.14] We have beautiful shirts.
[2236.32 → 2237.60] We have beautiful shirts.
[2237.88 → 2238.94] The best shirts.
[2239.34 → 2240.40] The best shirts.
[2240.42 → 2240.86] Yeah.
[2241.68 → 2242.56] Our shirts.
[2243.20 → 2244.88] My friend called me up, and he's like, you know what, Luke?
[2244.92 → 2245.72] You have the best shirts.
[2245.82 → 2246.34] The best shirts.
[2246.90 → 2247.50] Our shirts.
[2247.58 → 2248.32] Let me tell you.
[2248.54 → 2251.22] Our shirts can't be beat.
[2251.42 → 2251.78] Never.
[2252.12 → 2257.12] Mack Weldon's underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts, hoodies, and sweatpants are the best.
[2258.14 → 2258.86] They're the best.
[2260.00 → 2261.44] They come with silver sometimes.
[2261.70 → 2265.60] Mack Weldon's shirts and underwear make me great again.
[2266.04 → 2266.34] Yeah.
[2267.00 → 2268.06] Do I look great to you?
[2268.08 → 2268.70] They make you smell great again?
[2268.94 → 2269.60] They make me...
[2269.60 → 2270.34] They make you look great again?
[2270.34 → 2273.94] They actually can make you smell a lot better because you can smell pretty bad when you wear
[2273.94 → 2275.34] the same underwear for a long time.
[2275.40 → 2276.12] But these silver.
[2276.20 → 2277.38] Not that I speak from experience.
[2277.72 → 2277.92] Oh.
[2277.98 → 2278.34] Oh.
[2278.34 → 2282.78] Anyway, Mack Weldon does have some really cool stuff.
[2282.86 → 2284.10] So it's comfortable clothes.
[2284.36 → 2288.62] And they have a line of silver underwear and shirts that are naturally antimicrobial, which
[2288.62 → 2289.62] is a thing.
[2290.06 → 2296.08] And to be clear, what antimicrobial means is not that your skin dies because that's not
[2296.08 → 2296.48] the point.
[2296.48 → 2298.70] The point is that bacteria are microbes.
[2299.30 → 2303.24] And fun fact, you probably know this, but maybe some of our viewers don't know this.
[2303.48 → 2305.18] That's what makes sweat smell.
[2305.60 → 2307.22] It's actually bacterial growth.
[2307.54 → 2310.12] So antimicrobial is good if you don't want to smell.
[2310.38 → 2311.56] They won't make you not sweat.
[2311.80 → 2312.68] You're still going to sweat.
[2313.04 → 2316.98] But they can help eliminate odour by being naturally antimicrobial.
[2317.14 → 2321.88] And we know you don't want to think about Christmas yet because, quite frankly...
[2321.88 → 2322.20] I do.
[2322.20 → 2324.66] Who can think about anything positive in the world right now?
[2325.30 → 2328.14] But Mack Weldon stuff makes a great gift.
[2328.36 → 2332.82] So head over to MackWeldon.com and use offer code TECHNICS to save 20%.
[2332.82 → 2333.24] Yes.
[2333.62 → 2336.20] And honestly, it's a good idea to buy Christmas stuff early.
[2336.40 → 2337.60] I'm already gone shopping for my mom.
[2337.72 → 2338.92] I'm already gone shopping for my dad.
[2339.36 → 2341.42] I have part of my brother's gift.
[2341.82 → 2343.46] I have part of my girlfriend's gift.
[2343.58 → 2344.36] You are on the wall.
[2344.40 → 2346.10] I'm already gone shopping for my brother's girlfriend.
[2346.10 → 2349.58] I mean, this is the same guy who has literally come to me at work and said,
[2349.58 → 2352.56] It is birthday for person X.
[2353.30 → 2355.80] What can I steal from the office and give to them?
[2355.88 → 2356.46] More than once.
[2356.48 → 2361.02] What do we still have packaging for that I can repurpose to give to someone I know?
[2362.42 → 2364.12] Oh, that's happened a few times.
[2364.30 → 2364.50] Yeah.
[2364.80 → 2365.14] Yeah.
[2365.42 → 2365.86] All right.
[2366.06 → 2367.18] And you know what, though?
[2367.28 → 2369.36] Every single time it's come through, and it's worked.
[2370.14 → 2371.44] Like, it's been great.
[2371.76 → 2372.84] I would never let you down.
[2372.84 → 2373.28] Yeah.
[2374.18 → 2376.00] Leading us to our third sponsor.
[2378.00 → 2380.72] This message brought to you by the Crooked Linus Foundation.
[2381.30 → 2381.62] Wow.
[2381.88 → 2383.34] Ugh, Savage Jerky.
[2383.42 → 2385.04] Now, I actually picked some of the knots.
[2385.14 → 2386.04] I went straight for the maple.
[2387.12 → 2388.00] Because Canada.
[2388.70 → 2389.58] But Savage Jerky.
[2389.58 → 2390.36] He gave me, okay.
[2390.58 → 2392.48] He gave you maple buffalo bacon.
[2392.82 → 2394.42] He gave me Carolina Reaper.
[2394.90 → 2395.94] Mojo Habanero.
[2396.30 → 2397.64] Habanero Buffalo Sauce.
[2397.94 → 2399.30] Ghost Pepper Buffalo Sauce.
[2399.30 → 2401.68] And then, okay, I guess he gave me sweet sriracha barbecue.
[2401.82 → 2402.88] But that seems like a cop out.
[2402.98 → 2403.84] So let's do this up.
[2404.44 → 2404.70] Reaper.
[2405.82 → 2406.18] Wow.
[2406.34 → 2408.00] Well, he really actually offered me all of them.
[2408.38 → 2409.74] You put all those on my side.
[2409.76 → 2411.24] And then I just took the ones I wanted.
[2412.10 → 2414.12] I left all the really spicy stuff for you.
[2414.18 → 2415.10] Crooked Linus, man.
[2415.62 → 2416.16] That's right.
[2416.86 → 2417.54] Crooked Linus.
[2417.72 → 2419.52] So I'm going to start crying and run off the show in about 15 seconds.
[2419.52 → 2420.54] This one's actually perfect.
[2421.16 → 2423.00] I mean, anything with bacon is good.
[2423.14 → 2424.66] And anything with maple is good.
[2424.92 → 2426.36] And it has a bit of a kick to it.
[2426.36 → 2439.16] And what's hilarious about us getting all, like, Trump on our show and even Trump during our sponsor spots is that, like, there is no reason for us to get political.
[2439.86 → 2443.08] All we stand to do is alienate literally half of America.
[2444.36 → 2445.60] That's all we stand to gain.
[2446.26 → 2446.46] Oh.
[2446.46 → 2449.54] But I think they probably just don't care what we think.
[2450.00 → 2451.40] Because we're just Canadians anyway.
[2454.80 → 2457.58] I mean, they call it savage turkey for a reason.
[2458.94 → 2460.04] Oh, my God.
[2464.04 → 2465.16] We don't have any milk.
[2466.70 → 2468.04] Here are some talking points.
[2468.74 → 2470.52] Their turkey is made with the best ingredients.
[2470.52 → 2471.90] The best ingredients.
[2472.08 → 2473.08] It's right in the notes.
[2474.92 → 2476.48] The best ingredients.
[2477.44 → 2484.62] My friend called me up from savage jerky.com and told me that their turkey is made with the best ingredients.
[2485.26 → 2487.06] Without nitrates or preservatives.
[2488.24 → 2490.80] The goal was to create a snack that was full of flavour.
[2490.88 → 2491.60] Was it full of flavour?
[2493.12 → 2494.50] Full of flavour and spice.
[2494.60 → 2497.54] Was it also full of spice?
[2497.54 → 2499.36] But that wasn't bad for you.
[2500.64 → 2503.92] The inspiration came from the flavour of garlic, lime, and cilantro.
[2504.30 → 2506.52] As it brings out the natural flavour of premium beef.
[2507.36 → 2508.48] Could you taste the lime?
[2508.68 → 2509.30] I know.
[2514.00 → 2517.98] They also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and a spice rub.
[2520.46 → 2520.90] Okay.
[2521.26 → 2521.70] That's it.
[2522.48 → 2523.10] I'm done.
[2523.10 → 2526.66] Use OffergoatLTT to save 10% on all their products.
[2526.66 → 2527.68] Go check it out.
[2528.36 → 2528.78] All right.
[2528.96 → 2529.28] Oh.
[2530.42 → 2532.84] And Luke will be joining us again in a while.
[2536.22 → 2536.74] Ah.
[2537.28 → 2540.30] Sometimes I enjoy the shows where there's legitimately no news.
[2540.50 → 2545.54] Where we're like, we have to turn sponsor spots into a way to kill like 20 minutes.
[2545.78 → 2548.42] Because there's really just nothing to talk about this week.
[2549.12 → 2549.32] Hmm.
[2549.48 → 2550.70] No, I do have something good though.
[2550.70 → 2555.12] So one good thing did come out of Trump winning the presidency.
[2555.78 → 2557.28] So I made a bet.
[2558.32 → 2558.72] Crap.
[2558.84 → 2561.12] I was actually really hoping Luke would be here for this.
[2561.60 → 2563.42] So that I could remember.
[2564.76 → 2565.16] Luke.
[2566.16 → 2567.68] When did SEV come up here?
[2568.12 → 2569.50] When did we go to Bubble World?
[2569.78 → 2571.28] And when did I make my bet with him?
[2573.08 → 2574.48] That was a few months ago at this point.
[2574.48 → 2574.66] Oh.
[2574.90 → 2578.30] It was like early in the primaries.
[2578.82 → 2579.06] Yeah.
[2579.30 → 2579.56] Yeah.
[2580.94 → 2582.38] Like six months ago at least?
[2582.74 → 2583.08] Uh-huh.
[2583.20 → 2583.68] Must have been.
[2583.78 → 2584.00] Anyway.
[2584.50 → 2590.46] I made a bet with Seventies, Matt Barsky from Nerd Fusion, that Trump would win.
[2591.04 → 2594.04] He was being completely dismissive of the Donald.
[2594.64 → 2596.08] He was like, it's a joke.
[2596.34 → 2597.10] There's no way.
[2597.34 → 2598.24] This will not happen.
[2598.24 → 2599.90] And I was like, no.
[2600.06 → 2602.32] There's all these things that people are going to like about him.
[2603.16 → 2604.38] And I was like, look.
[2605.40 → 2613.10] If Trump doesn't win, I will wear, my entire team will wear Nerd Fusion shirts for a month.
[2613.10 → 2620.88] But if Trump wins, you and your whole streaming team have to wear Linus Tech Tips shirts for an entire month.
[2621.42 → 2621.90] Yeah.
[2622.10 → 2628.00] So we are getting a lot of free publicity on the Nerd Fusion Twitch channels.
[2628.62 → 2630.76] Because some of those guys are like huge.
[2631.02 → 2631.18] Yep.
[2631.48 → 2632.18] Like the amount.
[2632.60 → 2634.46] This is kind of a funny thing.
[2634.46 → 2643.16] The bet we were making was not a cash bet, but we are actually both fairly significant sized publications.
[2644.38 → 2652.52] And agreeing to a month of like in your face advertising across all of our content.
[2652.66 → 2653.44] Which is like pretty intense.
[2653.94 → 2655.42] It's like a pretty heavy-duty bet.
[2655.88 → 2657.12] And you agreed for like, okay.
[2657.36 → 2659.66] Luke, that's not how you drink water, says Suzuki.
[2660.24 → 2661.10] Yeah, no, that's a bad idea.
[2661.22 → 2661.98] You're doing it wrong.
[2662.26 → 2662.98] Yeah, that's a bad idea.
[2663.40 → 2663.68] No, no.
[2663.68 → 2668.26] Okay, in my defence, usually when there's like a super hot, and it's like a beef jerky thing.
[2669.42 → 2670.22] It's a joke.
[2670.40 → 2671.64] They don't really go that hard.
[2672.48 → 2673.24] Oh my God.
[2673.34 → 2674.30] No, it's like hiccups.
[2674.44 → 2675.54] You have to drink it upside down.
[2675.84 → 2676.38] Oh, nice.
[2676.46 → 2676.66] Okay.
[2677.22 → 2683.44] As far as I can tell, every hiccup's cure was created solely for the purpose of entertaining everyone who doesn't have hiccups in the room.
[2686.04 → 2686.48] Wow.
[2688.00 → 2689.52] You are like, are you okay?
[2689.76 → 2691.76] There was like full seeds in there too.
[2692.30 → 2693.18] Wow, really?
[2693.18 → 2693.68] Really?
[2693.68 → 2693.88] Yeah.
[2694.30 → 2694.66] Okay.
[2694.90 → 2695.12] Yeah.
[2695.70 → 2696.92] So they're for real men.
[2697.76 → 2699.26] I'm actually pretty good with spice too.
[2700.26 → 2701.22] This is not great.
[2701.22 → 2706.88] Oh, Desert Bus has a charity fundraising marathon for whatever it's...
[2706.88 → 2708.72] See, this is the kind of stuff I have to deal with.
[2709.02 → 2711.56] Like, there's nothing wrong with my computer right now.
[2711.92 → 2716.88] But look, I click like an inch and a half to the right and that's the cursor.
[2717.08 → 2717.80] Look at this.
[2718.30 → 2719.10] Look at this.
[2719.10 → 2723.40] See, this is the kind of haunted nonsense that is my life.
[2723.40 → 2725.84] I just have to kind of aim.
[2726.40 → 2727.40] Like...
[2727.40 → 2728.98] See, but this one's fine.
[2729.64 → 2729.98] See?
[2730.12 → 2730.90] This is my life.
[2731.08 → 2731.74] This is what I go through.
[2731.86 → 2732.06] Okay.
[2732.50 → 2733.30] Desert Bus for Hope.
[2733.46 → 2734.18] There you go, guys.
[2734.26 → 2735.46] It's desertbus.org.
[2735.90 → 2736.92] They're doing a thing.
[2737.06 → 2737.94] That's in the doc.
[2738.38 → 2739.58] Supports Child's Play charity.
[2739.66 → 2741.94] November 12th, 10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.
[2742.62 → 2743.04] That's cool.
[2743.04 → 2743.76] So...
[2743.76 → 2744.30] All right.
[2744.54 → 2746.86] YouTube has added support for HDR video.
[2746.98 → 2749.52] The original article here is from The Verge.
[2751.60 → 2753.58] So, I guess that's cool.
[2753.70 → 2754.16] I got it.
[2754.20 → 2754.36] Okay.
[2754.94 → 2757.08] For the four people who have HDR displays,
[2758.10 → 2763.46] you got a more accurate and realistic range of whites and blacks
[2763.46 → 2765.06] as well as a wider range of colours.
[2765.62 → 2767.84] So now they have 4K and HDR,
[2768.60 → 2771.50] just like the newest TVs that most people don't own.
[2772.28 → 2772.78] But that's okay.
[2772.78 → 2775.48] I mean, YouTube's never been afraid to support standards that no one owns.
[2775.56 → 2776.78] I mean, they support 8K.
[2777.34 → 2778.64] So, like, that's a thing.
[2778.72 → 2779.96] There are 8K videos on YouTube.
[2781.72 → 2784.40] With that said, I think we are losing track somewhat
[2784.40 → 2788.12] of what's actually important when it comes to online video streaming.
[2788.66 → 2791.32] So, this is top secret, and you didn't hear it here first,
[2791.44 → 2795.98] but we are definitely looking into online streaming technologies.
[2796.74 → 2797.50] That's all I'm saying.
[2797.70 → 2799.08] That's maybe scarier than The Reaper.
[2800.58 → 2801.74] We're looking into it.
[2801.74 → 2803.94] And the reality of it is...
[2803.94 → 2805.54] Call out to Cat Boiler and Eric.
[2805.90 → 2806.18] Yeah.
[2806.26 → 2807.52] You guys are awesome, by the way.
[2807.60 → 2807.78] Yeah.
[2807.96 → 2810.74] The reality of it is that...
[2811.28 → 2812.82] Here, let me see if I can find it.
[2813.36 → 2815.04] 4K worth.
[2815.04 → 2819.24] Our findings, like, a year ago...
[2819.24 → 2819.64] Oh.
[2819.64 → 2821.16] Still hold true.
[2821.58 → 2828.78] Where the streaming bitrate is far more important than stuff like resolution.
[2828.78 → 2836.12] And while HDR might provide more benefit than simply amping up the resolution,
[2837.20 → 2850.98] I don't think I buy that it is enough more that I would go HDR with, like, the low bitrate anomalies,
[2850.98 → 2857.76] like blocking and banding, versus just having a higher streaming bitrate and a lower resolution.
[2857.76 → 2858.08] Yeah.
[2858.58 → 2859.32] Here it is.
[2859.54 → 2863.52] So, if you haven't watched it already, I'm going to drop this video in the Twitch chat.
[2864.90 → 2866.40] Sorry for everyone watching on YouTube.
[2866.64 → 2867.32] You can go find it.
[2867.32 → 2868.80] It's called 4K Video, Is It Worth It?
[2869.36 → 2870.84] The answer is no.
[2871.08 → 2872.90] The only difference...
[2872.90 → 2878.50] That's why we edit all of our videos at 1080p and upscale to 4K before we upload, when we bother.
[2878.92 → 2886.40] Because the only difference when you watch a 4K video on YouTube is that if you select 4K, it's streaming at a higher bitrate.
[2886.88 → 2888.02] That's what makes the difference.
[2888.02 → 2891.16] It doesn't matter if the original source video was 1080p or 4K,
[2891.36 → 2896.72] because YouTube's 4K is still not even close to what good 1080p would have been anyway.
[2897.32 → 2898.88] So, we'll see.
[2899.10 → 2901.02] We were uploading...
[2901.02 → 2903.02] I mean...
[2903.02 → 2909.46] We were working with high bitrate 720 that looked better than the low bitrate 4K that YouTube serves.
[2910.04 → 2910.26] Yep.
[2910.98 → 2913.32] I wasn't even going to give them that much detail.
[2914.44 → 2917.80] Okay, we are definitely looking into video streaming platforms, so that's a thing.
[2919.02 → 2920.64] What else have we got in the docket for today?
[2922.80 → 2923.08] Rainbow Six...
[2923.08 → 2925.14] Toilet works pretty well when you don't have milk.
[2927.32 → 2928.78] Bring guys or...
[2928.78 → 2929.72] Fat?
[2930.10 → 2930.30] Yeah.
[2930.30 → 2931.10] Bring guys or...
[2931.10 → 2931.24] Fat?
[2932.98 → 2933.42] Alright.
[2933.42 → 2933.80] I don't know.
[2934.12 → 2934.46] Tesla...
[2934.46 → 2935.34] It's been a while since I've read there.
[2935.52 → 2937.54] Original article here is from Wired.com.
[2938.20 → 2941.70] Tesla has given up on free charging.
[2942.66 → 2944.04] What the crap is this?
[2945.10 → 2945.40] Go.
[2945.74 → 2945.94] Go.
[2946.02 → 2946.32] Oh.
[2946.44 → 2947.22] Oh, I clicked.
[2947.44 → 2947.78] Oh.
[2947.94 → 2949.22] Oh, it's a Mitsubishi ad.
[2949.96 → 2950.40] Wow.
[2950.46 → 2952.20] The Lancer at 0% financing?
[2952.20 → 2954.66] I don't even know if...
[2954.66 → 2955.82] Oh, it is Mitsubishi.ca.
[2955.94 → 2956.42] Okay, cool.
[2957.02 → 2958.16] They've given up on free charging.
[2958.26 → 2959.44] That was bound to happen eventually.
[2959.64 → 2962.12] Electricity is not free, especially in California.
[2963.70 → 2968.92] So Tesla had been inviting its customers to plug into chargers that added 200 to 300 miles
[2968.92 → 2969.70] of range per hour.
[2971.00 → 2972.32] Sorry, not a thing anymore.
[2972.54 → 2974.54] Now new Tesla buyers will have to pay.
[2974.54 → 2980.30] Okay, as of January 1st, 2017, anyone who orders a Tesla will get just 400 kilowatt-hours
[2980.30 → 2982.04] of free supercharging credits per year.
[2983.04 → 2986.42] They haven't revealed how much it'll cost after that limit, but said that the small fee will
[2986.42 → 2987.60] be cheaper than buying gas.
[2988.16 → 2988.58] Better be.
[2989.62 → 2994.34] People who ordered their car before this date still get to charge for free for life, which
[2994.34 → 2994.96] is pretty cool.
[2995.38 → 2996.90] Other than Model 3.
[2997.12 → 3001.72] Yeah, that doesn't count the 373,000 people that put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve a
[3001.72 → 3002.10] Model 3.
[3002.20 → 3003.12] That is so many people.
[3003.32 → 3003.70] Unbelievable.
[3004.54 → 3010.38] Tesla has found that more people are charging at these stations than at home, which like,
[3010.82 → 3011.16] wow.
[3011.86 → 3013.02] Who didn't see that one coming?
[3013.52 → 3019.66] If I could charge for free out of my home, or I could pay for it at home, which would I
[3019.66 → 3019.88] do?
[3020.22 → 3022.82] I just spent all of my money on a Tesla.
[3025.34 → 3025.98] All right.
[3026.26 → 3027.26] So that's fine.
[3027.26 → 3030.60] I think he said, if you just get his solar roof stuff, which looks amazing.
[3030.60 → 3033.32] I didn't want to talk about anything else for the rest of the show, by the way.
[3033.32 → 3035.10] So it's an ad.
[3035.18 → 3036.28] It's another ad again.
[3036.44 → 3036.64] Okay.
[3036.70 → 3037.24] Not that.
[3037.56 → 3037.86] Yes.
[3038.04 → 3038.38] This.
[3039.16 → 3039.44] Ha ha.
[3040.10 → 3040.88] Ha ha ha.
[3041.10 → 3041.54] Ha ha.
[3041.54 → 3045.18] Oh, I don't even care that my face is burning.
[3045.18 → 3046.96] This is fantastic.
[3046.96 → 3048.62] Oh, man.
[3048.70 → 3048.90] Okay.
[3049.10 → 3050.50] So leading up to Blazon.
[3051.22 → 3052.72] Dang, Blizzard, you messed up.
[3052.82 → 3056.00] Leading up to Blazon, Nostalgics was like, oh yeah.
[3056.36 → 3060.04] You better explain what the crap Nostalgics is for the people who don't care at all.
[3060.04 → 3064.22] So Nostalgics Begins was a private server for Classic WoW.
[3064.70 → 3066.72] I don't generally support private servers.
[3066.90 → 3068.44] I don't generally think they're a good idea.
[3068.82 → 3072.84] But in this case, the classic content in World of Warcraft is essentially gone.
[3073.98 → 3076.70] Cataclysm broke the world and changed the whole map.
[3077.00 → 3078.80] That is what the word means, by the way.
[3078.90 → 3079.06] Yeah.
[3079.18 → 3079.76] I'm just saying.
[3080.08 → 3080.64] Go ahead, though.
[3080.76 → 3081.00] Wow.
[3082.22 → 3082.62] Wow.
[3083.14 → 3084.34] Crooked Linus being a jerk.
[3086.60 → 3088.84] All the different expansion stuff screwed everything up.
[3089.02 → 3089.28] Whatever.
[3089.56 → 3091.32] If people like that new content, that's great.
[3091.40 → 3094.00] But there are some people that want to play the older stuff as well.
[3094.10 → 3094.78] Maybe Classic.
[3095.00 → 3095.92] Maybe Burning Crusade.
[3096.00 → 3096.96] Maybe Rate of the Like King.
[3097.46 → 3098.70] But the older stuff.
[3100.30 → 3101.12] So Nostalgics.
[3101.12 → 3102.52] Old people who are 26, mate.
[3104.48 → 3106.12] Nostalgics wants to bring in.
[3106.12 → 3106.92] I'm not 26 yet.
[3106.92 → 3115.88] Nostalgics wanted to bring in Classic WoW in a good, solid form with no pay to win, no donations even.
[3116.64 → 3121.78] And just let people play the game the way it was supposed to be played back then.
[3121.86 → 3123.82] The way it was meant to be played in video for life!
[3123.92 → 3124.28] Yes!
[3127.14 → 3128.16] Which is great.
[3128.80 → 3131.70] And then Blizzard was like, cease and desist order.
[3132.30 → 3132.74] Boom.
[3133.78 → 3134.40] Get rest.
[3134.40 → 3135.44] Yeah, we have to go soon.
[3135.50 → 3135.74] We know.
[3136.92 → 3138.28] Thanks.
[3138.80 → 3139.96] My company dinner is tonight.
[3140.36 → 3141.40] But he could talk about Nostalgics.
[3141.40 → 3143.88] I could literally clean up everything and leave.
[3143.94 → 3144.10] Yeah.
[3144.26 → 3145.82] And he could still be talking about Nostalgics.
[3145.88 → 3146.04] Okay.
[3146.24 → 3147.12] I'll talk about it in the car too.
[3147.14 → 3147.90] Explain how it's back.
[3149.18 → 3150.04] Saves and desist order.
[3150.20 → 3150.78] Cut them down.
[3150.88 → 3154.68] They went and had meetings with Blizzard about Blizzard opening official servers and all this kind of stuff.
[3154.78 → 3156.28] It all looked like it was going to be great.
[3156.28 → 3161.74] And then out of nowhere, Blizzard completely stops answering any form of email or any form of communication at all.
[3162.14 → 3163.14] Blazon comes up.
[3163.24 → 3165.96] Nostalgics' only communication is like, we're trying.
[3166.18 → 3168.30] Here, we're going to launch a shirt campaign.
[3168.46 → 3169.14] T-shirt campaign.
[3169.26 → 3170.52] We're not going to keep any of the proceeds.
[3170.52 → 3173.96] People can just buy some cool t-shirts to say Nostalgics on it.
[3173.96 → 3183.48] And then with the last announcement on the t-shirt campaign, they're like, if you don't hear anything at Blazon from Blizzard, you will hear something around Blazon from us.
[3184.06 → 3185.46] And then little like winch face.
[3185.66 → 3186.50] And that was it.
[3187.28 → 3188.38] They just left it at that.
[3188.76 → 3199.06] And then in response to that, because that blew up, Blizzard posted an official post on their own forums saying that there will be no communication about Classic WoW at Blazon.
[3199.06 → 3205.12] Fast forward to Blazon after that massively long post and the giant fights that there were back and forth on that thread.
[3205.40 → 3209.38] People are in the crowd yelling for news about Classic WoW, trying to get stuff going.
[3209.78 → 3211.92] And they don't talk about it, and they ignore it.
[3211.98 → 3215.82] I think there was maybe one official statement of them being like, no, guys, come on, we're not doing this.
[3216.80 → 3217.16] Anyway.
[3218.62 → 3220.06] Where's the official post?
[3220.14 → 3222.44] Because I don't want to get anything wrong.
[3224.50 → 3229.00] Nostalgics came out and said that the source code of Nostalgics will be given to an existing legacy.
[3229.06 → 3234.14] Project, which we believe to be the most in line with our core values, named Elysium.
[3234.24 → 3234.90] There are no donations.
[3235.16 → 3236.00] It's all run for free.
[3236.16 → 3236.62] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3237.42 → 3241.40] This server shares the volunteer spirit and passion for the game that we had.
[3241.78 → 3247.22] Furthermore, and an important part of Nostalgics volunteers are already working there.
[3247.60 → 3248.78] Some under different names.
[3248.78 → 3254.82] We wish them the best and hope that they will become a new home for the returned vanilla community,
[3255.30 → 3258.30] Nostalgics admin Viper wrote on a forum post.
[3258.30 → 3262.94] Essentially, they're giving everything to Elysium WoW.
[3264.50 → 3267.82] And if you had an old account, your old account will be able to come back.
[3267.86 → 3268.66] You'll be able to log into it.
[3268.72 → 3269.48] All your stuff will be there.
[3269.60 → 3270.54] Guilds are still going to be there.
[3270.72 → 3271.54] Everything's going to work.
[3271.88 → 3273.06] It's going to take about a month.
[3273.06 → 3284.04] And what people are kind of assuming is that considering these guys went and met with Blizzard in person, they don't want to be like, hey, we're putting this back up.
[3284.04 → 3285.04] We're hosting it ourselves.
[3285.28 → 3292.90] So they're giving it to someone else, going publicly at least, hands off, so that they don't have to be too close to it.
[3292.90 → 3294.72] And I am extremely excited.
[3294.98 → 3297.94] The only thing that is very frustrating, I can't stream it.
[3299.08 → 3299.48] Oh.
[3300.14 → 3300.40] Yeah.
[3300.40 → 3305.18] I really want Blizzard to officially host their own damn thing.
[3305.28 → 3306.38] I don't want there to be a private server.
[3306.60 → 3309.00] I want to play on a real Blizzard classic server.
[3309.44 → 3310.24] And I will stream it.
[3310.50 → 3312.06] And I will suggest people come and play it.
[3312.22 → 3313.66] And I'll host my own freaking guild.
[3313.98 → 3315.46] And people can come play with me.
[3315.64 → 3318.52] And I'll promote the awesome thing that Blizzard just did.
[3320.42 → 3323.62] Blizzard doesn't give you a lot of opportunities to promote the awesome thing they just did.
[3323.62 → 3324.80] No, not lately.
[3326.64 → 3327.14] All right.
[3327.18 → 3329.60] Speaking of awesome things, we've got one more topic for you today.
[3329.68 → 3330.48] This is really cool.
[3330.48 → 3343.52] The Kronos 1.4 could be, I think is a little bit optimistic, could be a $2,500 camera that can shoot at 21,650 frames per second.
[3344.34 → 3353.10] So all of a sudden, like, slo-mo guys style footage could be attainable to regular Joes like us.
[3353.62 → 3354.64] That's pretty insane.
[3354.74 → 3356.90] And even just, like, regular Joes.
[3358.22 → 3367.14] So it's the brainchild of engineer David Protein, who demonstrated the camera's hardware and recording capabilities under his YouTube handle Tesla500.
[3367.78 → 3370.84] He lists the pre-production camera features to be the following.
[3370.84 → 3373.38] 1.4 gigapixel per second throughput.
[3373.94 → 3374.80] Throughput, excuse me.
[3375.56 → 3379.10] 1280 by 1024 at 1050 FPS.
[3379.28 → 3383.50] So you could shoot, like, HD at over 1,000 frames per second.
[3383.98 → 3385.78] Lower resolutions, obviously, at higher speeds.
[3386.48 → 3389.64] 8, 16, or possibly 32 gigs of RAM.
[3390.14 → 3394.28] He doesn't know, apparently, because this is a list of the pre-production camera features.
[3394.90 → 3395.86] So there's that.
[3396.22 → 3398.88] Storage on SD card, USB drive, SATA hard drive.
[3399.30 → 3400.44] Raw video saving.
[3400.76 → 3402.14] No PC needed for operation.
[3402.34 → 3403.96] And an AC adapter or battery.
[3404.74 → 3408.62] Planning to launch the camera on GoFundMe rather than Kickstarter in the next month or so.
[3408.88 → 3409.42] Is it real?
[3409.42 → 3410.18] I don't know.
[3410.74 → 3411.78] Would I give money to it?
[3412.32 → 3412.64] No.
[3412.80 → 3413.56] Not until it's done.
[3413.84 → 3414.58] Go farted me?
[3414.70 → 3415.44] When it's done.
[3415.52 → 3416.80] Yeah, go fart me.
[3419.96 → 3423.18] And on that note, thank you very much for tuning into the WAN show.
[3423.28 → 3424.52] We will see you again next week.
[3424.64 → 3427.00] Same bad time, same bad channel, if we're to be believed.
[3428.46 → 3429.00] Wait, no.
[3429.08 → 3430.22] Not same bad time, same bad channel.
[3430.26 → 3430.52] Nope.
[3430.60 → 3430.80] See?
[3431.30 → 3432.00] You caught me.
[3432.30 → 3433.02] Crooked Linus.
[3433.24 → 3433.64] Wrong!
[3433.72 → 3434.12] Wrong!
[3434.12 → 3434.52] Wrong!
[3434.52 → 3434.96] Wrong!
[3434.96 → 3435.14] Wrong!
[3435.14 → 3435.64] Wrong!
[3435.64 → 3436.14] Wrong!
[3436.14 → 3436.64] Wrong!
