[0.00 --> 8.24]  Oh is it doing? Oh it is doing. Cool. Hey. And we are live and like actually in 1080p now. Say what?
[8.24 --> 15.00]  Welcome to the WAN show. Wow. I just I've wanted to say that for a while. Do we even say that? No.
[15.00 --> 23.00]  We do this time. Oh my goodness. Anyways, welcome to the WAN show. The WAN show. Correct.
[23.00 --> 52.70]  We are now actually in 1080p. This chair is so high up. There we go. Last time that we went live we were at like, okay the last time technically we were at 720p. The time before that, still today, we are at 360p. Now we are in 1080p, 29.97 FPS because that camera and everything should theoretically be fine. We were 720p for a little bit too. I said that. Oh. Really great job. I was totally listening. Attentiveness levels.
[52.70 --> 80.48]  Anyways, so what we're trying to do here is a little bit of a year in review, although that is slightly falling apart because a large percentage of the people that work here are leaving because Christmas. So John is in the States. Dennis has gone for some reason. Something is happening somewhere and he has to be there for whatever reason. Burkle isn't here today. So we're going to have Jake right now. Yes.
[80.48 --> 90.26]  We're going to have Tyler on, which you guys haven't met before. Colton and Nick and hopefully Linus and maybe one other person. Taryn and Edsel are probably both too busy, unfortunately.
[90.70 --> 98.62]  We're going to have those guys on. We're going to talk to them about how their year here has gone. What their favorite things have been, what their least favorite things have been, how everything has been going.
[98.62 --> 109.06]  I know you've probably sort of seen mine already. If you're here, you've probably sort of seen a few other ones. We're going to redo those because we're uploading this one to YouTube.
[109.06 --> 118.22]  And yeah, hopefully it is a good show. Did Colton even run the intro last time? I don't think so. I'm going to do it this time. Let's see if it lags out.
[118.96 --> 127.30]  Hey, it's working. I don't know if the music is working. So here we go. They can't even see us right now. Yeah.
[128.06 --> 132.14]  Wancho. Wancho. Weekly analysis and news.
[132.14 --> 138.30]  Yeah. Keep going. Drop the couch. Yeah. Drop the couch on the floor because you really don't snore.
[140.24 --> 141.54]  That was great. Very nice.
[141.96 --> 148.30]  Dollar Shave Club, thank you for sponsoring this show. Although I bet you you're hoping you got a different one.
[148.42 --> 151.80]  Well, they sponsored three shows today now. This is the third one.
[151.82 --> 153.76]  Wow. That value. Yeah.
[153.90 --> 156.28]  That's what it's about, right? That's a lot of value.
[156.28 --> 158.24]  Although I don't know if we did the intro for the other shows.
[158.42 --> 160.08]  It's okay. There's that.
[160.08 --> 163.36]  Jake. Hi. We have to do you first because you're leaving.
[163.64 --> 165.10]  Yeah. You're abandoning the post.
[165.26 --> 168.16]  Mm-hmm. So we got to cover your details first.
[168.40 --> 170.88]  Is my watch over? What do you do? Have you been on Wancho before?
[171.18 --> 173.04]  Uh, no. What do you do? Maybe for like two minutes.
[173.04 --> 176.64]  What do you do here? Uh, I started working here in February.
[177.00 --> 180.14]  Okay. I was doing warehouse stuff. Sort of. Not really.
[180.62 --> 182.22]  Do I need to like stay in a specific spot?
[182.22 --> 184.06]  Yeah. I'm going to get a little closer.
[184.24 --> 187.04]  Wow. Okay. Uncomfortable.
[187.24 --> 189.32]  Wow. That's only okay with Linus.
[189.32 --> 190.50]  Yeah. Is it?
[190.56 --> 191.74]  I'm only allowed to do that with Linus.
[191.82 --> 193.98]  Oh, okay. Right. Because there's like fan fiction and stuff.
[195.38 --> 196.34]  Anyways, what do you do?
[196.46 --> 199.00]  Um, I started working here doing warehouse stuff.
[199.06 --> 201.68]  I never actually really ended up doing any warehouse things.
[202.02 --> 203.90]  As soon as I started working here, Linus was like,
[203.94 --> 205.46]  Hey, I need you to help me with this computer.
[205.68 --> 207.20]  Or like disassemble this computer.
[207.64 --> 208.58]  Assemble this computer.
[208.74 --> 212.36]  And then so I never really ended up ever doing anything in the warehouse.
[213.10 --> 213.30]  Okay.
[213.30 --> 213.40]  Okay.
[213.98 --> 218.68]  And then Siler got hired a few months ago.
[219.22 --> 219.60]  Ignore.
[220.08 --> 220.30]  What?
[220.44 --> 220.76]  Pay attention.
[220.88 --> 221.16]  Okay.
[221.32 --> 227.52]  And now, now I like do benchmarking and review stuff sometimes.
[227.60 --> 228.42]  I'm looking at the thing.
[228.52 --> 229.14]  I can see it.
[230.06 --> 231.04]  It's kind of shiny.
[231.60 --> 231.96]  A little bit.
[232.08 --> 232.92]  You see that little twinkle?
[233.00 --> 234.10]  So benchmark, review things.
[234.10 --> 234.56]  Benchmark.
[234.86 --> 235.74]  Trying to get into writing.
[236.34 --> 236.70]  Yeah.
[237.54 --> 238.42]  We'll see how that goes.
[241.18 --> 242.02]  That should be good.
[242.10 --> 244.10]  What's your favorite thing that happened this year?
[244.42 --> 245.82]  To do with Linus Media Group.
[246.08 --> 247.78]  I'm going to say something different than I did last time.
[251.06 --> 252.50]  Favorite thing this year.
[253.62 --> 256.10]  I'm going to go with the Chalk Bomb battle on Channel Super Fun.
[256.26 --> 256.46]  Nice.
[256.46 --> 257.76]  If you haven't seen that, go check it out.
[257.90 --> 258.04]  Yeah.
[258.60 --> 260.32]  It was pretty great.
[260.40 --> 260.98]  That was very good.
[260.98 --> 263.86]  I like smacked Luke in the face with Chalk like three times.
[263.96 --> 264.24]  He did.
[264.86 --> 266.68]  I can still see a little bit of yellow right there.
[266.84 --> 267.10]  I don't know.
[267.24 --> 268.08]  I don't think that's how that works.
[268.40 --> 268.56]  Yeah.
[268.66 --> 269.64]  It's definitely not how that works.
[269.70 --> 269.80]  Wow.
[270.08 --> 270.34]  Okay.
[271.88 --> 272.54]  Worst thing.
[273.06 --> 273.66]  Least favorite thing.
[274.92 --> 276.84]  I said this is my favorite thing last time.
[277.88 --> 278.08]  Okay.
[278.18 --> 280.08]  So the good part of it.
[280.10 --> 281.22]  I don't even think I got to it.
[281.44 --> 283.12]  But I'll say this is the worst thing that happened.
[283.24 --> 283.78]  Last night.
[284.20 --> 285.46]  You all probably already heard this again.
[285.46 --> 285.58]  Last night?
[285.72 --> 286.76]  Last night.
[287.04 --> 287.96]  Was your favorite thing.
[287.98 --> 288.12]  No.
[288.22 --> 288.80]  Worst thing.
[288.80 --> 290.86]  Not at your house.
[290.98 --> 293.30]  Last night.
[294.36 --> 295.40]  Last night.
[295.90 --> 296.80]  Holy shit.
[297.10 --> 298.64]  Last night at.
[299.24 --> 299.64]  Um.
[299.98 --> 300.22]  Uh.
[300.28 --> 300.66]  No.
[301.94 --> 302.82]  Last night.
[303.52 --> 304.68]  At the office.
[305.08 --> 305.90]  5 p.m.
[305.92 --> 306.14]  Ish.
[306.68 --> 308.88]  So me and Brandon working on guidance for a script.
[309.04 --> 310.38]  So when you write a script.
[310.72 --> 311.48]  You have guidance.
[312.46 --> 312.90]  People.
[313.32 --> 317.22]  So you tell the editors and the shooters what needs to like end up in the video.
[317.22 --> 318.80]  Like hey I want this graph.
[318.92 --> 321.22]  I want this b-roll shot of this thing.
[321.84 --> 322.14]  Uh.
[322.76 --> 323.46]  It was good.
[323.58 --> 324.18]  We got it done.
[324.48 --> 325.74]  Last time than we thought we did.
[325.96 --> 326.34]  Uh.
[326.34 --> 326.90]  Than we would.
[327.08 --> 328.40]  So I saved it onto the server.
[328.90 --> 330.54]  And I had to come back to it because I missed something.
[331.26 --> 331.66]  Uh.
[331.74 --> 332.44]  Open the file.
[332.86 --> 334.60]  Every single comment is gone.
[334.82 --> 336.28]  Every single piece of guidance is gone.
[336.34 --> 338.84]  Except like the very first one I made like a week ago.
[338.84 --> 342.54]  I was just like okay.
[343.04 --> 344.66]  Just gonna like leave now.
[345.46 --> 346.90]  Like this is so bad.
[347.56 --> 349.50]  I did find a thing online.
[349.64 --> 352.32]  Because apparently word docs are like just like a zip file.
[352.80 --> 354.04]  So you just like extract it.
[354.42 --> 355.54]  And then all the stuff is inside.
[355.88 --> 357.90]  So there's like a comments dot XML or whatever.
[358.18 --> 358.42]  Oh wow.
[358.42 --> 360.64]  And I found the error and like deleted it.
[360.74 --> 362.40]  And I lost some of the comments.
[362.60 --> 363.88]  But most of them were covered.
[364.44 --> 366.38]  So it was very bad turned git.
[367.22 --> 367.44]  Cool.
[368.02 --> 368.64]  What about you?
[369.08 --> 369.90]  What about me?
[370.22 --> 370.44]  Yeah.
[370.52 --> 371.60]  I'm interviewing other people.
[371.80 --> 371.94]  Oh.
[372.06 --> 372.98]  What I'm reviewing you.
[373.20 --> 374.42]  Flip the flip the table here.
[374.42 --> 375.66]  I've already done mine.
[375.74 --> 376.60]  But I'll go through it again.
[376.70 --> 381.82]  My favorite part of this year hands down was the most recent Scrapyard Wars with uh.
[384.12 --> 385.10]  Can they hear that?
[385.42 --> 385.78]  Probably.
[385.96 --> 387.04]  They can probably hear that.
[387.04 --> 387.38]  That's fine.
[387.38 --> 387.70]  Anyways.
[387.88 --> 389.60]  My favorite thing this year was the yeah.
[389.70 --> 391.64]  Brand new Scrapyard Wars with BS mods.
[391.78 --> 392.48]  Bob and Rod.
[392.58 --> 393.40]  Rod was on my team.
[393.48 --> 394.18]  Had tons of fun.
[394.56 --> 396.42]  Built probably one of my favorite mods ever.
[396.42 --> 397.24]  Which is right.
[397.24 --> 398.04]  Uh.
[398.50 --> 398.86]  There.
[399.40 --> 400.38]  Almost poked him in the head.
[400.48 --> 401.04]  But didn't quite.
[401.32 --> 401.96]  It's right there.
[402.20 --> 404.22]  We still kept it because it's so awesome.
[404.36 --> 406.20]  It's like the Mad Max inspired build.
[406.38 --> 409.52]  That literally shot fire out of the computer.
[409.68 --> 410.92]  You see the little gauge right there?
[410.92 --> 411.32]  Probably.
[411.42 --> 411.96]  Did that work?
[412.14 --> 412.80]  Did the gauge work?
[412.92 --> 413.68]  The gauge didn't work.
[413.78 --> 417.14]  That's a like gigawatt gauge or megawatt gauge or something.
[417.48 --> 418.44]  Like it's ridiculous.
[418.56 --> 419.52]  It's for like power plants.
[419.64 --> 419.94]  It's not.
[420.04 --> 421.08]  It's not for that computer.
[421.38 --> 421.54]  Yeah.
[421.64 --> 423.68]  This is my wattage level in gigawatts.
[423.86 --> 424.26]  But yeah.
[424.26 --> 427.42]  That was a ton of fun and inspired me to do.
[429.00 --> 429.72]  Gigawatt?
[429.72 --> 432.40]  DIY gifts for Christmas.
[432.80 --> 433.06]  Oh.
[434.06 --> 434.18]  Oh.
[434.18 --> 434.46]  Mm-hmm.
[434.58 --> 435.68]  Which have been a bit of an adventure.
[435.90 --> 436.24]  Mm-hmm.
[436.40 --> 438.08]  Jake's been there for a fair amount of that.
[438.18 --> 438.52]  Mm-hmm.
[438.60 --> 441.72]  Thank you Jake's dad who's helped me with things.
[441.86 --> 443.82]  I'm not going to say what things because it's not Christmas yet.
[443.92 --> 444.14]  Yeah.
[444.14 --> 445.66]  Like two days?
[446.12 --> 446.38]  Jeez.
[447.50 --> 448.20]  That came quick.
[448.32 --> 449.24]  Boom Liam in chat.
[449.56 --> 451.14]  1.21 gigawatts.
[451.82 --> 452.30]  Gigawattts.
[453.20 --> 453.48]  Yeah.
[453.82 --> 455.42]  So those have been a little bit of a nightmare.
[455.54 --> 457.92]  I've lost a lot of sleep over those projects.
[458.00 --> 458.40]  Same dude.
[458.88 --> 459.12]  Yeah.
[459.32 --> 459.72]  Apparently.
[459.80 --> 459.82]  Get wrecked.
[459.82 --> 461.32]  I joined the no sleep club.
[461.46 --> 461.94]  Get wrecked.
[462.44 --> 463.58]  You don't really need sleep to do work.
[463.58 --> 463.78]  Yeah.
[463.84 --> 464.20]  That's fine.
[464.60 --> 465.52]  You just drink more caffeine.
[465.82 --> 466.36]  Mm-hmm.
[466.46 --> 466.76]  G-fuel.
[466.90 --> 467.30]  And survive.
[467.62 --> 468.02]  Mm-hmm.
[468.42 --> 468.82]  Survive.
[469.38 --> 469.74]  Anyways.
[469.90 --> 470.26]  That's all.
[471.22 --> 471.82]  I might.
[472.28 --> 472.68]  No.
[472.68 --> 474.36]  You guys will probably never hear about what those are.
[474.44 --> 474.74]  But yeah.
[474.92 --> 476.10]  I'm doing DIY projects.
[476.78 --> 478.24]  And that's my favorite thing about this year.
[478.64 --> 480.40]  My least favorite thing about this year.
[480.70 --> 481.10]  Uh.
[482.08 --> 483.52]  Related to work.
[485.18 --> 485.58]  Hmm.
[488.04 --> 488.70]  Is Jake.
[488.88 --> 489.08]  Oh.
[489.28 --> 489.46]  Okay.
[489.58 --> 489.76]  Hmm.
[490.02 --> 490.16]  Yeah.
[490.30 --> 490.90]  Appreciate you.
[490.90 --> 491.70]  That was a good call.
[491.96 --> 492.14]  Oh.
[492.26 --> 492.42]  Okay.
[493.16 --> 493.42]  Yeah.
[493.60 --> 493.92]  Wow.
[494.30 --> 494.50]  Yeah.
[495.52 --> 495.88]  Ooh.
[496.12 --> 496.48]  Yeah.
[496.60 --> 499.44]  So I don't really have a ton of other details to add to that.
[499.52 --> 502.38]  It's just his general presence and overall aura.
[502.68 --> 502.92]  Oh.
[503.08 --> 504.18]  It's just negativity.
[504.38 --> 504.66]  Just.
[504.88 --> 505.08]  Yeah.
[505.22 --> 505.46]  You know.
[505.68 --> 505.96]  No.
[506.08 --> 506.24]  No.
[506.32 --> 507.02]  That's not it.
[507.60 --> 507.92]  Um.
[508.10 --> 508.32]  Really?
[508.50 --> 510.26]  Least favorite thing that happened this year.
[510.92 --> 514.06]  There's probably the time that Linus's Twitter got hijacked.
[514.16 --> 514.40]  Oh.
[514.54 --> 514.82]  God.
[514.94 --> 515.70]  That was pretty bad.
[515.78 --> 516.60]  We were out doing.
[516.78 --> 517.14]  Hackers.
[517.36 --> 518.12]  This crazy.
[518.24 --> 518.46]  Oh.
[518.60 --> 518.84]  Come.
[519.48 --> 521.88]  A little bit of an exaggeration.
[522.00 --> 523.94]  That's why they're like sarcastic tone.
[524.04 --> 524.26]  Yeah.
[524.30 --> 524.78]  I got you.
[524.82 --> 525.32]  Like hackers.
[525.54 --> 527.66]  We were out filming this crazy video.
[528.32 --> 528.72]  No.
[528.84 --> 530.08]  Not the pizza computer.
[530.16 --> 531.22]  This got brought up last time too.
[531.22 --> 533.08]  I love the pizza computer.
[533.44 --> 535.00]  I love shooting the pizza computer.
[535.20 --> 535.40]  Pizza.
[535.70 --> 537.40]  I love shooting the pizza computer.
[537.84 --> 540.30]  I love making the pizza heater computer.
[540.46 --> 542.30]  I love the pizza heater computer itself.
[542.46 --> 543.58]  Even though it doesn't exist anymore.
[544.08 --> 544.52]  Um.
[545.90 --> 546.40]  He likes pizza.
[546.40 --> 548.50]  Just because you guys didn't like it.
[548.72 --> 550.64]  Doesn't mean that I didn't like it.
[550.64 --> 554.16]  I might have disliked the amount of dislikes that were on the video.
[554.48 --> 556.10]  And all the negative comments.
[556.32 --> 557.08]  That might have sucked.
[557.20 --> 558.30]  But I love that computer.
[558.36 --> 559.04]  Did it even heat up the pizza?
[559.04 --> 560.82]  And that was not the worst part of this year.
[561.16 --> 561.54]  That was.
[561.96 --> 563.12]  I'm changing my answer.
[563.12 --> 566.16]  My favorite part of this year was building the pizza heater computer.
[566.60 --> 566.72]  Oh.
[566.80 --> 567.64]  You can get wrecked.
[568.00 --> 568.36]  I'm kidding.
[568.54 --> 568.74]  Rod.
[568.92 --> 569.16]  Sorry.
[569.36 --> 569.50]  No.
[569.64 --> 570.60]  Scott Red Horse is the best.
[570.80 --> 571.20]  Roasted.
[571.72 --> 572.74]  Scott Red Horse is the best.
[573.36 --> 573.72]  But yeah.
[573.98 --> 574.50]  Um.
[574.62 --> 577.10]  Probably dealing with that was pretty.
[577.26 --> 578.14]  That was pretty terrible.
[579.02 --> 580.04]  Pretty terrible indeed.
[581.40 --> 583.90]  Work was fairly straight up this year I think.
[584.70 --> 585.48]  Except this week.
[586.40 --> 587.02]  Well no.
[587.08 --> 587.98]  Things were difficult.
[588.30 --> 588.52]  Yeah.
[588.92 --> 589.06]  But.
[590.02 --> 591.70]  And stressful and strenuous.
[591.70 --> 592.66]  This week especially.
[593.38 --> 595.58]  Everything mostly worked.
[596.12 --> 596.36]  Mm-hmm.
[597.40 --> 598.42]  The workshop series.
[601.00 --> 601.76]  There we go.
[602.46 --> 603.34]  There you go.
[603.40 --> 604.20]  That's the worst thing that happened.
[604.20 --> 604.60]  How to.
[604.78 --> 604.94]  GPU.
[605.56 --> 606.08]  That entire.
[606.46 --> 606.68]  No.
[606.86 --> 607.32]  That was fine.
[607.40 --> 607.92]  That was good.
[608.10 --> 610.24]  The likes on that video have slowly increased over time.
[611.46 --> 613.82]  The entire workshop series as a whole.
[613.82 --> 621.68]  So the idea of that concept was that I wanted to show everyone in real time with minimal editing.
[622.36 --> 623.92]  Showing everything on camera.
[624.36 --> 625.32]  Benchmarking things.
[625.32 --> 626.82]  So that they could.
[626.96 --> 630.64]  So that could hopefully add to the legitimacy.
[631.58 --> 633.60]  And make it feel more real.
[634.30 --> 634.40]  Mm-hmm.
[634.52 --> 638.96]  What that turned into however was just kind of a mess.
[639.50 --> 639.96]  Um.
[640.16 --> 641.36]  People didn't really like it.
[641.58 --> 643.58]  People didn't like hearing that everything that they.
[643.58 --> 644.18]  Didn't really like it.
[644.22 --> 645.66]  Do doesn't really matter.
[646.32 --> 646.88]  Um.
[647.80 --> 648.24]  And.
[649.58 --> 650.38]  It's just.
[650.54 --> 652.66]  It was kind of boring to watch.
[654.54 --> 655.58]  They just weren't great videos.
[655.58 --> 658.36]  I think people were trying to like reinforce their purchasing decisions.
[658.94 --> 659.22]  That's a.
[659.22 --> 661.20]  People that spent like hundreds of dollars on fans.
[661.60 --> 662.32]  And then were like.
[662.52 --> 662.72]  Oh.
[662.88 --> 664.06]  This did literally nothing.
[664.38 --> 665.64]  But they make it quieter.
[665.84 --> 666.24]  Like there's.
[666.24 --> 666.90]  There are benefits.
[666.90 --> 667.10]  Yeah.
[667.98 --> 668.28]  Mm-hmm.
[668.38 --> 669.24]  There are benefits.
[669.24 --> 669.58]  Mm-hmm.
[669.58 --> 670.06]  Anyways.
[670.20 --> 670.32]  Yeah.
[670.42 --> 671.28]  That was probably the.
[671.38 --> 672.86]  The worst thing that happened this year was.
[672.98 --> 674.20]  Was my workshop series.
[674.32 --> 674.48]  Are you.
[674.48 --> 676.98]  We should do a guide on overclocking pizza.
[678.64 --> 679.76]  It's adding hot sauce.
[680.54 --> 681.12]  But like.
[681.12 --> 681.26]  Well.
[681.38 --> 682.04]  But it depends.
[682.04 --> 683.86]  It's the distribution metrics of the hot sauce.
[683.88 --> 684.04]  Yeah.
[684.14 --> 684.62]  Like you need.
[685.02 --> 687.32]  And like certain hot sauces will give you.
[687.56 --> 688.04]  Like.
[688.52 --> 688.72]  Better efficiency.
[688.72 --> 690.42]  So the amount of Scoville level.
[691.24 --> 692.30]  Well not necessarily.
[692.48 --> 693.04]  Is your gigahertz.
[694.00 --> 694.22]  No.
[694.88 --> 695.36]  Uh.
[696.10 --> 696.52]  Okay.
[696.62 --> 696.80]  No.
[696.86 --> 697.10]  Maybe.
[697.24 --> 697.46]  Yeah.
[697.62 --> 697.80]  Yeah.
[697.80 --> 698.06]  Yeah.
[698.06 --> 698.22]  Yeah.
[698.22 --> 698.46]  Yeah.
[698.46 --> 698.74]  Yeah.
[699.74 --> 700.18]  So.
[700.44 --> 701.88]  What is like the anti-gigahertz.
[702.46 --> 702.52]  Like.
[702.52 --> 702.70]  Like.
[702.78 --> 704.46]  I have a 4.5 gigahertz.
[704.46 --> 705.84]  Pizza.
[706.68 --> 707.08]  Giga.
[707.26 --> 707.58]  Giga.
[707.98 --> 708.72]  Because I have like.
[708.74 --> 709.48]  Giga Scovles.
[711.02 --> 711.46]  Okay.
[711.48 --> 711.98]  I need to go.
[712.22 --> 712.38]  Yeah.
[712.66 --> 713.46]  I'm going to tap.
[713.70 --> 714.96]  Tap on out there buddy.
[715.10 --> 716.90]  So this is the best thing that's happened this year.
[717.28 --> 717.92]  Can I like just.
[717.98 --> 718.76]  Is Jake's leaving.
[719.38 --> 719.78]  Wow.
[720.84 --> 721.36]  Okay.
[722.36 --> 722.76]  Jesus.
[723.48 --> 723.92]  All right.
[724.00 --> 724.54]  Next up.
[724.74 --> 725.62]  We have Tyler.
[726.66 --> 727.00]  So I think.
[727.14 --> 729.18]  Is this the first time you've talked on camera?
[729.46 --> 729.68]  Yeah.
[729.94 --> 731.06]  This is my first speaking role.
[731.24 --> 731.60]  There we go.
[731.60 --> 731.70]  Yeah.
[731.84 --> 732.12]  Nice.
[732.30 --> 732.46]  Yeah.
[732.46 --> 732.66]  Yeah.
[732.96 --> 735.96]  Welcome to the most disastrous WAN show of 2016.
[736.38 --> 736.56]  Yeah.
[737.14 --> 738.48]  I don't even know if that's actually true.
[738.62 --> 739.48]  To be completely fair.
[740.14 --> 740.46]  Okay.
[740.56 --> 741.14]  So what do you do here?
[742.24 --> 745.68]  I'm in charge of inventory, acquisitions, and investigations.
[745.84 --> 746.84]  Also you have to wear the hat if you want.
[746.84 --> 747.50]  I have to wear the hat.
[747.54 --> 747.74]  Yes.
[747.74 --> 747.94]  Okay.
[748.16 --> 749.10]  Unless you're worried about lice.
[749.10 --> 750.48]  In which case you can avoid that rule.
[751.06 --> 751.72]  But I think it's fine.
[752.14 --> 752.30]  Okay.
[752.54 --> 752.68]  Yeah.
[752.80 --> 753.26]  So sorry.
[753.38 --> 753.70]  Say that again.
[754.50 --> 756.16]  Inventory, acquisitions, and investigations.
[756.16 --> 759.46]  And now there's a little bit more.
[760.46 --> 760.82]  Yeah.
[760.90 --> 761.92]  Now I'm also writing.
[762.12 --> 762.44]  Writing.
[762.44 --> 762.68]  Yeah.
[762.68 --> 764.84]  And doing some pre-production stuff.
[765.00 --> 767.36]  Like you worked on the monitor placement video.
[767.54 --> 768.18]  I did the monitors.
[768.50 --> 770.78]  I did the DIY typewriter.
[772.86 --> 775.66]  I don't know if you want to give away that other thing that you were working on.
[775.70 --> 777.64]  But the tabletop thing you can probably talk a little bit about.
[778.50 --> 778.90]  Yeah.
[779.06 --> 779.20]  Sure.
[779.30 --> 779.60]  If you want to.
[779.60 --> 782.66]  We just started a video on technology and tabletop gaming.
[782.86 --> 784.74]  Which I am super excited about.
[785.14 --> 785.36]  Yeah.
[785.62 --> 786.06]  Yeah.
[786.20 --> 788.52]  So Tyler wrote.
[788.92 --> 789.62]  And I helped edit.
[789.76 --> 790.48]  And Linus helped edit.
[790.76 --> 792.94]  And Tyler kind of sculpted this video.
[793.36 --> 794.06]  That is about.
[795.40 --> 796.84]  So I said Minecraft t-shirt.
[797.80 --> 798.32]  It's not.
[798.40 --> 798.86]  Well it is.
[798.88 --> 800.10]  It is a checkered t-shirt.
[800.28 --> 800.46]  Yeah.
[800.46 --> 800.82]  I don't know.
[800.94 --> 801.40]  Sort of.
[801.50 --> 802.38]  It almost gets there.
[802.98 --> 807.08]  But it's not just about tabletop simulator.
[807.08 --> 811.28]  It's about how technology has helped push tabletop gaming.
[811.52 --> 813.08]  Whether that's card gaming or role playing.
[814.04 --> 815.10]  Or whatever.
[815.34 --> 815.74]  Basically.
[816.28 --> 816.62]  Forward.
[817.40 --> 818.30]  3D printers.
[818.86 --> 819.52]  Roll 20.
[819.92 --> 820.80]  Tabletop simulator.
[821.12 --> 821.98]  A whole bunch of different stuff.
[822.04 --> 822.96]  It's actually really interesting.
[823.50 --> 825.06]  That's probably not going to be coming out for like.
[825.62 --> 826.26]  A little bit.
[826.34 --> 827.20]  Unless you're on Full Playing Club.
[827.82 --> 828.46]  But yeah.
[828.58 --> 828.96]  Stay tuned.
[829.14 --> 829.66]  That'll be cool.
[829.94 --> 832.44]  What was your favorite thing that happened this year that had to do with work?
[834.26 --> 835.92]  Oh we're doing like the least favorite.
[836.26 --> 837.06]  Favorite and least favorite.
[837.06 --> 837.62]  Favorite thing.
[837.74 --> 837.90]  Yeah.
[838.34 --> 842.44]  I think the least favorite thing that happened was when we started the WAN show.
[842.76 --> 843.70]  And it was in 320p.
[844.74 --> 847.82]  And then my most favorite thing was when we restarted the WAN show.
[848.08 --> 849.76]  And it was in Full 720p.
[849.78 --> 849.94]  Yeah.
[850.14 --> 850.32]  Yeah.
[850.52 --> 850.68]  Yeah.
[850.92 --> 851.10]  Yeah.
[851.34 --> 851.96]  That's good.
[852.06 --> 852.68]  That's pretty solid.
[853.02 --> 853.60]  That's a good answer.
[853.92 --> 855.10]  I don't have a long memory.
[856.56 --> 858.42]  You can remember like the last hour.
[858.60 --> 859.02]  Hour and a half.
[859.04 --> 861.12]  Those best and worst tend to change on a daily basis.
[861.24 --> 861.78]  That makes sense.
[861.94 --> 862.40]  That's solid.
[862.68 --> 863.08]  That's solid.
[865.52 --> 865.92]  Yeah.
[865.92 --> 866.00]  Yeah.
[866.60 --> 867.16]  I don't know.
[867.16 --> 868.60]  I don't have a ton else to say.
[869.40 --> 870.72]  Do you have any crazy plans?
[872.42 --> 873.48]  For DIY stuff?
[873.48 --> 874.88]  Not that I'm allowed to discuss.
[875.38 --> 877.54]  Most crazy plans have to stay kind of hush hush.
[877.54 --> 880.96]  I'm excited for the one with the woodworking and the tall stuff.
[881.52 --> 881.76]  Yeah.
[881.76 --> 883.22]  That should be a good one.
[883.26 --> 884.20]  I'll give them that much.
[884.52 --> 885.52]  I'll leave you with that.
[885.76 --> 885.90]  Yeah.
[885.94 --> 886.62]  That's all you get.
[887.64 --> 890.34]  Someone's saying that you're possibly the Legend 27.
[891.86 --> 892.64]  Legend 27.
[892.64 --> 894.32]  If you've seen that meme.
[894.64 --> 894.80]  See?
[895.00 --> 896.20]  Tyler is the Legend 27.
[896.40 --> 897.32]  I don't know that meme.
[897.64 --> 897.90]  See?
[898.10 --> 899.16]  He doesn't know that.
[899.38 --> 902.86]  Which is kind of like the same as when someone farts and then they're like, I don't smell anything.
[903.72 --> 904.04]  Right?
[904.14 --> 905.10]  So you are the Legend 27.
[905.36 --> 905.66]  Okay.
[905.92 --> 907.22]  Is this a good thing?
[907.30 --> 908.06]  Is this a bad thing?
[908.40 --> 910.58]  It means you're pretty much the most powerful person in the game.
[912.98 --> 913.34]  Okay.
[915.34 --> 916.74]  That's a hard thing to say no to.
[918.88 --> 919.24]  Okay.
[919.90 --> 920.96]  I think that's about it.
[921.08 --> 923.42]  We were basically just asking best and least.
[923.60 --> 924.52]  Is there anything you want to say?
[924.58 --> 925.86]  This is the first time you've been on camera.
[926.14 --> 926.78]  Or no.
[927.00 --> 928.22]  First time you've spoken on camera.
[928.38 --> 929.12]  First time I've spoken.
[929.42 --> 929.56]  Yeah.
[931.06 --> 933.02]  Well, you think I would have something prepared for that?
[933.16 --> 935.64]  Some kind of meaningful, momentous statement?
[936.22 --> 937.10]  Not necessarily.
[937.64 --> 942.88]  I think the first time that I spoke on camera was pretty not great.
[943.26 --> 944.20]  Was it the WAN show?
[945.06 --> 947.68]  I think possibly the first time I was ever on camera was on the WAN show.
[947.74 --> 948.90]  And my arm was in like a sling.
[949.00 --> 949.82]  And I was like beat up.
[950.58 --> 952.88]  And I just hung out while Linus hosted everything.
[953.06 --> 953.82]  Which was pretty cool.
[956.76 --> 957.12]  Yeah.
[957.48 --> 958.50]  I think I'll get someone else.
[958.50 --> 960.66]  I wish someone stayed here.
[961.28 --> 963.14]  So that we could relay people in.
[963.46 --> 964.84]  But if you want to go grab someone.
[964.84 --> 965.28]  Who do you want?
[965.38 --> 966.04]  That'll also work.
[967.82 --> 969.68]  Colton or Nick would be great.
[970.06 --> 970.16]  Yeah.
[970.32 --> 970.74]  That'll work.
[971.10 --> 971.46]  Thank you.
[971.86 --> 973.38]  And then give them the Santa hat.
[973.84 --> 974.72]  Or just leave it here.
[974.86 --> 975.20]  That works.
[975.44 --> 975.60]  Cool.
[975.76 --> 976.06]  Thank you.
[976.06 --> 977.78]  Okay.
[978.78 --> 979.34]  Great show.
[980.14 --> 981.68]  This is working really well.
[981.92 --> 984.62]  I technically do have a WAN dock.
[984.82 --> 985.84]  There's a few things.
[985.84 --> 989.68]  And there was a NVIDIA job posting.
[989.78 --> 991.06]  I'll try to drop this in the chat.
[991.06 --> 994.02]  That revealed GTX 1080 Ti.
[994.90 --> 999.36]  And a premium Club GeForce Elite subscription.
[1000.14 --> 1001.96]  Which was kind of interesting.
[1002.54 --> 1004.38]  You might even have something to say for this.
[1005.06 --> 1009.16]  Currently we're talking about Club GeForce Elite subscriptions.
[1009.72 --> 1010.04]  Yeah.
[1011.34 --> 1012.12]  What up with that?
[1012.50 --> 1013.26]  I don't even know.
[1013.32 --> 1013.90]  What do you think about that?
[1014.40 --> 1015.86]  It's a little different.
[1016.36 --> 1019.34]  Strong, intense opinions on that at all?
[1020.16 --> 1022.30]  Is it the worst thing that has literally ever happened to the universe?
[1022.52 --> 1023.36]  I mean, yes.
[1023.60 --> 1023.94]  Just kidding.
[1024.10 --> 1024.74]  No, it's not.
[1024.96 --> 1025.72]  No, definitely not.
[1025.82 --> 1029.80]  But I mean, like, it depends on what exactly it is.
[1029.86 --> 1030.96]  And like, the subscription.
[1031.78 --> 1032.76]  It's kind of like, what?
[1032.76 --> 1037.20]  Okay, so with 1080 Ti, I don't think we have a ton of information.
[1038.28 --> 1044.16]  There's one little kind of thing where there was targeted spot prizes to drive incentives.
[1044.58 --> 1045.94]  All this other weird kind of stuff.
[1046.22 --> 1049.04]  And there's something about possibly a form of step-up program.
[1049.94 --> 1051.42]  For owners of the 980 Ti.
[1051.68 --> 1052.06]  Yeah.
[1052.20 --> 1052.44]  Yeah.
[1052.96 --> 1056.64]  Where they could get a first spot in line to get 1080 Ti pre-orders or something.
[1056.78 --> 1057.92]  I don't really know what's going on with that.
[1058.20 --> 1059.66]  This is all very rumor mill right now.
[1059.66 --> 1062.46]  So personally, I don't think it's a super big deal.
[1062.46 --> 1065.70]  Yeah, it's from a LinkedIn job posting, which has since been taken down.
[1065.76 --> 1067.22]  And like, does anyone even have a screenshot?
[1068.20 --> 1069.36]  Because I haven't seen one.
[1072.24 --> 1073.10]  No screenshot.
[1073.60 --> 1074.66]  And then there's a link.
[1074.76 --> 1075.30]  You go to it.
[1075.36 --> 1076.26]  It's been taken down.
[1076.42 --> 1077.02]  So it's just like.
[1077.42 --> 1077.62]  Yeah.
[1078.16 --> 1078.40]  Yeah.
[1078.58 --> 1078.90]  Okay.
[1079.28 --> 1082.00]  So I kind of wonder if it's like a fake NVIDIA posting it.
[1082.50 --> 1083.08]  But who knows?
[1083.36 --> 1083.56]  Yeah.
[1083.90 --> 1084.28]  Who knows?
[1084.72 --> 1085.38]  I mean, like.
[1085.46 --> 1085.84]  Who knows?
[1086.96 --> 1087.92]  1080 Ti, it's going to come out.
[1087.96 --> 1088.76]  It's not surprising, right?
[1088.78 --> 1088.94]  Yeah.
[1088.94 --> 1091.74]  No, it's not like the craziest news we've ever heard.
[1091.88 --> 1092.54]  So, yeah.
[1093.06 --> 1097.48]  And then there's the Club GeForce Elite kind of deal.
[1098.56 --> 1101.40]  This has been interesting.
[1101.40 --> 1104.58]  It says that there's possibly beta access for Talos.
[1105.22 --> 1107.22]  And NVIDIA first party content.
[1107.58 --> 1108.00]  There's like.
[1108.34 --> 1110.34]  You get some indie games.
[1110.52 --> 1114.02]  And you get a subscription to their cloud gaming service thing.
[1114.02 --> 1116.42]  And you get some other stuff.
[1116.68 --> 1117.04]  Maybe.
[1118.72 --> 1120.08]  It's $10 a month.
[1120.22 --> 1123.64]  To me, it feels a lot like paying those like console subscription things.
[1123.70 --> 1124.24]  Put the hat on.
[1124.24 --> 1126.02]  I know it's not the same thing.
[1126.16 --> 1127.40]  Before everyone freaks out.
[1127.74 --> 1128.16]  I get it.
[1128.34 --> 1130.48]  It doesn't like give you access to play internet games.
[1130.72 --> 1130.86]  Yeah.
[1130.94 --> 1131.36]  But it just.
[1132.02 --> 1132.32]  Eh.
[1132.94 --> 1135.18]  Annual benefits include a free indie game.
[1135.82 --> 1139.38]  Custom skin or in-game items for AAA games every few months.
[1139.38 --> 1139.86]  Yeah.
[1144.32 --> 1144.66]  There's.
[1144.80 --> 1150.40]  You get free game codes, in-game currency, early beta access to certain games, gaming accessories,
[1150.88 --> 1153.94]  and tickets to gaming events like BlizzCon or PAX.
[1154.18 --> 1154.26]  Yeah.
[1154.32 --> 1155.28]  That's pretty crazy.
[1155.58 --> 1156.00]  That'd be cool.
[1156.12 --> 1156.44]  Actually.
[1158.14 --> 1158.38]  Sorry.
[1160.38 --> 1160.90]  Yeah.
[1161.28 --> 1165.66]  There's also users will be rewarded for submitting bug reports or contributing useful feature requests.
[1165.96 --> 1166.86]  It's also interesting.
[1168.14 --> 1169.16]  Oh, that was the chair.
[1169.16 --> 1170.20]  I thought you just ripped one.
[1170.74 --> 1171.06]  No.
[1171.06 --> 1171.34]  No.
[1171.80 --> 1172.78]  It's just like shh.
[1172.86 --> 1173.34]  It's all good.
[1173.64 --> 1176.82]  Most active forum users will also be given game codes.
[1177.42 --> 1184.32]  And as will the users who rank the most negative or the most positive in their sentiment tools.
[1184.42 --> 1186.56]  The negative part is kind of interesting.
[1188.88 --> 1190.16]  Does Nvidia want trolls?
[1190.46 --> 1192.12]  But then this is all rumor mill stuff.
[1192.34 --> 1192.44]  Yeah.
[1192.44 --> 1193.44]  So who knows.
[1193.56 --> 1195.72]  But moving back from that topic.
[1196.10 --> 1196.94]  Cal Tane.
[1197.04 --> 1197.26]  Hey.
[1197.36 --> 1197.76]  What up?
[1198.54 --> 1198.92]  How you doing?
[1198.92 --> 1199.92]  That's my question to you.
[1200.08 --> 1200.28]  What?
[1200.36 --> 1200.76]  How's it going?
[1201.08 --> 1201.56]  Oh, good, man.
[1201.74 --> 1202.26]  That's pretty good.
[1202.38 --> 1202.76]  Doing good.
[1202.82 --> 1203.46]  I'm doing good now.
[1203.80 --> 1204.04]  Nice.
[1204.12 --> 1204.54]  Doing good.
[1204.66 --> 1205.80]  Because everything's working.
[1205.94 --> 1206.96]  Because everything's working.
[1206.98 --> 1207.48]  Everything's working.
[1207.66 --> 1208.00]  Anyways.
[1208.24 --> 1208.54]  Yeah, man.
[1209.58 --> 1212.54]  Speaking of which, worst thing this year.
[1212.90 --> 1213.86]  Worst thing this year.
[1214.10 --> 1214.34]  Woo.
[1214.96 --> 1215.14]  Yeah.
[1215.14 --> 1215.28]  Woo.
[1215.66 --> 1215.84]  Yeah.
[1215.84 --> 1219.80]  I already went over my best thing.
[1219.80 --> 1220.56]  But we're still.
[1221.60 --> 1222.46]  I know that's tough.
[1222.52 --> 1223.96]  Like I was saying to Nick earlier.
[1224.28 --> 1224.46]  Like.
[1225.40 --> 1226.68]  This year's actually been pretty good.
[1226.80 --> 1226.98]  Like.
[1229.26 --> 1229.96]  Nothing like.
[1230.52 --> 1232.02]  Really, really, really bad.
[1232.02 --> 1233.10]  That like sticks out in my mind.
[1233.14 --> 1233.30]  I'm like.
[1233.30 --> 1233.56]  Oh, my.
[1239.76 --> 1241.54]  You more often than happens to me now.
[1241.70 --> 1242.24]  Yeah, that's cool.
[1242.50 --> 1242.80]  Thanks.
[1243.00 --> 1243.16]  Yeah.
[1243.22 --> 1243.56]  No problem.
[1243.56 --> 1243.88]  No problem.
[1244.08 --> 1244.50]  No problem.
[1244.60 --> 1244.70]  Yeah.
[1244.70 --> 1248.84]  Worst thing that happened this year.
[1249.18 --> 1250.38]  I think the chat's saying.
[1251.32 --> 1252.94]  When you were running at 360p.
[1253.12 --> 1253.38]  On the WAN.
[1253.40 --> 1253.86]  You know what?
[1253.90 --> 1254.54]  You know what, guys?
[1254.70 --> 1255.16]  You know what?
[1255.68 --> 1256.00]  Yes.
[1256.40 --> 1257.28]  So this one time.
[1257.40 --> 1258.24]  When this goes to YouTube.
[1259.00 --> 1260.16]  We did the WAN show.
[1260.46 --> 1261.48]  At 360p.
[1261.56 --> 1263.08]  And then we had to restart the whole WAN show.
[1263.16 --> 1264.08]  I don't remember when that happened.
[1264.14 --> 1265.18]  I don't remember what day that was.
[1266.44 --> 1266.76]  Yeah.
[1266.94 --> 1267.50]  So that happened.
[1267.58 --> 1268.00]  That's actually.
[1268.08 --> 1268.50]  You know what?
[1269.02 --> 1269.84]  It's a good way to end of the year.
[1269.90 --> 1270.70]  That's probably the worst thing.
[1271.08 --> 1272.30]  I'll go with that, actually.
[1272.50 --> 1272.68]  Yeah.
[1272.78 --> 1274.04]  That means you went through the whole year.
[1274.04 --> 1275.26]  Without that much bad stuff happening.
[1275.36 --> 1276.36]  Because it's not that bad.
[1276.40 --> 1276.66]  No.
[1276.78 --> 1276.96]  No.
[1277.04 --> 1277.32]  Exactly.
[1277.52 --> 1279.20]  I mean, we're fixing it literally right now.
[1279.22 --> 1279.42]  Yeah.
[1279.56 --> 1279.86]  Thanks.
[1279.92 --> 1280.36]  Thanks, guys.
[1280.46 --> 1280.66]  Thanks.
[1280.76 --> 1280.92]  Yeah.
[1281.00 --> 1281.60]  There we go.
[1282.18 --> 1282.50]  Yeah.
[1282.62 --> 1283.64]  And then best thing.
[1284.02 --> 1284.86]  Probably trips.
[1285.40 --> 1286.42]  Were you going to ask that?
[1286.92 --> 1287.24]  I was.
[1287.26 --> 1287.56]  Was you going to?
[1287.66 --> 1288.16]  No, I was.
[1288.16 --> 1289.12]  I don't know if you were going to go just the negative.
[1289.22 --> 1289.32]  Yeah.
[1289.42 --> 1289.92]  No, no, no.
[1290.04 --> 1291.02]  Definitely positive as well.
[1291.34 --> 1292.46]  So you had a couple of those.
[1292.72 --> 1292.88]  Yeah.
[1293.00 --> 1293.56]  You went to San Fran.
[1294.14 --> 1294.80]  Was that this year?
[1295.10 --> 1295.32]  Okay.
[1295.42 --> 1295.82]  Luke.
[1295.88 --> 1296.42]  Come on, dude.
[1296.50 --> 1297.24]  That was last year.
[1297.28 --> 1298.24]  That was last November.
[1299.16 --> 1300.44]  That was last November.
[1300.44 --> 1303.68]  We went to San Francisco for a VR thing.
[1303.72 --> 1305.02]  So it's been over a year.
[1305.16 --> 1305.48]  Yes.
[1305.54 --> 1306.42]  It has been over a year.
[1306.56 --> 1306.66]  But.
[1306.74 --> 1306.90]  All right.
[1307.08 --> 1309.00]  So this year, CES.
[1309.12 --> 1312.00]  Going to CES for the first time after hearing about it from all you guys.
[1312.24 --> 1312.42]  Yeah.
[1312.44 --> 1313.68]  You know, it's this big crazy thing.
[1314.00 --> 1314.56]  Linus Tech Tips.
[1314.70 --> 1317.78]  We, you know, make like between 40 and 50 videos in like a week.
[1318.08 --> 1318.58]  I don't know why.
[1318.64 --> 1319.54]  Being on the sales side of things.
[1319.60 --> 1320.14]  I'm like, oh, yeah.
[1320.14 --> 1320.92]  Just make some videos.
[1321.00 --> 1321.60]  And you guys will be fine.
[1321.62 --> 1321.94]  It'll be easy.
[1322.48 --> 1322.92]  Get there.
[1322.96 --> 1324.20]  And I'm like, holy cow.
[1324.26 --> 1325.02]  This is a real thing.
[1325.10 --> 1326.58]  This is nuts.
[1327.00 --> 1328.20]  This is insanity.
[1328.38 --> 1329.34]  Just running around.
[1329.68 --> 1333.96]  You got the business team going to meetings with all the different partners and brands.
[1334.18 --> 1336.96]  And going with you guys to check out really cool stuff.
[1337.08 --> 1341.62]  And then like John's roaming the show floor to try to get top fives of things.
[1341.78 --> 1346.76]  And like I'm just kind of walking around just checking things out.
[1346.90 --> 1348.86]  So that was a really cool experience.
[1350.20 --> 1352.44]  Also, the Mexico trip.
[1352.58 --> 1353.84]  I thought that was a lot of fun.
[1353.84 --> 1356.42]  I see why some people didn't have as much fun.
[1356.78 --> 1357.92]  On a workcation.
[1358.14 --> 1359.36]  Because they had a lot of stuff to do.
[1361.46 --> 1362.48]  And left his room.
[1363.42 --> 1364.36]  Unless he was working.
[1364.42 --> 1365.32]  Unless he was working, yeah.
[1365.48 --> 1366.98]  But I thought that was really cool too.
[1367.02 --> 1369.12]  Because I've never been to Mexico.
[1369.44 --> 1370.66]  So that was pretty cool to see.
[1370.90 --> 1372.38]  And doing all the expeditions.
[1372.40 --> 1373.88]  Or the, yeah, expeditions.
[1374.04 --> 1374.56]  I don't know.
[1374.64 --> 1375.62]  Doing all the activities.
[1375.96 --> 1376.10]  Yeah.
[1376.12 --> 1376.34]  Right.
[1376.38 --> 1378.54]  So you'll see a lot of those on Channel Sieber Fun.
[1378.62 --> 1380.28]  We got a lot of content over there.
[1380.42 --> 1382.00]  But doing those was pretty cool.
[1382.00 --> 1384.14]  So we actually got to keep busy.
[1384.40 --> 1385.26]  What just happened?
[1385.62 --> 1387.00]  We're having tons of audio problems.
[1387.24 --> 1387.62]  Oh.
[1389.44 --> 1389.84]  Really?
[1390.42 --> 1390.82]  Yeah.
[1392.08 --> 1392.48]  Interesting.
[1392.86 --> 1393.16]  Yeah.
[1393.16 --> 1394.68]  Well.
[1395.80 --> 1396.70]  Don't touch the mic.
[1397.40 --> 1398.18]  Well, I didn't touch the mic.
[1398.20 --> 1398.82]  Don't touch the mic cable.
[1398.82 --> 1399.26]  Audio's fine.
[1399.26 --> 1399.66]  So we're good now.
[1400.50 --> 1401.46]  So I touched the mic cable.
[1401.56 --> 1401.92]  And it was like.
[1402.12 --> 1402.32]  Yeah.
[1402.86 --> 1403.08]  Oh.
[1403.32 --> 1404.04]  But we're good now.
[1404.16 --> 1404.74]  Everything's fine.
[1404.86 --> 1404.88]  Okay.
[1404.88 --> 1405.08]  Cool.
[1405.22 --> 1405.82]  Everything's fine.
[1405.94 --> 1406.16]  Yeah.
[1406.44 --> 1406.88]  So the shows.
[1407.48 --> 1407.70]  Yeah.
[1407.78 --> 1408.26]  And I also.
[1408.38 --> 1410.10]  I actually went to VidCon by myself.
[1410.82 --> 1412.38]  Which was different.
[1413.34 --> 1413.58]  So.
[1413.94 --> 1414.40]  I don't know.
[1414.44 --> 1415.24]  I didn't see a lot of our.
[1415.48 --> 1416.52]  You came to PAX.
[1416.92 --> 1417.12]  Yeah.
[1417.20 --> 1417.70]  PAX was cool.
[1417.88 --> 1419.30]  That was the first PAX I've ever been to.
[1419.76 --> 1419.98]  Yeah.
[1420.44 --> 1420.76]  So.
[1421.32 --> 1422.60]  That was really cool to see.
[1422.78 --> 1424.52]  I kind of like geeked out to like Final Fantasy XV.
[1424.66 --> 1424.88]  I was like.
[1424.96 --> 1425.48]  Oh my gosh.
[1425.72 --> 1426.42]  Final Fantasy XV.
[1426.94 --> 1427.52]  Play that.
[1427.96 --> 1429.00]  Hang out with you guys.
[1429.34 --> 1429.84]  The LAN.
[1430.08 --> 1430.64]  That was a lot of fun.
[1430.88 --> 1431.28]  Oh my gosh.
[1431.44 --> 1432.06]  Oh thanks dude.
[1432.12 --> 1432.36]  Candy?
[1432.62 --> 1432.82]  Yeah.
[1432.96 --> 1433.20]  Candy.
[1434.20 --> 1435.06]  Did you bring these Ed?
[1435.18 --> 1435.72]  I choose.
[1436.02 --> 1436.28]  Sorry?
[1436.72 --> 1437.02]  Mango.
[1437.28 --> 1438.40]  But you brought them to me.
[1438.66 --> 1439.70]  And that's what matters.
[1440.96 --> 1441.84]  So it definitely.
[1441.84 --> 1443.12]  There was a pile of these.
[1443.26 --> 1444.24]  Before we set up Wancho.
[1444.28 --> 1445.84]  There was a pile of empty wrappers on the desk.
[1446.06 --> 1446.76]  Is that from you?
[1447.00 --> 1447.20]  No.
[1447.48 --> 1447.82]  Oh okay.
[1447.90 --> 1448.16]  I don't know who that's from.
[1448.16 --> 1449.48]  I've had one other than this one.
[1449.60 --> 1450.16]  Thanks Ed.
[1450.34 --> 1450.54]  Yeah.
[1450.60 --> 1451.00]  Thanks dude.
[1451.96 --> 1453.30]  Ed's probably not going to be on the show.
[1453.38 --> 1454.36]  Because he's feeling really sick.
[1454.64 --> 1455.66]  Is that a confirm Ed?
[1455.76 --> 1456.72]  Edsel you want to be on the WAN show?
[1456.80 --> 1456.98]  Come here.
[1457.46 --> 1459.16]  Are you going to be on the show or are you too sick?
[1459.24 --> 1459.46]  Come here.
[1460.22 --> 1463.04]  I know talking has been not awesome.
[1464.64 --> 1466.14]  I've never seen you on the WAN show.
[1466.40 --> 1467.24]  Do you guys know Edsel?
[1467.40 --> 1468.18]  You guys ever met Edsel?
[1469.16 --> 1469.90]  You're not on screen.
[1469.90 --> 1471.20]  I don't think you're even in frame.
[1471.44 --> 1471.80]  There you go.
[1471.80 --> 1472.30]  Now you're in frame.
[1472.70 --> 1473.24]  Merry Christmas.
[1474.02 --> 1474.34]  Whoa.
[1475.20 --> 1475.52]  Okay.
[1477.20 --> 1478.66]  There we go.
[1478.76 --> 1479.22]  That's Edsel.
[1479.22 --> 1481.80]  I mean realistically that's all you need to know.
[1482.32 --> 1482.98]  I guess.
[1483.30 --> 1483.88]  According to him.
[1484.58 --> 1484.80]  Great.
[1485.94 --> 1486.18]  Yeah.
[1486.78 --> 1487.18]  Trips.
[1487.94 --> 1489.08]  Excited for this year's.
[1489.38 --> 1489.62]  Okay.
[1489.84 --> 1491.00]  Excited for next year's CES.
[1491.34 --> 1492.78]  Definitely excited for next year's CES.
[1492.86 --> 1494.14]  Because I actually know what's going on now.
[1494.26 --> 1494.92]  I'm like I get it.
[1494.98 --> 1495.88]  I get how crazy it is.
[1495.88 --> 1498.62]  Because I started here last August.
[1498.68 --> 1499.50]  So August 2015.
[1500.40 --> 1500.78]  And the whole.
[1500.88 --> 1502.40]  Like from the day I started it was like.
[1502.64 --> 1503.80]  You ready for CES man?
[1504.14 --> 1505.66]  You hear the stories of CES?
[1505.76 --> 1506.58]  What happens to CES?
[1506.66 --> 1507.26]  Crazy man.
[1507.54 --> 1508.20]  Do lots of stuff.
[1508.28 --> 1508.76]  I'm like okay.
[1508.88 --> 1509.46]  Like I get it.
[1509.52 --> 1510.74]  Like let's calm down.
[1510.94 --> 1511.70]  And then it actually happens.
[1511.76 --> 1512.06]  I'm like wow.
[1512.12 --> 1512.86]  I was pretty busy.
[1513.44 --> 1513.84]  Pretty busy.
[1513.94 --> 1515.12]  You don't get to sleep much.
[1515.68 --> 1515.88]  Yeah.
[1516.50 --> 1516.82]  Yeah.
[1516.92 --> 1517.12]  Wow.
[1517.16 --> 1517.66]  It was pretty busy.
[1518.12 --> 1518.28]  Yeah.
[1518.34 --> 1518.44]  No.
[1518.50 --> 1519.20]  Looking forward to that.
[1519.20 --> 1519.64]  Yeah.
[1520.84 --> 1521.16]  Yeah.
[1521.26 --> 1522.58]  And another cool thing about this year too.
[1522.68 --> 1523.16]  Is just like.
[1524.06 --> 1524.38]  Expanding.
[1524.54 --> 1525.24]  Getting more people.
[1525.32 --> 1526.58]  There's 15 people that work here now.
[1527.18 --> 1528.74]  Do you know how many we had last year?
[1529.42 --> 1530.24]  I'm number 10.
[1531.14 --> 1531.86]  I'm number 10.
[1531.90 --> 1532.40]  Number 10.
[1532.66 --> 1533.18]  Double digits.
[1533.74 --> 1536.14]  And were you the newest person at CES?
[1536.70 --> 1537.66]  Or was that John?
[1537.76 --> 1538.44]  At CES?
[1538.50 --> 1538.68]  Yes.
[1538.72 --> 1539.20]  That would have been me.
[1539.32 --> 1539.44]  Yeah.
[1539.44 --> 1541.86]  John got hired two months before I did.
[1541.94 --> 1542.56]  Three months maybe.
[1543.00 --> 1544.60]  So we have 50% more people now.
[1546.14 --> 1546.82]  Pretty much.
[1546.90 --> 1548.22]  When did Dennis get hired?
[1548.22 --> 1549.54]  Was Dennis before John?
[1550.52 --> 1550.98]  Oh gosh.
[1551.04 --> 1551.86]  Dennis was well before John.
[1551.86 --> 1552.54]  You guys are going to know that.
[1552.60 --> 1552.76]  Oh.
[1552.88 --> 1553.02]  Okay.
[1553.72 --> 1553.92]  Yeah.
[1554.00 --> 1554.32]  Then yeah.
[1554.42 --> 1557.58]  Then pretty much we've doubled in size in like a year and a half.
[1558.30 --> 1559.00]  That's pretty crazy.
[1559.12 --> 1559.86]  That is pretty crazy.
[1560.02 --> 1560.18]  Yeah.
[1560.40 --> 1562.10]  But it's cool getting to work with different people.
[1562.18 --> 1564.16]  And everybody here has like different personalities and stuff.
[1564.20 --> 1565.68]  So it's really cool to see.
[1566.34 --> 1567.10]  As a stop.
[1567.10 --> 1568.08]  You can't stop.
[1568.34 --> 1568.64]  Yes.
[1569.70 --> 1570.54]  We're not going to have this now.
[1570.54 --> 1571.18]  But I'll have it later.
[1571.18 --> 1571.44]  Do you just have pockets?
[1571.44 --> 1573.46]  There's like a box or bucket of them or something.
[1573.76 --> 1573.94]  Okay.
[1574.54 --> 1574.74]  Yeah.
[1575.28 --> 1575.52]  Cool.
[1575.52 --> 1576.92]  I was just trying to teach me fetch.
[1578.22 --> 1580.40]  Oh my gosh.
[1580.40 --> 1580.42]  Oh my gosh.
[1581.98 --> 1582.46]  Wow.
[1583.58 --> 1583.86]  Woo.
[1584.44 --> 1584.84]  Woo.
[1585.00 --> 1585.48]  Racey.
[1585.76 --> 1586.24]  Um.
[1586.68 --> 1586.86]  Yeah.
[1587.16 --> 1587.48]  Anyways.
[1587.68 --> 1587.84]  Yeah.
[1588.16 --> 1588.48]  There you go.
[1588.62 --> 1588.84]  Dope.
[1589.10 --> 1590.62]  Are we going to do another topic for the transition?
[1590.72 --> 1591.24]  You want to grab Nick?
[1591.44 --> 1591.56]  Yeah.
[1591.56 --> 1592.38]  Is there anything else you want to say?
[1593.00 --> 1593.20]  No.
[1593.56 --> 1593.74]  No?
[1593.82 --> 1593.98]  Yeah.
[1594.04 --> 1594.14]  Cool.
[1594.14 --> 1594.68]  Good stuff.
[1594.82 --> 1595.16]  All right.
[1595.32 --> 1596.18]  See you guys later.
[1596.88 --> 1597.16]  Bye.
[1597.54 --> 1597.80]  All right.
[1599.08 --> 1600.10]  Send me back to the dock.
[1600.10 --> 1602.48]  Okay.
[1602.60 --> 1605.96]  So the Nintendo Switch's CPU, GPU clock speeds were revealed.
[1606.86 --> 1607.18]  Uh.
[1607.18 --> 1608.94]  You can check that out on Eurogamer.
[1609.82 --> 1613.22]  I'm going to post a link to that in the description here.
[1614.34 --> 1614.62]  Uh.
[1614.68 --> 1615.36]  Buh-ba-dump-bump.
[1615.36 --> 1623.50]  So this like in my opinion is probably the least important thing about the Nintendo Switch.
[1623.70 --> 1625.00]  That might sound weird.
[1625.76 --> 1627.68]  That could totally sound weird.
[1627.98 --> 1628.94]  And I get that.
[1629.44 --> 1629.88]  Um.
[1629.88 --> 1631.20]  But at the same time.
[1632.80 --> 1643.04]  It's not like Nintendo consoles for a long time have exactly been on like the forefront of performance technology.
[1643.04 --> 1647.72]  I am a self-proclaimed Nintendo fanboy.
[1648.22 --> 1650.76]  And I'm excited for this thing regardless.
[1651.02 --> 1652.92]  Because I want to play the games that are on it.
[1653.00 --> 1654.44]  I'm interested in the games that are on it.
[1654.44 --> 1655.40]  I'm.
[1656.72 --> 1661.88]  I will go for amazing, beautiful, detailed cinematic experiences on my PC.
[1662.58 --> 1666.58]  I will go for playing Zelda because hell yeah on my console.
[1666.86 --> 1667.92]  That's how that's going to work.
[1668.44 --> 1668.62]  Uh.
[1668.62 --> 1671.84]  One interesting thing is that there's different performance specs for it.
[1671.84 --> 1675.06]  When it's docked versus undocked.
[1676.24 --> 1676.68]  Um.
[1676.72 --> 1678.68]  So it's memory bandwidth is 200 and.
[1678.76 --> 1678.90]  Uh.
[1678.92 --> 1679.10]  Sorry.
[1679.30 --> 1681.34]  25.6 gigabytes per second.
[1681.66 --> 1684.52]  It's VRAM is shared through the GPU and the CPU.
[1685.08 --> 1685.48]  Uh.
[1685.48 --> 1689.30]  It has 256 CUDA cores at a maximum of 1 gigahertz.
[1689.80 --> 1690.08]  Um.
[1690.08 --> 1692.34]  And I actually can't find in this specific picture.
[1692.34 --> 1696.20]  But it has a pretty drastically different performance.
[1696.92 --> 1698.48]  Depending on whether it's plugged into a TV.
[1699.00 --> 1702.14]  Or it is taken remotely with you.
[1702.28 --> 1705.08]  If you remember you can put the controllers on the side of the switch.
[1705.46 --> 1708.12]  And take it as if it is a mobile gaming device.
[1708.12 --> 1711.52]  The mic is fine.
[1712.02 --> 1712.42]  Um.
[1712.46 --> 1712.76]  Thank you.
[1713.32 --> 1713.60]  Yes.
[1714.14 --> 1714.66]  Oh god.
[1719.18 --> 1719.58]  Hi.
[1720.12 --> 1721.64]  I'm going to take this off of your face.
[1721.92 --> 1722.80]  Oh that was my bad.
[1725.68 --> 1727.40]  Thanks for your candy contribution, Sedsl.
[1728.40 --> 1728.94]  Oh nice.
[1729.26 --> 1730.28]  I was talking about the Nintendo Switch.
[1730.66 --> 1731.02]  How are you?
[1731.56 --> 1732.16]  Oh you know.
[1732.34 --> 1733.00]  How's today going?
[1733.70 --> 1734.22]  It's a day.
[1734.22 --> 1735.08]  Is it stressful?
[1735.34 --> 1736.12]  Is it good?
[1736.22 --> 1736.66]  Is it chill?
[1736.88 --> 1737.46]  It's a day.
[1737.66 --> 1738.16]  It's a day.
[1738.66 --> 1739.34]  It's a day.
[1739.66 --> 1740.44]  How did the year go?
[1741.34 --> 1741.98]  It was a year.
[1742.06 --> 1742.46]  It was a year.
[1742.76 --> 1742.94]  Yeah.
[1743.28 --> 1743.54]  Yeah.
[1743.74 --> 1744.22]  It was chill.
[1744.46 --> 1744.64]  Yeah.
[1745.18 --> 1745.88]  It wasn't that chill.
[1746.26 --> 1746.54]  No?
[1747.36 --> 1748.08]  Pretty stressful year?
[1749.60 --> 1750.20]  I mean.
[1750.92 --> 1752.16]  People don't seem to realize like.
[1752.78 --> 1754.86]  It's actually like insane working here.
[1755.06 --> 1755.26]  Yeah.
[1755.66 --> 1756.00]  Like.
[1756.80 --> 1757.54]  We don't sleep.
[1758.74 --> 1759.68]  I always like.
[1759.70 --> 1760.56]  Just like work all the time.
[1760.62 --> 1762.18]  I never bother like fully dive into it.
[1762.22 --> 1762.58]  And people are like.
[1762.58 --> 1764.10]  Oh man I'd love to work at Linus Media Group.
[1764.10 --> 1764.48]  If I'm like.
[1764.78 --> 1765.32]  It's amazing.
[1765.52 --> 1766.54]  I absolutely love this job.
[1766.96 --> 1769.02]  You're basically sacrificing everything else in your life.
[1769.52 --> 1770.08]  It's amazing.
[1770.22 --> 1770.54]  It's great.
[1770.74 --> 1771.26]  Don't do it.
[1772.36 --> 1773.32]  This is now you.
[1773.48 --> 1774.70]  You are Linus Media Group now.
[1774.98 --> 1775.60]  Welcome to the.
[1775.66 --> 1776.32]  Welcome to the.
[1776.38 --> 1777.56]  People are saying I'm just.
[1777.64 --> 1779.10]  I'm stoned AF dude.
[1779.22 --> 1779.94]  He's not stoned.
[1780.58 --> 1781.50]  I mean maybe I am.
[1782.62 --> 1783.82]  It's legal in Washington.
[1784.24 --> 1784.36]  No.
[1784.54 --> 1785.46]  We're not in Washington.
[1785.60 --> 1786.10]  That's true.
[1788.50 --> 1789.46]  Well it's going alright though.
[1789.52 --> 1789.74]  You know.
[1789.86 --> 1790.94]  It's 2016 man.
[1791.24 --> 1792.48]  It's kind of a crappy year in a lot of ways.
[1792.74 --> 1792.76]  But.
[1792.82 --> 1793.14]  Yes.
[1793.14 --> 1794.46]  Work wise it's fine.
[1794.78 --> 1796.10]  The queen's going to make it apparently.
[1796.30 --> 1796.92]  Do you hear about that?
[1797.08 --> 1797.42]  The queen?
[1797.58 --> 1797.84]  Yeah.
[1798.00 --> 1798.98]  The queen was sick.
[1799.66 --> 1800.08]  Was she?
[1800.08 --> 1800.72]  But she's good now.
[1801.32 --> 1801.60]  Oh.
[1802.24 --> 1803.02]  Seemingly good now.
[1803.02 --> 1806.44]  Well I'm very glad that our figurehead is okay.
[1808.60 --> 1808.96]  Yeah.
[1809.64 --> 1810.70]  Best thing that happened this year.
[1812.02 --> 1812.50]  Um.
[1815.94 --> 1816.30]  Yeah.
[1816.34 --> 1816.78]  I'm selfish.
[1817.34 --> 1818.36]  I got a razor blade.
[1818.88 --> 1819.76]  That was the highlight.
[1822.18 --> 1822.98]  Just like.
[1823.38 --> 1823.78]  For real.
[1824.06 --> 1824.44]  There you go.
[1824.52 --> 1826.16]  We have a video on that if you haven't seen it.
[1826.50 --> 1827.36]  Do you know the title?
[1827.36 --> 1828.36]  Uh.
[1829.20 --> 1829.64]  It's like.
[1829.78 --> 1830.04]  Christmas.
[1830.04 --> 1830.08]  Christmas.
[1830.08 --> 1832.46]  $25,000 Christmas prank or something like that.
[1832.56 --> 1832.78]  Some.
[1833.02 --> 1833.60]  I don't know.
[1833.82 --> 1834.14]  Gone.
[1834.48 --> 1834.80]  Sexual.
[1834.88 --> 1835.10]  Gone.
[1835.16 --> 1835.44]  Sexual.
[1835.72 --> 1836.02]  Gone.
[1837.30 --> 1837.46]  Yeah.
[1837.48 --> 1837.78]  Preferably.
[1838.42 --> 1838.64]  That.
[1838.74 --> 1839.86]  I mean that would probably get more clicks.
[1840.36 --> 1840.62]  True.
[1841.22 --> 1841.46]  True.
[1841.68 --> 1842.06]  Uh.
[1842.06 --> 1843.98]  My favorite title we've done in a while was.
[1844.16 --> 1844.48]  Was.
[1844.90 --> 1845.50]  My suggestion.
[1845.62 --> 1846.38]  Which I don't do enough.
[1846.44 --> 1846.78]  I'm sorry.
[1847.04 --> 1847.34]  That's fine.
[1847.34 --> 1847.70]  Um.
[1847.78 --> 1848.42]  But the.
[1848.42 --> 1848.74]  The.
[1849.02 --> 1849.92]  USB killer thing.
[1851.64 --> 1854.06]  I changed it because you want it to be computer murder.
[1854.42 --> 1854.88]  And I was like.
[1855.04 --> 1856.08]  That's pretty dark.
[1856.26 --> 1856.42]  Oh.
[1856.78 --> 1857.42]  What is it now?
[1857.46 --> 1859.06]  I think it's like computer destruction.
[1859.06 --> 1859.38]  Destruction.
[1859.52 --> 1860.66]  Gone deadly or something.
[1860.68 --> 1860.92]  Yeah.
[1860.92 --> 1861.72]  That's probably a.
[1861.96 --> 1862.82]  Probably a better.
[1862.86 --> 1863.44]  It was like.
[1863.62 --> 1870.02]  It was going to be so dark because the original plan was to have like a gun shooting the USB drive for the thumbnail.
[1870.16 --> 1871.20]  And then it was computer murder.
[1871.38 --> 1871.64]  Wow.
[1871.64 --> 1872.08]  It was like.
[1872.70 --> 1873.36]  It was dang.
[1873.48 --> 1874.54]  That was a little aggressive.
[1874.82 --> 1875.26]  LTT.
[1875.72 --> 1876.56]  Gone dark.
[1876.88 --> 1877.28]  Ugh.
[1878.40 --> 1878.88]  2016.
[1879.48 --> 1879.82]  Rare.
[1881.16 --> 1882.08]  Oh jeez.
[1882.84 --> 1883.24]  Uh.
[1883.46 --> 1885.12]  I love it when they put rare in the title.
[1885.36 --> 1885.88]  Rare.
[1886.62 --> 1887.06]  2016.
[1887.52 --> 1887.76]  What?
[1888.18 --> 1890.54]  It's a rare unlimited view video.
[1891.38 --> 1892.26]  Sure dog.
[1892.96 --> 1893.26]  Alright.
[1893.62 --> 1894.58]  Next year do they change.
[1894.88 --> 1895.26]  YouTube pranks.
[1895.46 --> 1897.10]  Like do they go like fine and replace.
[1897.60 --> 1898.36]  And do 2017.
[1899.64 --> 1900.52]  Oh man.
[1900.78 --> 1901.40]  That would be funny.
[1901.40 --> 1902.16]  That would be funny.
[1902.24 --> 1902.36]  Yeah.
[1902.44 --> 1903.12]  Super edge.
[1903.24 --> 1903.60]  Edgy.
[1903.90 --> 1905.02]  Worst thing this year.
[1905.52 --> 1906.42]  Worst thing this year.
[1906.64 --> 1907.72]  Like work related.
[1908.04 --> 1910.34]  I know your laptop was work related but yeah.
[1913.84 --> 1914.28]  Um.
[1914.28 --> 1917.90]  I don't even know.
[1918.90 --> 1924.22]  This is I think it's good that this is everyone's hardest question to answer so far.
[1924.62 --> 1924.96]  Yeah.
[1924.96 --> 1928.54]  Well for me it's also hard because there's so much stuff where I'm like NDA.
[1929.18 --> 1929.38]  Yeah.
[1929.50 --> 1930.46]  Can't talk about that.
[1930.62 --> 1930.72]  Yeah.
[1931.00 --> 1931.40]  Contract.
[1931.70 --> 1932.60]  Can't talk about that.
[1932.82 --> 1932.98]  Yeah.
[1933.52 --> 1934.20]  It's just like.
[1934.20 --> 1936.80]  But overall like.
[1937.54 --> 1938.78]  It's been a good year.
[1940.46 --> 1941.28]  I'm just tired.
[1941.42 --> 1942.24]  I'm super tired.
[1942.32 --> 1942.70]  I hear that.
[1943.04 --> 1943.14]  Yeah.
[1943.76 --> 1944.04]  Yeah.
[1944.04 --> 1945.24]  But uh.
[1945.24 --> 1947.18]  Worst thing to happen in 2016.
[1948.38 --> 1949.60]  Had to be.
[1952.72 --> 1954.68]  I guess it wasn't like that bad.
[1954.80 --> 1955.50]  But just like.
[1956.16 --> 1958.52]  Biggest disappointment of 2016 is like.
[1958.52 --> 1960.16]  All of the series that like.
[1960.44 --> 1961.50]  Didn't work out as.
[1961.70 --> 1961.90]  Yeah.
[1962.50 --> 1965.48]  And that was kind of like what we knew was going to happen going in.
[1965.54 --> 1967.04]  Because this was pretty much like.
[1967.58 --> 1969.72]  The year of pilots for Linus Tech Tips.
[1969.90 --> 1970.04]  Yeah.
[1970.08 --> 1971.40]  And I kept telling people that because they'd be like.
[1971.70 --> 1973.02]  Why are you starting all these new series?
[1973.20 --> 1973.90]  This is stupid.
[1974.06 --> 1976.02]  I don't want a new series every single day.
[1976.16 --> 1976.82]  This is stupid.
[1976.96 --> 1977.58]  Why are you doing this?
[1977.62 --> 1977.88]  It's like.
[1978.08 --> 1979.32]  So we figure out what works.
[1979.92 --> 1980.12]  Yeah.
[1980.24 --> 1981.26]  Like that's how you figure it out.
[1981.34 --> 1981.90]  You do it.
[1982.14 --> 1982.44]  That's true.
[1982.56 --> 1983.40]  So um.
[1983.40 --> 1985.22]  This was very much like the year of the pilot.
[1985.30 --> 1987.32]  And there were some concepts that I really liked that didn't work out.
[1987.32 --> 1989.14]  Like Tech Showdown is one where it was like.
[1989.84 --> 1990.36]  It was good.
[1990.56 --> 1991.76]  First couple ones were fun.
[1991.86 --> 1993.28]  And then just people don't seem to care.
[1993.46 --> 1993.70]  I don't.
[1993.78 --> 1994.10]  That's.
[1994.20 --> 1995.38]  That's actually been really.
[1997.02 --> 1997.92]  Confusing for me.
[1998.10 --> 1999.14]  Because I feel like.
[2000.88 --> 2002.74]  Like what I hear from the audience.
[2002.74 --> 2005.54]  That is the most in tune with what people like.
[2006.24 --> 2007.80]  Seem to ask for.
[2008.32 --> 2009.12]  It's just not the right.
[2009.22 --> 2010.04]  But then no one.
[2010.04 --> 2010.36]  Vehicle.
[2010.66 --> 2011.82]  Actually cares.
[2012.66 --> 2013.06]  Um.
[2013.10 --> 2013.44]  Which is.
[2013.64 --> 2014.16]  That's fine.
[2014.16 --> 2017.76]  It's one of my favorite things to do.
[2018.44 --> 2020.24]  Maybe if it was Tech Showdown gone sexual.
[2020.70 --> 2020.98]  Let's see.
[2021.06 --> 2021.40]  That would make.
[2021.54 --> 2022.28]  People would like it.
[2022.48 --> 2023.34]  Rare 2017.
[2023.94 --> 2024.12]  I think.
[2024.24 --> 2026.72]  I think Tech Showdown as a name is pretty garbage.
[2027.54 --> 2027.94]  Um.
[2028.22 --> 2029.42]  I liked the original.
[2030.62 --> 2031.86]  Not saying it name.
[2032.10 --> 2033.30]  That is way too close.
[2033.30 --> 2033.58]  Can we say it?
[2033.82 --> 2034.12]  Maybe.
[2035.32 --> 2035.76]  So okay.
[2035.76 --> 2036.72]  The internal name was.
[2037.44 --> 2038.02]  Iron Tech.
[2038.08 --> 2038.26]  Yeah.
[2038.42 --> 2038.98]  Iron Tech.
[2038.98 --> 2040.78]  Because it was supposed to be like Iron Chef.
[2040.98 --> 2041.42]  But with tech.
[2041.42 --> 2045.56]  The original concept for Tech Showdown was that Linus and I would be standing there.
[2045.66 --> 2047.40]  Or whoever the competitors were would be standing there.
[2047.70 --> 2049.74]  And then everything that you had to build with.
[2050.00 --> 2051.38]  Was going to be on a table under a cloth.
[2051.62 --> 2052.84]  Just like Iron Chef.
[2053.30 --> 2054.54]  And then whoever the host was.
[2054.60 --> 2056.16]  Was going to whip the cloth off.
[2056.82 --> 2057.22]  And.
[2057.64 --> 2057.96]  Uh.
[2058.88 --> 2060.26]  All of their stuff.
[2060.60 --> 2062.58]  That they were able to use for the build was going to be there.
[2062.82 --> 2064.04]  And you had to like run up and.
[2064.42 --> 2066.14]  Grab your computer case and all the hardware.
[2066.26 --> 2066.94]  And run that back.
[2067.00 --> 2069.48]  And then run all the modding stuff that you want back to your table.
[2069.48 --> 2071.50]  And like try to figure out your mod on the spot.
[2071.62 --> 2072.80]  And it turned into.
[2073.58 --> 2075.10]  Something that I think was still really cool.
[2075.18 --> 2075.86]  But it was different.
[2076.24 --> 2076.64]  Uh.
[2076.64 --> 2078.60]  Where you would go pre-shopping.
[2078.74 --> 2081.14]  And you'd go to the store and buy everything for the mod that you wanted.
[2081.50 --> 2083.36]  And then it was just a start time.
[2083.44 --> 2084.50]  And a fixed amount of time.
[2084.86 --> 2085.86]  People are saying that.
[2086.18 --> 2088.56]  Well some people are saying that Iron Tech is a way cooler name.
[2088.92 --> 2089.60]  I agree.
[2089.84 --> 2090.12]  It is.
[2090.12 --> 2091.30]  I also don't want to get sued.
[2091.54 --> 2091.78]  Yeah.
[2091.82 --> 2093.10]  It's way too close to Iron Chef.
[2093.48 --> 2093.80]  Sorry.
[2094.48 --> 2094.76]  Like.
[2096.52 --> 2096.92]  Yeah.
[2097.08 --> 2097.62]  That's like.
[2098.34 --> 2098.56]  Oh.
[2098.56 --> 2099.06]  That's half the battle of stuff like this.
[2099.06 --> 2101.34]  One that people are saying is Scrapyard Wars.
[2101.44 --> 2102.74]  Which is very close to Junkyard Wars.
[2105.14 --> 2105.92]  I guess.
[2107.26 --> 2108.08]  But like.
[2109.42 --> 2110.10]  I don't know.
[2111.12 --> 2111.98]  I feel like.
[2112.50 --> 2113.74]  Iron X.
[2114.00 --> 2114.72]  Is so.
[2115.50 --> 2116.72]  Like there's only one.
[2116.94 --> 2118.00]  Iron X.
[2118.62 --> 2119.10]  Whereas like.
[2119.10 --> 2119.44]  That's a.
[2119.68 --> 2120.64]  Other than Iron Man.
[2121.92 --> 2122.92]  That's totally different.
[2123.04 --> 2123.22]  Yeah.
[2124.16 --> 2125.14]  And we would be like.
[2125.32 --> 2126.90]  One of the things about Scrapyard Wars.
[2126.90 --> 2127.82]  Is it's actually like.
[2128.08 --> 2129.12]  Genuinely quite a bit different.
[2129.20 --> 2129.84]  Copper Tech.
[2130.10 --> 2130.74]  Than Junkyard Wars.
[2131.52 --> 2132.16]  Copper Tech.
[2134.70 --> 2135.58]  I like that.
[2136.30 --> 2136.74]  Um.
[2136.96 --> 2138.30]  Iron Ingot Tech.
[2138.52 --> 2139.00]  Where like.
[2139.20 --> 2139.54]  Iron.
[2139.80 --> 2140.66]  Iron Tech.
[2140.76 --> 2141.86]  Was named Iron Tech.
[2141.92 --> 2142.60]  Very specifically.
[2142.76 --> 2143.54]  Because it was essentially.
[2143.78 --> 2145.06]  Exactly Iron Chef.
[2145.50 --> 2145.80]  Yeah.
[2146.30 --> 2147.08]  But with technology.
[2147.08 --> 2147.40]  Scrapyard Wars.
[2147.40 --> 2149.02]  Is not exactly Junkyard Wars.
[2149.02 --> 2149.24]  No.
[2149.30 --> 2150.16]  It's quite different.
[2150.56 --> 2150.84]  Yeah.
[2150.84 --> 2154.34]  We need season four.
[2154.56 --> 2154.70]  Dude.
[2154.76 --> 2155.74]  I think there's season four.
[2155.86 --> 2156.74]  On YouTube already bro.
[2157.00 --> 2157.94]  You should probably go watch it.
[2158.24 --> 2158.46]  Yeah.
[2158.64 --> 2159.04]  Anyways.
[2159.12 --> 2160.38]  That concept didn't really work out.
[2160.62 --> 2161.04]  Which sucks.
[2161.14 --> 2161.50]  Because yeah.
[2161.56 --> 2162.80]  I really like the Tech Showdown.
[2164.80 --> 2165.92]  This one will last it.
[2167.64 --> 2168.86]  Someone said Aluminum Tech.
[2168.94 --> 2170.32]  That's the name of a dude on the forum.
[2170.46 --> 2170.94]  Tin Tech.
[2171.02 --> 2172.08]  We probably shouldn't do that.
[2172.26 --> 2173.58]  Silicon Showdown.
[2174.74 --> 2175.70]  That sounds like.
[2176.24 --> 2176.60]  Yeah.
[2176.80 --> 2177.84]  A modeling contest.
[2177.84 --> 2179.24]  It should be Silicon Showdown.
[2179.46 --> 2180.20]  Silicon Showdown.
[2180.20 --> 2180.38]  Yeah.
[2180.38 --> 2181.76]  They said Silicon Showdown.
[2181.90 --> 2182.10]  Yeah.
[2182.20 --> 2182.54]  Maybe.
[2182.68 --> 2182.88]  Maybe.
[2182.94 --> 2183.12]  Maybe.
[2183.12 --> 2184.04]  Maybe we don't do that.
[2184.66 --> 2185.42]  Might be a good idea.
[2185.44 --> 2187.18]  The one and only Iron Man says.
[2187.36 --> 2187.58]  Hi.
[2187.64 --> 2188.50]  I love your shows.
[2188.72 --> 2189.18]  Oh wow.
[2189.82 --> 2190.14]  Wow.
[2190.72 --> 2191.02]  I'm.
[2191.12 --> 2191.74]  I'm very.
[2191.96 --> 2192.60]  The timing on that.
[2192.92 --> 2194.32]  I am very flattered.
[2194.80 --> 2195.08]  Yeah.
[2195.24 --> 2195.56]  Me too.
[2195.70 --> 2196.50]  You could come by.
[2196.52 --> 2196.98]  What's his name?
[2197.04 --> 2197.54]  Tony Stark.
[2197.64 --> 2198.14]  Tony Stark.
[2198.24 --> 2198.38]  Yeah.
[2198.48 --> 2199.20]  I'm very flattered.
[2199.30 --> 2200.00]  If you want to come by.
[2200.02 --> 2200.86]  Robert Downey Jr.
[2201.12 --> 2203.12]  Show us how to build better computers than we have.
[2203.30 --> 2204.02]  That would be wonderful.
[2204.60 --> 2205.40]  We need Jake back.
[2205.50 --> 2206.02]  Jake went home.
[2206.08 --> 2206.78]  He has school tomorrow.
[2207.62 --> 2209.82]  If you could teach someone how to make Jarvis.
[2209.82 --> 2211.36]  So we could all have voice control systems.
[2211.36 --> 2213.18]  That were anywhere close to that good.
[2213.34 --> 2214.24]  That would be wonderful.
[2215.40 --> 2216.50]  Let's see if it even works.
[2216.86 --> 2217.40]  Let's see.
[2217.64 --> 2218.26]  Let's see.
[2219.06 --> 2219.78]  Okay Google.
[2220.74 --> 2221.56]  Oh my god.
[2221.58 --> 2221.96]  It worked.
[2222.04 --> 2223.22]  That's actually very surprising.
[2223.34 --> 2225.02]  I've been having so many problems with those lately.
[2227.70 --> 2228.10]  Anyways.
[2228.30 --> 2228.86]  Any other comments?
[2228.86 --> 2233.32]  I don't know.
[2234.64 --> 2235.46]  I'm just like.
[2235.92 --> 2236.96]  It's been a year man.
[2237.12 --> 2237.68]  It's been a year.
[2238.08 --> 2238.56]  It has.
[2238.70 --> 2240.02]  It has by definition.
[2240.14 --> 2240.64]  I was saying.
[2241.20 --> 2242.64]  On the 360p version.
[2243.28 --> 2243.62]  Rare.
[2244.00 --> 2244.44]  2016.
[2244.78 --> 2245.26]  Gone sexual.
[2245.26 --> 2245.98]  That is a rare.
[2246.24 --> 2246.90]  That is rare.
[2247.06 --> 2248.00]  That is a rare cut.
[2248.06 --> 2249.94]  Because that's only going to be available through the Twitch archives.
[2250.10 --> 2250.24]  Yeah.
[2250.24 --> 2256.00]  But on the rare 2016 360p version.
[2257.02 --> 2257.98]  I was saying.
[2260.32 --> 2261.64]  I totally lost my train of thought.
[2262.12 --> 2263.74]  What you were saying on the 2016.
[2264.54 --> 2264.94]  Sorry.
[2265.14 --> 2267.44]  What you were saying on the 360p version of the show.
[2267.82 --> 2268.06]  Yeah.
[2268.20 --> 2269.08]  Do you remember what you said back then?
[2269.20 --> 2269.40]  No.
[2269.66 --> 2270.46]  It's been too long.
[2270.88 --> 2271.70]  It's too rare.
[2272.32 --> 2273.00]  His brain was like.
[2273.00 --> 2273.34]  I can't do this.
[2273.34 --> 2273.98]  I was talking about this year.
[2275.14 --> 2275.50]  And.
[2276.04 --> 2276.86]  Thanks for the help.
[2277.00 --> 2277.12]  Cool.
[2277.20 --> 2277.48]  Thanks.
[2277.48 --> 2277.54]  Thanks.
[2277.54 --> 2281.62]  You're the worst.
[2281.64 --> 2282.66]  Literally what the entire show is.
[2282.74 --> 2283.08]  We're talking about this year.
[2283.08 --> 2283.36]  Oh yeah.
[2283.50 --> 2285.18]  What I was saying was that I hate Colton.
[2285.50 --> 2285.98]  Oh dang.
[2288.20 --> 2290.10]  He's just crying on the stairs.
[2291.02 --> 2291.74]  Stoned AF.
[2292.40 --> 2292.66]  Yeah.
[2292.96 --> 2293.18]  Yeah.
[2294.26 --> 2295.50]  Definitely blitzed.
[2296.36 --> 2296.60]  Dude.
[2296.78 --> 2298.24]  Have you never been tired.
[2298.90 --> 2299.62]  From working.
[2300.04 --> 2300.34]  Like.
[2301.56 --> 2302.76]  60 plus hour weeks.
[2303.70 --> 2305.14]  Have you never done that bro?
[2305.44 --> 2306.98]  Have you never done that?
[2306.98 --> 2308.26]  I also didn't have coffee today.
[2308.32 --> 2308.86]  So that didn't help.
[2310.04 --> 2310.66]  But anyway.
[2310.86 --> 2311.72]  Do you want me to go get Taron?
[2312.50 --> 2313.08]  Is he available?
[2313.56 --> 2313.88]  Santiago.
[2315.02 --> 2315.28]  Oh.
[2315.38 --> 2315.76]  That'd be cool.
[2315.86 --> 2316.44]  He needs to be.
[2316.80 --> 2317.48]  He needs to be.
[2317.60 --> 2318.38]  Is he coming on the show?
[2318.78 --> 2319.72]  Oh my goodness.
[2320.22 --> 2321.06]  Intermission topic.
[2321.60 --> 2322.04]  Oh.
[2322.32 --> 2322.72]  KFC.
[2324.20 --> 2324.60]  What?
[2324.92 --> 2329.14]  KFC's latest weird text suggests an order based on your face.
[2333.24 --> 2333.64]  Really?
[2333.64 --> 2337.26]  Wow.
[2337.36 --> 2338.54]  Don't swear Taron.
[2340.26 --> 2340.82]  God.
[2343.16 --> 2346.24]  Everyone left because they all have families to go to.
[2346.30 --> 2348.04]  What do you think about this Taron?
[2348.04 --> 2351.36]  KFC's latest weird text suggests an order based on your face.
[2352.70 --> 2355.00]  What do you think they would order for you Luke?
[2356.90 --> 2357.98]  Why do we have to bring it there?
[2360.46 --> 2361.00]  I mean.
[2361.14 --> 2361.46]  You know.
[2361.56 --> 2361.84]  I just.
[2362.22 --> 2364.58]  What do you think the tech is like Luke?
[2365.74 --> 2367.90]  How much chicken would they want you to.
[2367.90 --> 2368.46]  Anyways.
[2368.70 --> 2372.00]  It'll look at the customer's age, gender, and facial expressions.
[2372.46 --> 2375.68]  To make educated guesses as to what they might be in the mood for.
[2378.10 --> 2378.30]  I.
[2378.52 --> 2379.18]  You know.
[2380.18 --> 2384.36]  I also hazard a guess that they would order more chicken for me than they would for Taron.
[2384.36 --> 2390.20]  That's where I think Taron was trying to go when he said it to me because he's a dick.
[2390.70 --> 2390.96]  Yeah.
[2391.22 --> 2391.58]  Yeah.
[2391.96 --> 2392.78]  I mean like what?
[2392.90 --> 2395.48]  Does more smiling equal more vegetables?
[2395.94 --> 2396.76]  That's what I was kind of wondering.
[2396.96 --> 2398.78]  Does KFC have vegetables?
[2399.78 --> 2400.22]  Age.
[2400.22 --> 2400.70]  One second.
[2400.88 --> 2401.30]  Maybe.
[2401.48 --> 2404.14]  Like if you're a little kid maybe you want like a kid's meal thing.
[2404.14 --> 2404.88]  Comment from the peanut gallery here.
[2404.92 --> 2406.30]  Why aren't you on the WAN show?
[2406.40 --> 2406.74]  He was.
[2406.74 --> 2408.48]  Mr. Talking all the time.
[2408.70 --> 2408.80]  Oh.
[2409.52 --> 2409.84]  Santiago.
[2410.10 --> 2410.34]  All right.
[2410.50 --> 2411.18]  Get out of here then.
[2411.58 --> 2411.92]  Bye.
[2411.92 --> 2417.44]  Okay Taron what's the what's the your best thing that's happened this year that has to
[2417.44 --> 2418.10]  do with Lines Media Group?
[2418.16 --> 2418.54]  Oh no.
[2418.64 --> 2421.82]  See this is why I didn't want to be here because I can't think of anything.
[2422.18 --> 2423.24]  I don't know.
[2423.28 --> 2424.92]  You started reviewing bikes this year didn't you?
[2425.04 --> 2425.62]  Yeah I did.
[2425.82 --> 2427.16]  Is that the best thing that happened to do with Lines Media Group this year?
[2427.16 --> 2429.88]  I don't know if it's the best thing but I'm really stoked about it.
[2430.84 --> 2432.20]  What else are you really stoked about?
[2432.44 --> 2434.86]  Because um hey I was not done with the bikes yet.
[2434.86 --> 2440.24]  Because I like bikes and I like e-bikes and um I like bikes.
[2441.92 --> 2450.40]  So that was nice.
[2450.50 --> 2451.26]  What else did we do?
[2451.32 --> 2452.46]  What did we do this year?
[2453.02 --> 2455.66]  I mean we finished the warehouse?
[2456.20 --> 2460.40]  Uh I don't know if that's ever like a thing.
[2460.50 --> 2461.96]  The B-roll set's still not technically done.
[2461.96 --> 2465.20]  Yeah yeah it's it's there's been a lot more work done on it lately.
[2465.20 --> 2465.56]  Yeah.
[2465.56 --> 2470.58]  Uh Brian the guy building it has come in uh every night for the past like week to finish
[2470.58 --> 2471.36]  it up and so it's looking better and better.
[2471.36 --> 2472.36]  Hold up hold that thought.
[2472.48 --> 2473.16]  Hold that thought.
[2473.72 --> 2476.94]  The audio went away and I think it's going to be back now.
[2477.02 --> 2477.46]  We're back.
[2477.56 --> 2478.56]  Okay say that again.
[2478.72 --> 2479.54]  It's going to be finished soon.
[2479.60 --> 2481.86]  Do we have waveforms that you can see?
[2481.92 --> 2482.44]  We do not.
[2482.48 --> 2483.42]  That would be really convenient.
[2483.42 --> 2486.20]  It would be but we don't have a mixer that can do that.
[2487.20 --> 2489.34]  Maybe we should upgrade that mixer.
[2490.48 --> 2490.80]  At home.
[2491.02 --> 2491.42]  Anyways.
[2491.92 --> 2492.16]  Yes.
[2492.16 --> 2492.50]  B-roll set.
[2492.64 --> 2493.18]  B-roll set.
[2493.52 --> 2496.58]  Uh yeah I was I was saying uh we're getting a new B-roll set.
[2496.74 --> 2500.02]  The guy building it has come in every night for the past week or so.
[2500.42 --> 2501.16]  Finishing it up.
[2501.26 --> 2502.22]  He's really cool.
[2502.32 --> 2504.38]  He's got a tree house that's way nicer than mine.
[2504.60 --> 2506.22]  So he clearly knows what he's doing.
[2507.06 --> 2510.08]  Um and so we'll have we'll have more B-roll abilities.
[2510.48 --> 2514.72]  And we're also going to build the mezzanine so we can get all these uh all this crap off
[2514.72 --> 2518.90]  off the ground and put it up into the mezzanine and then we'll have more room for more filming
[2518.90 --> 2519.70]  of more stuff.
[2520.02 --> 2520.42]  That'll be good.
[2520.78 --> 2523.30]  Yeah uh we added a lot of employees this year.
[2523.48 --> 2528.38]  We we grew uh we added 50 percent more than we had before.
[2529.00 --> 2529.54]  Of employees.
[2529.54 --> 2533.16]  We are 150 percent of the size that we were in 2015.
[2533.16 --> 2533.90]  Yeah yeah.
[2533.90 --> 2536.24]  And somehow we're still just as busy.
[2536.72 --> 2536.88]  Yep.
[2537.02 --> 2538.24]  The work never stops.
[2538.42 --> 2539.84]  Like maybe even busier.
[2540.40 --> 2541.20]  Potentially yes.
[2541.20 --> 2541.48]  Maybe.
[2541.86 --> 2543.48]  It's it's borderline.
[2543.68 --> 2547.94]  The thing is it's always like 100 percent capacity so there's it's hard to like tell if
[2547.94 --> 2548.18]  it's.
[2549.16 --> 2550.22]  Yeah exactly.
[2550.56 --> 2555.22]  Um and we had we had gotten ahead on the on the videos for a while for for about a month
[2555.22 --> 2555.68]  or two.
[2556.14 --> 2560.56]  We were really ahead on on writing and then and then it it all went to hell because
[2560.56 --> 2561.40]  it's quarter four.
[2561.78 --> 2561.84]  Yeah.
[2561.84 --> 2564.00]  Quarter four is always.
[2564.34 --> 2564.96]  Just terrible.
[2565.30 --> 2567.26]  It's it's it's a mess.
[2567.48 --> 2567.66]  Yeah.
[2567.78 --> 2568.30]  It's a mess.
[2568.30 --> 2571.04]  And then it ends with CES which fortunately.
[2571.36 --> 2571.98]  The king of the mess.
[2572.20 --> 2575.86]  Well yes and no because all the content is like right there.
[2576.02 --> 2576.22]  Okay.
[2576.30 --> 2578.02]  You just go out and go get something.
[2578.36 --> 2578.44]  Yeah.
[2578.54 --> 2580.82]  Of course it's a lot of work but at least.
[2581.02 --> 2582.02]  You're gonna have videos.
[2582.22 --> 2582.54]  Yes.
[2582.54 --> 2586.34]  And also there's lots of parties which I enjoy every year.
[2586.42 --> 2586.80]  I don't.
[2586.88 --> 2587.64]  Very greatly.
[2588.12 --> 2589.16]  Luke doesn't drink at all.
[2589.46 --> 2589.68]  No.
[2589.88 --> 2591.90]  Which is a shame if you're in Vegas.
[2592.40 --> 2592.64]  Yeah.
[2593.52 --> 2596.54]  Or maybe the opposite of a shame when you're in Vegas.
[2596.54 --> 2603.26]  I have found one single because okay I don't I don't not drink because of like some holier
[2603.26 --> 2604.14]  than now thing.
[2604.26 --> 2605.76]  I do it because I literally just don't like it.
[2606.02 --> 2612.12]  I have found one alcoholic beverage that I can drink without absolutely hating the taste.
[2612.20 --> 2612.74]  Let me guess.
[2612.92 --> 2614.60]  I still don't like the experience but the taste.
[2614.60 --> 2616.68]  Is it um is it um.
[2616.84 --> 2617.82]  You're probably not gonna guess.
[2617.94 --> 2618.18]  Yeah.
[2618.36 --> 2620.26]  What's that creamy stuff?
[2620.40 --> 2620.80]  Bailey's?
[2620.84 --> 2621.02]  Nope.
[2621.20 --> 2621.94]  Bailey's is good.
[2622.06 --> 2622.68]  I hate it.
[2622.90 --> 2623.08]  Really?
[2623.10 --> 2625.12]  If I can taste the alcohol at all.
[2625.24 --> 2626.94]  But that's the point of Bailey's.
[2628.32 --> 2628.76]  Fireball.
[2629.20 --> 2629.38]  What?
[2630.32 --> 2632.10]  That sounds like you'd be able to taste the alcohol.
[2632.38 --> 2633.76]  The cinnamon is so strong.
[2633.80 --> 2634.20]  Wow.
[2635.12 --> 2636.34]  That I can't taste the alcohol.
[2636.88 --> 2640.60]  And it burns the whole way down and then it burns in your stomach but I don't taste the alcohol.
[2640.62 --> 2641.34]  That sounds horrible.
[2641.46 --> 2643.12]  It's still better than everything else.
[2643.36 --> 2643.68]  Anyways.
[2643.68 --> 2645.78]  What is the worst thing this year?
[2646.04 --> 2646.32]  Oh.
[2646.66 --> 2648.28]  Worst thing this year.
[2648.60 --> 2649.58]  Let me see here.
[2649.64 --> 2649.88]  Hang on.
[2650.00 --> 2650.40]  I want to.
[2650.48 --> 2650.62]  Oh.
[2650.74 --> 2652.52]  This is a different chair from what I'm used to.
[2652.56 --> 2653.90]  I don't know what to do with it.
[2654.10 --> 2654.38]  Adobe?
[2654.62 --> 2654.86]  Worst thing.
[2655.82 --> 2656.26]  Ah.
[2656.42 --> 2657.14]  You know what?
[2657.28 --> 2658.80]  I mean as long as I like to.
[2658.84 --> 2660.46]  As much as I like to harp on Adobe.
[2660.58 --> 2665.64]  They have at least been making gradual improvements to their software.
[2665.74 --> 2666.84]  Much slower than I like.
[2667.00 --> 2667.88]  But no.
[2667.92 --> 2668.46]  It's not worse.
[2668.50 --> 2670.54]  Actually the software is slowly getting better.
[2671.30 --> 2672.60]  The worst thing.
[2672.60 --> 2674.16]  The worst thing.
[2674.72 --> 2675.38]  Let's see.
[2677.06 --> 2677.50]  Ah.
[2677.56 --> 2678.00]  None of my.
[2678.04 --> 2679.36]  All of my videos were great.
[2679.46 --> 2680.42]  So there's that.
[2681.42 --> 2682.02]  Um.
[2682.68 --> 2686.34]  I didn't get horribly injured doing anything.
[2686.60 --> 2687.66]  So there's that.
[2687.66 --> 2690.60]  The worst thing.
[2690.70 --> 2691.72]  It snowed a bunch.
[2691.78 --> 2693.06]  But nobody was killed.
[2693.90 --> 2694.50]  That we know.
[2694.62 --> 2695.82]  That we know.
[2696.82 --> 2697.22]  Um.
[2697.74 --> 2700.12]  And we might get a white Christmas here in Vancouver.
[2700.28 --> 2700.58]  Yeah.
[2700.64 --> 2701.44]  It's going to be close.
[2702.48 --> 2702.80]  Yeah.
[2702.80 --> 2708.54]  A lot of people were thinking that it had held up and we weren't absolutely going to get a white Christmas and then it snowed last night.
[2708.68 --> 2708.82]  Yeah.
[2708.82 --> 2710.42]  And just for context.
[2710.42 --> 2711.38]  It's very rare.
[2711.38 --> 2711.74]  Sorry.
[2711.94 --> 2716.84]  For there to be snow in BC in this area at all.
[2716.84 --> 2717.18]  Yes.
[2717.48 --> 2718.48]  Just for whatever reason.
[2718.56 --> 2720.88]  We would usually get like maybe one day of snow a year.
[2721.06 --> 2721.24]  Yeah.
[2721.64 --> 2723.04]  It would just be slush and it would be terrible.
[2724.00 --> 2725.68]  What bad things have happened?
[2725.86 --> 2726.54]  I don't know.
[2726.64 --> 2727.54]  I mean it's been.
[2728.12 --> 2729.02]  It's been good.
[2729.08 --> 2731.62]  I had to pay a lot of money to fix my car up the other day.
[2732.20 --> 2733.78]  That's not Lattice Media Group related.
[2734.10 --> 2734.34]  No.
[2734.72 --> 2735.72]  Among other things.
[2735.72 --> 2736.30]  Go ahead though.
[2736.30 --> 2737.12]  You don't have anything else.
[2737.12 --> 2740.78]  Some rodents had found their way into my air intake.
[2741.68 --> 2744.64]  And burrowed in the air filter and they had a little nest in there.
[2744.74 --> 2745.26]  Oh wow.
[2745.42 --> 2748.86]  Because apparently when it gets so cold this is a common occurrence.
[2749.34 --> 2751.86]  Of animals just like oh I gotta go shelter somewhere.
[2751.86 --> 2753.38]  There's a warm car.
[2753.96 --> 2756.54]  And so they'll hang out in their car.
[2756.96 --> 2759.82]  So check under the hood ladies and gentlemen.
[2760.00 --> 2763.74]  You might find some uninvited guests in your car this winter season.
[2764.54 --> 2766.94]  And maybe park in the garage if you have one.
[2767.84 --> 2768.88]  Which I don't.
[2769.26 --> 2769.56]  Okay.
[2770.06 --> 2771.40]  Is there anything else you want to add?
[2771.88 --> 2772.20]  No.
[2772.32 --> 2772.44]  No.
[2772.54 --> 2774.56]  I have literally no ideas.
[2775.36 --> 2776.20]  I mean tech.
[2776.48 --> 2777.76]  Are we all out of tech stuff?
[2777.96 --> 2780.66]  We can keep talking about tech news if you want to hang out for a little while.
[2780.92 --> 2781.14]  Yeah.
[2781.14 --> 2782.46]  What is the WAN show done?
[2782.50 --> 2783.16]  Are we done here?
[2783.26 --> 2783.86]  What's going on?
[2783.86 --> 2784.18]  Is there anyone else?
[2784.48 --> 2786.00]  Linus or Brandon are you available?
[2788.70 --> 2789.44]  They sound.
[2789.52 --> 2790.52]  That sounds like a no.
[2791.04 --> 2791.82]  I think that's a no.
[2791.82 --> 2792.50]  Sounds like a no.
[2793.90 --> 2794.72]  I still haven't gotten to one.
[2794.72 --> 2796.50]  We have to do ad spots at some point.
[2796.56 --> 2798.14]  I can do that just to buy time.
[2798.22 --> 2799.00]  You don't have to worry about anything.
[2799.18 --> 2799.96]  Buy time.
[2800.08 --> 2800.88]  Oh dang.
[2801.02 --> 2801.42]  Get it?
[2801.72 --> 2802.76]  Speaking of which.
[2803.34 --> 2804.44]  We both have beards.
[2804.78 --> 2805.78]  Dollar Shave Club.
[2805.78 --> 2808.02]  If you're not a member of Dollar Shave Club.
[2808.14 --> 2809.28]  I need to join the thing.
[2810.40 --> 2811.64]  You're not a member of Dollar Shave.
[2811.70 --> 2811.90]  Okay.
[2812.14 --> 2812.74]  But to be fair.
[2812.76 --> 2813.54]  Do you have a neck beard?
[2814.02 --> 2814.38]  Yeah.
[2814.44 --> 2815.20]  Well a little bit.
[2815.32 --> 2816.58]  And do you have to shave this?
[2816.64 --> 2817.48]  All the time bro.
[2817.48 --> 2817.50]  Yeah.
[2817.50 --> 2818.24]  See then there we go.
[2818.30 --> 2818.98]  We still shave.
[2819.06 --> 2819.48]  How about you?
[2819.54 --> 2820.04]  Do you shave?
[2820.20 --> 2820.88]  Colton's on the show.
[2820.88 --> 2821.00]  Oh yeah.
[2821.42 --> 2821.98]  See okay.
[2822.10 --> 2823.36]  So every single one of us has a beard.
[2823.52 --> 2823.92]  So this isn't.
[2824.84 --> 2825.90]  But we all shave this part.
[2826.18 --> 2826.36]  Yeah.
[2826.50 --> 2826.92]  There we go.
[2826.92 --> 2829.38]  If you're not a member of Dollar Shave Club yet.

[2850.72 --> 2851.96]  You can also use Dr. Cover's Shave Butter.
[2851.96 --> 2853.44]  Which goes on like clear and stuff.
[2853.56 --> 2855.14]  So you can like see where you're shaving.
[2855.14 --> 2857.80]  Which can be beneficial unless you're like me.
[2857.90 --> 2859.10]  And you just shave in the shower.
[2859.20 --> 2860.10]  And don't look at what you're doing.
[2860.24 --> 2860.90]  I tried it.
[2860.94 --> 2862.26]  I didn't understand how it worked.
[2862.38 --> 2864.14]  But then I didn't really read instructions.
[2865.76 --> 2865.92]  Dr. Carver?
[2866.02 --> 2866.26]  Yeah.
[2866.48 --> 2867.56]  You don't have to read the instructions.
[2867.66 --> 2869.44]  I'm just used to the normal stuff.
[2870.30 --> 2870.66]  But just.
[2870.86 --> 2872.16]  You just put it on your face and you shave.
[2872.24 --> 2872.62]  No I know.
[2872.76 --> 2873.02]  It's just.
[2873.16 --> 2873.42]  Yeah.
[2873.80 --> 2874.06]  I know.
[2874.22 --> 2874.56]  I'm just.
[2874.78 --> 2875.00]  You know.
[2875.46 --> 2877.08]  I was in a rush that day.
[2877.62 --> 2879.52]  I had to shave to get on the set.
[2880.12 --> 2880.64]  We have.
[2880.64 --> 2881.16]  To be clear.
[2881.28 --> 2883.26]  The bathroom cabinets over there.
[2883.44 --> 2883.62]  Yes.
[2883.62 --> 2884.68]  It's totally full of.
[2884.68 --> 2886.50]  Of Dollar Shave Club stuff.
[2886.60 --> 2886.94]  I did that.
[2886.94 --> 2888.26]  Makes the bathroom smell delicious.
[2888.46 --> 2888.66]  Yeah.
[2889.12 --> 2889.32]  Delicious.
[2889.32 --> 2890.88]  And it's like oh look at all this stuff in here.
[2890.94 --> 2891.84]  You can fix up my hair.
[2891.84 --> 2893.00]  Use Doctor Shave Club stuff.
[2893.10 --> 2894.28]  You will smell delicious.
[2894.68 --> 2894.96]  Duh.
[2895.24 --> 2896.06]  It's great.
[2896.26 --> 2896.56]  Anyways.
[2896.64 --> 2897.10]  I'm going to say delicious.
[2898.38 --> 2900.80]  It can ship to the US, Canada and Australia.
[2900.98 --> 2902.78]  So head over to DollarShaveClub.com slash Linus.
[2903.22 --> 2904.84]  And give it a try for free.
[2906.12 --> 2906.50]  For free.
[2906.72 --> 2907.50]  How much for free?
[2907.64 --> 2908.14]  For a week?
[2908.50 --> 2908.94]  For a month?
[2909.08 --> 2909.56]  I said that at the beginning.
[2909.56 --> 2910.72]  I wasn't paying any attention.
[2910.96 --> 2912.16]  Like right at the beginning of the ad spot.
[2912.16 --> 2912.84]  Right at the beginning.
[2913.94 --> 2914.86]  Are they coming?
[2914.96 --> 2915.06]  No?
[2915.86 --> 2916.44]  They're both out?
[2917.92 --> 2918.24]  No.
[2918.32 --> 2918.40]  No.
[2918.40 --> 2918.78]  It's cool.
[2918.90 --> 2919.42]  I'll stay here.
[2919.54 --> 2919.96]  It's fine.
[2920.62 --> 2921.62]  Let's see what else we got.
[2921.72 --> 2922.42]  We don't have a ton of stuff.
[2922.48 --> 2923.08]  Do you have an iPhone?
[2923.24 --> 2923.74]  Android, right?
[2923.90 --> 2925.40]  I'm all Android all the time.
[2925.40 --> 2927.86]  So Super Mario Run breaks a record.
[2927.98 --> 2930.72]  Gets 40 million downloads in four days.
[2931.12 --> 2931.82]  Which is like.
[2931.86 --> 2932.50]  What is it?
[2932.68 --> 2933.66]  Pretty crazy.
[2933.78 --> 2934.52]  More Super Mario?
[2934.52 --> 2935.90]  It's a Super Mario game.
[2936.02 --> 2938.72]  Let me see if I can like ninja screen grab this.
[2938.86 --> 2940.96]  Because we don't have like laptops set up.
[2941.14 --> 2942.22]  Because whatever.
[2942.48 --> 2942.96]  Oh wow.
[2943.04 --> 2943.80]  That's an awkward.
[2943.98 --> 2944.24]  Okay.
[2944.30 --> 2944.80]  That'll work.
[2945.12 --> 2946.46]  What if I do this?
[2946.62 --> 2946.80]  No.
[2946.94 --> 2947.80]  It's working.
[2951.80 --> 2953.14]  You're making us disappear.
[2953.42 --> 2953.84]  Sort of.
[2954.62 --> 2954.84]  Okay.
[2954.84 --> 2955.18]  So.
[2955.50 --> 2955.92]  Anyways.
[2957.10 --> 2957.54]  Yeah.
[2957.62 --> 2959.20]  So Super Mario Run breaks record.
[2959.28 --> 2962.16]  Gets 40 million downloads in four days.
[2962.16 --> 2962.82]  Which is pretty.
[2963.00 --> 2963.60]  Four days.
[2963.68 --> 2964.26]  Pretty insane.
[2964.38 --> 2965.92]  But it's only on iOS.
[2966.10 --> 2966.64]  Only on iOS.
[2967.86 --> 2970.00]  Super Mario Run's $10 asking price.
[2970.30 --> 2970.54]  Huh.
[2970.54 --> 2972.06]  The internet connectivity requirement.
[2972.26 --> 2972.88]  Various issues.
[2973.06 --> 2973.50]  Blah blah blah blah blah.
[2973.78 --> 2974.22]  Anyways.
[2974.40 --> 2976.96]  What do you think about Nintendo games?
[2977.30 --> 2979.08]  On Apple products.
[2980.40 --> 2982.44]  On mobile devices.
[2982.54 --> 2983.18]  That's on a phone.
[2983.34 --> 2983.60]  Yeah.
[2983.60 --> 2985.68]  That is on a phone.
[2985.84 --> 2986.14]  Yes.
[2986.32 --> 2986.86]  Well I.
[2986.86 --> 2993.20]  I've never liked the fact that for a touch screen you don't have buttons that you can have
[2993.20 --> 2996.96]  your fingers on to know where they are before you press them.
[2997.46 --> 3000.86]  And on a phone you have to keep your hands completely off the screen.
[3000.92 --> 3002.44]  Otherwise you're going to screw something up.
[3002.52 --> 3002.70]  Yeah.
[3002.94 --> 3003.18]  Right.
[3003.18 --> 3004.18]  There's this disconnect.
[3004.98 --> 3008.14]  There's this like oh I don't really know if I'm pressing the button.
[3008.24 --> 3009.24]  There's no tactile feedback.
[3009.92 --> 3010.86]  And so on and so forth.
[3011.10 --> 3012.04]  So you don't prefer the experience.
[3012.04 --> 3012.50]  I don't.
[3012.54 --> 3013.22]  I don't like that.
[3013.50 --> 3016.92]  So if you play games on a phone you kind of need an extra controller.
[3017.30 --> 3017.48]  Yeah.
[3017.78 --> 3018.02]  Right.
[3018.06 --> 3020.32]  And I bought one for my brother and he's like oh this is great.
[3020.56 --> 3021.86]  And it's just you know it's just buttons.
[3022.04 --> 3022.96]  It pairs with Bluetooth.
[3023.40 --> 3025.30]  If you have that then by all means go for it.
[3025.44 --> 3025.78]  There you go.
[3025.78 --> 3028.68]  And also it's going to cover up what you're trying to look at in the first place.
[3028.68 --> 3028.92]  Yeah.
[3029.10 --> 3029.46]  Probably.
[3029.74 --> 3034.54]  To be clear about what I said earlier the $10 asking price is to unlock all of the content.
[3035.18 --> 3036.48]  It is technically a free app.
[3036.52 --> 3037.34]  You can download the app.
[3037.42 --> 3042.10]  It is number one in the like free app category for like 140 countries.
[3042.60 --> 3050.78]  And it is number one in the top grossing app in a whole bunch of different countries as well.
[3051.68 --> 3055.46]  So it seems to be going splendidly for that.
[3055.46 --> 3056.72]  It's going to play with the free version.
[3057.02 --> 3057.94]  Absolutely wonderfully.
[3058.26 --> 3061.58]  I don't know but I know there's content that's behind a paywall.
[3062.06 --> 3063.96]  Well we have iPhone devices here.
[3064.04 --> 3066.50]  I would suggest we download it and just have some fun.
[3066.88 --> 3067.52]  Not right now.
[3067.56 --> 3068.06]  Not right now.
[3068.30 --> 3069.92]  But you know I want to see.
[3070.40 --> 3072.80]  It feels weird because I play all the Mario games.
[3072.92 --> 3073.08]  Yeah.
[3073.36 --> 3074.30]  But I don't have an iOS device.
[3074.30 --> 3075.90]  So Pokemon Go.
[3076.22 --> 3079.02]  This is a thing that's not on the thing for today.
[3079.54 --> 3079.78]  Yeah.
[3079.78 --> 3082.90]  But they had an update recently-ish.
[3083.32 --> 3085.32]  I know this is a weekly news show and this was a while ago.
[3085.46 --> 3088.52]  But they've been losing players a lot.
[3089.02 --> 3093.58]  I uninstalled it because I kept trying to find some redeeming feature and couldn't.
[3095.22 --> 3099.48]  So I think they had some special stuff for Halloween and maybe for Christmas as well.
[3100.18 --> 3101.26]  But who cares?
[3101.44 --> 3101.98]  I don't.
[3101.98 --> 3104.26]  Sorry.
[3104.76 --> 3106.28]  Anybody who likes Pokemon Go.
[3106.86 --> 3111.76]  I know it because my brother's really into it and he's caught like Christmas Pikachus and
[3111.76 --> 3114.30]  Christmas Raichus and stuff that have Santa hats on like me.
[3114.30 --> 3115.42]  So I'm a Christmas Luke.
[3115.84 --> 3118.36]  If you catch me I'm only a seasonal thing.
[3119.22 --> 3121.54]  Well but then you'll have the Christmas Luke forever.
[3121.66 --> 3122.00]  Yes.
[3122.08 --> 3122.24]  Right.
[3122.30 --> 3123.72]  But you have to get him this year.
[3123.82 --> 3124.02]  Yeah.
[3124.02 --> 3126.68]  Well next year it might be a slightly different model.
[3126.78 --> 3126.86]  Yeah.
[3127.00 --> 3127.28]  That's right.
[3127.30 --> 3128.08]  He'll look a little different.
[3128.12 --> 3128.62]  A little different.
[3128.84 --> 3129.02]  Yeah.
[3129.48 --> 3130.38]  Hopefully a little thinner.
[3130.56 --> 3132.86]  So there's that.
[3133.18 --> 3133.48]  Yes.
[3134.30 --> 3134.70]  Yes.
[3135.24 --> 3138.16]  Oh have you made any New Year's resolutions?
[3139.16 --> 3139.46]  New Luke?
[3139.46 --> 3142.22]  Well most of my like physical stuff is based around fixing my knee.
[3142.72 --> 3143.02]  Yeah.
[3143.24 --> 3145.36]  I have to fix both of my knees.
[3145.58 --> 3145.76]  Yeah.
[3145.76 --> 3149.30]  They're less badly damaged than Luke's knee probably.
[3149.76 --> 3149.98]  Maybe.
[3150.04 --> 3151.16]  Both of mine are a little bit.
[3151.32 --> 3154.70]  I bet you want my right one is probably on the same level of yours.
[3154.86 --> 3156.18]  My left one is very bad.
[3158.66 --> 3159.98]  We're getting old Luke.
[3160.16 --> 3160.52]  Yeah.
[3160.94 --> 3161.38]  We are.
[3161.84 --> 3163.70]  We were young whippersnappers.
[3163.70 --> 3167.24]  So having the e-bike has like been wonderful.
[3167.40 --> 3167.80]  Very helpful.
[3167.80 --> 3171.62]  Because my knees on a normal bike it's like it's hurting.
[3172.00 --> 3172.20]  Okay.
[3172.72 --> 3173.54]  So it's great.
[3174.14 --> 3174.64]  Car.
[3175.02 --> 3175.42]  Yeah I do.
[3175.76 --> 3177.24]  So if your knees are screwed up.
[3178.18 --> 3179.54]  I was driving the car.
[3179.78 --> 3180.02]  Okay.
[3180.02 --> 3182.20]  Because I couldn't bike anymore.
[3182.36 --> 3182.50]  Okay.
[3182.64 --> 3184.78]  I did that for a month and I was like I don't like driving.
[3185.06 --> 3188.86]  And I finally got one of the e-bikes and I was like yes back on the bike.
[3189.42 --> 3191.12]  So is the car going to be off the road?
[3191.48 --> 3191.84]  Are you still paying back?
[3191.84 --> 3192.24]  My car?
[3192.40 --> 3192.58]  Yeah.
[3193.02 --> 3193.52]  What do you mean?
[3193.82 --> 3194.40]  No I got it fixed.
[3194.40 --> 3194.80]  Because the e-bikes?
[3195.18 --> 3195.42]  Oh.
[3195.66 --> 3195.90]  What?
[3197.04 --> 3199.08]  I was wondering you have the e-bikes now.
[3199.24 --> 3200.98]  Are you interested in taking the car off the road?
[3201.44 --> 3203.26]  Oh you mean not paying for it at all anymore?
[3203.62 --> 3204.76]  Probably not.
[3204.76 --> 3205.76]  It's too convenient.
[3206.04 --> 3208.74]  I like to visit my family who lives on the island.
[3208.80 --> 3209.10]  Yeah.
[3209.10 --> 3210.12]  It's a big long drive.
[3210.16 --> 3210.76]  Having a car for that is very helpful.
[3210.76 --> 3215.36]  My brother is like downtown Burnaby-ish.
[3215.96 --> 3216.36]  So um.
[3216.72 --> 3217.86]  Having a car to get there would be helpful.
[3217.98 --> 3218.38]  Exactly.
[3218.66 --> 3218.78]  Yeah.
[3218.78 --> 3219.16]  It would be pretty brutal for that.
[3219.16 --> 3222.60]  The Sky Train doesn't go all the way here.
[3223.68 --> 3225.14]  Which would be convenient if it did.
[3225.28 --> 3226.68]  I think there's like plans for that.
[3226.88 --> 3227.04]  But yeah.
[3227.08 --> 3227.46]  Yeah maybe.
[3227.62 --> 3229.58]  But you got to take like a bus that goes straight there.
[3229.66 --> 3230.80]  But it still is a long ride.
[3231.44 --> 3231.68]  Yes.
[3231.68 --> 3232.24]  Yeah.
[3232.32 --> 3234.40]  No I'm going to have a car probably pretty much forever.
[3234.54 --> 3235.42]  I just barely drive it.
[3235.56 --> 3236.72]  I just use it when I need it.
[3236.94 --> 3237.46]  So that's great.
[3237.58 --> 3237.90]  There you go.
[3237.96 --> 3238.46]  That's a good way.
[3238.46 --> 3240.90]  And my insurance is very low because I haven't had an accident in nine years.
[3241.02 --> 3242.86]  Because I haven't been driving for nine years.
[3242.86 --> 3243.08]  Ah.
[3245.48 --> 3246.18]  That's funny.
[3246.78 --> 3248.00]  That's actually pretty good.
[3249.88 --> 3253.20]  I'm in the same spot but I've actually been driving for the majority of that.
[3253.20 --> 3255.70]  But it's still not that low because we live in BC.
[3256.54 --> 3258.10]  Insurance here is just expensive.
[3258.44 --> 3258.50]  Yeah.
[3258.56 --> 3259.52]  It's just a fact of life.
[3259.52 --> 3260.52]  It's monopoly-tastic.
[3261.14 --> 3261.54]  Uh.
[3262.08 --> 3266.84]  Panasonic has developed a new IPS panel to rival OLED apparently.
[3267.20 --> 3272.08]  The new type of panel is an IPS LED that has one million to one contrast ratio but like.
[3273.38 --> 3274.12]  Like what?
[3274.18 --> 3275.12]  What does that mean you mean?
[3275.24 --> 3275.58]  Yeah.
[3275.90 --> 3276.92]  Well it means something.
[3277.02 --> 3277.60]  Those are numbers.
[3277.60 --> 3281.64]  But it's relative to how you do the tests and stuff.
[3281.64 --> 3283.44]  Like it's a little screwy.
[3283.64 --> 3283.74]  Okay.
[3283.94 --> 3287.00]  Do we not have like a better measurement for that?
[3287.10 --> 3288.30]  I don't believe so.
[3288.40 --> 3293.80]  Because like the greatest contrast ratio I think is still CRT.
[3294.42 --> 3295.06]  Isn't it?
[3296.16 --> 3296.84]  Let's see.
[3297.32 --> 3299.28]  Because when it's off, it's off.
[3299.56 --> 3301.90]  It's not getting hit by any of those little electrons.
[3301.90 --> 3307.82]  Although I remember on my CRT TV of childhood that I had.
[3307.82 --> 3308.66]  Uh.
[3308.94 --> 3311.84]  That you turn the TV on and of course it makes a pssss noise.
[3312.06 --> 3314.04]  And I think it becomes brighter.
[3314.48 --> 3315.56]  Even if it's on black.
[3316.32 --> 3317.10]  So I could be wrong.
[3317.18 --> 3320.26]  But maybe modern CRTs are actually more hardcore.
[3320.54 --> 3322.94]  And it's the least display lag.
[3323.38 --> 3324.52]  I think even lower than.
[3325.36 --> 3328.36]  I think some of what you're saying might be a little wonko.
[3328.58 --> 3329.62]  But the display lag thing.
[3329.72 --> 3329.90]  Yeah.
[3330.08 --> 3330.30]  Yeah.
[3330.34 --> 3331.16]  They're really good for that.
[3331.30 --> 3331.48]  Yeah.
[3331.48 --> 3332.20]  So lag.
[3332.36 --> 3333.90]  I don't know about contrast ratio.
[3334.28 --> 3334.72]  Necessarily.
[3334.74 --> 3334.76]  Sorry.
[3334.76 --> 3335.40]  I've been reading this.
[3335.48 --> 3336.16]  I haven't been fully listening.
[3336.16 --> 3336.38]  Yeah.
[3337.42 --> 3341.22]  It's speculated that these IPS panels may appear at CES 2017.
[3341.66 --> 3343.08]  So pay attention to that.
[3343.18 --> 3345.52]  We'll probably have something going on there.
[3345.84 --> 3346.02]  Hmm.
[3346.60 --> 3349.42]  And let's see here.
[3349.62 --> 3352.44]  G-Skill has new Trident Z RGB memory kits.
[3353.10 --> 3354.56]  That are like really fast and stuff.
[3354.72 --> 3356.74]  DDR4, 4266 MHz.
[3357.02 --> 3357.80]  So that's pretty cool.
[3358.04 --> 3358.60]  Uh-huh.
[3358.88 --> 3360.26]  Going up to how many gigabytes?
[3360.26 --> 3362.96]  One of the notes is that it requires no additional power connections.
[3363.26 --> 3369.00]  I'm very happy that the RAM doesn't require individual additional power.
[3369.32 --> 3369.76]  That's...
[3369.76 --> 3371.86]  Like one of the...
[3371.86 --> 3372.54]  Like...
[3372.54 --> 3373.42]  The big...
[3373.42 --> 3374.62]  Can you imagine?
[3374.80 --> 3375.38]  Oh, man.
[3375.42 --> 3380.12]  I mean, that's up there with water-cooled RAM, you know, in terms of ridiculousness.
[3380.80 --> 3381.32]  Ridiculous.
[3381.80 --> 3382.14]  Okay.
[3382.30 --> 3383.92]  So South Carolina...
[3383.92 --> 3384.42]  What?
[3384.52 --> 3384.88]  Carolina.
[3385.64 --> 3386.10]  Oh, yeah.
[3386.20 --> 3387.82]  I remember hearing about this.
[3388.36 --> 3388.78]  Oh, my.
[3388.88 --> 3389.32]  That picture.
[3389.32 --> 3389.76]  Mm-hmm.
[3389.76 --> 3390.76]  Uh...
[3390.76 --> 3391.08]  Hmm.
[3391.28 --> 3391.56]  Okay.
[3391.74 --> 3392.92]  Can we not show that?
[3392.98 --> 3393.56]  Is it too...
[3393.56 --> 3394.20]  I think we can.
[3394.22 --> 3394.86]  Is it too racy?
[3395.00 --> 3395.70]  It's borderline.
[3395.82 --> 3397.84]  It's just a guy's bare chest.
[3398.00 --> 3399.16]  You know, it's...
[3399.16 --> 3399.64]  We're not...
[3399.64 --> 3399.76]  It's...
[3399.76 --> 3401.56]  Maybe some of you are into that.
[3401.68 --> 3402.26]  Let's find out.
[3402.26 --> 3403.38]  It's a tiny amount of a guy's bare chest.
[3403.38 --> 3404.08]  Let's find out right now.
[3404.08 --> 3406.28]  It's mainly that girl's backside, but...
[3406.28 --> 3407.38]  Oh, I thought that was...
[3407.38 --> 3410.16]  Oh, I'm not understanding what's going on there.
[3410.78 --> 3411.18]  Wow.
[3411.18 --> 3413.50]  I did not look at that very clearly.
[3413.50 --> 3414.50]  Clearly.
[3414.50 --> 3415.50]  Clearly.
[3415.50 --> 3416.50]  ...
[3416.50 --> 3417.50]  Yeah.
[3417.50 --> 3418.50]  So there's a...
[3418.50 --> 3425.50]  South Carolina wants to install anti-porno chips in PCs that cost $20 to disable.
[3425.50 --> 3427.94]  I think I heard it was a rootkit.
[3427.94 --> 3429.94]  Um...
[3429.94 --> 3431.84]  There was some discussion on Reddit about this.
[3431.84 --> 3432.50]  This is hilarious.
[3432.78 --> 3432.98]  Yeah.
[3433.84 --> 3435.00]  Oh, my goodness.
[3435.00 --> 3440.34]  Oh, this is written in a very funny way, too.
[3440.50 --> 3440.74]  Hmm.
[3441.12 --> 3446.26]  So, like, I guess it's just, like, putting a text on computers?
[3446.96 --> 3448.52]  Does that include phones?
[3449.00 --> 3449.32]  Hmm.
[3449.54 --> 3451.54]  This is very odd.
[3451.90 --> 3452.12]  Hmm.
[3452.12 --> 3452.24]  Hmm.
[3452.86 --> 3457.68]  Well, the problem is lawmakers not really understanding the law...
[3457.68 --> 3460.40]  The things that they're trying to make laws about.
[3460.80 --> 3461.22]  Yeah.
[3461.22 --> 3467.12]  And the analogy that I like to use here is, imagine if movies weren't as popular as they are,
[3467.64 --> 3474.62]  and lawmakers didn't understand them, and they thought that it was racist to cast various people in various roles.
[3474.62 --> 3479.36]  Because you can be racist when you're casting a movie if you want a movie full of black people, right?
[3479.52 --> 3481.38]  Because that's the movie, right?
[3482.94 --> 3487.72]  So imagine if there was a law saying you can't do that, you can't discriminate based on skin color for a movie.
[3487.72 --> 3491.44]  When, in fact, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do for a movie.
[3491.84 --> 3494.72]  So for porn, we have...
[3495.44 --> 3496.14]  We have...
[3496.14 --> 3497.70]  Why is Luke putting his head in his hands?
[3499.66 --> 3503.00]  It's another situation where the lawmakers just don't understand what's going on.
[3504.28 --> 3504.68]  What?
[3504.80 --> 3505.92]  Have I said something?
[3506.14 --> 3506.68]  I just...
[3506.68 --> 3508.86]  Topics I don't want to talk about on Land Show.
[3509.36 --> 3511.30]  Just because, like, someone's going to freak out somewhere.
[3511.90 --> 3512.08]  Yeah.
[3512.50 --> 3513.90]  We should be less political.
[3513.90 --> 3519.36]  I was expecting you to go into, like, you should be able to gender discriminate in porn.
[3519.58 --> 3520.52]  I thought that's where you were going to be.
[3520.52 --> 3521.34]  Well, there's that too.
[3522.06 --> 3523.62]  Because, like, it might be determined to be seen.
[3523.62 --> 3524.26]  But that...
[3524.26 --> 3529.04]  Yes, but that doesn't have anything to do with this news story.
[3530.30 --> 3531.46]  As far as I'm aware.
[3531.62 --> 3532.02]  Anyways.
[3532.76 --> 3536.62]  My point is, laws can be very stupid, but we already all knew that.
[3537.12 --> 3537.60]  Didn't we?
[3538.10 --> 3538.44]  Yeah.
[3538.44 --> 3542.44]  Desktop Macs are in the worst.
[3542.44 --> 3543.88]  Okay, here's a cool one.
[3543.96 --> 3545.30]  This will be our last topic of the day.
[3545.64 --> 3548.66]  Tim Cook has said that great desktop Macs are in the worst.
[3548.84 --> 3550.60]  That's actually good.
[3552.22 --> 3553.34]  Some people might be like,
[3553.46 --> 3554.32]  Oh my God!
[3554.58 --> 3555.82]  But it's Linus Tech Tips!
[3556.10 --> 3557.58]  Don't we hate Apple products?
[3558.08 --> 3559.16]  One, we don't.
[3559.20 --> 3560.42]  We don't hate Apple products.
[3560.54 --> 3562.92]  We just usually prefer PC products.
[3563.04 --> 3563.26]  Yeah.
[3563.58 --> 3564.96]  Possibly 100% of the time.
[3565.10 --> 3565.62]  But who knows?
[3566.02 --> 3566.26]  Usually.
[3566.26 --> 3569.38]  I've seen some cool things on Mac.
[3569.76 --> 3571.04]  Mac and tablet washes.
[3571.42 --> 3574.46]  And having good competition, even if you don't like it.
[3574.86 --> 3576.36]  I have no problem with Mac.
[3576.48 --> 3580.18]  But having good competition, even if you don't like it, is a good thing.
[3580.32 --> 3580.64]  Yes.
[3581.36 --> 3582.28]  So, yeah.
[3582.44 --> 3586.40]  Which is why I'm stoked about the Studio Surface Pro.
[3587.24 --> 3588.00]  Or, not Pro.
[3588.50 --> 3590.18]  Microsoft Surface Studio.
[3590.26 --> 3590.64]  There you go.
[3590.70 --> 3591.34]  Without the Pro.
[3591.52 --> 3591.78]  Yes.
[3591.78 --> 3600.20]  Because it's competition to Wacom, which has dominated the industry of on-screen tablet writing thingies for very long.
[3600.34 --> 3600.42]  Yeah.
[3600.50 --> 3603.08]  And that review will be done eventually soon.
[3603.18 --> 3604.06]  It's scripted right now.
[3604.20 --> 3606.88]  I am very interested in injecting your stuff.
[3607.10 --> 3608.70]  But it is scripted so I can put it wherever.
[3608.78 --> 3611.44]  I've been using it today.
[3612.22 --> 3615.52]  Trying to figure out how the tilt works on it, which I can't figure out.
[3615.52 --> 3620.56]  Tim Cook, in response to a question about whether Mac desktops were strategic for Apple, he said,
[3620.68 --> 3623.14]  The desktop is a very strategic place for us.
[3623.34 --> 3624.24]  I added place in.
[3624.72 --> 3627.04]  It just says, The desktop is very strategic for us.
[3627.40 --> 3632.24]  It's unique compared to the notebook because you can pack a lot more performance in a desktop.
[3632.92 --> 3638.34]  The largest screens, the most memory and storage, a greater variety of I.O. and fastest performance.
[3638.34 --> 3644.20]  So there are many different reasons why desktops are really important and in some cases critical to people.
[3644.62 --> 3647.84]  The current generation of iMac is the best desktop we have ever made.
[3647.94 --> 3651.92]  And its beautiful Retina 5K display is the best display in the world.
[3652.94 --> 3658.72]  Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops.
[3658.74 --> 3664.14]  If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear.
[3664.26 --> 3665.80]  We have great desktops in our roadmap.
[3665.80 --> 3668.42]  Nobody should worry about that.
[3669.68 --> 3671.46]  The Mac people say that.
[3672.08 --> 3675.98]  That's a little odd because there's very valid reasons to worry about that.
[3676.64 --> 3677.00]  Right.
[3678.10 --> 3679.96]  Sorry, I wasn't actually paying attention.
[3681.72 --> 3682.76]  What's the gist of that?
[3682.90 --> 3683.26]  Sorry, Luke.
[3683.28 --> 3686.32]  Basically, there's new Mac desktops on the roadmap.
[3686.62 --> 3688.00]  It's been a long time since they've released one.
[3688.04 --> 3689.26]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[3689.26 --> 3690.08]  And there's new Mac desktops on the roadmap.
[3690.08 --> 3691.98]  So they've been mostly focusing on notebooks.
[3693.98 --> 3694.46]  Yeah.
[3695.04 --> 3695.38]  Okay.
[3695.80 --> 3697.58]  I think like phone.
[3698.30 --> 3699.12]  And that too.
[3699.40 --> 3699.74]  Yes.
[3699.92 --> 3702.34]  And literally books made out of paper.
[3702.54 --> 3703.04]  Smart phone.
[3703.78 --> 3705.08]  Yeah, and then the paper.
[3705.14 --> 3705.44]  $300.
[3705.90 --> 3706.82]  Actual paper book.
[3706.90 --> 3707.08]  Yeah.
[3707.38 --> 3707.92]  That's right.
[3708.00 --> 3708.94]  That is a thing.
[3710.44 --> 3712.48]  Anything else on the dock or are we done?
[3712.76 --> 3713.34]  I think we're done.
[3714.58 --> 3715.66]  This was a weird show.
[3715.90 --> 3716.78]  Hopefully you guys liked it.
[3716.86 --> 3717.64]  We got to see Jake.
[3717.64 --> 3718.62]  We got to see Tyler.
[3718.84 --> 3719.88]  They're not normally on camera.
[3719.98 --> 3720.42]  That was cool.
[3720.78 --> 3722.96]  We got to see some other members of Linus Meteor Group come in.
[3723.88 --> 3724.58]  It's Christmas.
[3724.58 --> 3725.90]  Yes.
[3727.90 --> 3728.78]  Oh my goodness.
[3728.90 --> 3729.10]  Brandon.
[3729.36 --> 3729.72]  Wait, yeah.
[3729.76 --> 3730.36]  Where were you?
[3731.24 --> 3731.96]  Get in here.
[3732.36 --> 3732.54]  Yeah.
[3732.62 --> 3734.40]  I still have to finish my edit.
[3735.18 --> 3735.86]  Get over here.
[3735.86 --> 3736.10]  What's up?
[3736.10 --> 3737.76]  How are we doing?
[3738.46 --> 3739.26]  How are you doing?
[3739.36 --> 3740.82]  I'm doing fantastic.
[3741.08 --> 3742.24]  Today has been a good day.
[3742.38 --> 3742.72]  Oh wow.
[3743.36 --> 3743.64]  Why?
[3743.82 --> 3744.32]  Tell me about it.
[3744.44 --> 3746.32]  Well, we just got our new camera.
[3746.46 --> 3747.62]  Or well, half of it.
[3747.96 --> 3749.16]  Half of our new camera.
[3749.16 --> 3752.06]  It's not quite there yet.
[3752.34 --> 3757.82]  We still need the lens mount and some SSDs that are still on the way.
[3757.96 --> 3758.52]  Okay, question.
[3758.74 --> 3759.00]  Yes.
[3759.64 --> 3761.90]  Why would they make the camera but not have the lens mount on it?
[3761.96 --> 3763.50]  Why would you want a camera without a lens mount?
[3763.86 --> 3764.66]  You can change it.
[3764.66 --> 3770.82]  So like, we're getting a Canon EF mount but you can change it to PL, Nikon mount.
[3771.40 --> 3773.08]  Like, you have options.
[3774.18 --> 3775.16]  This is the Christmas hat.
[3775.44 --> 3776.46]  Oh, yes.
[3776.54 --> 3777.82]  I'm not festive enough, clearly.
[3777.82 --> 3780.80]  I don't really do well with hats.
[3781.08 --> 3781.82]  Like, they're never really...
[3782.90 --> 3783.52]  That one works.
[3783.72 --> 3784.16]  Yeah, okay.
[3784.48 --> 3785.68]  Santa, I can just...
[3785.68 --> 3786.14]  I played...
[3786.14 --> 3786.42]  You know what?
[3786.48 --> 3788.46]  In grade 7, I played Santa.
[3789.02 --> 3789.36]  Oh.
[3790.54 --> 3792.84]  My elementary school was very progressive.
[3793.06 --> 3793.68]  And they're like...
[3793.68 --> 3794.90]  I was the only...
[3794.90 --> 3797.20]  Like, one of two Asian guys in the class.
[3797.24 --> 3798.68]  They're like, let's make Brandon play Santa.
[3798.76 --> 3799.42]  I'm like, okay.
[3800.10 --> 3800.54]  Sure.
[3802.70 --> 3803.34]  That's funny.
[3804.50 --> 3806.14]  Best and worst things that happened this year.
[3806.40 --> 3807.70]  For you, related to work.
[3808.38 --> 3809.82]  Best and worst things.
[3811.02 --> 3812.38]  I think...
[3812.38 --> 3813.50]  That's a little bit of an on the spot.
[3813.76 --> 3814.26]  Oh, wow.
[3814.32 --> 3816.58]  That's a hard question to just answer.
[3818.22 --> 3823.40]  I think the best things have just been like, optimization.
[3824.30 --> 3829.98]  Like, our lighting grid was basically set, finalized at the beginning of the year.
[3829.98 --> 3833.92]  And a lot of things that I didn't used to have are now here.
[3833.92 --> 3838.94]  So, I guess that's the best part is that my life has gotten more efficient when it comes
[3838.94 --> 3839.88]  to being working here.
[3840.54 --> 3845.70]  Worst part, though, is that it feels like my workload has tripled since that time.
[3845.92 --> 3850.94]  So, like, all the efficiency that I felt like I had just got eaten up like that.
[3850.94 --> 3852.04]  But it's okay.
[3852.52 --> 3854.02]  You know, not so bad.
[3855.14 --> 3857.62]  But, I mean, if you're talking about specific things, like...
[3859.62 --> 3860.46]  I don't know.
[3860.56 --> 3861.48]  I haven't broken anything.
[3861.78 --> 3863.02]  I didn't drop a camera this year.
[3863.10 --> 3863.58]  That's good.
[3863.58 --> 3865.68]  I don't know.
[3865.96 --> 3867.98]  There was a light that was dropped today.
[3868.26 --> 3868.88]  Oh, God.
[3868.98 --> 3869.20]  What?
[3871.44 --> 3875.78]  X person was on the phone walking by a light, and I think they accidentally kicked it.
[3876.58 --> 3876.92]  It fell over.
[3876.94 --> 3877.54]  It still works.
[3878.06 --> 3878.30]  Nope.
[3878.48 --> 3878.70]  Nope.
[3878.74 --> 3879.32]  It was not Colton.
[3879.42 --> 3880.28]  I won't tell you who it was.
[3880.40 --> 3882.10]  That's the last person I'm confirming or denying.
[3882.64 --> 3883.80]  I said it was not Colton.
[3884.18 --> 3885.50]  Why do you assume it's me?
[3885.62 --> 3886.30]  I don't know.
[3886.60 --> 3887.54]  You're just there.
[3888.54 --> 3889.54]  Sneakly in the background.
[3890.68 --> 3890.84]  Yeah.
[3891.00 --> 3891.94]  So, but it's fine.
[3892.00 --> 3893.22]  Everything still works and whatnot.
[3893.22 --> 3897.14]  People in the chat are asking about what camera specifically.
[3897.50 --> 3900.02]  So, we just got to...
[3900.02 --> 3900.64]  Should I go get it?
[3901.56 --> 3901.82]  Yeah.
[3902.04 --> 3902.30]  Okay.
[3902.68 --> 3902.90]  Wait.
[3903.72 --> 3905.34]  I thought you weren't allowed to take it out of the box.
[3905.48 --> 3906.26]  No, no, no.
[3906.40 --> 3907.54]  We, uh...
[3907.54 --> 3908.32]  That's the other one.
[3909.68 --> 3910.12]  Okay.
[3910.60 --> 3911.08]  You know what?
[3911.14 --> 3911.94]  I won't even mention that.
[3912.76 --> 3913.32]  So...
[3913.32 --> 3916.36]  Here it is.
[3916.64 --> 3918.10]  You put it on, like, a...
[3918.10 --> 3918.78]  A rail mount.
[3918.88 --> 3920.76]  So far, we have...
[3921.68 --> 3922.66]  This is an Epic W.
[3924.22 --> 3924.90]  Top handle.
[3925.14 --> 3927.48]  So, it's Epic W, but it's not an Epic weapon.
[3928.40 --> 3929.02]  Well...
[3929.02 --> 3931.26]  Yeah, their naming scheme is kind of weird.
[3931.28 --> 3932.42]  It's a weapon body.
[3933.00 --> 3933.52]  So, like...
[3933.52 --> 3934.44]  Because...
[3934.44 --> 3935.78]  It's a little...
[3935.78 --> 3938.14]  Like, all the red lineup cameras...
[3938.14 --> 3939.14]  Are...
[3939.14 --> 3941.14]  DSM-C2.
[3942.32 --> 3944.14]  That's just, like, their second generation bodies.
[3944.48 --> 3946.58]  And so, they all technically have the same body.
[3946.74 --> 3947.78]  All the bodies are the same.
[3947.98 --> 3950.48]  So, like, all the parts for each tier...
[3950.48 --> 3953.46]  You're literally only changing, like, processing.
[3954.02 --> 3954.86]  Because, like...
[3954.86 --> 3959.74]  And the sensor is the same in the Epic as it is in the Weapon 8K.
[3959.74 --> 3960.74]  It's just there's...
[3960.74 --> 3961.32]  Okay.
[3961.32 --> 3962.56]  There's some processing differences.
[3963.46 --> 3964.04]  So...
[3964.04 --> 3964.38]  But, yeah.
[3964.74 --> 3965.78]  We have our side handle.
[3966.34 --> 3967.30]  There's no, like...
[3967.30 --> 3968.16]  There's no lens mount yet.
[3968.56 --> 3969.42]  But it's coming.
[3969.84 --> 3970.96]  I still can't use it.
[3971.38 --> 3973.74]  So, it's, like, literally just this, like, really expensive box...
[3973.74 --> 3977.26]  That I get to look at until the rest of the stuff comes, like, next week.
[3977.60 --> 3977.84]  Okay.
[3977.90 --> 3980.02]  But to be fair, it looks really freaking cool.
[3980.38 --> 3980.48]  Yeah.
[3980.48 --> 3983.86]  One thing that I really like that they did is it looks extremely industrial.
[3984.40 --> 3984.66]  Yeah.
[3984.76 --> 3985.52]  Like, they...
[3985.52 --> 3986.64]  Well, like, Red's...
[3986.64 --> 3987.64]  Red's...
[3987.64 --> 3990.74]  Besides being a pretty good camera company, they've...
[3990.74 --> 3991.68]  They're all about marketing.
[3992.30 --> 3993.74]  So, like, their marketing is just, like...
[3994.92 --> 3996.68]  Love this.
[3996.88 --> 3997.84]  Look how nice it looks.
[3997.90 --> 3998.62]  They have, like...
[3998.62 --> 4002.68]  You can literally buy, like, a wood cover, like, replacement grip for this grip.
[4002.68 --> 4004.40]  This side handle that's, like, right here.
[4004.86 --> 4005.46]  So...
[4005.46 --> 4006.54]  And, like...
[4006.54 --> 4010.68]  I've seen some people color code, like, their eject buttons on cameras.
[4010.84 --> 4011.58]  And, like...
[4011.58 --> 4012.38]  One guy...
[4012.38 --> 4013.22]  I think a vlogger.
[4013.28 --> 4014.16]  I can't remember what his name was.
[4014.22 --> 4017.84]  He did his up in, like, the same paint job as his car.
[4017.94 --> 4020.96]  Which is, like, a weird cow, like, camo thing.
[4021.34 --> 4022.24]  So, you can...
[4022.24 --> 4022.40]  Yeah.
[4022.48 --> 4023.48]  You can do whatever you want.
[4023.54 --> 4023.78]  Oh, my goodness.
[4023.80 --> 4028.34]  If you want it to look cool, if that is important to you when it comes to a camera, I can.
[4028.50 --> 4029.84]  I think it just looks cool how it is.
[4029.84 --> 4030.12]  I...
[4030.12 --> 4030.34]  Yeah.
[4030.44 --> 4032.42]  Like, I'm fine with it the way it is.
[4032.42 --> 4033.94]  I don't need anything particularly.
[4033.94 --> 4034.22]  Yeah.
[4034.48 --> 4034.66]  Yeah.
[4034.96 --> 4040.38]  Are you going to do a camera review like you did the other camera reviews with the red?
[4040.64 --> 4041.54]  That is a good question.
[4041.62 --> 4041.94]  Should I?
[4042.54 --> 4043.52]  I want to see it.
[4043.74 --> 4044.14]  Should I?
[4044.44 --> 4045.46]  Does anyone want to see that?
[4045.68 --> 4047.18]  Does anyone be interested?
[4047.18 --> 4048.12]  We can do a straw poll.
[4048.26 --> 4048.46]  Sure.
[4048.56 --> 4049.38]  Let's do a straw poll.
[4050.00 --> 4050.86]  Should I review...
[4050.86 --> 4055.30]  I'm very tempted to put both options as yes because I just want you to do it.
[4055.30 --> 4056.30]  Um...
[4056.30 --> 4056.80]  Um...
[4056.80 --> 4063.88]  But I will just put yes and no.
[4064.04 --> 4064.70]  Holy crap.
[4064.76 --> 4065.36]  Just in case.
[4065.52 --> 4065.70]  What?
[4066.66 --> 4067.64]  I see a lot of yeses.
[4067.70 --> 4071.68]  If we let him review the red camera, we're not going to get to use it in the video.
[4071.68 --> 4077.68]  But if we let him review the red camera, he'll learn everything about it and then be able
[4077.68 --> 4080.92]  to teach everyone else at the company how to use it properly more quickly.
[4080.92 --> 4082.36]  I want you to do that anyway.
[4082.36 --> 4085.82]  He's not wrong.
[4086.82 --> 4088.28]  But he also...
[4088.28 --> 4089.38]  But I want to see a video.
[4089.60 --> 4094.22]  For anyone who didn't hear, Linus basically thinks like, well, if I make this review, we
[4094.22 --> 4099.40]  won't be able to use the camera for actual work like in the studio forever, which is...
[4099.40 --> 4101.14]  I don't know.
[4101.24 --> 4102.62]  I can balance that out.
[4103.08 --> 4103.36]  It's...
[4103.36 --> 4105.68]  96% of people say yes.
[4108.14 --> 4109.08]  Yes and no.
[4109.08 --> 4110.08]  No.
[4113.68 --> 4114.12]  Yeah.
[4114.26 --> 4114.76]  No, I know.
[4114.88 --> 4115.08]  It's...
[4115.08 --> 4116.64]  The options are literally yes and no.
[4116.70 --> 4117.82]  I didn't even put in turnip.
[4120.96 --> 4121.76]  Oh, yeah.
[4121.80 --> 4127.46]  For anyone who's curious, Linus is building a very special new server that is...
[4127.46 --> 4128.14]  What was that?
[4128.76 --> 4130.18]  Necessary for this...
[4130.18 --> 4133.50]  Oh, okay.
[4134.16 --> 4135.18]  Oh, hey, John.
[4136.66 --> 4137.94]  You want to be on WAN show?
[4137.94 --> 4139.64]  Most impromptu WAN show ever.
[4140.92 --> 4141.24]  Yeah.
[4142.76 --> 4143.62]  Come say hi.
[4144.62 --> 4145.50]  Merry Christmas.
[4147.44 --> 4147.80]  Five...
[4147.80 --> 4148.44]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[4148.50 --> 4148.96]  Like...
[4148.96 --> 4149.26]  Okay.
[4150.78 --> 4151.64]  30 people.
[4151.78 --> 4152.80]  So of the 30 people...
[4152.80 --> 4154.16]  And they're just trolling a little bit.
[4154.18 --> 4155.80]  Who don't want me to review this camera.
[4155.98 --> 4156.22]  Why?
[4156.88 --> 4157.22]  Yeah.
[4157.76 --> 4158.76]  Because I want to.
[4158.88 --> 4159.16]  Yeah.
[4159.64 --> 4160.40]  What's happening, everyone?
[4160.70 --> 4161.08]  Hey, John.
[4161.08 --> 4162.00]  How was America?
[4162.32 --> 4163.04]  It was good.
[4163.12 --> 4165.94]  I was detained at the Canadian border for almost two hours, but...
[4165.94 --> 4166.70]  That was all right.
[4166.70 --> 4170.26]  Good old friendly Canadians.
[4170.54 --> 4172.68]  No, I just had to pay duties on some company stuff.
[4172.74 --> 4173.26]  It was no big deal.
[4173.46 --> 4174.46]  So it just took a long time.
[4174.66 --> 4174.78]  Yeah.
[4175.16 --> 4175.32]  Yeah.
[4176.60 --> 4177.30]  There you go.
[4177.56 --> 4180.46]  We're doing a year in review type WAN show.
[4180.94 --> 4184.70]  What was your favorite and least favorite parts of this year that had something to do with work?
[4184.70 --> 4185.68]  You are going to say it, John.
[4185.78 --> 4186.12]  What's up?
[4187.22 --> 4188.38]  Least, best and worst.
[4188.54 --> 4189.20]  Best and worst.
[4189.30 --> 4190.22]  That had something to do with work.
[4190.44 --> 4190.60]  Yeah.
[4190.60 --> 4194.46]  I think the best was probably winning the burger challenge.
[4194.70 --> 4195.62]  Burkle's burger challenge.
[4195.68 --> 4197.06]  That was probably the highlight of the year for me.
[4197.74 --> 4198.06]  Absolutely.
[4198.56 --> 4199.10]  No question.
[4199.24 --> 4199.66]  No question.
[4200.82 --> 4201.18]  Yeah.
[4201.54 --> 4201.90]  Nice.
[4202.06 --> 4202.28]  Okay.
[4202.32 --> 4202.98]  What about the worst?
[4203.38 --> 4209.14]  The worst was probably the super funds we did like really early in the year before I lost all that weight.
[4209.14 --> 4210.70]  and I got to see how fat I looked on camera.
[4210.92 --> 4211.98]  So that was kind of awesome.
[4212.26 --> 4214.42]  That's an interesting pairing.
[4215.82 --> 4217.76]  Your favorite thing was winning the burger challenge.
[4217.90 --> 4220.46]  And your least favorite thing was looking at yourself when you weighed more.
[4221.44 --> 4223.36]  Well, you can enjoy burgers.
[4223.44 --> 4224.44]  Just always in moderation.
[4224.78 --> 4224.90]  You know?
[4226.72 --> 4227.20]  That's true.
[4227.38 --> 4227.46]  There you go.
[4227.80 --> 4229.36]  That's solid and very fast.
[4229.50 --> 4229.70]  What's up?
[4229.82 --> 4230.36]  I don't care.
[4230.50 --> 4230.96]  It doesn't matter.
[4231.04 --> 4231.34]  Sit down.
[4231.48 --> 4231.88]  Take his teeth.
[4232.10 --> 4232.26]  Okay.
[4232.44 --> 4232.70]  Enjoy.
[4233.02 --> 4233.40]  Very good.
[4234.02 --> 4234.96]  Yeah, I can hang out for a few minutes.
[4235.06 --> 4235.84]  Goodbye, everybody.
[4235.98 --> 4236.56]  Merry Christmas.
[4236.82 --> 4236.94]  Here.
[4236.94 --> 4238.26]  Here's the hat.
[4238.56 --> 4238.86]  Oh, hey.
[4238.86 --> 4239.10]  Okay.
[4239.16 --> 4239.54]  Very good.
[4239.82 --> 4244.38]  I don't think I'm going to be able to make my engagement because it's too snowy out there.
[4244.70 --> 4245.42]  Make your engagement?
[4245.44 --> 4248.50]  Well, I had a thing I was going to go to, but it turns out it's to Washington.
[4249.00 --> 4249.40]  Oh, wow.
[4249.78 --> 4252.38]  So I'm not going to make it to Washington tonight.
[4253.12 --> 4254.36]  Let's pull up another chair.
[4254.42 --> 4255.10]  Do you need to?
[4255.18 --> 4255.68]  I can drive.
[4255.68 --> 4255.86]  No.
[4256.20 --> 4257.04]  Wait, which way is it?
[4257.74 --> 4258.96]  That's good.
[4259.08 --> 4259.90]  I think it does whatever.
[4260.08 --> 4260.24]  I don't know.
[4260.24 --> 4264.34]  Yeah, it's just sort of coming out to the side like a jester hat, but with only one thingy on it.
[4264.34 --> 4269.26]  You know, last year on the New Year's WAN show, Taren, you drank.
[4270.06 --> 4270.30]  No.
[4270.80 --> 4271.62]  No, I didn't.
[4271.80 --> 4276.22]  I opened a bottle of champagne, and then we drank it later.
[4276.48 --> 4277.06]  Off screen.
[4277.78 --> 4278.30]  Not here.
[4278.40 --> 4278.72]  Am I in?
[4278.72 --> 4279.14]  There he is.
[4279.56 --> 4279.86]  Yay.
[4279.86 --> 4281.16]  Oh, lean to the left slightly.
[4281.30 --> 4281.80]  There he is.
[4282.08 --> 4282.44]  Yes.
[4282.94 --> 4284.00]  Come join us, Colton.
[4284.54 --> 4284.90]  Yes.
[4285.04 --> 4285.76]  Get on screen.
[4286.18 --> 4287.02]  Well, I'm hogging.
[4287.02 --> 4288.48]  It's a Christmas miracle.
[4288.80 --> 4289.08]  Oh, crap.
[4289.32 --> 4292.14]  Hey, Brandon, can you go outside and like shut my car door?
[4292.22 --> 4292.78]  I left it open.
[4292.78 --> 4297.30]  I was going to bring in all that stuff, but then they were like, yo, want to be on WAN show?
[4297.48 --> 4297.58]  So.
[4297.58 --> 4299.60]  There we go.
[4299.82 --> 4300.00]  Yeah.
[4300.40 --> 4301.72]  What is chat saying right now?
[4301.94 --> 4302.36]  Let's see.
[4303.16 --> 4305.00]  I still can't think of a worst thing.
[4305.32 --> 4305.98]  John is here.
[4306.08 --> 4306.18]  What?
[4306.18 --> 4306.76]  You didn't pick one?
[4307.16 --> 4309.32]  No, I can't think of a worst thing.
[4309.32 --> 4309.68]  Really?
[4309.68 --> 4310.34]  I had a good year.
[4310.68 --> 4311.10]  Yeah, I know.
[4311.24 --> 4312.72]  Like, it's kind of the same for me, too.
[4312.74 --> 4316.70]  I mean, except for, you know, lots of things that did happen in 2016, but not to me personally.
[4316.70 --> 4318.38]  That weren't related to work, I guess.
[4318.46 --> 4318.66]  Yeah.
[4318.78 --> 4319.78]  He did say work related.
[4319.90 --> 4320.72]  Turned good on screen.
[4320.82 --> 4321.28]  Yeah, I know.
[4321.46 --> 4322.92]  It's a narrow.
[4323.26 --> 4323.38]  Yeah.
[4323.74 --> 4324.76]  2016 was a good year.
[4325.24 --> 4327.48]  Is Brandon inside right now?
[4327.70 --> 4329.80]  Colton, have you already done your best and worst of 2016?
[4329.98 --> 4330.22]  You done?
[4331.38 --> 4335.02]  Hey, Linus, what were your best and worst things of 2016 related to work?
[4335.02 --> 4340.12]  I lost all the data last year, right?
[4340.30 --> 4340.56]  Yeah.
[4340.74 --> 4341.10]  Yes.
[4341.38 --> 4341.74]  Okay.
[4342.34 --> 4343.66]  I lost all the data last year.
[4345.28 --> 4349.54]  Did he get the data back this year?
[4349.90 --> 4350.06]  Yeah.
[4351.12 --> 4351.76]  What data?
[4352.90 --> 4354.26]  I think that was last year, yeah.
[4354.98 --> 4355.70]  Yeah, okay.
[4355.70 --> 4359.34]  What about your new server?
[4360.04 --> 4360.36]  What?
[4360.52 --> 4361.54]  What about your new server?
[4362.10 --> 4362.70]  You know what?
[4362.80 --> 4367.06]  I'm going to go with the total 10, uh, total 10,000 response.
[4367.60 --> 4371.92]  The best thing of your career was going to work alongside my wife at work.
[4372.14 --> 4372.78]  Oh, wow.
[4372.78 --> 4373.98]  Oh, there we go.
[4374.20 --> 4379.30]  If you didn't catch that, he said the best thing was working alongside his wife at work.
[4380.02 --> 4381.24]  Didn't you have a kid this year?
[4382.48 --> 4385.42]  Oh, yeah.
[4385.42 --> 4385.54]  Yeah.
[4388.16 --> 4389.18]  Wait, not work related?
[4389.72 --> 4390.18]  It's worse?
[4390.36 --> 4392.48]  It's not, no, not as good.
[4392.82 --> 4394.36]  Not as good as what he was saying.
[4394.74 --> 4395.20]  Oh, my God.
[4395.20 --> 4397.40]  No, the other one was the worst thing that happened.
[4397.42 --> 4397.98]  Oh, the worst?
[4398.10 --> 4400.32]  Okay, that was related to work.
[4400.34 --> 4401.56]  No, I thought he was saying the best.
[4401.68 --> 4402.92]  Was he saying the best or the worst?
[4403.14 --> 4404.78]  Oh, I wasn't paying attention at all.
[4404.78 --> 4406.14]  Did he mean the worst?
[4406.42 --> 4408.90]  If it's the worst, we should totally say that.
[4408.90 --> 4412.50]  But that was a related to work response, which might actually make sense.
[4412.50 --> 4414.76]  I'm going to go on the defense for you, Linus.
[4414.80 --> 4415.36]  I got this.
[4415.88 --> 4422.80]  His response was, the questions were, what were the best and worst things that happened to you this year related to work?
[4422.88 --> 4423.14]  Yes.
[4423.30 --> 4429.28]  So the impact of the new child related to work does make sense as being the worst thing that happened this year.
[4429.28 --> 4429.62]  That's true.
[4429.62 --> 4434.76]  Outside of work is his own thing, and we're not taking comments on that at this time.
[4435.58 --> 4438.36]  But related to work, that might make sense.
[4438.42 --> 4439.64]  You ever consider law school, Luke?
[4439.98 --> 4440.76]  You'd be good at it.
[4441.28 --> 4441.98]  There we go.
[4442.12 --> 4442.52]  Thank you.
[4442.86 --> 4444.80]  I don't think I actually would be, but I appreciate it.
[4447.10 --> 4449.08]  Anyways, I think we're done now.
[4450.16 --> 4453.48]  I'm going to stop this thing and upload this thing and then go home.
[4453.68 --> 4454.56]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[4454.68 --> 4454.86]  Yeah.
[4455.26 --> 4456.88]  Hope you guys had a good year, you know?
[4457.02 --> 4458.06]  I hope you did, too.
[4458.06 --> 4458.68]  Drive safe.
[4458.94 --> 4467.68]  If you want to let us know, hit us up at LinusTech on Twitter and let us know what the best and worst things we did this year was.
[4467.80 --> 4468.44]  Yeah, please do.
[4469.66 --> 4470.44]  And Jamar 604.
[4470.44 --> 4471.34]  That's going to be fun.
[4471.68 --> 4471.98]  Yeah.
[4472.40 --> 4473.22]  Let him know, too.
[4473.78 --> 4474.88]  Sure, why not?
[4474.88 --> 4476.24]  Let him know everything you hate.
[4477.18 --> 4477.74]  Bye.
[4477.96 --> 4478.28]  Bye.
[4479.36 --> 4480.24]  Happy Festivus.
