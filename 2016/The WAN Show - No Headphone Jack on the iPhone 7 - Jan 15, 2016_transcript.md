[0.00 --> 4.00]  Hey, welcome to the WAN show!
[4.38 --> 9.18]  Oh, I'm so disappointed, because I always try and find like a, just a, like a ridiculous
[9.18 --> 12.30]  screen grab of you for the thumbnail on Vessel.
[12.70 --> 12.96]  Yeah.
[13.10 --> 17.88]  And that one's too early in the show for me to be able to screen grab it tonight, later,
[17.98 --> 19.30]  without getting the YouTube UI.
[19.44 --> 20.96]  So just, can you make that face again for a sec?
[23.18 --> 24.14]  Yeah, look at that!
[24.14 --> 24.42]  There we go!
[24.42 --> 28.48]  Hey, we should just make this part of the routine, like making our, getting our thumbnail
[28.48 --> 29.86]  sort of taken care of.
[29.86 --> 32.84]  So we'll just like, what is wrong with you?
[33.32 --> 33.62]  Whoa!
[34.18 --> 35.50]  Without getting the YouTube UI.
[35.68 --> 36.08]  Can you?
[37.26 --> 39.84]  That surprised me so much.
[41.44 --> 45.86]  Well, what's interesting about that, though, is now we actually know at what point in the
[45.86 --> 49.74]  video people are actually hearing what we're talking about at the beginning of the show.
[49.76 --> 50.02]  That's true.
[50.20 --> 52.20]  Turns out, not at the very beginning.
[52.20 --> 52.78]  Not at all.
[52.78 --> 57.62]  So now we know that, and we did before, but we couldn't quantify it, and we haven't yet
[57.62 --> 58.74]  because we weren't timing it.
[58.74 --> 59.26]  Nope, we didn't count.
[59.86 --> 62.14]  Welcome to the WAN show, guys.
[62.24 --> 66.62]  It's good to be totally back into the, I mean, honestly.
[66.62 --> 69.82]  Is this our first proper WAN show in like four weeks?
[69.96 --> 70.36]  Yeah.
[71.22 --> 71.58]  Yeah.
[71.58 --> 76.20]  Like, it's, we did the recap, which was cool.
[76.34 --> 79.84]  We had everyone on, but it wasn't, you know, the WAN show.
[79.84 --> 81.52]  And like, not everyone could make it.
[81.76 --> 87.40]  And then I bailed on Luke like one hour before the next one after that, which was awesome.
[87.52 --> 88.14]  That was brutal.
[88.14 --> 95.26]  And then we were streaming from CES last time with like the, oh man, the, oh, it was awful.
[95.32 --> 96.84]  The equipment wasn't working.
[96.84 --> 99.10]  The, the computer wasn't working.
[99.10 --> 102.28]  Like I said, Edsel and Yvonne did a really good job of setting it up.
[102.32 --> 104.32]  They just, they didn't have much at their disposal.
[104.32 --> 106.68]  And it broke and all of those things.
[106.88 --> 110.86]  And, and then, and then, and like we didn't have any of our like lower thirds.
[110.86 --> 115.20]  Like, you know, where, how would you guys know where to buy all your Linus Tech Chips merch?
[115.34 --> 116.80]  Or what the name of the show was.
[116.88 --> 118.22]  Or like our Twitter handles.
[118.56 --> 118.84]  Yeah.
[119.48 --> 120.66]  If it wasn't for the lower third.
[120.72 --> 122.66]  All of that is the most important information.
[122.84 --> 123.24]  Exactly.
[123.34 --> 124.36]  Brandon keeps on taking pictures.
[124.36 --> 127.60]  Speaking of most important information, why is your Twitter handle above mine?
[128.22 --> 130.28]  I don't, I didn't do, I didn't make it.
[130.60 --> 132.50]  I'm going full on conspiracy theory.
[132.92 --> 134.52]  He thinks he runs the WAN show now.
[134.58 --> 135.28]  Let's do a straw poll.
[135.40 --> 135.72]  What?
[135.72 --> 139.68]  I want to know, I want to know, I want to know what you guys think of this.
[139.76 --> 139.88]  Okay.
[139.92 --> 140.72]  It's straw poll time.
[141.10 --> 143.38]  Technically in the last month I've been on the WAN show more than you.
[143.62 --> 145.30]  Does Luke run the WAN show?
[145.52 --> 145.82]  Okay.
[146.04 --> 148.34]  So we're going with a yes and no and a turnip.
[148.78 --> 149.38]  And a turnip.
[149.48 --> 156.02]  And I think that, I think that we all know what the, what the answer is to any poll that
[156.02 --> 156.94]  involves a turnip.
[157.24 --> 157.56]  Turnip.
[157.64 --> 158.48]  So go ahead guys.
[158.54 --> 159.26]  Go ahead guys.
[159.36 --> 160.18]  Hit those results.
[160.30 --> 161.02]  Let's see those results.
[161.08 --> 163.48]  In the meantime, let's introduce our topics for the day.
[163.48 --> 165.42]  Yes, we have a fully prepared doc.
[165.78 --> 168.58]  Luke and I have actually prepped on the topics.
[168.80 --> 168.94]  Mostly.
[169.32 --> 169.76]  We're, yeah.
[169.76 --> 172.44]  I, I, I, 80% for me or so.
[172.44 --> 172.64]  Yeah.
[172.64 --> 172.70]  Yeah.
[172.70 --> 172.96]  Good.
[173.04 --> 173.36]  All right.
[173.36 --> 174.30]  So we're both on the same page.
[175.98 --> 181.56]  An iPhone leak has quote unquote officially, because remember a leak is still a leak, not
[181.56 --> 184.32]  a, you know, a poo, for example.
[184.32 --> 186.18]  You know, like a, you got to take a leak.
[186.18 --> 186.92]  That's not, yeah.
[187.06 --> 190.88]  You know, you're not like, you're not sitting down and pulling out the phone and getting
[190.88 --> 191.08]  some.
[191.08 --> 192.20]  A leak is only stage one.
[192.26 --> 193.94]  Jetpack joyride going on, right?
[193.94 --> 194.08]  Yeah.
[194.08 --> 194.60]  Like, okay.
[194.60 --> 194.70]  Yeah.
[194.70 --> 194.72]  Like, okay.
[194.72 --> 195.08]  Yeah.
[195.08 --> 195.58]  Yeah.
[195.58 --> 199.08]  That, the headphone jack will be removed from the iPhone 7.
[200.08 --> 201.26]  Dun, dun, dun.
[201.26 --> 201.64]  DUN.
[201.64 --> 202.64]  Yeah.
[202.64 --> 203.64]  Yeah.
[203.64 --> 204.64]  Yeah.
[204.64 --> 205.64]  Yeah.
[205.64 --> 206.64]  Yeah.
[206.64 --> 211.50]  Your computer sucks and is currently in the process of building a propane-cooled personal
[211.50 --> 215.58]  rig to, uh, presumably game in VR.
[215.58 --> 219.96]  Although it depends who you ask and it also depends on how seriously you take the sensationalist
[219.96 --> 220.96]  headline.
[220.96 --> 223.40]  And take a note of context and two completely different things.
[223.40 --> 224.40]  Yes.
[224.40 --> 225.40]  More on that at 11.
[225.40 --> 226.40]  Pfft.
[226.40 --> 232.78]  Also, some parents somewhere got an $8,000 bill for some FIFA microtransactions from their
[232.78 --> 238.40]  kid who is not like eight or seven years old as you might expect, but actually 17.
[238.40 --> 240.42]  We'll talk about that later.
[240.42 --> 244.54]  And Mushkin announced a $500, four terabyte SSD.
[244.54 --> 245.54]  Look at this.
[245.54 --> 246.54]  I tried to buy it.
[246.54 --> 247.54]  It's not available yet.
[247.54 --> 249.54]  This is very interesting.
[249.54 --> 251.14]  There's a couple of interesting things here.
[251.14 --> 257.32]  Number one is that 64% of our audience is deluded, which is fascinating.
[257.32 --> 260.80]  And number two is that the hardcores, okay?
[260.80 --> 264.30]  The guys who tune in right at the beginning of the show, look at that engagement.
[264.30 --> 265.30]  Yeah.
[265.30 --> 268.30]  The number of viewers we have versus the number of poll results returned.
[268.30 --> 269.30]  It's really high.
[269.30 --> 270.30]  That is incredible.
[270.30 --> 271.30]  It is.
[271.30 --> 273.12]  You guys, you guys, you guys are hardcore.
[273.12 --> 274.42]  You guys are cool guys.
[274.42 --> 276.56]  And now your cool guys are going to watch the intro.
[276.56 --> 283.56]  I know.
[283.56 --> 295.06]  You guys are awesome.
[295.06 --> 296.06]  You guys are super cool.
[296.06 --> 297.06]  Love, love.
[297.06 --> 298.06]  Yeah.
[298.06 --> 299.06]  Fuck you.
[299.06 --> 300.06]  Bye-bye.
[300.06 --> 301.06]  Bye-bye.
[301.06 --> 302.06]  Bye-bye.
[302.06 --> 303.06]  Bye-bye.
[303.06 --> 304.06]  Bye-bye.
[304.06 --> 305.06]  Bye-bye.
[305.06 --> 306.06]  Bye-bye.
[306.06 --> 307.06]  Bye-bye.
[307.06 --> 308.52]  of our company secrets.
[308.52 --> 311.92]  Oh, I can't put the, okay, this scene,
[311.92 --> 314.04]  this scene is being kind of a derp,
[314.04 --> 317.40]  and I'm having trouble putting the Squarespace
[317.40 --> 319.42]  and TunnelBear logos that maybe you guys
[319.42 --> 321.24]  will just have to imagine that you've seen
[321.24 --> 322.30]  at this point in time.
[322.30 --> 325.06]  Someone made a compilation of all my stupid business ideas
[325.06 --> 326.32]  that I came up with for Squarespace.
[326.32 --> 327.82]  Do you ever, do you ever not seeing that?
[327.82 --> 332.66]  No, I actually haven't watched any of our CES content.
[332.66 --> 334.64]  At the end of all of my CES videos,
[334.64 --> 336.70]  I came up with some reason why you might need
[336.70 --> 338.74]  a website, and at the start of the show,
[338.74 --> 341.26]  there was tons of easy pickings reasons
[341.26 --> 342.44]  why you might need a website.
[342.44 --> 345.46]  Near the end of the show, it got pretty difficult
[345.46 --> 347.18]  because I made a lot of videos.
[347.18 --> 348.56]  So like at the Zotac suite,
[348.56 --> 350.38]  they had this really weird looking chandelier,
[350.38 --> 352.16]  so I started talking about how you might need
[352.16 --> 353.90]  a website to sell your chandeliers,
[353.90 --> 356.32]  but I was sort of talking about the concerns
[356.32 --> 359.18]  of distribution, like lanes and stuff
[359.18 --> 361.92]  that you might need for chandelier distribution.
[361.92 --> 363.96]  For one of them, I talked about teleportation devices.
[363.96 --> 364.80]  It got weird.
[364.80 --> 367.04]  Did you ever get to the point where it's like,
[367.04 --> 368.76]  you could start a service online
[368.76 --> 370.66]  where people send their wine bottles,
[370.66 --> 372.20]  where like the cork is kind of stuck
[372.20 --> 373.76]  and you can't get it out?
[373.76 --> 375.84]  And you send it to us, and we like get it out for you
[375.84 --> 377.10]  and then send it back to you?
[377.10 --> 378.84]  No, I didn't.
[378.84 --> 379.52]  Not that stupid.
[379.52 --> 381.22]  I came up with one where you could make a resume
[381.22 --> 382.24]  because you lost your job
[382.24 --> 384.06]  because you ran out of ideas.
[384.06 --> 385.20]  Because I ran out of ideas.
[387.00 --> 387.88]  Then I was like, wait, no,
[387.88 --> 389.40]  that's technically an idea and I'm fine.
[389.40 --> 390.24]  Grab that resume.
[390.24 --> 391.44]  Have you sent it to Tech Syndicate?
[391.44 --> 392.28]  Because...
[392.28 --> 394.24]  Oh, I should.
[394.24 --> 394.92]  All right.
[394.92 --> 397.28]  So why don't we move into our first topic of the day?
[397.28 --> 399.80]  It's going to be a good show for you guys.
[399.80 --> 402.58]  This is actually posted by the CBC
[402.58 --> 404.64]  and was posted on the Linus Tech Tips Forum by...
[404.64 --> 405.58]  So this was here.
[405.58 --> 407.36]  ...the Digital Doctor.
[407.36 --> 408.14]  Oh, yes.
[408.14 --> 409.30]  Oh, yes, my friend.
[409.30 --> 410.18]  This was here.
[410.18 --> 414.60]  So Pembroke Parent gets an $8,000 Xbox bill
[414.60 --> 417.04]  after son racks up charges.
[417.36 --> 418.84]  Lance Perkins says,
[419.26 --> 422.48]  there will never be another Xbox system
[422.48 --> 425.00]  or any gaming system in my home.
[425.62 --> 426.14]  Overreaction?
[427.36 --> 428.26]  I don't know.
[428.38 --> 429.40]  I don't know, actually.
[430.00 --> 432.26]  I would love to say, yes, it's an overreaction,
[432.44 --> 434.58]  but I also didn't get a credit card bill
[434.58 --> 435.42]  for over $7,500.
[435.70 --> 437.54]  Now, to put this in the correct perspective,
[437.78 --> 440.04]  we're talking Canadian rupees here.
[440.04 --> 442.72]  So that's only about $5,000 US dollars?
[443.54 --> 444.98]  Probably roughly about there, yeah.
[445.08 --> 446.98]  But it's still a $5,000 bill.
[447.14 --> 449.02]  And do you want to sort of explain
[449.02 --> 450.72]  what the lead-in to this was?
[451.00 --> 452.36]  What the lead-in to this was?
[452.38 --> 453.60]  Yeah, like how do you end up?
[453.74 --> 455.72]  How do you end up with an $8,000 Xbox bill?
[455.84 --> 457.32]  The kid literally is like,
[457.52 --> 458.68]  I'm not even really sure.
[459.58 --> 460.20]  No joke.
[460.34 --> 461.90]  In the thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[463.96 --> 466.32]  Although he, too, was shocked about the amount
[466.32 --> 468.94]  contacted credit.
[469.18 --> 469.66]  Blah, blah, blah.
[470.04 --> 470.58]  By the amount?
[470.94 --> 474.58]  So, son confessed to using the card illicitly.
[474.66 --> 475.46]  So he wasn't supposed to.
[475.52 --> 476.42]  The card was given to him
[476.42 --> 477.96]  for emergency reasons from his dad.
[478.28 --> 479.04]  He used it illicitly.
[479.10 --> 480.34]  He was not supposed to do this.
[480.92 --> 482.40]  But he was shocked that there was
[482.40 --> 484.68]  over $7,500 in charges.
[485.04 --> 486.14]  Like, okay.
[486.54 --> 487.46]  At what level?
[487.60 --> 488.84]  There's a point where you're like,
[488.92 --> 490.98]  okay, maybe if I do like a $10 microtransaction
[491.52 --> 493.06]  once a month or something,
[493.44 --> 494.40]  they probably won't really notice
[494.40 --> 495.30]  and it's not a huge deal.
[496.10 --> 497.60]  At what point does that go
[497.60 --> 498.62]  to like,
[499.06 --> 499.84]  I'm just going to microtransaction
[500.38 --> 502.00]  every single possible thing.
[502.00 --> 502.76]  And here's the thing
[502.76 --> 504.02]  that I really need to understand.
[504.16 --> 506.00]  Can I hear from some FIFA players?
[506.20 --> 507.38]  Okay, let's Twitter blitz this.
[507.50 --> 509.64]  You guys blitz us, okay?
[509.76 --> 510.92]  At Linus Tech on Twitter.
[511.22 --> 511.50]  Okay.
[511.50 --> 514.34]  What can you buy in FIFA?
[514.78 --> 515.68]  Seriously, what cost?
[515.90 --> 516.84]  What are you buying?
[516.86 --> 517.54]  And here, here.
[517.62 --> 519.12]  This is the other real killer.
[519.30 --> 520.32]  This puts it again.
[520.48 --> 520.98]  It's all about,
[521.04 --> 522.40]  this is what the WAN show is.
[522.58 --> 524.28]  Putting it in the appropriate context.
[524.42 --> 525.80]  While knowing nothing about the story
[525.80 --> 527.14]  because we don't know what you can buy.
[527.18 --> 528.42]  This was done in a month.
[529.20 --> 529.60]  What?
[530.28 --> 531.74]  Well, because they got the bill.
[532.66 --> 533.20]  Oh, that makes sense.
[533.20 --> 534.30]  It's a single bill.
[534.70 --> 535.70]  I didn't even think about that.
[535.70 --> 537.16]  What did you buy in a month?
[537.24 --> 538.58]  That's obscene.
[538.58 --> 539.92]  For five grand US.
[540.78 --> 541.32]  In FIFA.
[541.80 --> 542.32]  Like how many,
[542.38 --> 544.00]  how many like amazing
[544.00 --> 546.00]  Brazilian soccer players
[546.00 --> 546.50]  can you,
[546.58 --> 547.58]  can you buy
[547.58 --> 548.74]  to put on the same roster
[548.74 --> 550.10]  or whatever it is that you're doing
[550.10 --> 551.70]  in a month?
[551.82 --> 552.64]  FIFA coins
[552.64 --> 553.96]  and FIFA packs.
[554.44 --> 556.26]  FIFA points to open packs
[556.26 --> 557.34]  to get players
[557.34 --> 558.30]  for building your own team.
[558.48 --> 559.46]  You don't get all the players
[559.46 --> 560.34]  when you buy the game?
[562.02 --> 563.80]  And how much do players cost?
[563.88 --> 564.20]  What?
[564.30 --> 564.78]  Okay, hold on.
[564.86 --> 565.66]  Let's, let's, let's get on,
[565.70 --> 566.82]  let's get on this Twitter blitz.
[566.86 --> 567.72]  Let's get on this Twitter blitz.
[567.80 --> 568.00]  We gotta,
[568.00 --> 568.68]  we gotta make this,
[568.72 --> 569.60]  gotta make this happen thing.
[569.66 --> 569.82]  Okay.
[570.68 --> 572.30]  Gotta make this happen thing?
[572.82 --> 573.30]  It's cool.
[573.38 --> 573.82]  It's fine.
[573.82 --> 574.36]  What are we even talking about?
[574.36 --> 575.38]  We're a professional show.
[575.90 --> 576.24]  Okay.
[576.38 --> 576.72]  It's okay.
[576.74 --> 577.28]  We're a professional show
[577.28 --> 578.50]  that doesn't have their Twitter blitz.
[578.88 --> 579.60]  Put it there.
[580.88 --> 581.74]  Well, let's put it here.
[581.84 --> 582.98]  Apparently you run the show anyway.
[584.34 --> 585.14]  Give me a Wilson.
[586.22 --> 587.30]  That sounds dirty.
[587.52 --> 588.28]  Wow, it does actually.
[588.62 --> 589.46]  I meant like from.
[589.46 --> 590.38]  Give me a Wilson.
[592.80 --> 594.00]  Give me a rusty Wilson.
[594.00 --> 594.44]  Okay.
[594.66 --> 597.48]  So Jack McLaughlin helpfully says packs.
[597.68 --> 598.16]  Thank you.
[598.26 --> 598.66]  Thank you.
[598.78 --> 600.06]  Six packs, eight packs.
[600.74 --> 602.92]  About 115 FUT packs.
[603.24 --> 604.28]  Different game type.
[604.44 --> 605.42]  FIFA ultimate team.
[605.58 --> 605.90]  Okay.
[606.54 --> 606.94]  All right.
[607.04 --> 608.12]  Ultimate team packs.
[608.26 --> 609.22]  Huge on YouTube.
[609.52 --> 610.60]  A couple dollars a pack.
[610.80 --> 611.18]  Okay.
[611.64 --> 612.56]  Coins and packs.
[612.98 --> 613.42]  IMO.
[613.60 --> 614.30]  It's pretty awful.
[614.52 --> 615.92]  $5,000 bill is stupid.
[616.08 --> 616.64]  FIFA sucks.
[616.74 --> 617.52]  CSGO for life.
[617.52 --> 618.00]  Thank you.
[618.06 --> 618.46]  Ayush.
[619.90 --> 620.86]  Or cowbell.
[621.10 --> 623.26]  Now I remember why we don't do as many Twitter blitzes.
[623.70 --> 624.76]  Lots and lots of packs.
[624.84 --> 625.20]  There you go.
[625.32 --> 625.44]  Okay.
[625.56 --> 627.30]  So what is FUA?
[627.50 --> 628.72]  What is FIFA ultimate team?
[628.82 --> 629.64]  Coins for packs.
[629.78 --> 630.50]  Coins for packs.
[630.66 --> 632.54]  Pokemon cards for your online team.
[633.06 --> 634.86]  Billions and billions of FIFA coins.
[634.86 --> 650.22]  So at what point is Microsoft or EA somewhat responsible for building in prompts that are all like, yo, are you sure?
[651.98 --> 653.90]  At what point are they responsible?
[654.32 --> 656.94]  Because I mean, you look at, okay, look at, look at NBC.
[657.12 --> 657.28]  Okay.
[657.32 --> 658.50]  In BC, Canada anyway.
[659.84 --> 664.22]  Like do microtransactions need to get gambling style laws because they're too easy to purchase?
[664.22 --> 678.32]  The lottery, the lottery, the BC lottery association or whatever that organization is called is required to spend a given amount of their earnings on gambling addiction awareness campaigning.
[678.80 --> 687.72]  At what point is Microsoft or EA required to step in and do something about this?
[687.72 --> 696.58]  Because going back to this story, Microsoft basically said that there's a setting that prevents minors from making purchases without parents' permission.
[697.20 --> 700.18]  Xbox responded, said they would look into it.
[700.18 --> 710.24]  And the credit card company basically said that unless Lance charges his son with fraud, there is nothing they can do.
[710.40 --> 711.58]  He will have to pay the bill.
[711.74 --> 716.18]  To be completely fair, I hate credit card companies just as much as everyone else.
[716.28 --> 718.02]  But the credit card company here is totally right.
[718.76 --> 719.14]  Yep.
[720.00 --> 721.34]  They didn't do anything wrong.
[721.84 --> 722.20]  Yep.
[722.38 --> 723.72]  They facilitated the payments.
[723.82 --> 724.82]  That has nothing to do with them.
[725.22 --> 726.44]  They did a good job.
[726.44 --> 726.96]  Probably.
[727.22 --> 729.66]  Maybe your limit shouldn't be that high.
[730.40 --> 731.34]  On something that you're...
[731.34 --> 731.90]  Actually, you know what?
[731.92 --> 736.92]  That's a very good point because I have had a credit card since I was 16.
[737.84 --> 738.28]  16?
[738.66 --> 739.10]  15.
[739.46 --> 740.42]  15 or 16.
[740.88 --> 741.54]  Pretty early on.
[741.64 --> 743.02]  As young as you can be.
[743.02 --> 748.58]  My credit card limit until I was in my early 20s was $500.
[749.14 --> 749.62]  Yeah, me too.
[749.84 --> 750.54]  By choice.
[750.98 --> 751.22]  Me too.
[751.22 --> 752.54]  Not because I couldn't get a bigger limit.
[752.64 --> 759.54]  Not because, you know, TD Visa didn't call me and be like, hey, kid, would you like a bigger credit card limit?
[760.22 --> 760.66]  Yeehaw!
[761.60 --> 762.40]  That happened.
[762.82 --> 763.74]  But I was like, no.
[764.00 --> 768.44]  Because I need to learn how to use a credit card responsibly, which means...
[769.32 --> 770.44]  Part of my thing was like, even...
[771.00 --> 774.76]  Like, I know credit cards are actually pretty good at getting your money back if there was fraud.
[774.96 --> 778.72]  But I was like, even if it does happen, I just don't want to deal with something that's high of a bill.
[778.90 --> 779.04]  Yep.
[779.26 --> 780.76]  And I am not going to buy...
[780.76 --> 784.08]  This is for like, buying small things online.
[784.18 --> 785.40]  That was the only reason why I had mine.
[785.62 --> 785.76]  Yep.
[785.76 --> 788.54]  I immediately locked it up and just knew the number and was like, okay.
[788.54 --> 794.78]  And I mean, here's a little thing that people don't know is that you can preload your credit card.
[794.92 --> 796.88]  If you have a $500 limit on your credit card.
[796.94 --> 801.28]  Because like, I would build computers for people all the time when I was in high school, early university.
[801.80 --> 803.88]  And what I would do is I would take...
[803.88 --> 809.46]  I would either collect money from them ahead of time or I would take from my checking account if I was expecting payment after the fact.
[809.60 --> 812.98]  And I would just load into my credit card.
[813.06 --> 814.08]  Then you could spend more than your limit.
[814.10 --> 814.98]  Which doesn't cost you anything.
[814.98 --> 821.04]  And then I believe the way that it worked back then anyway is you would have to do multiple $500 transactions.
[821.50 --> 823.72]  But you could do them back to back to back.
[823.92 --> 827.52]  And if the sales rep is nice and patient with you, that's no big deal.
[827.60 --> 830.30]  If you're going into a store to buy some computer hardware or whatever else.
[831.72 --> 832.66]  It ain't rocket surgery.
[833.10 --> 833.60]  And same thing.
[833.68 --> 839.68]  Like, if you have a PayPal account that's tied to your credit card, you can use your credit card's overloadedness to overload into PayPal.
[839.68 --> 844.84]  Like, there are ways to work around it if you don't trust yourself, which I wasn't ready to do yet.
[844.98 --> 849.40]  And that's self-awareness and logic that's not, like, being weak.
[849.54 --> 851.66]  I've got people saying, I refuse to get a credit card.
[851.76 --> 853.58]  I don't like the idea of spending more than I have.
[853.90 --> 855.52]  Then don't spend more than you have.
[856.34 --> 857.00]  Like, I'll...
[857.00 --> 858.80]  Here, I'm going to be completely up front with you guys.
[858.90 --> 865.76]  I have multiple credit cards, personally and through the business, that have limits in the ranges of tens of thousands of dollars each.
[865.92 --> 867.22]  Business cards need that.
[867.22 --> 871.98]  Do you want to know how much balance I have ever carried over in my life?
[872.36 --> 873.50]  For me, personally, zero.
[874.44 --> 874.76]  Yeah.
[875.26 --> 875.58]  Nothing.
[876.04 --> 876.36]  Yeah.
[876.64 --> 877.08]  Because...
[877.08 --> 881.18]  I use it as an enabler in order to buy things that I wouldn't be able to with traditional methods.
[881.38 --> 882.52]  Like, say, things online.
[882.56 --> 883.32]  And for rewards.
[883.72 --> 884.40]  And for rewards.
[884.52 --> 885.78]  The rewards are the bomb.
[886.12 --> 887.48]  Getting that cash back check.
[887.56 --> 888.06]  Hey, free...
[888.06 --> 888.72]  Costco cards.
[888.86 --> 889.48]  Free money.
[889.76 --> 890.76]  Are really good.
[890.76 --> 892.48]  And we're talking...
[892.48 --> 896.02]  I'm not advocating for, like, use your credit card for everything.
[896.18 --> 897.18]  I personally do.
[897.38 --> 897.62]  I do.
[897.62 --> 898.76]  Because I'm responsible.
[899.42 --> 902.52]  But the thing, too, though, is that you have to be responsible.
[902.70 --> 903.78]  Log into your bank account.
[903.88 --> 904.08]  Okay?
[904.34 --> 905.42]  I find it easier...
[905.42 --> 907.04]  I know I'm lazy about tracking things.
[907.10 --> 908.88]  I find it easier to track my debit card.
[908.96 --> 909.12]  Okay.
[909.12 --> 913.46]  So I don't use my credit card for as much as I probably should in order to get the rewards.
[913.46 --> 916.92]  But I see the ability to track it better as worth it.
[917.16 --> 918.28]  So if you're willing to...
[918.28 --> 921.18]  See, for me, I actually use my credit card for everything.
[921.52 --> 921.68]  Yeah.
[921.72 --> 923.30]  So I'm still only tracking one statement.
[925.30 --> 926.62]  Mine is still through my bank?
[927.28 --> 927.80]  I'm gonna get...
[927.80 --> 928.58]  Your bank is the ghetto.
[929.08 --> 929.98]  Your bank is the ghetto.
[930.08 --> 931.06]  We've had this conversation.
[931.68 --> 933.34]  You can't live track purchases.
[933.50 --> 934.04]  All of...
[934.04 --> 936.42]  They come in later.
[937.64 --> 939.56]  Sometimes up to, like, a week down the line.
[939.58 --> 940.44]  I hate you.
[943.64 --> 944.84]  It's so bad.
[944.84 --> 951.28]  Basically, I just have to, like, estimate what it's gonna be and then figure out what my bill is at the end of the month.
[951.32 --> 953.08]  And I'm like, all right, that's pretty much what I was expecting.
[953.76 --> 955.80]  Anyway, there is no...
[955.80 --> 956.72]  And here's another thing.
[956.86 --> 961.40]  There is no reason that you can't pay your credit card bill more frequently than once a month.
[962.24 --> 962.64]  Whoa.
[963.08 --> 965.94]  And I used to do that all the time because I had a $500 limit.
[965.94 --> 974.00]  So I'd spend $450 of cash that I had and then I would go pay it so that I'd be back up to my limit so I could use my credit card to get my rewards.
[974.08 --> 975.78]  I mean, we're talking grade four math here.
[976.34 --> 976.56]  Okay?
[977.02 --> 982.46]  Like, we're talking addition that you don't even have to do because screw grade four.
[982.54 --> 983.88]  We got calculators for that shit.
[984.54 --> 987.04]  Like, it is not a big deal.
[987.04 --> 989.98]  You just have to be cognizant of what you're doing.
[990.12 --> 991.20]  And it's really funny...
[991.20 --> 992.24]  I don't see a credit card.
[992.42 --> 994.58]  Like, I basically remove the credit from the thing.
[994.66 --> 996.22]  I don't use it for credit, really.
[996.38 --> 996.58]  Right.
[996.84 --> 998.82]  I just use it to enable online purchases.
[999.30 --> 1000.12]  Tell me this.
[1001.18 --> 1003.64]  What burns a hole in your pocket more?
[1004.42 --> 1006.76]  A credit card or cash?
[1008.86 --> 1012.60]  Actually, I want to straw poll this, too, because I want to talk about this.
[1012.94 --> 1013.70]  Cash, probably.
[1013.70 --> 1018.96]  Um, what's easier to overspend?
[1019.60 --> 1020.48]  Credit card?
[1020.86 --> 1021.64]  American cash.
[1021.64 --> 1022.10]  Cash.
[1022.42 --> 1022.62]  Yeah.
[1023.04 --> 1024.30]  Not Canadian cash.
[1024.42 --> 1025.48]  American cash, yes.
[1026.24 --> 1026.64]  It all looks the same.
[1026.64 --> 1029.10]  Okay, I'm going to get you to elaborate on that because, uh...
[1029.10 --> 1029.68]  Okay, okay.
[1029.78 --> 1030.64]  Tell me about this.
[1030.74 --> 1031.72]  It all looks the same.
[1032.04 --> 1036.86]  So, the WOD, when you're in Canada, the WOD gets smaller as you run out of money.
[1037.14 --> 1040.24]  When you're in the States, sometimes the WOD gets bigger when you run out of money.
[1040.46 --> 1041.26]  That's very interesting.
[1041.26 --> 1047.16]  Because you spend five bucks with a $20 bill, and it might give you back 15 ones.
[1047.38 --> 1047.66]  Right.
[1047.78 --> 1052.76]  Or, like, one, ten, and five ones, which just massively increase the amount of bills that
[1052.76 --> 1053.02]  you have.
[1053.20 --> 1054.36]  And this is interesting, too.
[1054.46 --> 1059.58]  Like, when you have a pile of Canadian money, it's quick to look at this and go...
[1059.58 --> 1060.54]  I have X amount.
[1060.66 --> 1061.16]  Yeah, that's...
[1061.16 --> 1061.64]  Because it's color-coordinated.
[1061.66 --> 1062.52]  That's kind of worthless.
[1062.72 --> 1063.82]  There's a bunch of blue in there.
[1064.24 --> 1064.38]  Yeah.
[1064.38 --> 1066.90]  These are literally the lowest denomination bills we have.
[1067.38 --> 1068.76]  So, I'm not a baller.
[1068.76 --> 1075.10]  Yes, it looks like Monopoly money, but actually, that's fine because it's very quick and easy
[1075.10 --> 1076.06]  to figure out what you have.
[1076.08 --> 1077.94]  That's why they color-coded in Monopoly, by the way.
[1078.18 --> 1082.52]  Whereas this, I could flash that, and that could be $3, or it could be $300.
[1082.52 --> 1087.62]  I love seeing, like, super gangster videos on YouTube where they're throwing money around
[1087.62 --> 1092.60]  and then pausing and being like, that's a one, and that's a one, and that's a one, and
[1092.60 --> 1093.46]  that's $3.
[1094.10 --> 1095.96]  And nothing that you just did matters.
[1096.60 --> 1099.32]  Go to the dollar menu at McDonald's and have yourself a meal.
[1099.68 --> 1103.50]  I had someone comment on, do I have glitter in my hair?
[1104.24 --> 1105.20]  Yes, I do.
[1105.62 --> 1107.48]  Channel super fun video incoming.
[1107.76 --> 1108.10]  It's going to be awesome.
[1108.24 --> 1111.80]  I can't really tease it, but let's go to that straw poll for a minute.
[1111.80 --> 1112.98]  I want to see those results.
[1113.58 --> 1118.26]  So this is interesting, and this actually backs up my experience as well.
[1119.08 --> 1125.76]  Because I have, since the day I got a bank account, when I was, like, 11 or whatever,
[1126.00 --> 1127.28]  10, something like that.
[1127.90 --> 1133.20]  So since I was a young kid, when I first got, like, a savings account, I have always used
[1133.20 --> 1135.08]  my debit card for pretty much everything.
[1135.20 --> 1137.66]  Like, I'm, like, a plastic generation kid.
[1138.88 --> 1139.34]  Yeah, me too.
[1139.34 --> 1145.46]  And so for me, the only time I would ever take cash out would be when I had the intent
[1145.46 --> 1148.08]  to spend it at a place that only accepts cash.
[1148.16 --> 1149.76]  Like Craigslist or Richmond.
[1149.96 --> 1152.14]  Like Craigslist or, yeah, the entire city of Richmond.
[1152.14 --> 1162.22]  So for me, cash in my wallet is cash that's already been subtracted from the bank balance
[1162.22 --> 1162.72]  for me.
[1163.24 --> 1165.58]  So it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like free money.
[1165.70 --> 1166.26]  It's disposable.
[1166.46 --> 1167.28]  It's not real anymore.
[1167.28 --> 1169.54]  It feels like it's not supposed to be there.
[1169.64 --> 1171.44]  It's supposed to be in the bank or it's supposed to be with someone else.
[1171.46 --> 1172.62]  I've already written it off.
[1172.76 --> 1174.28]  I've already allocated it.
[1174.54 --> 1176.64]  It's probably not counted on your cost sheets anymore.
[1176.64 --> 1178.20]  It's probably been withdrawn from that.
[1178.20 --> 1182.28]  Exactly, because I never factor cash into my monthly balance sheet.
[1182.44 --> 1189.36]  So for me, I find cash a way bigger problem than the card because the card gives me stress.
[1189.94 --> 1192.44]  The card gives me, sorry, how much is it?
[1192.44 --> 1193.48]  You have to check something.
[1193.58 --> 1194.60]  There's some amount of unknown.
[1194.72 --> 1196.08]  There's some amount of checking about.
[1196.20 --> 1197.50]  The cash is just like, woo!
[1198.40 --> 1199.26]  No big deal!
[1199.40 --> 1200.42]  This isn't accounted for.
[1200.50 --> 1200.88]  It's fine.
[1200.88 --> 1202.68]  This doesn't change my bank balance.
[1203.26 --> 1203.42]  Woo!
[1203.98 --> 1205.30]  Vente cappuccinos for everyone.
[1205.48 --> 1210.94]  So it's interesting to see that actually more of you are having that experience than people
[1210.94 --> 1214.38]  who are like, oh, I can't handle the credit card.
[1214.54 --> 1216.62]  You know, I find that too easy to spend.
[1217.32 --> 1218.36]  Very, very interesting.
[1218.62 --> 1221.50]  I find the credit card annoying because I don't know the number off the top of my head
[1221.50 --> 1222.44]  because I don't use it that much.
[1222.92 --> 1224.92]  So if I ever buy something online, I have to look it up.
[1225.94 --> 1226.78]  That's a good point, too.
[1227.80 --> 1229.92]  PayPal is actually another one.
[1229.92 --> 1231.02]  PayPal is easy.
[1231.44 --> 1232.42]  That one click.
[1232.64 --> 1232.92]  Amazon.
[1233.58 --> 1235.14]  That one click with the saved credit card.
[1235.14 --> 1238.80]  But that's one thing that I do for my own checking and balancing kind of thing with PayPal
[1238.80 --> 1241.30]  is I check it every single time before I use it.
[1241.52 --> 1241.76]  Right.
[1242.10 --> 1244.04]  I will not buy something without checking it.
[1244.04 --> 1244.20]  Yep.
[1245.02 --> 1246.58]  I'm pretty good at checking all my stuff.
[1246.68 --> 1251.20]  Just the one thing is that it's basically impossible for me to accurately check my credit card.
[1251.56 --> 1253.56]  So I don't really like using it too much.
[1253.94 --> 1254.96]  I'm going to get a different one.
[1254.96 --> 1257.82]  There's a problem with my address and stuff, which is why I can't get a new one.
[1257.82 --> 1260.74]  Because my bank won't update my new address.
[1262.62 --> 1263.96]  So when I try to file for a new...
[1263.96 --> 1264.42]  What new address?
[1264.52 --> 1265.98]  You've lived there for like two years.
[1266.18 --> 1266.40]  I know.
[1266.90 --> 1270.92]  When I try to file for a new card, they check my previous card and they're like,
[1270.92 --> 1271.76]  Your address is wrong.
[1271.88 --> 1273.16]  I won't give you one.
[1275.88 --> 1279.00]  As your boss and as your friend.
[1280.86 --> 1281.30]  Okay.
[1281.40 --> 1284.16]  So as your friend, yo dog, get a new bank.
[1284.34 --> 1288.34]  As your boss, I am offering you a $4 a month raise.
[1288.34 --> 1292.68]  To get a new bank.
[1294.00 --> 1296.08]  And pay for your stupid bank account.
[1299.08 --> 1301.00]  Sometimes in life, you get what you pay for.
[1302.30 --> 1303.14]  And then...
[1303.14 --> 1303.46]  Okay.
[1303.52 --> 1307.90]  If Yvonne needs the backup on this offer of a $48 a year raise.
[1308.42 --> 1308.78]  Okay.
[1308.86 --> 1310.50]  Just send her this clip of the video.
[1310.62 --> 1311.38]  Just be like, no, really.
[1311.46 --> 1312.04]  Line is said.
[1312.50 --> 1312.76]  Okay.
[1312.80 --> 1313.40]  If I...
[1313.40 --> 1314.90]  But I want to see proof of performance.
[1315.74 --> 1319.92]  I want you to show me your debit card and your credit card from your new bank.
[1320.30 --> 1321.62]  That is a real bank.
[1321.96 --> 1322.28]  Okay.
[1323.24 --> 1324.16]  Oh my god.
[1324.72 --> 1325.74]  That's so beautiful.
[1325.74 --> 1326.20]  All right.
[1326.42 --> 1327.74]  So let's...
[1327.74 --> 1331.02]  This article was posted crap by who?
[1332.22 --> 1333.18]  Blippity bloopity.
[1333.46 --> 1334.34]  Someone on the forum.
[1334.74 --> 1335.62]  And it's not listed.
[1335.76 --> 1336.00]  Okay.
[1336.60 --> 1339.22]  So Oculus's Palmer Lucky thinks...
[1339.22 --> 1340.74]  Liquid cooling.
[1341.00 --> 1341.78]  Digital trends.
[1342.04 --> 1344.56]  Liquid cooling is so 2015.
[1345.14 --> 1348.94]  Uses propane for his PC gaming rig.
[1349.00 --> 1349.54]  Hold up.
[1349.68 --> 1351.34]  I want to defend Palmer here for a second.
[1351.56 --> 1353.24]  He super didn't say that at all.
[1354.38 --> 1356.64]  Nowhere anywhere was he like, oh yeah.
[1356.84 --> 1358.00]  Water cooling so 2015.
[1358.60 --> 1361.68]  He was just like, I enjoy computer hardware stuff.
[1361.72 --> 1362.94]  And I want to do something cool.
[1363.08 --> 1364.72]  And I'm going to do liquid propane rig.
[1364.78 --> 1366.10]  And it like sounds super badass.
[1366.10 --> 1370.68]  It was posted in like a short little blurb thing on Reddit during a huge Q&A where everyone
[1370.68 --> 1373.94]  was freaking out about the price and exclusivity things about Oculus.
[1374.18 --> 1374.28]  Yeah.
[1374.48 --> 1374.64]  Yeah.
[1374.64 --> 1377.60]  He was shutting down a whole bunch of those things and stuff and it was fine.
[1377.60 --> 1382.88]  So basically, the dude's just like a cool techie dude.
[1383.06 --> 1383.26]  Yeah.
[1383.40 --> 1386.26]  He's experimented with liquid nitrogen cooling in the past.
[1386.62 --> 1388.28]  It's a huge pain to work with.
[1388.28 --> 1394.06]  I actually don't know if that was a revelation from him or just something that, I mean, you
[1394.06 --> 1395.56]  know, it's really, it's really interesting.
[1395.56 --> 1404.66]  You can always tell how, how new someone is by their suggestion that, oh man, what if
[1404.66 --> 1406.62]  you did like a liquid nitrogen cooling PC?
[1407.50 --> 1408.90]  Not how it works.
[1408.90 --> 1409.58]  Okay.
[1409.74 --> 1411.20]  Liquid nitrogen to have, okay.
[1411.20 --> 1418.16]  To have, to have a liquid nitrogen cooled PC that actually recycled the liquid nitrogen
[1418.16 --> 1426.10]  and like, sort of like recondensed it or something before running it through, I don't know what
[1426.10 --> 1428.26]  kind of insulation you'd be looking at to have that.
[1428.32 --> 1430.04]  It is not a 24 seven setup.
[1430.38 --> 1432.88]  It is a suicide run benchmark setup.
[1432.98 --> 1434.06]  It is not a thing.
[1434.62 --> 1435.50]  About as.
[1435.76 --> 1436.78]  You're drag racing your computer.
[1437.02 --> 1437.44]  It's not.
[1437.76 --> 1438.04]  Yes.
[1438.18 --> 1438.42]  Yeah.
[1438.52 --> 1439.52]  You're drag racing your.
[1439.52 --> 1442.10]  You're dragging it to the track and then drag racing your computer.
[1442.24 --> 1442.40]  Yes.
[1442.40 --> 1443.32]  You don't drive it home.
[1443.46 --> 1443.58]  Yeah.
[1443.58 --> 1447.60]  That, that, that computer literally doesn't have, what was it?
[1447.66 --> 1449.72]  What was that revelation that I had recently?
[1450.48 --> 1451.78]  Um, yeah.
[1451.86 --> 1452.20]  Okay.
[1452.24 --> 1454.82]  It's, it's, it's literally, it doesn't have an alternator.
[1454.88 --> 1455.22]  Okay.
[1455.56 --> 1456.60]  To save weight.
[1457.04 --> 1459.04]  I was like, oh yeah, that makes sense.
[1459.16 --> 1460.54]  But it never occurred to me.
[1460.60 --> 1460.76]  Yeah.
[1460.78 --> 1462.54]  What would a race car need an alternator for?
[1462.58 --> 1464.84]  You start it to start and then that, that's it.
[1464.86 --> 1466.44]  You go, you don't recharge the battery.
[1466.44 --> 1467.10]  What are you doing?
[1467.20 --> 1468.94]  Wasting power off the drive, Ryan.
[1469.66 --> 1473.44]  Um, so, so anyway, liquid nitrogen not affect.
[1473.58 --> 1480.46]  About as hardcore as it gets is phase change with some people going as far as to run like
[1480.46 --> 1486.00]  cascading phase change systems where you've got a phase that cools a phase that cools another
[1486.00 --> 1487.62]  phase that cools the CPU.
[1487.94 --> 1493.48]  So he's not even actually getting that hardcore, but he's working on a project that would have
[1493.48 --> 1497.98]  a small, powerful PC with no heat sinks and fans that would be cooled by liquid propane.
[1498.08 --> 1502.74]  This is totally different, totally hardcore in a very different way.
[1502.74 --> 1507.08]  So by, by not that hardcore, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not that cool.
[1507.56 --> 1507.88]  Not all right.
[1507.88 --> 1508.12]  Okay.
[1508.12 --> 1508.74]  It's very cool.
[1508.86 --> 1509.86]  It's not that cold.
[1510.06 --> 1510.46]  Yeah.
[1510.58 --> 1516.72]  There are cascaded systems that can get a CPU under load down to like nearing triple digits.
[1516.72 --> 1519.46]  We're talking really, really cold.
[1520.06 --> 1525.96]  This is not even that practical because like you could actually run a system like that 24
[1525.96 --> 1526.28]  seven.
[1526.40 --> 1530.64]  If you were willing to put up with the noise, this is kind of like the way that we did our
[1530.64 --> 1536.44]  mineral oil PC system where we submerged it in mineral oil for like not even better performance.
[1536.54 --> 1539.68]  Water cooling is literally better than mineral oil in every possible way.
[1539.76 --> 1541.74]  Maintenance, time to set up, cooling performance.
[1541.74 --> 1544.74]  This is just a cool project.
[1545.68 --> 1546.64]  Super badass.
[1546.78 --> 1547.60]  Super BA.
[1548.02 --> 1549.16]  Just want to put that out there.
[1549.18 --> 1549.34]  Yeah.
[1549.46 --> 1551.60]  So do you want to explain a little bit about how it works then?
[1551.74 --> 1554.62]  It's cool, but liquid propane, like he said, it's boiled into, okay.
[1554.84 --> 1559.36]  When we say boiled, the boiling point for propane is negative 42 degrees.
[1559.36 --> 1560.24]  Not a hundred degrees.
[1560.62 --> 1560.86]  Yeah.
[1560.86 --> 1566.64]  So it boils like at a really low temperature, just to be clear.
[1567.08 --> 1570.52]  It's boiled into gaseous propane in an expansion block.
[1570.68 --> 1575.74]  It can compress back into a tank under really high pressure if you wanted to, or it can vent
[1575.74 --> 1579.58]  out of a burner nozzle for super cooling to sub-zero temperatures.
[1579.74 --> 1584.48]  If he had more time, he says that he would vent the propane to a small turbine generator,
[1584.58 --> 1588.60]  which we hooked up to the power supply, which is actually pretty freaking cool.
[1588.60 --> 1593.46]  But he can't justify that kind of work right now, which kind of totally makes sense.
[1593.46 --> 1595.00]  Because he's busy building the rift.
[1595.28 --> 1595.58]  Yeah.
[1596.22 --> 1597.50]  Which is kind of sick.
[1598.52 --> 1600.66]  That's negative 42 degrees Celsius.
[1600.90 --> 1607.18]  One thing that I hate about Palmer and Musk is that they can both do multiple things that
[1607.18 --> 1608.52]  are way cooler than what I'm doing.
[1609.94 --> 1613.42]  It's like, oh, I want to do a single thing that's that cool.
[1614.50 --> 1616.34]  We do stuff that's pretty cool.
[1616.34 --> 1618.64]  I built the mineral oil rig.
[1619.42 --> 1621.60]  He's doing a liquid propane rig.
[1622.20 --> 1623.86]  Way to up me, guy.
[1624.40 --> 1625.62]  Yeah, that's true.
[1625.74 --> 1628.60]  We could contact 3M about that other material.
[1628.76 --> 1629.84]  Do you remember what that stuff's called?
[1629.98 --> 1630.12]  Yeah.
[1630.12 --> 1630.62]  We could do cool things.
[1630.62 --> 1631.54]  Well, I don't remember the name of it.
[1631.54 --> 1635.16]  We built 7Gamers1CPU, which was technically me and not you, but you know.
[1635.32 --> 1635.86]  You're a dick.
[1639.34 --> 1640.92]  The Fallout rig was cool.
[1641.18 --> 1643.64]  Well, LimeTech kind of had a lot to do with that.
[1643.64 --> 1644.96]  That's true, actually.
[1645.10 --> 1646.44]  Without LimeTech's help.
[1646.56 --> 1647.12]  Sorry, Taryn.
[1647.46 --> 1652.14]  Without LimeTech's help, that rig would not have been a thing, but you know.
[1652.92 --> 1656.74]  I was talking to John, who I think has a minor in chemistry.
[1656.86 --> 1657.12]  Were you?
[1657.56 --> 1658.26]  No, this John.
[1658.74 --> 1659.36]  Oh, that John.
[1659.62 --> 1659.90]  Really?
[1660.08 --> 1661.04]  He has a minor in chemistry?
[1661.04 --> 1661.58]  I think so.
[1662.82 --> 1663.26]  John?
[1663.60 --> 1664.84]  I don't want to yell too loud.
[1665.08 --> 1665.24]  Yeah.
[1665.24 --> 1666.74]  Sorry, guys.
[1666.82 --> 1667.44]  I won't.
[1667.56 --> 1668.28]  Hey, John!
[1669.60 --> 1670.24]  There he is.
[1670.90 --> 1672.02]  That was really fast.
[1672.64 --> 1673.58]  Do you have a minor in chemistry?
[1674.04 --> 1674.34]  Yes.
[1674.58 --> 1674.80]  Yeah.
[1675.36 --> 1676.28]  Are you cooking meth?
[1677.44 --> 1678.92]  This is a loaded question, isn't it?
[1679.02 --> 1680.04]  I'm just going to be that's a joke.
[1681.18 --> 1681.54]  Okay.
[1681.80 --> 1682.28]  See you later.
[1683.46 --> 1686.24]  So, I've been talking to him, and we might try to...
[1686.90 --> 1687.22]  John.
[1687.22 --> 1688.66]  Oh, it was John, not Yvonne.
[1688.72 --> 1689.06]  You're good.
[1689.20 --> 1690.56]  There are too many people that work here now.
[1690.56 --> 1691.20]  I know.
[1691.54 --> 1691.76]  You can't.
[1691.76 --> 1691.92]  I know.
[1692.58 --> 1694.00]  You can be like, Nick?
[1694.24 --> 1695.26]  And I'm like, whoop, whoop.
[1696.52 --> 1698.34]  Anyways, John has a minor in chemistry.
[1698.44 --> 1699.00]  I've been talking to him.
[1699.06 --> 1701.04]  We might try to do some cool stuff with some things.
[1701.18 --> 1702.72]  That's literally all I'm going to say right now.
[1702.74 --> 1703.04]  All right.
[1703.06 --> 1703.80]  Cool stuff with some things.
[1703.88 --> 1704.42]  I'm into that.
[1704.50 --> 1705.68]  I'm into cool stuff with things.
[1706.04 --> 1706.32]  Yeah.
[1706.46 --> 1707.30]  Does it involve the butt?
[1708.10 --> 1714.96]  I mean, technically, it would be part of the person who did the thing, so it involves
[1714.96 --> 1715.70]  at least one butt.
[1716.22 --> 1716.56]  Okay.
[1716.78 --> 1717.52]  I like it.
[1717.70 --> 1717.88]  Yeah.
[1717.88 --> 1719.60]  Is there a way we can involve six butts?
[1720.56 --> 1720.92]  Maybe.
[1721.16 --> 1722.04]  One at a time is okay.
[1722.04 --> 1723.08]  I can work on...
[1723.08 --> 1723.36]  Okay.
[1723.60 --> 1723.96]  Probably.
[1724.42 --> 1724.76]  Okay.
[1725.14 --> 1725.48]  Excellent.
[1726.22 --> 1728.66]  Speaking of butts, this is a pretty butt idea.
[1728.82 --> 1731.04]  This was posted by Section 35 on the forum.
[1731.14 --> 1732.48]  Original article here is from Forbes.
[1732.54 --> 1733.64]  You're going to pop that up on screen.
[1734.02 --> 1736.60]  Is it the 35th section of the butt?
[1736.74 --> 1737.60]  I'm contingent...
[1737.60 --> 1737.94]  What?
[1738.74 --> 1740.34]  It was posted by Section 35.
[1740.62 --> 1741.02]  All right.
[1741.02 --> 1741.12]  What?
[1741.62 --> 1743.64]  Posted by Gordon Kelly on Forbes.
[1744.12 --> 1746.04]  iPhone 7 leaks.
[1746.64 --> 1747.12]  Confirm.
[1747.30 --> 1748.84]  And this is quote unquote confirmed.
[1748.84 --> 1751.92]  In fact, it says that right on the article, except it's this kind of quote.
[1752.32 --> 1756.36]  Also, Forbes is getting up there as one of the more annoying websites to go to.
[1756.50 --> 1756.64]  Yeah.
[1756.70 --> 1757.54]  Just throwing that out there.
[1757.56 --> 1758.12]  Just putting that out there.
[1758.80 --> 1763.62]  Confirm Apple abandoning the headphone jack.
[1763.62 --> 1765.08]  I love the quote unquote confirm.
[1765.24 --> 1767.26]  I know you just said that, but like, oh my God.
[1767.30 --> 1767.86]  I love that.
[1768.76 --> 1770.06]  It's a good way to acknowledge.
[1770.24 --> 1777.66]  At least it's not the clickbait headline that's like, Apple gets rid of the headphone
[1777.66 --> 1777.94]  jack.
[1777.98 --> 1779.70]  And then you click the article and it's like, maybe.
[1780.06 --> 1780.30]  Yeah.
[1780.46 --> 1781.80]  According to like some dude.
[1782.14 --> 1782.40]  Yeah.
[1782.40 --> 1784.78]  Like the Vive pricing thing.
[1784.98 --> 1786.50]  I know this was a rejected topic.
[1786.64 --> 1787.82]  I'm just going to bounce here real quick.
[1787.82 --> 1787.90]  Okay.
[1787.96 --> 1788.68]  No, let's talk about it.
[1788.70 --> 1788.84]  Okay.
[1788.90 --> 1789.96]  We're jumping off the rails.
[1790.04 --> 1791.64]  We're going to get back to the iPhone 7 leak.
[1792.48 --> 1793.12]  Hit that.
[1793.18 --> 1793.78]  Hit that topic.
[1793.78 --> 1797.54]  This isn't a video that's coming soon to YouTube and is already on Vessel.
[1797.54 --> 1803.14]  I barely touched on it and the overarching thing of the whole thingy, but a bunch of
[1803.14 --> 1807.50]  sites recently have reported thing of the whole thingy, a bunch of sites recently have
[1807.50 --> 1810.70]  reported on the Vive being $1,500.
[1812.62 --> 1818.22]  And they've been kind of losing their source as it's been kind of trickling down the line.
[1818.30 --> 1822.78]  If you go all the way back, which took me a surprising amount of time.
[1822.94 --> 1824.98]  All the way into the butt of the source.
[1824.98 --> 1832.02]  It ends up on a Taiwanese website, which is just saying that like, I think the exact
[1832.02 --> 1838.38]  translated quote was like foreign financial investigators or analysts or something.
[1838.52 --> 1840.66]  So like, nope.
[1841.02 --> 1841.66]  Some guy.
[1841.80 --> 1842.22]  Yeah.
[1842.50 --> 1843.00]  Says.
[1843.18 --> 1851.68]  Some guy said to some guy, maybe if that even happened in Taiwan, that it's maybe $1,500
[1851.68 --> 1853.48]  because he's speculating.
[1853.48 --> 1857.82]  And then everyone else was like, oh my God, Vive, $1,500.
[1858.84 --> 1860.84]  The whole internet freaked out.
[1861.10 --> 1862.04]  Oh my God.
[1862.64 --> 1863.64]  It might be $1,500.
[1864.24 --> 1865.28]  I'm betting no.
[1865.54 --> 1867.24]  I'm betting on no as well.
[1867.56 --> 1870.90]  I'm betting on no because I really have to, because I want one.
[1871.02 --> 1874.62]  I'm actually kind of on the, I'm kind of on the Vive bandwagon right now.
[1874.62 --> 1876.56]  From CES, that's actually super fair.
[1876.88 --> 1877.20]  Yeah.
[1877.36 --> 1879.84]  From before CES, I would think you were crazy.
[1880.28 --> 1880.54]  Yeah.
[1881.00 --> 1883.48]  But like Vive at CES is a pretty.
[1883.48 --> 1884.78]  Really stepped their game up.
[1884.80 --> 1886.26]  Pretty badass piece of kit.
[1886.38 --> 1887.48]  I could paint for days.
[1888.46 --> 1888.48]  Like.
[1888.58 --> 1889.16]  No, seriously.
[1889.34 --> 1889.58]  Yeah.
[1890.14 --> 1890.50]  Crap.
[1890.56 --> 1891.08]  What is it called?
[1891.16 --> 1892.40]  I don't remember, but it's awesome.
[1893.06 --> 1893.76]  Something Brush.
[1893.80 --> 1895.04]  I don't care, but I'm going to buy it.
[1895.14 --> 1895.98]  Art Brush or something?
[1897.08 --> 1897.80]  Wicked demo.
[1898.54 --> 1899.26]  Oh man.
[1899.32 --> 1901.46]  And like, I know they already had it for the original one.
[1901.64 --> 1902.00]  I know.
[1902.12 --> 1903.62]  But it's a totally different ball game now.
[1903.68 --> 1905.52]  The screen is way better.
[1905.86 --> 1908.14]  The tracking on everything is astronomically better than it used to be.
[1908.14 --> 1909.30]  Yvonne didn't get sick.
[1909.96 --> 1910.30]  Yeah.
[1910.56 --> 1911.22]  On the Vive.
[1911.38 --> 1911.64]  Yeah.
[1911.90 --> 1913.54]  She gets sick on everything.
[1913.84 --> 1914.04]  Yeah.
[1914.14 --> 1915.42]  She gets sick on boats.
[1915.72 --> 1917.66]  I mean, it's like she gets such like.
[1918.64 --> 1919.00]  Everything.
[1919.12 --> 1920.20]  Gets sick playing Portal.
[1920.54 --> 1920.80]  Yeah.
[1920.94 --> 1921.80]  On a flat screen.
[1921.96 --> 1922.16]  Yeah.
[1922.26 --> 1922.80]  In front of her.
[1922.90 --> 1923.46]  No big deal.
[1923.64 --> 1925.62]  It's gotten way better.
[1925.82 --> 1926.50]  Like completely.
[1926.68 --> 1928.72]  When I saw it, I was like, what?
[1929.10 --> 1930.06]  Because it looked totally different.
[1930.12 --> 1931.02]  There's a camera on the front and stuff.
[1931.30 --> 1932.82]  Did I tell you what the camera on the front does?
[1932.96 --> 1933.16]  No.
[1933.58 --> 1933.86]  Okay.
[1934.04 --> 1937.00]  Yes, but I'm saying no so that you'll explain it for the purposes of the show.
[1937.18 --> 1941.24]  Again, this is coming out in the video on YouTube next Thursday, I think.
[1941.24 --> 1943.12]  It's already on Vessel as of yesterday.
[1943.30 --> 1944.92]  It was a little bit rushed, but I think it's good.
[1946.06 --> 1948.04]  There's a camera on the front of the Vive now.
[1948.10 --> 1952.36]  I made a joke, which I'm hoping everyone realizes is a joke because there's something in front of me.
[1952.42 --> 1955.60]  So you can't see my face making the joke, which is a little bit worrisome, but it's fine.
[1956.12 --> 1958.30]  That no one told HCC that it wasn't a phone.
[1959.18 --> 1960.60]  So they put a camera on the front.
[1961.10 --> 1961.40]  Anyways.
[1961.82 --> 1964.62]  As long as they didn't put a camera on the inside for like VR selfies.
[1965.48 --> 1966.94]  That might eventually be coming.
[1967.04 --> 1968.72]  Not for VR selfies, but for eye tracking.
[1969.24 --> 1969.56]  Okay.
[1969.90 --> 1970.14]  Yeah.
[1970.14 --> 1972.20]  It's not a thing yet, but maybe eventually.
[1972.86 --> 1975.54]  But the camera on the front is for a couple things.
[1976.42 --> 1978.76]  One is what people are calling the cat detection system.
[1979.34 --> 1982.14]  And I don't remember the actual more proper name for the whole system, but whatever.
[1982.24 --> 1982.70]  Don't worry about that.
[1982.76 --> 1983.22]  It's in the video.
[1983.32 --> 1983.68]  Check it out.
[1984.32 --> 1990.10]  What it does is it, you know how before it would set the boundaries and give you blue outlined walls for where the walls were?
[1990.10 --> 1990.38]  Yeah.
[1990.38 --> 1996.70]  Now those walls can be set up by you and by actual walls in the room because it can see them.
[1996.70 --> 2004.56]  And if you look at like, if you looked down here, you would see the table and all the stuff on the table, but just like blue grid versions of them.
[2004.64 --> 2004.82]  Yes.
[2004.88 --> 2005.72]  Not the actual things.
[2005.72 --> 2009.90]  And that will help you with the cat detection system, which will make it so you don't like step on your cat.
[2010.06 --> 2010.26]  Right.
[2010.38 --> 2013.46]  Which is, I didn't realize how incredibly important that it was.
[2013.46 --> 2014.44]  Until you killed a cat.
[2015.22 --> 2016.14]  Several cats.
[2016.34 --> 2020.50]  Until I realized that people aren't going to be doing this in demo rooms with people walking around.
[2020.94 --> 2021.18]  Yep.
[2021.18 --> 2026.32]  It's going to be done possibly by yourself at home and things are going to go wrong and it's going to be a problem.
[2026.58 --> 2027.78]  Much like masturbation.
[2028.94 --> 2030.38]  Except usually I think that's fine.
[2031.30 --> 2032.30]  Things can go wrong.
[2032.42 --> 2033.02]  That's fair.
[2033.40 --> 2034.86]  Especially with a VR headset on.
[2035.38 --> 2035.90]  And the butt.
[2036.18 --> 2036.88]  And the butt.
[2037.08 --> 2037.24]  Yep.
[2037.60 --> 2040.40]  So moving on to, what is this show even about?
[2041.56 --> 2042.28]  iPhone leaks.
[2043.00 --> 2043.58]  iPhone leaks.
[2043.64 --> 2044.02]  No, hold on.
[2044.06 --> 2045.28]  We'll get back to that in a minute actually.
[2045.28 --> 2049.74]  I wanted to do that Twitter blitz that I forget what it was about.
[2049.98 --> 2050.50]  There was a thing.
[2051.18 --> 2052.38]  Logs on to the WAN show.
[2052.48 --> 2054.48]  First thing Linus says, are you cooking meth?
[2054.60 --> 2056.48]  And after the ad, him talking about butts.
[2056.56 --> 2057.98]  Yes, that is this show.
[2060.46 --> 2061.86]  Novak 7000 by the way.
[2061.96 --> 2062.10]  Yes.
[2062.10 --> 2063.30]  Is that fluid that I...
[2063.30 --> 2065.22]  I love how someone knew what we were talking about.
[2065.22 --> 2065.56]  Yes.
[2066.48 --> 2067.82]  Please mention the giveaway deadline.
[2068.00 --> 2068.82]  Do you know what it is?
[2068.98 --> 2069.16]  No.
[2069.16 --> 2069.86]  For that Supermicro?
[2069.90 --> 2070.12]  Okay.
[2070.42 --> 2070.72]  I don't.
[2070.80 --> 2071.56]  Okay, we don't know.
[2071.82 --> 2073.08]  We need to contact Supermicro.
[2073.20 --> 2074.40]  They're actually the ones handling that.
[2074.46 --> 2075.68]  They'll be shipping it directly to you.
[2075.76 --> 2076.52]  We're not even touching it.
[2077.90 --> 2079.40]  Make it rain Canadian money.
[2079.66 --> 2080.40]  Cash definitely.
[2080.40 --> 2081.54]  Oh, was that it?
[2081.60 --> 2082.24]  Was it the Twitter blitz?
[2082.30 --> 2082.42]  No.
[2083.56 --> 2084.80]  Don't think so.
[2085.08 --> 2085.84]  Okay, forget it.
[2085.90 --> 2088.40]  Moving on to the iPhone 7 leaks.
[2089.60 --> 2091.92]  So, basically here's where we're at.
[2092.72 --> 2098.66]  There's a pair of sources within Apple's Chinese supply chain that have independently confirmed
[2098.66 --> 2104.00]  confirmed that Apple will ditch the headphone jack from the iPhone 7.
[2104.00 --> 2105.64]  Can we say independently claimed?
[2106.18 --> 2106.50]  Yeah.
[2106.62 --> 2107.66]  That's probably more accurate.
[2108.60 --> 2109.50]  I'm not even saying...
[2109.50 --> 2109.88]  Nope.
[2110.00 --> 2110.50]  You're right.
[2110.50 --> 2112.24]  Has there been rumors about this since forever?
[2112.64 --> 2113.04]  Yeah.
[2113.18 --> 2113.88]  I'm pretty sure...
[2113.88 --> 2114.86]  Like, this is probably happening.
[2115.02 --> 2116.86]  I think going back to the 5 or the 5S.
[2117.08 --> 2117.36]  Yeah.
[2117.36 --> 2124.44]  It was rumored that Apple would completely lose their mind and take away the headphone jack
[2124.44 --> 2128.96]  all in the name of making the device slimmer, something that literally no one has asked for,
[2129.02 --> 2134.10]  and even Apple with the camel hump battery pack has acknowledged is not necessarily the
[2134.10 --> 2134.66]  right answer.
[2134.66 --> 2135.06]  Yeah.
[2135.60 --> 2136.04]  Yeah.
[2136.20 --> 2138.36]  So, like, I'm not saying it's...
[2138.36 --> 2138.94]  It's just...
[2138.94 --> 2139.46]  It's a claim.
[2139.72 --> 2140.34]  It's a claim.
[2140.34 --> 2146.34]  So, the expectation, and honestly, like, this...
[2147.26 --> 2152.38]  More than the Beats music service, which is what a lot of folks speculated the Beats
[2152.38 --> 2156.74]  acquisition was all about, this might explain the Beats acquisition.
[2157.48 --> 2163.30]  The last couple generations of products from Beats have been markedly better than the earlier
[2163.30 --> 2167.36]  ones, which, if you're being honest with yourself, if you own one of them, I'm sorry you paid
[2167.36 --> 2168.44]  so many hundreds of dollars for it.
[2168.46 --> 2169.56]  It's a piece of garbage.
[2170.16 --> 2171.30]  Complete piece of garbage.
[2171.90 --> 2179.36]  Newer ones, actually, even considered by experts within the audiophile community, which is about,
[2179.36 --> 2185.04]  like, having a, you know, like, a card in your wallet that says, I'm a cool dude, but
[2185.04 --> 2186.64]  take it for what it is.
[2186.76 --> 2191.48]  Experts within the audiophile community acknowledge as being actually pretty good.
[2191.48 --> 2191.52]  Okay.
[2192.52 --> 2194.44]  But the cable is so danceable.
[2194.58 --> 2195.06]  But the cable...
[2195.06 --> 2196.14]  Yeah, I know, danceable cables.
[2196.30 --> 2196.58]  I know.
[2196.98 --> 2204.12]  Anyway, so this could explain it, because how was Apple going to get support from a major
[2204.12 --> 2208.98]  headphone manufacturer to move away from the 3.5mm jack?
[2209.08 --> 2212.16]  I mean, Apple has asked for leaps of faith before, okay?
[2212.32 --> 2217.68]  Wire up your 3.5mm jack so that it works with our volume control and not someone else's, but
[2217.68 --> 2221.62]  still, you know, carries sound, regardless of the phone that you're using.
[2222.08 --> 2225.36]  How was Apple going to convince someone to make this leap?
[2225.70 --> 2232.64]  Put a lightning connector on your pair of headphones unless they just ran out and acquired the
[2232.64 --> 2237.60]  number one largest market share headphone maker in the United States, which, by the way,
[2237.68 --> 2240.02]  Beats, last time I checked, was.
[2243.10 --> 2243.50]  Yeah.
[2243.74 --> 2245.08]  I mean, it makes sense.
[2245.54 --> 2249.88]  I am surprised that it would be that big of a jump, because I think...
[2249.88 --> 2251.02]  Wouldn't you just be able to make an adapter?
[2252.20 --> 2252.60]  Yeah.
[2252.60 --> 2254.26]  I guess you could make an adapter.
[2254.28 --> 2256.14]  Maybe it's an expensive adapter.
[2256.24 --> 2257.58]  But it's probably an expensive adapter.
[2257.60 --> 2259.74]  That is going to throw it out of price ranges and no one's going to want to make.
[2259.88 --> 2260.28]  I don't know.
[2260.94 --> 2266.76]  Then again, people paid $300 for Beats by Dre back in the day, so...
[2266.76 --> 2267.90]  Anyway.
[2268.94 --> 2269.22]  Yeah.
[2269.34 --> 2271.08]  So the move is apparently...
[2271.08 --> 2273.02]  Again, this is all speculation at this point.
[2273.48 --> 2278.54]  To help Apple engineer thinner new models, as well as drive users towards wireless headphones
[2278.54 --> 2280.04]  as well, which...
[2280.04 --> 2282.78]  Wireless headphones are really...
[2282.78 --> 2284.48]  I don't want wireless headphones.
[2285.04 --> 2285.48]  Yeah.
[2285.82 --> 2287.02]  I don't want a thinner phone.
[2288.12 --> 2288.34]  No.
[2288.34 --> 2290.44]  I literally don't want any of this stuff.
[2290.78 --> 2292.10]  I don't like wireless headphones.
[2292.66 --> 2293.28]  I mean, there...
[2293.28 --> 2294.06]  I don't want a thinner phone.
[2294.12 --> 2298.06]  There are decent wireless headphones out there.
[2298.08 --> 2299.16]  Then they're going to drain my battery.
[2299.42 --> 2301.04]  And I might have to disconnect my watch.
[2301.04 --> 2304.04]  You'll have to deal with batteries, and you'll have to...
[2304.04 --> 2304.56]  Yeah.
[2304.80 --> 2306.04]  So, um...
[2306.84 --> 2307.14]  Hmm.
[2307.14 --> 2309.60]  So, again, more rumors.
[2309.76 --> 2313.84]  Apple will introduce audio output profiles to compensate for the loss of the headphone
[2313.84 --> 2314.38]  jack.
[2314.96 --> 2315.32]  Um...
[2315.32 --> 2319.34]  So we'll set the iPhone 7 to switch between different wired and wireless output profiles
[2319.34 --> 2320.42]  depending on the scenario.
[2321.26 --> 2323.18]  And I guess...
[2323.18 --> 2323.40]  Yeah.
[2323.46 --> 2324.08]  What is there...
[2324.08 --> 2325.56]  What else is there to really...
[2325.56 --> 2327.02]  To really say about this?
[2327.04 --> 2327.64]  We'll wait and see.
[2328.14 --> 2328.46]  Yeah.
[2328.74 --> 2329.80]  We'll have to wait and see.
[2330.32 --> 2331.32]  Um...
[2331.32 --> 2334.08]  It's probably not a million years till the 7 comes out.
[2334.08 --> 2335.08]  I mean...
[2335.08 --> 2335.86]  I get...
[2335.86 --> 2336.50]  Like the...
[2336.50 --> 2338.52]  The very big picture.
[2338.78 --> 2340.20]  Like the huge picture.
[2340.28 --> 2347.32]  There was actually a rumor this week that Apple was, because of regulatory pressure, working
[2347.32 --> 2351.84]  on a tool to help users migrate from iOS to Android.
[2352.96 --> 2353.52]  Um...
[2353.52 --> 2354.92]  This kind of ties into that.
[2355.20 --> 2357.22]  Which Apple denied outright.
[2357.46 --> 2361.34]  They said, actually, we're working on getting users to migrate from Android to iOS.
[2361.34 --> 2362.32]  And it's going great.
[2362.32 --> 2363.32]  Um...
[2363.32 --> 2365.66]  This to me...
[2365.66 --> 2365.84]  Like...
[2365.84 --> 2366.78]  So Apple's...
[2366.78 --> 2371.10]  So Apple's philosophy where it's more...
[2371.10 --> 2374.90]  It's all about making it more difficult to get out of their ecosystem.
[2375.08 --> 2376.46]  The apps you've invested in.
[2376.54 --> 2378.12]  The accessories you've invested in.
[2378.24 --> 2379.10]  All these things.
[2379.10 --> 2384.80]  If Apple can snag you for a longer term purchase...
[2384.80 --> 2386.08]  Like a headset.
[2386.08 --> 2388.10]  A big ticket purchase.
[2388.44 --> 2393.60]  Then they have effectively locked you into their ecosystem in a way that they actually
[2393.60 --> 2394.62]  couldn't before.
[2395.30 --> 2399.74]  Because even content you've purchased on iTunes, which is a great way to help lock into an ecosystem.
[2399.88 --> 2401.38]  Oh, I've got a bunch of movies I can...
[2401.38 --> 2403.44]  Or I've got a bunch of songs I can only listen to on my iPhone.
[2403.54 --> 2406.08]  Well, you can still listen to those songs on other devices.
[2406.08 --> 2406.34]  No.
[2406.68 --> 2406.84]  No.
[2406.98 --> 2408.40]  This is the ultimate.
[2408.58 --> 2408.92]  It's like...
[2408.92 --> 2410.24]  It's like NVIDIA.
[2410.64 --> 2412.12]  Locking you into buying their...
[2412.12 --> 2415.30]  Because Apple has to fight for the customer.
[2415.52 --> 2416.44]  Every generation.
[2417.18 --> 2417.46]  And they...
[2417.46 --> 2418.08]  It's like needing to buy...
[2418.60 --> 2419.62]  This is going to be terrible.
[2419.74 --> 2421.20]  And people are going to hate this analogy that I'm using.
[2421.28 --> 2425.38]  But it's like needing to buy a GeForce version of a game instead of a Radeon version of a game.
[2425.42 --> 2425.66]  Yes.
[2426.14 --> 2426.42]  Okay.
[2426.42 --> 2431.98]  So Apple probably recognized this in the iPhone 5, 5S, 5C era.
[2432.48 --> 2439.58]  Where they didn't capture the hearts and minds of the customers as well as they have more recently with the 6S.
[2440.28 --> 2446.88]  And, you know, they kind of must have thought to themselves, well, gee, we have to fight for the customer every generation.
[2446.88 --> 2455.76]  We have to keep innovating on what is effectively becoming a block of aluminum and glass that sits in your pocket and has a couple of antennas.
[2455.86 --> 2457.90]  And you make phone calls and you listen to music and watch movies on.
[2458.22 --> 2459.96]  They're becoming very commodity.
[2459.96 --> 2468.20]  So if Apple can figure out how to have something tied to it that is a separate long-term investment.
[2468.50 --> 2471.98]  The phone, people are used to upgrading every one to two to three years.
[2472.12 --> 2479.10]  But a pair of headphones, I think people believe that they should get five years out of a good quality pair of headphones.
[2479.38 --> 2485.56]  So if Apple can sell you a headphone that only really works without an awkward, weird, and or expensive adapter with their phones,
[2486.00 --> 2487.76]  then you're going to have to keep buying the Apple upgrade.
[2487.76 --> 2497.10]  It's yet another way to lock you into the ecosystem, which I personally find abhorrent because there is no practical reason to do this
[2497.10 --> 2501.36]  other than to make the phone thinner and lighter, which nobody asked for.
[2501.52 --> 2501.66]  Nope.
[2502.18 --> 2507.76]  You're not going to get a sound quality improvement unless you go and put like...
[2509.88 --> 2511.60]  No, I can't.
[2511.60 --> 2521.56]  Unless you use the data connection that is lightning to have a bigger battery-powered amp and DAC in the headphones,
[2521.66 --> 2523.42]  but then you're putting a bunch more weight on your head.
[2523.60 --> 2527.10]  Like, you could make arguments.
[2527.12 --> 2527.66]  Let's put a battery in there.
[2527.66 --> 2538.62]  And someone will come up with something that leverages the lightning connector for, you know, blah, blah, blah, bitrate, HD sound, blah, blah, blah.
[2538.62 --> 2542.36]  But this is the best way to get high-end audio file sound over the lightning connector.
[2542.36 --> 2545.22]  Did you just say this is the best way to get high into audio files?
[2545.22 --> 2546.22]  High-end audio files.
[2546.22 --> 2546.80]  Ah, okay.
[2546.92 --> 2548.24]  Because it's kind of similar.
[2548.28 --> 2548.70]  That would have.
[2549.50 --> 2550.72]  Also would have made sense.
[2550.72 --> 2553.98]  So I disagree with this move.
[2554.04 --> 2555.28]  I think it's a big load of crap.
[2555.50 --> 2558.88]  And apparently a lot of people agree with me because there are already petitions circulating.
[2559.00 --> 2559.76]  How many signatures?
[2559.82 --> 2561.38]  I think it was almost 300,000.
[2561.44 --> 2563.74]  Like, really close to 300,000 signatures.
[2564.16 --> 2565.52]  I signed for lulz.
[2565.70 --> 2565.96]  Yeah.
[2566.14 --> 2568.66]  Because I do legitimately think it would be a terrible, terrible idea.
[2568.76 --> 2572.02]  And I also legitimately think that the petition will do jack all.
[2572.58 --> 2573.02]  Get it?
[2577.68 --> 2579.28]  I like that.
[2579.28 --> 2581.42]  I made a horrible pun in the video that's coming out Thursday.
[2581.46 --> 2588.42]  I mean, breaking standards that have been standards for literally, you know, decades.
[2589.08 --> 2590.70]  And that are just fine.
[2590.90 --> 2591.08]  Yep.
[2591.36 --> 2601.72]  That no amount of silver cables or, you know, what other stuff have people tried to do to the quarter inch and the whatever it is, eight inch.
[2601.72 --> 2609.00]  Haven't they done, like, the carbon fiber wrapped cable because it keeps the electrons inside better and stuff?
[2609.00 --> 2611.22]  Like, there's been some weird stuff.
[2612.14 --> 2615.04]  Nothing has actually really improved that.
[2615.12 --> 2620.08]  I mean, when we're talking professional applications, you can start talking about balanced XLR or whatever else the case may be.
[2620.14 --> 2624.56]  But when we're talking about what an actual normal consumer needs and a device that fits in their pocket.
[2624.56 --> 2627.94]  Bro, you need to get the monster cable for your 3.5 millimeter?
[2628.16 --> 2628.30]  Yeah.
[2628.38 --> 2630.84]  The 3.5 millimeter jack has served us just fine.
[2630.86 --> 2631.58]  Well, it's just not good enough.
[2631.62 --> 2635.48]  And, like, there were times when I was really wondering if it was the end of the 3.5 millimeter jack.
[2635.48 --> 2643.78]  I mean, do you remember for a bit there, the early days of, like, discmans, when every 3.5 millimeter jack failed within, like, a year or two on every device?
[2644.00 --> 2644.02]  Yeah.
[2644.22 --> 2653.06]  And you always had to, like, hold your discman with your finger pressing the connector like, yeah, man, I carry my discman around in my hand because it's cool.
[2653.28 --> 2655.68]  Actually, I can only hear in one ear when I don't do this.
[2657.58 --> 2657.98]  Yeah.
[2657.98 --> 2659.42]  But that's improved so much.
[2659.68 --> 2663.28]  Industry-wide, that has improved dramatically in the last 5 to 10 years.
[2663.30 --> 2664.24]  It's never really a problem anymore.
[2664.38 --> 2664.54]  Yeah.
[2664.66 --> 2665.96]  It's never a problem anymore.
[2666.18 --> 2669.26]  Your micro USB port is going to fail before your 3.5 millimeter jack.
[2669.50 --> 2669.82]  Oh, yeah.
[2670.60 --> 2671.98]  Apple, please don't do this.
[2673.24 --> 2673.64]  There.
[2673.70 --> 2676.06]  I would prefer if you did not.
[2676.46 --> 2676.92]  All right.
[2676.94 --> 2679.52]  We've got more Oculus.
[2679.94 --> 2680.94]  More Oculus stuff.
[2680.94 --> 2685.42]  So, original article here is from Ars Technica, and it was posted by, what just happened?
[2685.60 --> 2686.26]  Sleep, probably.
[2686.68 --> 2687.54]  Or monitor turn off.
[2687.62 --> 2687.94]  There we go.
[2688.22 --> 2688.58]  Oh.
[2691.06 --> 2691.94]  Not sleep.
[2692.30 --> 2693.36]  Just monitor turn off.
[2693.46 --> 2694.60]  We should probably disable that.
[2696.28 --> 2697.82]  Well, it's not usually an issue.
[2697.96 --> 2699.82]  We don't normally talk about a topic for that long.
[2699.82 --> 2700.30]  That's true.
[2700.40 --> 2701.86]  And I touch it a lot more often.
[2701.96 --> 2703.42]  I mean, I'm all about touching it often.
[2703.68 --> 2704.60]  He likes touching it.
[2704.84 --> 2708.40]  So, our next topic here, another Oculus thing posted by Cubed on the forum.
[2708.40 --> 2711.40]  And now I've gotten totally...
[2711.40 --> 2713.26]  This is such a great headline.
[2713.46 --> 2717.44]  Usually, Ars is a lot more responsible than this.
[2718.20 --> 2719.24]  Oculus founder.
[2719.24 --> 2723.16]  Your crappy PC is the biggest barrier to VR adoption.
[2723.26 --> 2723.46]  Okay.
[2723.46 --> 2726.40]  This was taken out of context.
[2727.78 --> 2728.10]  Okay.
[2728.20 --> 2728.98]  So, to put it...
[2728.98 --> 2730.56]  Again, that's what the WAN show is.
[2730.62 --> 2732.94]  It's all about putting it back in the appropriate context.
[2734.04 --> 2734.40]  Context.
[2734.78 --> 2737.44]  Bring it on, because my system's locked up here for a second.
[2737.44 --> 2738.96]  I think, like...
[2738.96 --> 2746.24]  Basically, to tie into this, NVIDIA has been saying that 13 million PCs will be capable of running Oculus stuff.
[2746.36 --> 2747.16]  Which is essentially...
[2747.16 --> 2747.88]  Sounds like a lot.
[2748.14 --> 2748.32]  Yeah.
[2748.40 --> 2748.94]  It's not.
[2749.32 --> 2750.00]  Yeah, it's really not.
[2750.02 --> 2750.40]  At all.
[2750.52 --> 2752.18]  It's like 1% of PCs.
[2752.30 --> 2752.60]  Less.
[2753.20 --> 2753.44]  Yeah.
[2753.56 --> 2754.88]  It's less than 1%.
[2754.88 --> 2755.72]  It's a low number.
[2755.78 --> 2757.10]  That are capable of...
[2757.10 --> 2759.00]  I forget what the word they used was.
[2759.08 --> 2761.36]  Delivering a good VR experience.
[2761.42 --> 2763.18]  Not even, like, great.
[2763.38 --> 2767.32]  Because that's another thing that I've been noticing, is that on the Oculus website, they're like...
[2767.32 --> 2768.82]  Is it recommended or minimum...
[2768.82 --> 2769.70]  Whatever it is.
[2769.86 --> 2771.02]  They're like, you need a 970.
[2771.02 --> 2773.02]  And every time I look at that, I'm like...
[2773.02 --> 2775.74]  I don't know.
[2775.88 --> 2777.40]  Because you need minimums of 90.
[2778.10 --> 2779.52]  Not averages of 90.
[2779.92 --> 2781.88]  And I think people constantly forget about that.
[2781.98 --> 2782.52]  Frames per second.
[2782.52 --> 2782.68]  Yeah.
[2782.90 --> 2783.02]  Yeah.
[2783.22 --> 2783.34]  Yeah.
[2783.54 --> 2785.02]  So, like...
[2785.02 --> 2785.96]  It's kind of an issue.
[2788.22 --> 2788.44]  Ooh.
[2788.98 --> 2795.96]  Lucky is saying that in terms of VR adoption, high-end graphics hardware should be pushed a lot harder now than it was in the past.
[2796.38 --> 2798.36]  And that's actually probably true.
[2798.60 --> 2798.78]  Yep.
[2798.78 --> 2808.50]  Because if graphics card makers are releasing, they're like, we want everyone to buy this card, and it can't run the thing that everyone's talking about.
[2809.14 --> 2810.84]  That's really embarrassing for them.
[2811.12 --> 2811.34]  Yep.
[2811.66 --> 2812.54]  And you know what?
[2812.58 --> 2815.78]  That trend has actually been going for a while.
[2815.90 --> 2817.26]  I mean, subtle things.
[2817.36 --> 2824.58]  Like, NVIDIA removing their GTX branding from anything that's not actually capable of running games at 1080p.
[2824.88 --> 2825.14]  Yeah.
[2825.20 --> 2827.38]  That happened over the last couple of years here.
[2827.38 --> 2828.30]  Even...
[2828.30 --> 2828.58]  You know what?
[2828.58 --> 2829.34]  This is really interesting.
[2829.56 --> 2830.74]  I actually have a...
[2830.74 --> 2832.34]  We've got a lot of great videos coming soon.
[2832.46 --> 2834.38]  So, his VR thing should be like...
[2835.32 --> 2836.98]  Nothing's definitive.
[2837.20 --> 2842.22]  But, like, should be like the excellent showdown on Rift versus Vive.
[2842.48 --> 2847.54]  And then I've got something really interesting coming about buying a gaming PC at Best Buy.
[2847.54 --> 2848.14]  Yeah.
[2848.14 --> 2850.02]  We literally went with a credit card.
[2850.14 --> 2851.36]  Best Buy knew nothing about this.
[2851.46 --> 2853.70]  We went and bought a PC, a gaming...
[2853.70 --> 2855.10]  We went and asked a sales rep.
[2855.28 --> 2856.86]  I want to buy a gaming PC.
[2856.98 --> 2857.66]  What should I buy?
[2857.66 --> 2863.98]  And I was floored to find out that it actually had, like, a decent graphics card in it.
[2864.34 --> 2865.62]  So, that...
[2865.62 --> 2867.70]  It was not a thing when I worked there when I was a kid.
[2867.76 --> 2869.54]  So, that trend is already happening.
[2870.06 --> 2870.58]  Pushing towards...
[2870.58 --> 2877.92]  Instead of selling the thing that has a palatable price point, selling the thing that will actually do the job is already happening.
[2878.34 --> 2880.20]  And, sorry, I'll let you carry on now.
[2880.24 --> 2883.64]  We're not there yet, is where my previous point was talking about.
[2883.72 --> 2886.30]  Like, the 970 sketches me out in terms of VR gaming.
[2886.42 --> 2887.42]  And that's a 970!
[2887.68 --> 2891.36]  Like, you should be fine with a 970 for, like, whatever you're doing.
[2891.78 --> 2894.88]  People with 980s, I'm like, I probably...
[2894.88 --> 2895.34]  Good luck!
[2895.42 --> 2901.86]  Because most of the, like, native VR games that are built specifically for VR will probably be fine for you.
[2901.92 --> 2907.90]  But for people that added VR support after and that wasn't the main focus of their game, you might still have a pretty big problem.
[2909.48 --> 2910.32]  That's an issue.
[2910.32 --> 2919.26]  So, he has said, in the near future, that demand will push PC tech to the point where even that crappy PC will be able to power a convincing VR experience.
[2919.78 --> 2920.86]  Which is cool.
[2921.12 --> 2922.14]  And a really good point.
[2922.26 --> 2923.18]  And a really good quote.
[2923.18 --> 2930.26]  And it's more talking about the long-standing statement that Oculus has had, which is where they're aiming for mass adoption.
[2930.86 --> 2932.38]  Yeah, they missed it this time.
[2932.62 --> 2935.08]  But, I don't know, you probably could have figured that out.
[2935.70 --> 2939.30]  Even if it was just in minimum specs and not even the surprising price of the headset.
[2939.64 --> 2939.84]  Yeah.
[2940.06 --> 2949.06]  It is also said that if normal PCs get good enough to run VR, then the majority of people will be able to buy a relatively cheap headset and just use whatever computer they already own to drive it.
[2949.20 --> 2951.16]  That's talking, again, down the line.
[2951.46 --> 2952.22]  In the future.
[2952.22 --> 2952.60]  Different headset.
[2952.60 --> 2953.52]  In the future.
[2953.52 --> 2955.20]  Not talking about this version of the Rift.
[2955.46 --> 2957.14]  Not talking about normal PCs right now.
[2957.20 --> 2960.64]  Talking about once a crappy PC reaches that level.
[2960.74 --> 2961.58]  A crappy PC.
[2961.58 --> 2964.88]  So, the quote was kind of taken out of context.
[2964.88 --> 2974.46]  And he's using the evolution of cell phones and the pricing of cell phones as an example of how that whole thing shook down.
[2974.46 --> 2977.06]  And cell phones are an example.
[2977.06 --> 2978.06]  There's a thousand examples.
[2978.06 --> 2978.56]  There's a thousand examples.
[2978.56 --> 2981.66]  Digital cameras are another great example.
[2981.66 --> 2983.66]  Where at the beginning, they were like...
[2983.66 --> 2986.30]  At the beginning, they were very trash.
[2986.30 --> 2988.94]  And if you look back to the early days of VR, yep, it was all trash.
[2989.02 --> 2989.32]  Oh, yeah.
[2989.32 --> 3002.40]  And then came, you know, which for me, the PowerShot A20 was like what happened when I went, okay, a digital camera is actually good enough to be somewhat usable, but I spent like $600 on it.
[3002.40 --> 3005.70]  And, like, where is it?
[3005.70 --> 3015.60]  And now, that technology, you know, the PowerShot A20, and much better than the PowerShot A20, is so commodity that it's inside every cell phone.
[3015.78 --> 3017.22]  And that's the adoption curve.
[3017.28 --> 3027.34]  That's what it takes for something to get mainstream to the point where a crappy phone is better than what was the $600 Cadillac experience however many years ago.
[3027.34 --> 3033.32]  Another thing that I said, not to spoil the entire video that is coming out on Thursday, is that...
[3033.32 --> 3035.20]  The Wet n' Show, Luke's upcoming video edition.
[3035.42 --> 3035.50]  Yeah.
[3035.92 --> 3042.84]  It needs the Android Butter update or the, like, 3GS release for it to really explode.
[3042.98 --> 3045.68]  This is not where VR is going to get big.
[3045.88 --> 3053.28]  This is where VR is going to get big with the small percentage of a small percentage of a small percentage, which is...
[3053.28 --> 3053.66]  Of dorks.
[3053.66 --> 3057.60]  Cuter hardware guys that are into really high-end stuff and have enough money to afford it.
[3057.78 --> 3058.46]  And are dorks.
[3058.52 --> 3059.16]  And are dorks.
[3059.22 --> 3059.36]  Yeah.
[3059.40 --> 3060.12]  And it's going to be wonderful.
[3060.12 --> 3061.08]  Which is okay, because...
[3061.08 --> 3062.94]  And we're going to enjoy it, and it's going to be awesome.
[3063.32 --> 3063.48]  Yeah.
[3063.58 --> 3065.04]  But that's what needs to happen right now.
[3065.26 --> 3072.20]  And then, hopefully, a little bit after that, it'll be the hardcore guys that can afford it, but the price is cheaper.
[3072.38 --> 3076.78]  And then, eventually, it'll be everyone because it's easy to get and easy to use, and everyone likes it.
[3077.30 --> 3079.46]  It has to go through these stages, and that's fine.
[3079.68 --> 3080.54]  That's more what he's saying.
[3080.98 --> 3081.76]  So, there you go.
[3081.76 --> 3082.26]  Yeah.
[3082.44 --> 3092.22]  VR is a thing for the super rich who also are willing to allocate that amount of their expendable excess income.
[3092.24 --> 3092.66]  Not super rich.
[3092.90 --> 3093.14]  No.
[3093.24 --> 3101.02]  For the super rich or the people who are willing to take what money they have and allocate a lot of it to this experience.
[3101.02 --> 3106.92]  In some communities that I've been, I've seen people talking that have been saving for this launch since DK2.
[3107.40 --> 3107.60]  Yeah.
[3107.78 --> 3108.98]  That includes me.
[3109.08 --> 3109.82]  I knew this was coming.
[3109.94 --> 3110.32]  It's fine.
[3110.50 --> 3111.88]  I didn't know it was going to be this expensive.
[3112.12 --> 3113.86]  I actually didn't think they were going to hit their target.
[3114.38 --> 3119.12]  I did think it was going to be over $350 or whatever they were guessing, but I didn't really think it was going to be $600.
[3119.48 --> 3122.02]  And you didn't think the Canadian dollar would have fallen 25%?
[3122.02 --> 3126.56]  The $300 is going to end up being like actually almost $1,000 because rip Canadian dollar.
[3126.96 --> 3127.14]  Yeah.
[3127.82 --> 3128.02]  Yeah.
[3128.02 --> 3129.16]  All right.
[3129.22 --> 3132.32]  So let's move on to ways that you might be able to save some.
[3132.40 --> 3134.10]  Oh, let's move on to our sponsors.
[3134.50 --> 3137.16]  Ways to make sure that Luke can afford to buy an Oculus.
[3137.54 --> 3137.94]  Yay.
[3138.24 --> 3138.64]  Yay.
[3139.16 --> 3141.02]  First one is...
[3141.54 --> 3143.02]  Squarespace.
[3143.70 --> 3144.72]  Yeah, move it forward.
[3144.72 --> 3146.30]  It's been so long since I've said that.
[3146.56 --> 3147.14]  I know.
[3147.26 --> 3150.56]  It's really funny because the people posting on the videos are like, yeah, we got it.
[3150.60 --> 3150.92]  Squarespace.
[3151.46 --> 3153.54]  I'm like, yeah, but like they sponsored the show.
[3153.62 --> 3157.24]  We can't just like stop saying it because you personally are tired of it.
[3157.24 --> 3160.10]  To be honest, I think I made it kind of fun.
[3160.32 --> 3165.02]  Most of the comments on my videos are just about like how the weird idea that I came up with was stupid.
[3165.16 --> 3165.36]  Yeah.
[3165.46 --> 3165.98]  I'm like, yeah.
[3166.10 --> 3167.06]  I had fun with it too.
[3167.14 --> 3171.18]  Like, and honestly, I will tell you guys this because some people are like, yeah, you guys got to like mix it up.
[3171.36 --> 3181.46]  We actually had a meeting after CES last year where we were like, okay, maybe what we should do is instead of selling the entire show to one set of sponsors.
[3181.46 --> 3183.38]  So we're saying the same thing over and over again.
[3183.48 --> 3185.96]  We should have like a different set of sponsors per day.
[3185.96 --> 3191.34]  And then what we decided after that meeting was that, no, that's really hard.
[3191.46 --> 3192.30]  It's really difficult.
[3192.30 --> 3193.82]  It would be really hard to do it fairly.
[3194.12 --> 3195.78]  It would be really hard to do it accurately.
[3196.44 --> 3201.78]  And we would end up just upsetting everyone by getting it wrong all the time.
[3201.84 --> 3206.74]  We'd end up creating a bunch of extra work for ourselves doing pickups because, oh, I screwed up the sponsor spot on that one.
[3206.74 --> 3209.34]  And we kind of went, you know what, CES is stressful enough.
[3209.84 --> 3216.84]  If we can find one guy who's willing to go, yeah, I'll flip the bill for the whole company to go cover the crap out of CES this year.
[3217.10 --> 3219.72]  Then let's make sure that one guy gets a bunch of exposure for it.
[3219.74 --> 3220.22]  Everyone's happy.
[3220.32 --> 3221.16]  And it was Squarespace.
[3221.56 --> 3223.34]  And this is going to sound like a little bit of a cop out.
[3223.34 --> 3229.16]  But it's actually a lot easier to focus on the content when I go to actually talk about it.
[3229.22 --> 3230.64]  I'm like, oh, yeah, Squarespace thing.
[3230.90 --> 3231.40]  And then I'm done.
[3231.46 --> 3235.42]  And I'm like, oh, yeah, got to make up some stupid story and Squarespace thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, done.
[3235.74 --> 3237.32]  And then I can go focus on more content.
[3237.32 --> 3243.14]  It makes life easier for us, which makes sure that we can focus on what we're supposed to be doing, which is covering that show.
[3243.38 --> 3244.98]  So that's what Squarespace did for us.
[3245.14 --> 3246.94]  Let's talk about what Squarespace can do for you.
[3246.94 --> 3260.10]  If you want to build a beautiful website about whether it's building Brazilian blow dart frog guns or whatever else the case may be, which you probably shouldn't do, actually.
[3260.20 --> 3262.58]  I'm sure a lot of places would classify that as a weapon because it kind of is.
[3264.50 --> 3271.48]  Or whether it's a blog or a personal portfolio or whether you just want to be like a web 2.0 company that has a one-page website.
[3272.80 --> 3274.20]  Squarespace has got you covered.
[3274.20 --> 3283.70]  But don't worry if you don't want to have an obnoxious website, Squarespace also has the ability to create lots of other pages that actually explain what your company does and what your product is.
[3283.84 --> 3286.26]  So you can definitely flesh things out, too.
[3286.36 --> 3293.60]  And they make sure that, you know, with their logo creator and with their ability to, you know, just take images and arrange them and make them look great.
[3293.64 --> 3297.14]  Even if you don't have your web experience, Squarespace is the way to go.
[3297.32 --> 3299.10]  It's only $8 a month to start.
[3299.20 --> 3302.04]  And you get a free domain if you buy Squarespace for the year.
[3302.04 --> 3307.82]  And you can save 10% on your first Squarespace purchase if you use offer code LINUS.
[3308.30 --> 3312.44]  Is that not the easiest sponsor spot now because we've done it so many times?
[3312.52 --> 3316.76]  I know, but it's also such an obvious, like, it's such an obvious offer.
[3317.30 --> 3318.96]  It's just like, yep, it's easy to build a website.
[3319.18 --> 3321.14]  It's a website and it's easy and it's not that expensive.
[3321.20 --> 3322.92]  And you know what else is an obvious offer?
[3323.22 --> 3323.78]  TunnelBear.
[3323.90 --> 3324.18]  Yay!
[3324.18 --> 3328.80]  TunnelBear is the easy to use VPN app for mobile and desktop.
[3329.04 --> 3330.04]  Seriously, mobile and desktop.
[3330.18 --> 3338.30]  They've got Android, iOS, PC, Mac, and even a Chrome extension, depending on what you want to, you know, TunnelBear up.
[3338.60 --> 3342.96]  And their friendly little bears take all the hassle out of setting up a VPN.
[3342.96 --> 3349.68]  You don't have to, like, you know, oh, do I have to do the ports and DNS and blah, blah, blah.
[3349.94 --> 3352.88]  Their default option is even just, like, nearest portal.
[3353.58 --> 3355.30]  Like, oh, or tunnel, I guess.
[3355.46 --> 3355.94]  Yeah, tunnel.
[3356.18 --> 3356.38]  Yeah.
[3356.74 --> 3357.64]  Tunnel, burp-a-derp.
[3357.76 --> 3362.14]  You know, and you just kind of go, okay, I want to be, like, as if I'm from Great Britain.
[3362.42 --> 3366.08]  And then you press a button and it's like, oh, hey, now you're from Great Britain.
[3366.54 --> 3369.92]  Oh, wait, welcome to our site, mate, which is actually more of an Australian accent.
[3369.92 --> 3371.48]  So don't worry too much about that.
[3371.94 --> 3374.92]  I actually have a really hard time turning on one or the other.
[3375.04 --> 3377.02]  It actually takes me a little while to get into my groove.
[3377.16 --> 3377.62]  You're not Burkle.
[3377.82 --> 3378.48]  I'm not Burkle.
[3378.60 --> 3379.36]  I can't do it either.
[3379.56 --> 3380.22]  It's fine.
[3380.66 --> 3381.92]  I just don't even at all.
[3382.00 --> 3383.36]  Yeah, it's better not to.
[3383.48 --> 3384.24]  Because I can't.
[3385.02 --> 3385.90]  Tell me something.
[3386.22 --> 3392.88]  Why is it okay for me to imitate an accent as long as it's an accent that it's mostly other white people who have?
[3393.86 --> 3395.24]  Let's not get into that on this show.
[3395.32 --> 3395.58]  Okay.
[3395.58 --> 3400.10]  But if you do Great Britain and you say Australian.
[3400.72 --> 3402.26]  Oh, no, they'll still be upset about that.
[3402.30 --> 3402.44]  Yeah.
[3402.56 --> 3407.56]  But in general, like, it would be politically correct, sort of, for me to do an Australian accent.
[3407.66 --> 3408.68]  No one's upset about that.
[3408.80 --> 3412.48]  But if I were to run around doing a Chinese accent, no one would like that.
[3412.66 --> 3413.40]  That would be wrong.
[3413.70 --> 3415.14]  No one would think that that's a good idea.
[3415.20 --> 3416.08]  I don't have an answer for you.
[3416.12 --> 3416.92]  Yeah, I don't either.
[3417.18 --> 3423.28]  Anyway, so TunnelBear allows you to have the first 500 megs of your VPN access per month for free.
[3423.28 --> 3423.72]  Yay!
[3424.04 --> 3424.24]  Yay!
[3424.56 --> 3426.64]  And then if you actually, I don't know if that's per month.
[3427.04 --> 3427.64]  I think it is.
[3427.70 --> 3427.90]  Yeah.
[3428.06 --> 3429.02]  Yeah, I think it's per month.
[3429.12 --> 3435.76]  And then for just a few bucks a month by heading over to TunnelBear.com slash when you guys can get unlimited data.
[3435.76 --> 3440.20]  And you can actually save 10% by visiting this URL as well.
[3441.74 --> 3442.52]  That's funny.
[3442.70 --> 3446.76]  Our sponsors, oh, oh, racist unsubbing, racist unsubbing.
[3447.42 --> 3448.00]  I'm upset.
[3448.32 --> 3449.46]  Racist unsubbing.
[3449.78 --> 3450.16]  Oh, no.
[3450.16 --> 3452.90]  I'm not racist.
[3453.82 --> 3455.74]  I have Chinese friends.
[3456.44 --> 3457.18]  You married?
[3457.84 --> 3461.50]  No, I just, it's the stereotypical, like, you know, I'm not racist.
[3461.68 --> 3462.44]  I have a black friend.
[3462.54 --> 3465.70]  You know, the whole, like, the white people defense.
[3466.66 --> 3469.20]  No, but I legitimately have a Chinese wife.
[3469.62 --> 3471.90]  Which I think maybe does give you some.
[3472.06 --> 3474.30]  Legit, straight up, my kids are Chinese.
[3474.54 --> 3474.78]  Hi, Von.
[3474.78 --> 3475.04]  Okay?
[3476.72 --> 3477.74]  I don't know where she is.
[3477.76 --> 3478.22]  So there you go.
[3478.44 --> 3482.66]  I mean, and, and, and with that said then, am I allowed?
[3485.00 --> 3486.24]  I don't, I don't, I don't.
[3486.34 --> 3486.80]  If my.
[3486.80 --> 3487.54]  I don't know these rules.
[3487.54 --> 3488.58]  I'm really bad at PC stuff.
[3488.58 --> 3489.84]  Okay, no, no, hold on a second.
[3490.02 --> 3491.22]  You're bad at PC stuff?
[3491.26 --> 3491.60]  You're fired.
[3491.60 --> 3496.60]  I meant politically correct.
[3496.60 --> 3504.52]  If my nuclear family is literally half Chinese, because my wife and all of my kids, actually,
[3504.62 --> 3506.52]  if any of my kids weren't half Chinese, that would be a serious.
[3506.52 --> 3508.34]  That would be a slight issue.
[3508.42 --> 3509.00]  Okay, so my.
[3509.00 --> 3510.34]  That wouldn't technically be your nuclear family.
[3510.56 --> 3511.14]  It could be.
[3511.28 --> 3513.98]  Because I, I would argue that a step kid is a, is a nuclear family.
[3513.98 --> 3517.70]  So I could have technically come in with like a half white, half ginger kid or something
[3517.70 --> 3518.18]  like that.
[3518.18 --> 3528.90]  Um, so, so if my nuclear family is half Chinese, am I allowed to do the Chinese accent?
[3529.40 --> 3529.76]  And.
[3530.04 --> 3531.18]  I literally, I don't know.
[3531.26 --> 3533.80]  And does this, and does this, this is a Lisa's channel.
[3533.80 --> 3540.82]  And does, does the fact that my wife is only really ethnically Chinese and culturally Western,
[3541.00 --> 3542.16]  does that affect it?
[3542.58 --> 3543.78]  Because she doesn't speak.
[3543.78 --> 3548.46]  She was actually born in Brunei, but doesn't speak a lick of Mandarin.
[3549.98 --> 3555.02]  I, I, I, I, I, I just don't even, I just stay super far away from this stuff because
[3555.02 --> 3555.88]  I have no idea.
[3556.02 --> 3556.96]  Everyone's saying no.
[3557.86 --> 3558.68]  Everyone's saying no.
[3558.90 --> 3559.50]  It's probably no.
[3559.62 --> 3560.46]  No, Laysist.
[3560.46 --> 3561.14]  Because you are not.
[3561.42 --> 3562.22]  Because I'm not.
[3562.36 --> 3563.90]  I don't think it includes the nuclear family.
[3564.02 --> 3564.92]  I think it's just you.
[3568.72 --> 3571.06]  All right, so let's move on to our next topic here.
[3571.10 --> 3571.86]  That was too much fun.
[3571.86 --> 3578.82]  Oh, the problem with overclocking on non-Z chipsets.
[3579.64 --> 3585.94]  So this was originally posted over on Tom's hardware, and news has recently surfaced that
[3585.94 --> 3591.42]  some motherboard manufacturers, notably ASRock and Supermicro, have found a way to overclock
[3591.42 --> 3595.40]  Skylake CPUs on H-class chipsets.
[3595.54 --> 3596.86]  So cheapo motherboards.
[3596.86 --> 3598.96]  And Luke talked about this at CES.
[3599.08 --> 3602.18]  There's actually Supermicro's doing a giveaway, which Luke hosted, which some of you asked
[3602.18 --> 3602.36]  about.
[3602.36 --> 3602.76]  Of the whole system.
[3603.16 --> 3604.06]  Of the entire system.
[3604.64 --> 3605.66]  I don't know when the deadline is.
[3605.66 --> 3612.26]  But this is not as cut and dried and like, woo, party time!
[3612.90 --> 3616.18]  As people might have initially anticipated.
[3616.88 --> 3625.00]  So while you can overclock on a non-Z chipset, which Intel has enforced for quite some time
[3625.00 --> 3625.14]  now.
[3625.18 --> 3629.42]  You're going to have to have a K-unlocked CPU, and you're going to have to have a Z-enthusiast-grade
[3629.42 --> 3630.66]  overclockable chipset.
[3630.66 --> 3632.34]  But there are some limitations.
[3632.72 --> 3634.26]  So what do we got here for limitations?
[3634.70 --> 3637.24]  So it kills your hyperthreading, theoretically.
[3637.54 --> 3638.38]  On some boards.
[3638.58 --> 3640.22]  On some not Supermicro ones.
[3640.40 --> 3640.72]  Yep.
[3640.86 --> 3641.28]  Which is interesting.
[3641.28 --> 3643.30]  It kills your hyperthreading on other ones.
[3643.44 --> 3643.58]  Yep.
[3643.70 --> 3648.72]  You're unable to use C states to reduce voltage and power consumption when the system is idle.
[3649.10 --> 3650.54]  And I think there's some crashing problems.
[3650.62 --> 3653.50]  But the main thing is unable to use C states and kills hyperthreading.
[3654.14 --> 3659.46]  ASUS states that using modded chipsets will also lose support for some instruction sets.
[3659.60 --> 3659.86]  Okay.
[3659.86 --> 3666.68]  Hardware modifications and firmware support must be added to work on a chipset like H170
[3666.68 --> 3667.72]  or B150.
[3667.92 --> 3672.66]  So this has to be something where the motherboard maker is like going out there.
[3672.86 --> 3676.36]  Well, when talking to Supermicro, they have to do custom bio stuff.
[3676.54 --> 3677.22]  They have to do custom.
[3677.80 --> 3681.00]  There has to be a custom chip to bypass the Intel thing.
[3681.16 --> 3683.42]  There's a lot of custom work that has to be done.
[3683.78 --> 3687.84]  So like they were telling me, there is an increased cost.
[3688.34 --> 3688.58]  Yep.
[3688.58 --> 3691.26]  So these cost more than H-series ones as well.
[3691.34 --> 3695.40]  So if you're just buying it as a motherboard and not planning to overclock, that's a terrible idea.
[3695.40 --> 3699.02]  Because it'll be less stable and cost more.
[3699.02 --> 3705.84]  And ASUS's take on this is that any non-Z170 boards designed to overclock would have significant
[3705.84 --> 3711.42]  reliability issues and could result in numerous CPU and motherboard failures.
[3711.42 --> 3728.90]  So an ASUS representative basically said that to develop and sell these motherboards to its users would damage its standing among PC enthusiasts and made it clear that it felt producing motherboards with modified chipsets would be a huge liability and that it would be irresponsible and a disservice to its loyal customers.
[3728.90 --> 3735.54]  Ever since Supermicro told me about that, I've been really interested in what it's actually like.
[3735.72 --> 3743.90]  Because I mean, you could say things like, okay, you know, an H-170 board designed to overclock wouldn't be reliable.
[3743.90 --> 3749.72]  But I mean, part of the problem might be that an H-170 board is typically designed with components that are not designed to overclock.
[3749.84 --> 3750.40]  And that's the thing.
[3750.46 --> 3752.70]  And then the Supermicro guys have added more heat sinks.
[3752.82 --> 3761.02]  So if you build an H-170 board that's designed to overclock, then maybe.
[3761.02 --> 3765.06]  Who knows, but then you're bypassing things which might cause stability problems there.
[3765.24 --> 3766.22]  There might be other issues.
[3766.42 --> 3767.98]  Like, I don't know.
[3768.14 --> 3770.42]  I really want to get my hands on one and just mess with it a bunch.
[3770.50 --> 3773.26]  So the Tom's Hardware article is actually excellent.
[3773.76 --> 3783.62]  So ASRock has two H-170 motherboards and one B-150 motherboard and one C-232 chipset motherboard with overclocking features.
[3783.72 --> 3784.72]  Gigabyte didn't say much.
[3785.60 --> 3788.28]  MSI kind of expressed concerns about reliability and all that.
[3788.28 --> 3794.22]  But I mean, part of it is like I don't know how seriously to take the reliability concerns.
[3794.34 --> 3797.46]  Because sometimes a reliability concern is just that.
[3797.72 --> 3798.32]  A concern.
[3798.58 --> 3798.74]  Yeah.
[3798.86 --> 3800.62]  It's a concern because we haven't tested it.
[3800.62 --> 3801.56]  This is new and it's sketchy.
[3801.80 --> 3803.12]  So we're not sure.
[3803.88 --> 3804.66]  Which is fair.
[3805.00 --> 3805.22]  Yeah.
[3805.26 --> 3805.78]  To be completely honest.
[3805.80 --> 3806.66]  Which is totally fair.
[3806.74 --> 3806.90]  Yeah.
[3807.08 --> 3808.06]  And the problem is.
[3808.06 --> 3811.34]  And it's just this stance where they're like, we don't want to do this because we don't know a lot about it.
[3811.56 --> 3813.54]  And we have some concerns.
[3813.54 --> 3814.68]  So we're not going to do it.
[3815.02 --> 3817.96]  And we're frankly not worried about, you know, Supermicros.
[3817.96 --> 3822.96]  Supermicro's H170 overclocking board taking away a significant amount of our market share.
[3823.84 --> 3825.26]  Like that's a totally valid.
[3825.26 --> 3826.78]  Probably a good stance to go with.
[3826.78 --> 3832.16]  As the 800-pound gorilla in the motherboard industry, that's a pretty safe and responsible approach.
[3832.28 --> 3836.08]  I also think Supermicro's approach is probably exactly what they should do too.
[3836.36 --> 3839.46]  They're trying to carve out a space in the gaming thing for motherboards.
[3839.46 --> 3844.22]  And this is an aggressive way to carve out a space other than just making a green motherboard.
[3844.46 --> 3848.98]  Because the reality of it is there's not a whole lot of ways to differentiate on the motherboard these days.
[3849.18 --> 3856.30]  Because the costs are controlled by factors that are outside of Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, Supermicro, whoever you want to name.
[3856.38 --> 3859.58]  I mean, Intel charges everyone the same amount for a chipset.
[3859.58 --> 3864.18]  And that dictates that a Z-class motherboard is going to be over $100.
[3864.60 --> 3870.22]  I got some interesting looks in the Supermicro suite when I was like, this is cool.
[3870.32 --> 3871.60]  And like mostly mumbled that part.
[3871.86 --> 3874.44]  And then was like, because motherboards are so boring.
[3876.08 --> 3877.76]  I had to like reiterate afterwards.
[3877.86 --> 3881.44]  I was like, because there's like no differences and this finally makes them different.
[3881.68 --> 3883.16]  And then they were like, oh, okay, okay.
[3883.62 --> 3884.82]  I'm like, no, no, it's fine.
[3884.82 --> 3888.58]  But yeah, they're like, look at the Asus suite.
[3889.28 --> 3890.92]  I covered their boards this year.
[3891.08 --> 3892.50]  I don't know why it got so many views.
[3892.76 --> 3894.40]  One of them was white camo.
[3894.70 --> 3897.88]  One of them had some RGB lights and an RGB header.
[3898.08 --> 3899.90]  And the other one was small.
[3901.58 --> 3906.72]  And there might have been like AI suite features that accompanied those boards.
[3906.92 --> 3908.60]  When was the last time you installed AI suite?
[3908.82 --> 3909.58]  Well, okay.
[3909.58 --> 3916.72]  The last thing I got excited about that Asus changed was that you no longer have to install AI suite to use their onboard fan control.
[3918.06 --> 3920.02]  So there is still room for innovation.
[3920.64 --> 3920.84]  Yeah.
[3921.12 --> 3922.36]  But it's in like.
[3922.40 --> 3923.18]  It's fairly incremental.
[3923.30 --> 3924.82]  How nice your UEFI is.
[3925.60 --> 3926.56]  Yeah, there's a fair bit of that.
[3926.60 --> 3927.28]  Which is like.
[3927.42 --> 3932.52]  And in Gigabyte's defense, their 1080p UEFI does look very good.
[3932.66 --> 3933.36]  It's pretty clean.
[3933.68 --> 3934.56]  It does look great.
[3934.56 --> 3936.22]  For the like 10 minutes that you see it.
[3936.64 --> 3936.98]  Yes.
[3937.08 --> 3937.80]  It's pretty cool.
[3937.80 --> 3940.72]  Because most people are pretty fast at UEFI now.
[3940.78 --> 3940.98]  Yes.
[3940.98 --> 3943.10]  Especially because you can use a mouse and arrow keys.
[3943.10 --> 3943.30]  Yes.
[3943.30 --> 3944.08]  It goes really quickly.
[3945.62 --> 3948.20]  It really doesn't take that long to select that dare boot device.
[3948.34 --> 3948.64]  Okay.
[3948.76 --> 3953.24]  So this was posted by N-A-E-A-E-S-N-E-A-S-D-B-E on the forum.
[3953.24 --> 3954.96]  And this is really.
[3955.08 --> 3955.84]  This is kind of funny.
[3956.02 --> 3957.46]  Because I'm going to be.
[3957.54 --> 3962.10]  I'm going to give you guys an unusual insight into the inner workings of Linus Media Group.
[3962.88 --> 3969.66]  Where our Predator 240 and 360 coverage was not very well received.
[3969.72 --> 3971.26]  Actually by a variety of parties.
[3971.36 --> 3972.56]  Some of you complained about it.
[3972.60 --> 3973.18]  Said we rushed it.
[3973.20 --> 3974.12]  We did rush it, by the way.
[3974.58 --> 3975.62]  Said we rushed it.
[3976.12 --> 3978.70]  EK wasn't happy because they said we rushed it.
[3978.88 --> 3980.08]  The plan wasn't to rush it.
[3980.10 --> 3981.30]  No, the plan wasn't to rush it.
[3981.38 --> 3985.32]  But the reason it got rushed was that it leaked.
[3986.68 --> 3987.08]  Catastrophically.
[3987.24 --> 3987.70]  It leaked.
[3987.80 --> 3988.26]  It leaked.
[3988.36 --> 3988.76]  It failed.
[3989.28 --> 3991.46]  And we ended up having to get a new unit.
[3991.78 --> 3992.54]  And something, something.
[3992.66 --> 3993.64]  Production schedules, etc.
[3993.72 --> 3994.12]  Deadlines.
[3994.32 --> 3996.12]  We ended up having to kind of rush it.
[3996.18 --> 3998.00]  And we talked about in the video how it leaked.
[3998.84 --> 4001.40]  And so EK wasn't super happy with our video.
[4001.40 --> 4001.64]  No.
[4001.64 --> 4004.82]  Because we were like, yep, it leaked.
[4004.98 --> 4008.00]  And then the coverage of the product honestly wasn't as good as it should have been.
[4008.08 --> 4009.38]  Because it leaked and we were in a rush.
[4009.54 --> 4009.80]  Sorry.
[4010.40 --> 4013.32]  So this is just kind of funny to me.
[4013.72 --> 4015.32]  In sort of like a mean spirited way.
[4015.36 --> 4016.00]  I like EK.
[4016.22 --> 4017.78]  They're nice blokes over there.
[4017.92 --> 4020.64]  They helped us with the 7Gamers1 CPU project.
[4020.86 --> 4022.76]  They helped me with the Personal Rig Update project.
[4023.26 --> 4024.32]  They provided the blocks.
[4024.32 --> 4025.32]  Not only blocks.
[4025.84 --> 4029.00]  But like consultation on making sure that everything was going to work.
[4029.00 --> 4035.54]  And also creating a custom part to make 7Gamers1 CPU function.
[4035.80 --> 4038.86]  That didn't exist before and will likely never need to exist again.
[4039.34 --> 4040.42]  We just, we've got the one.
[4040.56 --> 4041.90]  And that's all that ever needs to exist.
[4041.96 --> 4043.52]  Because no one should really build a rig like that.
[4044.12 --> 4044.44]  Anyway.
[4044.78 --> 4045.70]  So I like those guys.
[4045.86 --> 4046.74]  But this is kind of funny.
[4047.48 --> 4052.02]  They are recalling the Predator 240 and 360 units that we reviewed.
[4052.74 --> 4055.02]  Because 10% of them leak.
[4055.92 --> 4057.70]  Not actually in the way that ours leaked.
[4058.00 --> 4058.28]  Nope.
[4058.28 --> 4059.64]  In a completely different way.
[4060.06 --> 4064.82]  So for ours, one of the fittings didn't seem to be pre-attached from the factory tight enough.
[4064.82 --> 4065.92]  Yeah, not at all.
[4067.26 --> 4067.74]  Anyways.
[4067.96 --> 4072.58]  And this is actually between the, I believe it's the top and the bottom of the CPU block.
[4073.04 --> 4075.04]  O-ring issue, etc, etc.
[4075.82 --> 4079.42]  To give them some credit, they've got some ballsiness with them.
[4079.42 --> 4083.24]  If you contact EKWB for replacement or refund, they will do so.
[4083.32 --> 4088.92]  And they will also refund a customer for any computer component damage created by the leakage.
[4089.28 --> 4089.88]  Holy shit.
[4089.88 --> 4090.28]  Yeah.
[4090.34 --> 4091.40]  That's what they say.
[4092.24 --> 4093.60]  We'll see if they actually...
[4093.60 --> 4094.76]  If it happens, tweet me.
[4095.42 --> 4095.64]  Yeah.
[4095.64 --> 4099.98]  If you get a confirmed refund for computer components that died from the leak, tweet me.
[4100.18 --> 4100.42]  Yeah.
[4100.52 --> 4103.22]  And tell me what you had to do to get that.
[4103.34 --> 4103.58]  Yeah.
[4104.06 --> 4105.38]  Yeah, that'd be very interesting.
[4105.52 --> 4107.42]  I'm sure there's going to be hoops.
[4107.68 --> 4110.48]  Like, EK probably wants you to send them the component.
[4110.50 --> 4111.16]  There should be some hoops.
[4111.22 --> 4111.38]  Yeah.
[4111.44 --> 4112.20]  And there should be some hoops.
[4112.20 --> 4115.26]  At the very least, a picture showing water damage of some sort or something.
[4115.32 --> 4115.70]  I don't know.
[4115.70 --> 4116.88]  Yeah, that's too easy to fake.
[4117.02 --> 4121.32]  If I was EK, I would want someone to, with the Predator, that they have to ship back anyway.
[4121.72 --> 4122.88]  I would have them put the Predator.
[4123.14 --> 4124.64]  And it's a bunch of broken components.
[4125.86 --> 4126.56]  Jam it in a box.
[4126.60 --> 4127.16]  Yeah, exactly.
[4127.26 --> 4130.28]  It's not like it has to be meticulously, painstakingly packed.
[4130.36 --> 4130.76]  They're broken.
[4131.18 --> 4132.38]  I would want that box.
[4132.46 --> 4133.48]  I would want it back to them.
[4133.58 --> 4134.92]  And then I would go, okay, all right.
[4135.18 --> 4137.10]  Here's your Amazon credit to go buy it.
[4137.40 --> 4138.38]  Or we'll buy it for you.
[4138.42 --> 4139.10]  We'll ship you new ones.
[4139.18 --> 4139.68]  Or whatever.
[4140.10 --> 4143.94]  I expect them to do something to figure out how to handle that.
[4143.94 --> 4150.10]  A lot of companies in this situation, I think, would say, send us your things and we'll
[4150.10 --> 4153.54]  replace the things and completely ignore all the things that that thing would have killed.
[4153.68 --> 4154.56]  Oh, that's been done.
[4154.78 --> 4154.94]  Yep.
[4155.02 --> 4155.58]  That's been done.
[4155.68 --> 4156.40]  And Swift Tech, again.
[4156.52 --> 4158.38]  I love my bros over at Swift Tech a lot.
[4158.62 --> 4162.28]  But the Apogee GTX?
[4163.14 --> 4163.98]  I can't remember.
[4164.10 --> 4168.54]  They have just completely lost me on their naming scheme for their water blocks.
[4168.60 --> 4169.24]  Yeah, who knows?
[4170.64 --> 4172.42]  Yes, the Apogee GTX.
[4172.42 --> 4179.32]  Swift Tech basically washed their hands of any responsibility for things like corrosion
[4179.32 --> 4182.54]  occurring because of problems with the anodization.
[4182.68 --> 4187.08]  They basically went, well, you should have been using Hydrex fluid from Swift Tech.
[4187.34 --> 4189.74]  That's not our fault that your block corroded.
[4189.92 --> 4190.94]  So get recs done.
[4192.38 --> 4193.38]  That's really unfortunate.
[4193.68 --> 4193.88]  Yeah.
[4195.80 --> 4197.68]  It's not Apple GTX.
[4197.80 --> 4198.60]  It's Apogee.
[4198.76 --> 4199.50]  You didn't say that.
[4199.58 --> 4200.26]  Someone in the chat did.
[4200.26 --> 4201.44]  Oh, I was going to say, yeah.
[4201.56 --> 4202.44]  No, you got it fine.
[4203.44 --> 4204.24]  This is okay.
[4204.46 --> 4205.18]  It's like, excuse me?
[4205.40 --> 4206.02]  Excuse me?
[4206.26 --> 4207.44]  I did not say this.
[4210.06 --> 4214.42]  But yeah, I had kind of a – because I hosted that video.
[4214.84 --> 4219.34]  So when this news came out, I was kind of happy in a horrible person kind of way.
[4219.44 --> 4219.76]  Yeah.
[4220.60 --> 4222.08]  Definitely horrible person kind of way.
[4222.08 --> 4225.32]  Duck Dodgers posted this on the forum.
[4226.32 --> 4228.54]  And the original article here is from Torrent Freak.
[4230.40 --> 4231.22]  This is interesting.
[4231.60 --> 4240.34]  Cracking Group warns, no more pirated games in as little as two years.
[4240.34 --> 4247.02]  So this is from – so the founder of the notorious Chinese cracking forum, 3DM, is warning that
[4247.02 --> 4251.38]  given the current state of anti-piracy technology, in two years there may be no more pirate games
[4251.38 --> 4251.80]  to play.
[4252.20 --> 4257.66]  And this comes after attempts to breach the DeNuvo security protecting Just Cause 3 pushed
[4257.66 --> 4261.26]  the group's cracking expert to the breaking point.
[4262.62 --> 4263.94]  Dun, dun, dun.
[4263.94 --> 4273.18]  Now, with that said, a lot was made of Blu-ray's copy protection, which, by the way, as someone
[4273.18 --> 4281.12]  who believes in paying for content but also believes in enjoying the content that he's
[4281.12 --> 4286.30]  paid for the way that he chooses to enjoy it, I have – I don't know if I should say
[4286.30 --> 4291.64]  this – I have definitely ripped DVD discs and Blu-ray discs that I own.
[4292.40 --> 4293.78]  I have definitely done that.
[4293.78 --> 4299.68]  Those files are definitely on a server for my private consumption when and where I feel
[4299.68 --> 4300.96]  like I want to consume them.
[4303.32 --> 4311.02]  So Blu-ray, speaking from experience, a Blu-ray disc is about as easy to rip as, you know,
[4311.26 --> 4315.84]  using clone DVD back in the day when it was DVDs, where you basically click a button.
[4316.90 --> 4319.38]  Yeah, it's supported in a lot of modern software.
[4319.62 --> 4319.82]  Yeah.
[4319.82 --> 4320.82]  Yeah.
[4320.82 --> 4327.36]  So do I necessarily believe that, you know, the DeNuvo security protecting Just Cause 3 will
[4327.36 --> 4328.00]  never be broken?
[4328.00 --> 4329.00]  No.
[4329.00 --> 4330.00]  No.
[4330.00 --> 4337.64]  But what I do believe is that encryption technology is continuing to improve in such a way that
[4337.64 --> 4345.02]  we may get to the point where cracking games that implement newer security measures all the
[4345.02 --> 4354.06]  time may become so time consuming that for people who are actually amped to play the game, like, you know,
[4354.06 --> 4357.56]  near the release time, they might end up just paying for it.
[4357.80 --> 4363.70]  Because otherwise you could end up waiting three, six months in order to enjoy the game, by which time
[4363.70 --> 4365.60]  all your friends might not even be playing it anymore.
[4365.60 --> 4370.98]  Because let's face it, whether we like it or not, gaming has become more about the multiplayer
[4370.98 --> 4374.42]  experience than about the single player experience, by and large.
[4374.46 --> 4376.88]  I'm talking AAA gaming, not necessarily like mobile gaming.
[4376.88 --> 4383.08]  So if you take away that social experience, well, what's the point anyway?
[4383.08 --> 4390.32]  So DeNuvo is a secondary encryption that actually protects existing and underlying DRM products,
[4390.54 --> 4395.48]  and another example would be FIFA 2016, which is still protected by DeNuvo and was released
[4395.48 --> 4397.96]  over three months ago.
[4397.96 --> 4403.42]  Doesn't, like, FIFA games often take longer?
[4404.98 --> 4406.12]  I thought that was a thing.
[4407.00 --> 4413.28]  When I was reading this, like, it's one Chinese cracking forum.
[4413.72 --> 4413.94]  Yep.
[4414.24 --> 4419.36]  There's often times, if you follow things, there's often, like, the one group that seems to be
[4419.36 --> 4420.56]  really good for a while.
[4420.86 --> 4424.94]  Like, one group will just kind of figure it out for a while, and then it will kind of trade
[4424.94 --> 4426.06]  which one's doing what.
[4426.18 --> 4426.30]  Yep.
[4426.30 --> 4430.78]  Um, certain games just always seem to just have problems.
[4431.52 --> 4433.36]  Maybe no one in that group cared.
[4434.18 --> 4437.64]  Maybe no one on 3DM is a FIFA fan.
[4440.16 --> 4441.08]  I don't know.
[4441.08 --> 4447.48]  But not enough demand is a really interesting reason for something to not end up getting
[4447.48 --> 4447.90]  cracked.
[4448.52 --> 4455.34]  And if the game's old, if it's like yesterday's news, then is it inherently not enough demand?
[4455.72 --> 4456.12]  Probably.
[4456.74 --> 4457.08]  Maybe.
[4457.48 --> 4458.08]  Maybe not.
[4458.56 --> 4459.28]  Like, maybe not.
[4460.00 --> 4460.82]  But possibly.
[4461.26 --> 4461.50]  Yeah.
[4462.92 --> 4463.56]  I don't know.
[4464.04 --> 4464.32]  Yeah.
[4465.32 --> 4466.76]  I also don't crack games.
[4467.60 --> 4467.88]  So...
[4467.88 --> 4468.26]  Me neither.
[4468.46 --> 4468.88]  I am not a...
[4468.88 --> 4470.22]  I don't really personally care.
[4470.26 --> 4471.50]  I'm not a cracker, so to speak.
[4471.68 --> 4471.96]  Oh!
[4471.96 --> 4476.72]  Although, hearing the news about Alan Rickman.
[4477.22 --> 4477.70]  Oh.
[4478.24 --> 4480.60]  I just found out, like, right before the show.
[4480.74 --> 4481.70]  I love Alan Rickman.
[4481.70 --> 4482.42]  Yeah, I haven't...
[4482.42 --> 4483.24]  I've been just...
[4483.24 --> 4485.16]  Well, yesterday I was completely busy with that.
[4485.22 --> 4485.76]  Super fun.
[4485.92 --> 4487.74]  And then I wrote and hosted...
[4487.74 --> 4489.88]  I wrote one video and hosted two videos.
[4490.00 --> 4490.96]  Like, that was my day yesterday.
[4491.02 --> 4494.00]  I didn't even touch my, like, phone, pretty much.
[4494.06 --> 4495.58]  And then, like, today...
[4495.58 --> 4496.36]  I don't even know what...
[4496.36 --> 4496.56]  Oh, yeah.
[4496.60 --> 4497.32]  Today I went to a funeral.
[4497.52 --> 4498.36]  I think that's one of the...
[4498.36 --> 4498.96]  Oh, wow.
[4500.18 --> 4500.54]  Indeed.
[4500.74 --> 4500.82]  Wow.
[4502.12 --> 4504.08]  I felt really bad immediately after saying that.
[4504.20 --> 4506.16]  Saying it in context actually seems worse.
[4506.60 --> 4507.34]  I don't know why.
[4508.62 --> 4510.26]  That's probably one of the first...
[4510.26 --> 4511.54]  I could be wrong about this.
[4511.60 --> 4515.68]  That's probably one of the first celebrity deaths that felt somewhat personal.
[4515.92 --> 4517.70]  Yeah, Robin Williams kind of hit me pretty hard.
[4519.84 --> 4521.18]  But, like, Alan Rickman...
[4521.18 --> 4522.12]  Alan Rickman hit me a lot hard.
[4522.12 --> 4525.58]  Like, my favorite movie when I was a kid was Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves.
[4525.64 --> 4526.94]  I've watched it since as an adult.
[4527.06 --> 4527.68]  It's a terrible movie.
[4527.70 --> 4528.26]  It doesn't matter.
[4528.80 --> 4529.62]  But it's not the point.
[4529.76 --> 4529.94]  Yeah.
[4530.20 --> 4532.82]  That movie was, like, freaking awesome when I was a kid.
[4532.88 --> 4535.42]  I watched that movie over and over and over again.
[4535.50 --> 4544.44]  And, like, he has had probably more, like, iconic, impactful roles for me than almost anyone else.
[4544.56 --> 4548.00]  Like, I rank him right up there with, like, Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks for me.
[4548.06 --> 4548.20]  Yeah.
[4548.82 --> 4550.30]  Like, he's awesome.
[4550.30 --> 4551.10]  And someone...
[4551.10 --> 4551.86]  It should feel awesome.
[4552.00 --> 4556.30]  Something that I didn't really get and I've always wondered about, like, celebrity deaths and stuff in the past.
[4556.30 --> 4561.62]  I've always been like, wow, I'm surprised the amount of discussion there is about this.
[4562.04 --> 4562.98]  Someone said something.
[4563.04 --> 4563.82]  I don't remember who it was.
[4564.26 --> 4567.30]  But they said it's, we're not sad because we knew them.
[4567.40 --> 4570.18]  We're sad because they helped us know ourselves or something.
[4570.24 --> 4571.24]  It was something along those lines.
[4571.24 --> 4573.90]  And I was like, whoa, that makes a lot of sense with Alan Rickman.
[4574.32 --> 4574.54]  Yep.
[4574.84 --> 4575.68]  So much.
[4575.82 --> 4576.88]  And I was like, okay, I get it.
[4577.16 --> 4578.40]  That's why I'm sad.
[4578.60 --> 4579.32]  That's exactly why I'm sad.
[4579.32 --> 4579.34]  Yeah.
[4579.34 --> 4583.84]  And it's like, sometimes a defining moment in your life can be a song you listened to or a movie you watched.
[4583.84 --> 4588.00]  Or just, like, a line that was delivered with a...
[4588.00 --> 4588.50]  I don't know.
[4588.50 --> 4589.08]  It's art, right?
[4589.16 --> 4589.48]  Always.
[4589.72 --> 4589.96]  It's art.
[4590.06 --> 4590.54]  It's intangible.
[4590.54 --> 4592.88]  From Alan Rickman and Harry Potter is, like, a huge thing for a lot of people.
[4593.24 --> 4600.94]  Anyways, to go to why this matters, last night when I was going to the store, I ended up looking for the entirety of the Harry Potter series.
[4601.12 --> 4601.38]  Oh, yeah.
[4601.56 --> 4604.36]  Because I was like, I actually don't have an easy way to watch this.
[4604.88 --> 4605.98]  That's probably not a bad idea.
[4606.00 --> 4606.60]  Get it at Costco.
[4606.70 --> 4607.88]  It was on during the holiday season.
[4607.98 --> 4608.66]  Very good deal.
[4608.66 --> 4615.44]  I, like, almost bought it, but Yvonne was like, well, we can get it when the kids are a bit older and they're ready to watch it because right now they're not ready yet.
[4615.52 --> 4616.06]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[4616.08 --> 4616.72]  Anyway, sorry, go ahead.
[4617.30 --> 4618.64]  But, like, I don't.
[4619.06 --> 4621.34]  For a long time, I've been like, it's probably on Netflix.
[4621.96 --> 4624.16]  And that's honestly been true for a huge amount of stuff.
[4624.26 --> 4626.76]  So I just kept my Netflix subscription and things have been fine.
[4627.24 --> 4629.54]  I don't think Harry Potter is, at least not in Canada.
[4630.48 --> 4632.54]  And then I was like, wow, I really want to re-watch this.
[4632.62 --> 4635.58]  I ended up looking at some clips on YouTube and stuff, and, like, that was great.
[4635.58 --> 4638.76]  But I was like, I want to re-watch the whole thing, and I don't want to pirate it.
[4638.84 --> 4642.96]  The Bud Monkey says that he wrote him a very moving letter when he was having some difficulties when he was younger.
[4643.10 --> 4643.60]  That's interesting.
[4643.98 --> 4644.72]  That's really cool.
[4646.20 --> 4649.66]  He's like a really, or he was like a really great dude.
[4649.76 --> 4650.56]  Yeah, I've heard that.
[4650.56 --> 4656.20]  And reading, reading, wow, what's the name of the dude that plays Harry Potter?
[4657.26 --> 4658.14]  Oh, Daniel Radcliffe.
[4658.20 --> 4658.66]  There we go.
[4658.90 --> 4660.06]  I had the initials.
[4660.18 --> 4661.38]  I had, it just wasn't quite there.
[4661.38 --> 4665.74]  Reading what Daniel Radcliffe had to say about him after his passing was really interesting as well.
[4665.82 --> 4667.30]  I was like a mentor and all this kind of stuff.
[4667.40 --> 4667.54]  Yep.
[4667.70 --> 4668.10]  Anyways.
[4668.88 --> 4669.24]  Yeah.
[4669.68 --> 4670.54]  Womp womp.
[4670.70 --> 4671.28]  So there you go.
[4671.60 --> 4671.80]  Yeah.
[4673.32 --> 4675.74]  AMD significantly cuts pricing on R9 Nano.
[4675.86 --> 4677.00]  That's literally all we have to say.
[4677.06 --> 4681.52]  It went from $6.49 to $4.99, which is actually super compelling and really, really cool.
[4681.68 --> 4681.96]  Yep.
[4682.78 --> 4683.66]  Because that's a solid card.
[4683.66 --> 4689.86]  Someone messaged me and they're like, wow, you need to review the R9 Nano now that the price is lower.
[4689.96 --> 4691.08]  I'm like, we've reviewed it.
[4691.14 --> 4692.40]  It's been in seven gamers.
[4692.56 --> 4693.72]  It's been in the bomb build.
[4693.84 --> 4694.78]  What have you been watching?
[4694.96 --> 4695.68]  I don't understand.
[4696.26 --> 4698.52]  We have so much coverage about this card.
[4700.00 --> 4701.24]  It's great that it's cheaper.
[4701.30 --> 4704.60]  And everything that we said before is the same.
[4704.80 --> 4705.04]  Yeah.
[4705.18 --> 4706.16]  But the price is lower.
[4706.26 --> 4707.86]  So I think you can probably do the math.
[4707.92 --> 4709.94]  Again, we're coming back to the grade four math here, kids.
[4710.60 --> 4710.88]  Okay.
[4711.42 --> 4712.28]  Pull out the calculator.
[4712.28 --> 4714.18]  They're literally a dollar at the dollar store.
[4714.78 --> 4715.10]  All right.
[4715.52 --> 4718.08]  FPS over dollars is how many frames per dollar?
[4718.84 --> 4719.44]  Or it's on your phone.
[4719.46 --> 4720.10]  Or it's on your phone.
[4720.20 --> 4720.38]  Yes.
[4720.80 --> 4721.36]  All right.
[4721.74 --> 4722.76]  This is interesting.
[4723.62 --> 4728.36]  Mushkin previews a $500 4TB SSD at CES.
[4728.42 --> 4735.94]  Now, this is something that I always kind of get my panties in a nod over is memory companies.
[4736.04 --> 4737.16]  And I'm talking RAM memory.
[4737.30 --> 4738.54]  I'm talking NAND memory.
[4738.70 --> 4740.70]  I'm talking even storage memory.
[4740.70 --> 4740.98]  Okay.
[4741.06 --> 4743.70]  So all like even hard drive memory.
[4743.82 --> 4744.84]  I know it's incorrect use of the word.
[4744.96 --> 4745.66]  Don't worry about it.
[4745.68 --> 4746.00]  It's not the point.
[4747.92 --> 4750.46]  Previewing a capacity bump.
[4750.58 --> 4755.84]  So a capacity of storage or RAM or whatever at a given price.
[4755.84 --> 4757.50]  But it's not available yet.
[4757.50 --> 4759.96]  Because I could do that.
[4760.50 --> 4765.98]  I could literally show you an empty box that's a 10 terabyte hard drive at $100.
[4767.68 --> 4769.14]  Release date TBD.
[4769.84 --> 4772.64]  And eventually I can deliver that.
[4772.64 --> 4774.66]  Thank you, Moore's Law.
[4774.98 --> 4775.18]  Yeah.
[4775.82 --> 4780.64]  However, there is some technology that went into this that is somewhat interesting.
[4781.64 --> 4794.92]  So basically what this is, is it's an update to their reactor series of SSDs that now supports 3D NAND and drive capacities up to 2 terabytes thanks to a new controller.
[4794.92 --> 4809.48]  Now they are taking that updated controller and they are actually putting it together with another separate controller that is going to run two of those other controllers in a JBOD.
[4809.64 --> 4813.08]  Which stands for, literally, it stands for just a bunch of disks.
[4813.24 --> 4814.70]  Which they might have to upgrade the term for.
[4815.34 --> 4815.72]  Yeah.
[4815.96 --> 4816.66]  Well, hmm.
[4816.74 --> 4817.46]  Just a bunch of drives.
[4817.74 --> 4818.02]  Just a bunch.
[4818.06 --> 4818.36]  Yeah.
[4818.64 --> 4818.88]  Hmm.
[4819.04 --> 4819.28]  Okay.
[4819.36 --> 4819.76]  Anyway.
[4820.30 --> 4820.74]  Right.
[4820.74 --> 4821.68]  I think it is disks.
[4821.92 --> 4822.08]  Yeah.
[4822.18 --> 4823.44]  But they should change it to drives.
[4823.60 --> 4823.80]  Yeah.
[4824.10 --> 4830.72]  Just kind of like how RAID changed from redundant array of inexpensive to redundant array of independent, I think.
[4830.92 --> 4835.76]  This is why we can never keep track of things, tech industry.
[4836.76 --> 4842.48]  So it's a four terabyte drive, but spanning drives like this.
[4842.48 --> 4848.82]  So basically, in theory, the way a JBOD works is that data is just kind of stored on wherever.
[4848.82 --> 4856.56]  And if one drive dies, all the files that were on that drive are gone, but the other one is completely left independent of the other one.
[4856.56 --> 4859.56]  Just makes you searching two drives look like you searching one drive.
[4859.72 --> 4859.88]  Yeah.
[4859.96 --> 4870.02]  It's basically like if you had a bunch of USB thumbsticks and you duct taped them all together, plugged them all in at the same time, and then assigned one drive letter to all of them.
[4870.32 --> 4870.58]  Yeah.
[4870.68 --> 4872.38]  That's basically JBOD, okay?
[4872.76 --> 4873.74]  But with hard drives.
[4873.74 --> 4875.52]  And with crappy performance.
[4875.68 --> 4882.72]  So Mushkin says to expect somewhere in the neighborhood of read and write performance of about 10k IOPS, which to be clear will still crush a hard drive.
[4883.44 --> 4887.50]  And with that kind of a price for something like bulk media storage.
[4888.30 --> 4888.74]  Games.
[4889.12 --> 4889.86]  Game storage.
[4889.92 --> 4891.16]  I wanted it for games.
[4891.38 --> 4892.78]  Could be freaking awesome.
[4892.78 --> 4898.54]  Fallout 4 takes like a really long time to load on my computer because I load it off a hard drive.
[4899.54 --> 4900.44]  It sucks.
[4900.66 --> 4901.44]  It takes forever.
[4901.74 --> 4902.56]  So there you go.
[4902.70 --> 4913.38]  To be clear, this is not as good a drive as something like that Samsung 3.84 that is on Vessel and not on YouTube yet that we checked out recently.
[4913.38 --> 4919.08]  Where it's got a single controller, it's enterprise grade drive, but it is really, really cheap.
[4919.18 --> 4920.28]  25 cents a gig.
[4920.70 --> 4926.44]  Like $500 is still really expensive for a single component in like an enthusiast grade rig.
[4926.94 --> 4932.68]  But it's also not completely outside of the realm of somewhat doable.
[4933.12 --> 4933.22]  Yeah.
[4933.58 --> 4936.72]  It's not $2,000 like that Samsung drive I just referred to.
[4936.72 --> 4940.32]  So love it, but it has to actually come out, Mushkin.
[4940.52 --> 4941.58]  So yeah.
[4941.84 --> 4945.22]  That was posted by Rani on the forum, by the way.
[4947.14 --> 4948.36]  This is kind of a bummer.
[4948.48 --> 4952.32]  Intel confirms Skylake crash erratum.
[4953.34 --> 4955.50]  Some bad news from the tech industry today.
[4955.60 --> 4955.90]  Yeah.
[4956.58 --> 4961.68]  I mean, to be clear, this is not the first time that something like this has happened.
[4961.92 --> 4965.60]  It's not the last time something like this will happen for either Intel or AMD.
[4966.72 --> 4967.92]  But it's a bummer.
[4968.08 --> 4973.38]  And there will be a BIOS update, which unfortunately doesn't help people who have systems that get crappy BIOS support.
[4973.94 --> 4981.04]  Or who have like OEM systems where the BIOS update is like difficult to do for no apparent reason.
[4981.30 --> 4982.54]  And that kind of sucks.
[4983.06 --> 4984.48]  But basically it's causing crashes.
[4985.54 --> 4988.10]  I don't really know what else to really say about that.
[4988.32 --> 4991.94]  The Intel has already given the updated code to their partners.
[4991.94 --> 4996.76]  You just have to wait for the Asuses and Dells and Lenovos of the world to implement them.
[4996.88 --> 5001.78]  And no one's really given a time frame on that.
[5003.22 --> 5003.66]  Yes.
[5004.40 --> 5005.28]  So yeah.
[5007.24 --> 5008.80]  Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
[5009.08 --> 5009.32]  Yeah.
[5009.38 --> 5010.44]  Hopefully fixed very soon.
[5011.54 --> 5014.06]  I don't really know what else we got here.
[5014.20 --> 5015.94]  That's like super duper important.
[5015.94 --> 5017.52]  Technically the show's done.
[5017.64 --> 5019.24]  If you have time we can after party.
[5019.34 --> 5021.36]  If you don't have time I can after party on my own.
[5021.72 --> 5023.56]  Which I'm going to be playing Valkyrie.
[5023.78 --> 5026.22]  Which is going to be kind of funny because I'm not going to be able to read the Twitch chat.
[5026.42 --> 5026.52]  So.
[5029.98 --> 5034.44]  I'm still waiting for someone to program a Twitch overlay for HMD.
[5034.44 --> 5039.26]  This is the next level of like you know ballin' Twitch streamers.
[5039.52 --> 5043.68]  Where they actually get to the point where they can just have someone like that they pay to.
[5043.68 --> 5044.80]  Read them the Twitch chat.
[5044.82 --> 5045.70]  To read them the Twitch chat.
[5045.96 --> 5045.98]  Yeah.
[5047.50 --> 5049.08]  It's like I'm really focused on the game.
[5049.20 --> 5053.04]  I'm calling in Jeeves to deal with Twitch chat for me.
[5053.10 --> 5054.60]  Jeeves what does the red text say?
[5055.24 --> 5056.76]  Tell me what's highlighted Jeeves.
[5057.66 --> 5058.82]  Actually this is interesting.
[5058.98 --> 5060.02]  Posted by Mr. Troll.
[5060.30 --> 5062.22]  Original article here is from Overclocked.net.
[5062.28 --> 5063.22]  It's just a post on the forum.
[5063.22 --> 5068.96]  AMD has begun shipping around samples of two different Polaris architecture chips.
[5069.12 --> 5070.50]  So four different GPUs.
[5070.86 --> 5073.80]  Basically a full fat looks like the top tier one.
[5074.22 --> 5075.88]  And then a cut down top tier GPU.
[5076.04 --> 5081.16]  So that would be your equivalent to you know R9 Fury X and an R9 Fury kind of thing.
[5081.60 --> 5085.18]  And then the what looks like some kind of a step down but full fat.
[5085.38 --> 5087.00]  And then a cut down version of that.
[5087.88 --> 5093.06]  Presumably some kind of a like you know a 380X type of grade GPU.
[5093.06 --> 5094.06]  Or something along those lines.
[5094.38 --> 5102.24]  It's gotten really gray with AMD because they've reused previous flagships a couple times now as mid tier.
[5102.44 --> 5103.32]  So I did that.
[5104.68 --> 5105.08]  Yeah.
[5105.28 --> 5108.86]  So anyway it looks like those have started being shipping around to be clear.
[5108.86 --> 5111.70]  That doesn't mean that they're coming out like tomorrow.
[5112.08 --> 5114.68]  That means probably sometime second half this year.
[5114.82 --> 5116.98]  Which would not be a surprising timeline at all.
[5117.10 --> 5117.28]  Yep.
[5117.68 --> 5125.14]  But what's cool is that for the first time in a long time both AMD and Nvidia are going to be delivering like probably.
[5125.40 --> 5128.70]  This is my speculation but it's based on facts that do exist.
[5128.70 --> 5131.72]  Rocking GPU upgrades.
[5131.92 --> 5135.32]  They really better because VR really needs it.
[5135.38 --> 5138.22]  Yeah the timing couldn't be couldn't be more dire.
[5138.88 --> 5143.62]  If they were like hibernating for the big boom now would be the time to do that.
[5143.94 --> 5148.08]  So this is the first actual die shrink in a very very long time.
[5148.14 --> 5150.48]  We've been stuck on 28 nanometer for a long time.
[5150.48 --> 5155.44]  20 nanometer planar technology was not not ready for GPU.
[5155.60 --> 5157.54]  Leakage was too high etc etc etc.
[5157.74 --> 5163.62]  So AMD it looks like will actually be sourcing from both Global Foundries and TSMC.
[5163.74 --> 5164.54]  So they're going to be leveraging.
[5165.30 --> 5170.84]  Correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's Global Foundries 14 nanometer and TSMC 16 nanometer process.
[5171.20 --> 5176.26]  Although it's not clear if they will be dual sourcing like AMD.
[5176.56 --> 5177.58]  Excuse me like AMD.
[5177.58 --> 5180.72]  Like Apple has done with the A9.
[5180.86 --> 5181.96]  I always lose track of this crap.
[5182.02 --> 5184.34]  Anyway with the chip in the iPhone 6S.
[5184.50 --> 5187.10]  Where they're actually sourcing the same chip from both Foundries.
[5187.52 --> 5191.66]  What AMD may be doing is sourcing some GPUs from one and some from the other.
[5191.74 --> 5192.74]  Like different products.
[5192.96 --> 5196.08]  Which would require some doing over of work.
[5196.26 --> 5200.00]  But not like a complete re-optimization and re-tuning of the chip.
[5200.06 --> 5202.54]  Like Apple would have had to do for the latest iPhone.
[5203.60 --> 5205.44]  So I think that pretty much wraps it up for the show.
[5205.44 --> 5208.20]  So thank you guys for tuning in.
[5208.56 --> 5209.88]  We will see you again next week.
[5210.08 --> 5211.18]  Same bat time.
[5211.38 --> 5213.54]  Same bat channel.
[5213.54 --> 5213.86]  No.
[5216.32 --> 5216.78]  I did.
[5216.78 --> 5226.18]  That was a good show.
[5226.18 --> 5226.20]  That was a good show.
[5236.06 --> 5237.50]  Go pot.
[5237.50 --> 5245.54]  Another one.
[5245.94 --> 5247.26]  There's two more.
[5249.16 --> 5250.34]  Oh, there's two more.
[5250.56 --> 5251.16]  Three more.
