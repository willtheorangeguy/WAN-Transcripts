[0.00 → 5.12] so just you know be aware that I'm broadcasting it's fine you can keep doing what you're doing
[5.12 → 11.68] taken apparently thinks building Lego crap at work is work or whatever yeah Lego like
[11.68 → 20.24] got you know brain hurricane or whatever it is seen I knew he can't resist it he has to
[20.24 → 26.40] correct me even though he knows like he absolutely knows on every possible level that
[26.40 → 33.12] I'm doing it on purpose he can't resist broom face he has to he has to correct me so wait sorry
[33.12 → 39.92] hold on a second is Lego windstorm related to Meccano see he did it again Meccano was that on
[39.92 → 46.16] purpose that time yeah of course okay, and he's leaving hey and you guys are coming on board
[46.16 → 50.48] welcome to the wan show it's going to be me and john here today we're going to be telling you about
[50.48 → 55.60] what's new in tech we're going to be trolling taken, and it'll be up to you guys to decide which of those
[55.60 → 64.80] things is better and or more important and of course you're here to find out why exactly it is
[64.80 → 71.76] that we're late today okay so I would love to tell you about that but I went and I left it um I left
[71.76 → 77.52] it over there well whatever I was working on a video actually yeah Pella do you mind grabbing that green
[77.52 → 82.96] and black video card that's kind of next to the inventory station sweet Pella's going to bring it over
[82.96 → 88.00] for us oh you haven't been introduced to Pella he's kind of shy I don't know if he's actually
[88.00 → 96.96] going to want to be on camera but um he works here he does something right sometimes
[96.96 → 104.00] sometimes so he works here okay um I've got people saying my pupils are huge uh it could be all the
[104.00 → 108.72] drugs that I took it's not that easy to get amped up for wan show how could they tell that your pupils
[108.72 → 117.20] are huge the camera's not that high-res I mean yay thank you all right, so this is what I was
[117.20 → 124.64] working on a five thousand dollar graphics card finding out just what makes it special so it's a
[124.64 → 130.24] squadron m6000 and there's a lot of there's a lot of discussion about these because they're very hard to
[130.24 → 135.12] get your hands on unless you have five thousand dollars that you want to trade for one of these
[135.12 → 144.24] um so I've seen people saying things all the way from squadron can't run games to that squadron run
[144.24 → 150.16] games better neither of which are true well there's only one way to find out and that's watching the
[150.16 → 156.40] episode of holy shit uh that's going to be coming pretty soon maybe I'm wrong stay tuned to find out
[156.40 → 160.24] yeah now some of you are probably kind of sitting here going really was that more important than
[160.24 → 164.96] starting the show on time and the answer is normally no normally that would not be more
[164.96 → 170.64] important than starting the show on time, but we ran into a bit of a production snafu uh one of the
[170.64 → 176.64] videos that was supposed to go out this weekend on vessel the b-roll wasn't done and then Brandon's
[176.64 → 182.56] out of office on a forced vacation right now uh seriously the guy wouldn't take his time off yeah I know
[182.56 → 192.00] so he has uh let's see uh seven weeks to take all of his time off because he hasn't booked off any
[192.00 → 200.16] and q4 is a blackout zone and so Yvonne actually just assigned him days, and she was just like you're
[200.16 → 205.84] not coming into the office on these days and is he going anywhere or is he just kind of hanging out
[205.84 → 212.56] and just not being here I suspect he's like sitting at home dreaming of work probably that's that's my
[212.56 → 217.20] best he's probably looking at camera gear that's my yeah he's probably he's probably like researching
[217.20 → 221.28] crap that he can hang in the lighting grid or whatever the case may be all right so let's get
[221.28 → 228.32] this show on the road and that begins with of course after the excuses the intro roll it
[235.84 → 265.60] wow it's so nice having the stream work properly the only thing that doesn't work properly is
[265.60 → 273.04] me being here on time so uh you guys should just skip the intro and do the excuses no I already did
[273.04 → 280.24] the excuses that's the whole point all right let's jump right into what I personally consider to be
[280.24 → 288.56] the big news this week, so the original article here is from CCF tech when I saw this I pretty much went
[288.56 → 295.12] bananas look at that AMD zen engineering sample benchmarks leak out
[295.60 → 303.60] the summit ridge CPU is apparently faster than the Intel Core i5 4670 in the um whatever it is
[303.60 → 308.56] yes ashes of the singularity benchmark program
[311.04 → 318.32] yes my friends I just covered for a weird grammatical slip up by pretending that the pauses
[318.88 → 323.92] were intentional it was very convincing that's a pro tip by the way I didn't get away with it did I
[323.92 → 331.92] when I have your job one day I'll keep that in mind okay all right well ah show up on time and work hard
[332.48 → 342.00] and other thing yes then profit question mark then profit okay so let's let's talk about this a little
[342.00 → 349.12] bit first yes I know the source is CCF tech bit of a rumour mill, but sometimes they do hit on things so
[349.12 → 354.80] bit of a rumour mill I mean it's one of those things where if you mill enough rumours eventually you will end up with a
[355.36 → 363.92] loaf of truth I was just about to say loaf of truth bread right in my mind perfect see we got synergy today all right
[364.32 → 371.44] um and there are things that you can consider there are things that you can do to sort of vet a particular rumour
[371.44 → 380.56] so one of them is you can kind of go okay does the what's the evidence, so the evidence here is not a leak
[380.56 → 391.04] from AMD it's a leak from a benchmark database so that that can be credible, or it can be non-credible
[391.04 → 396.32] because some benchmarks it's just a matter of like editing a text string somewhere, and you can make a
[396.32 → 401.92] product show up as though it is something else whereas other benchmarks especially ones where
[402.88 → 405.76] the publisher in particular wouldn't really have any reason to
[407.76 → 416.72] any reason to act like it's something that it's not um this can be an excellent way of uh of
[417.44 → 423.44] figuring out that yes that is indeed pretty credible so for example a leaked CPU said screenshot
[423.44 → 431.44] maybe I wouldn't put too much stock in it can you validate on CPU z a validated CPU z screenshot where
[432.00 → 438.88] the processor id shows up as intel engineering sample whatever code name usually those are
[438.88 → 448.96] pretty credible okay number two is timing is huge so AMD is figuring like the old quote if i
[448.96 → 453.20] recall correctly you'll have to forgive me AMD has changed the story a number of times on this
[453.20 → 459.84] but the old quote was that they would ship zen in late 2016. We are now getting towards well we're
[459.84 → 465.68] well into the second half of 2016 however they did say that it slipped and should be shipping sometime in
[465.68 → 475.36] early 2017. The timing for this leak is perfect because don't imagine for a second that a motherboard
[475.36 → 480.96] maker remember this is a new CPU and a new chipset this isn't a microcode update for existing
[480.96 → 484.40] motherboards and chipsets because it's been like what five years that will make no sense at this
[484.40 → 490.40] point exactly we are getting a new socket am4 we are getting a new chipset with support for ddr4
[491.28 → 498.48] finally uh support for PCI Express 3.0 finally i mean AMD has shipped multiple generations of
[498.48 → 506.08] graphics cards that support PCI Express technology that their CPUs and motherboards do not and even if you
[506.08 → 510.64] aren't um even if you're running like sort of a middle of the road or even a high-end GPU that's
[510.64 → 515.20] not going to saturate a PCIE two lanes it also means you can't take advantage of like the new storage
[515.20 → 521.20] options as well that's running an older PCIE revision that's right so basically the timing is pretty good
[521.20 → 528.16] don't imagine for a second that motherboard makers don't have some of the first working silicon in their
[528.16 → 533.52] labs so they can start to make sure that their motherboards work because AMD again this is a new
[533.52 → 540.88] platform AMD cannot launch a CPU until the motherboards are not only completed in the design
[540.88 → 549.20] stage of things but are actually tested and validated mass-produced packaged and shipped
[549.76 → 554.24] otherwise you might as well just hang the CPUs on your Christmas tree with that said okay this is
[554.24 → 560.88] kind of funny thing AMD has done that before they have launched CPUs before the motherboards
[560.88 → 565.04] were available to retail yeah yeah I don't I don't remember which one it was, but basically it was
[565.04 → 570.08] it wasn't a huge delay it was like a couple of days but like the CPUs were in stock you could build some
[570.08 → 575.68] hype that way I guess almost like pre-ordering a game I guess so pre-ordering a game except it's a game
[575.68 → 581.04] that you also need to buy like a special controller for, and then you have to pay shipping on
[581.04 → 588.88] the order separately so like guitar hero but to another degree yeah just ordering like a guitar
[588.88 → 598.16] hero like disc library and then not having the plastic guitar yet exactly, exactly okay so basically
[598.16 → 605.44] what I'm trying to say oh yeah so consideration number three is um what kind of performance we're
[605.44 → 615.28] seeing out of it an early leak that indicates that zen at 200 is going to crap all over the 6950x
[615.28 → 624.00] is probably designed by some AMD fanboy somewhere who wants people to be hyped up about AMD that's
[624.00 → 631.12] that doesn't have much credibility whereas this rumour looks pretty solid so
[633.76 → 639.60] let's get through this blah blah blah okay so the benchmarks so first and this is another
[639.60 → 643.20] important disclaimer the benchmarks are of an engineering sample and may not be entirely
[643.20 → 648.32] representative of the retail product with that said the product development timelines on things
[648.32 → 654.88] like CPUs are so long that if motherboard manufacturers and presumably that's that's where
[654.88 → 659.28] this ultimately came from at some point but if motherboard manufacturers or anyone else who has their
[659.28 → 666.88] hands on motherboards and CPUs um has silicon that they're actually using to validate anything
[666.88 → 673.44] it's probably pretty far along like there are sometimes very early chips that are clocked much
[673.44 → 679.68] much lower than the eventual retail ones end up being, but that's earlier on in the development
[679.68 → 686.80] process where there's still time to like tape it out again for example I don't think AMD is looking at
[686.80 → 691.36] if they're going to be launching the chip sometime in the next you know three to six months actually
[692.24 → 696.72] okay maybe, but that would be very tight like I don't think we're going to see anything that's
[696.72 → 701.04] dramatically different from what's here maybe some tweaked clock speeds maybe this is a lower end
[701.04 → 709.44] skew hard to say it was tested with an unnamed motherboard and a rx480 graphics card and the 1080p
[709.44 → 714.32] average frame rates and ashes of the singularity showed 58 fps for the zen engineering sample compared
[714.32 → 725.12] to 65.4 on an Intel Core i7 4790 and 52.6 on a 4670k so it's currently clocked at 2.8 gigahertz base
[725.12 → 730.32] 3.2 gigahertz boost and the benchmarks have since been pulled down by the source
[732.88 → 740.88] so AMD zen are you still hyped well I mean okay so I feel like the benchmark results are probably so
[740.88 → 747.20] acts is uh is it CPU bound at all I feel like it might be there, there yeah there's some CPU yeah so
[748.00 → 753.04] so we have a chip that's like on like a 14 nanometre process and I know there's like a lot more to it
[753.04 → 759.68] than just the transistor size, but it's what intel is currently using as well so it's its been such a
[759.68 → 766.88] long time since 2011 since we got anything new from them is in terms of architecture so it's also been
[766.88 → 773.36] completely redesigned by the team that was led by Jim Keller who has actually since moved on to tesla
[773.36 → 779.52] which is sort of a shame although AMD says that the groundwork has been laid for not only zen but
[780.08 → 785.68] improvements upon zen over the next couple of years though my concern then if I were said for
[785.68 → 792.80] example an AMD investor or an AMD fan would be well gee isn't that exactly what happened with the Athlon 64
[793.84 → 799.20] Jim Keller led the team that designed it, and you iterated on it after he left and then just kind of
[799.20 → 804.24] kept iterating on it after he left and that was sort of all we had for the next I don't know 10 years
[804.24 → 811.92] um but uh sorry let's let's get this let's get this straw poll up so I just posted a straw poll
[811.92 → 819.68] are you guys still amped for zen let's see the results here boom 45 of you saying yes
[820.88 → 826.88] with nine percent of you saying no and 45 of you saying you were never so basically
[826.88 → 834.72] in a nutshell this has not really dampened the spirits of anyone who was legitimately excited
[834.72 → 840.72] about zen in the first place, and you know what I am actually in the same camp on this because
[841.52 → 850.16] I don't need AMD to come back Athlon 64 style um and take the performance crown that is actually
[850.16 → 856.56] not what we need at all because at the performance crown level is not where intel has been stagnant
[857.20 → 863.60] you look back at the last three or four generations they've given us the 3960x the first six core
[864.32 → 871.28] consumer, but they gave us a six core consumer okay the generation after that they gave us a six core
[871.28 → 877.68] consumer for a little over half the price of the previous one and a faster six core in the 4960x
[877.68 → 883.84] the year after that they bumped the core count, and they drove pricing of six cores no wait no that
[883.84 → 889.36] 5820 was still a hold on yeah 5820k was still a six core if I recall correctly right yeah just it
[889.36 → 894.64] just has fewer PCI lanes than some of the other ones do that's right 28 PCI Express lanes versus 40.
[894.64 → 901.84] so at the enthusiast level okay we got an eight core we still got a cheaper six core, and we got an even
[901.84 → 906.72] cheaper six core but with fewer PCIE lanes which quite frankly for consumers is completely irrelevant you
[906.72 → 911.92] can quote me on that especially these days with the SLI limitations that's right and then and I mean
[911.92 → 915.36] even in the previous days when the SLI wasn't limited, but you should have been doing it anyway
[915.36 → 921.20] yeah it's still scaled horribly so just why exactly yeah and then in the latest generation we got a 10
[921.20 → 927.12] core at the top range which is sort of more of a moving the bar of the top range and less of delivering
[927.12 → 932.80] us a 10 core for what used to be with a price to match yeah exactly, but then we still get eight and six
[932.80 → 939.92] cores for and I think in particular the 6800k is a pretty compelling skew on the enthusiast platform
[939.92 → 947.04] you get six cores really high clock speeds, and you get overclocking and there okay it was the same
[947.04 → 951.68] thing that we said in our review i think it's because it retails for like what 350 somewhere
[951.68 → 956.16] that ballpark a little higher I think so, but it's not ridiculous yeah yeah it's its doable it's not a
[956.16 → 961.84] thousand dollars yeah seventeen hundred dollars it's its not completely outlandish yeah so actually
[961.84 → 968.88] at the performance crown end of things intel hasn't been sitting on ass to quite the same degree
[970.08 → 978.64] with that said what they have done is they have ramped up pricing in the performance crown halo tier
[978.64 → 986.88] and the reason you can ramp up pricing of your halo tier products is not necessarily because
[986.88 → 993.76] there isn't a competitor who's also releasing halo tier products at a lower price in fact if they
[993.76 → 998.80] both had haloed tier products you can bet that they would both be selling us CPUs for a thousand dollars
[998.80 → 1004.48] a pop in fact it's happened everyone likes to treat AMD like they're these like good guys champions of you
[1004.48 → 1009.60] know cheap CPUs for consumers they are not it's about strategy like what market segment are you going
[1009.60 → 1015.44] to target that's right you go back far enough AMD introduced the thousand dollar enthusiast processor
[1015.44 → 1022.72] they started this thing and people forget that so that's not the problem is that intel has
[1022.72 → 1032.56] the luxury of holding not only the performance crown but also the mainstream enthusiast segment where AMD
[1032.56 → 1041.28] is only really competing in the very high-end range with their Apus and in the desperate AMD fanboy range
[1041.28 → 1049.68] with their FX CPUs that's all AMD really has so because intel is not putting any pressure on their
[1049.68 → 1058.72] enthusiast processors by continuing to sell us quad cores for an entire decade an entire decade intel has
[1058.72 → 1062.48] said quad-core is enough for the mainstream, and you know what they're probably right, but that isn't the
[1062.48 → 1067.04] point of what I'm saying the point is they are not giving us the other stuff because they don't have
[1067.04 → 1073.52] to because the only one putting pressure on the enthusiast making us do a cost per performance per core
[1073.52 → 1080.80] value calculation on the enthusiast chips is intel, and they're going yeah that's how much a six core
[1080.80 → 1086.32] costs because if you want to spend less all you can get to quad-core, and you can argue till you're blue
[1086.32 → 1092.48] in the face about AMD's six cores and eight cores but let's get real performance matters how many
[1092.48 → 1098.56] cores you write on the side of the box doesn't matter and intel's eight cores have nothing to do
[1098.56 → 1103.28] or rather AMD's eight cores have nothing to do with intel's eight cores they're not they're not the same
[1103.28 → 1108.32] thing yeah they're not even comparable in terms of like single threaded and all that so no they're not
[1108.32 → 1115.68] yeah yeah it's its not even it's not even a conversation so am I amped for zen knowing that
[1115.68 → 1122.96] zen is not necessarily going to go toe to toe with the 6700k that's not the point of zen absolutely I'm
[1122.96 → 1134.56] amped exactly if zen gives us great performance at 200 bucks then mission accomplished AMD will have
[1134.56 → 1140.32] effectively dramatically increased their average selling price if they can move a bunch of new
[1140.32 → 1144.88] generation FX whatever it is they end up calling them FX zen CPUs I actually don't know what the
[1144.88 → 1149.68] branding is going to be for them but if they can move a whack ton of those it'll drive up AMD's asps
[1149.68 → 1155.12] that's their average sell price it will improve AMD's profitability give them money to spend on r d which
[1155.12 → 1162.24] they have been sorely lacking and maybe give them a shot to come back with another punch after zen that
[1162.24 → 1168.56] really puts some pressure on intel in the meantime giving people who want to buy a high performance
[1168.56 → 1176.32] value computer a legitimate option because after the 200 mark even like closer to 230 bucks diminishing
[1176.32 → 1181.12] returns yeah intel really starts to lock you down they kind of go okay yeah we're gonna really
[1181.12 → 1186.08] start to ramp down clock speed I actually did a lot of analysis on intel's lineup for a video that i
[1186.08 → 1191.92] worked on recently called which intel CPU should I buy um don't worry there will be an AMD follow-up but I'm
[1191.92 → 1196.96] waiting for zen because right now the answer is a cheap APU if you want a cheap machine that runs an APU
[1197.68 → 1203.92] um so I did a lot of research, and you start to get into dual cores really quickly down at the bottom
[1203.92 → 1210.40] of intel's lineup and the reality of it is when it comes to cost of the silicon there is no real reason
[1210.40 → 1217.04] that intel should still be shipping a dual-core at least not over a hundred dollars so I would love
[1217.04 → 1222.32] for zen to bring the fight to intel in that mainstream segment in a real meaningful way
[1222.32 → 1229.60] in much the same way that Rx 480 has been a smash hit at the 200 to 250 dollar price point even though
[1229.60 → 1235.76] AMD doesn't have an answer for anything above that yeah it's a very similar strategy you know um because
[1235.76 → 1241.68] Rx 480 is not designed they're not targeting like the GTX 1080 they're targeting the middle of the market and
[1241.68 → 1245.28] it looks like they're going to be doing the same thing with zen which makes a lot of sense I think people
[1245.28 → 1250.64] are kind of tired of uh being quoted unquote trapped in you know intel's ecosystem because if you want
[1250.64 → 1256.72] like a modern CPU they're kind of your only option and in addition to paying like a sort of extra you
[1256.72 → 1262.08] know intel tax if you will on just, just like you were talking about so yeah and I mean there's more
[1262.08 → 1266.16] to there's more to modern than just the CPU because I would even make the argument that
[1267.12 → 1271.60] you know you could buy used intel hardware you could go grab a 3770k
[1272.40 → 1278.00] overclock that still a perfect processor great processor, and you know if you want to go back to
[1278.00 → 1282.48] the enthusiast platform ones assuming you can find a board and I talk about this in my what CPU should I
[1282.48 → 1288.80] buy video but assuming you can find a board uh you can go back to something like a 3960x you can get
[1288.80 → 1294.40] those on Amazon for like 180 200 bucks I saw them used yeah and I haven't checked out eBay lately but like
[1294.40 → 1298.88] yeah you can get like a six core for a pretty good value overclock the snot out of that thing the problem is
[1298.88 → 1304.24] the platform so you're going to be missing a lot of usb3 ports you're going to be missing USB 3.1
[1304.24 → 1309.60] 10 gigabit for sure you're going to be missing m.2 you're going to be missing um things that require
[1309.60 → 1314.64] bios level support even though the hardware is there, so something like a NVMe SSD that goes into a PCIE
[1314.64 → 1319.44] slot you're not going to have support for that um bottlenecked by that by the interface exactly
[1319.44 → 1323.60] the board yeah, yeah well not even just that um the motherboard manufacturer has to specifically
[1323.60 → 1330.24] enable it yeah they have to add bios support for it and let's face it you show me a motherboard
[1330.24 → 1336.80] manufacturer that cares about their motherboards after the product cycle is over and I will show
[1336.80 → 1342.56] you an incredulous face like this I like to say I'll put a unicorn in your driveway yeah that's good too
[1342.56 → 1352.56] yeah yeah I'll put a unicorn in your incredulous face bam all right so uh let's see what are people
[1352.56 → 1359.04] saying they're saying they have expansion slots so it's not quite that is a good point yeah but
[1359.04 → 1364.40] there's some stuff that you will not get with an expansion slot thunderbolt comes to mind thunderbolt
[1364.40 → 1368.80] must have support at the board level before you can add an expansion card to it even though some
[1368.80 → 1375.36] other boards do support expansion cards um notably the rampage 5 extreme that I have in my personal rig
[1375.36 → 1380.88] doesn't have it on board, but there's a header like a data header that you can plug in this specific
[1380.88 → 1385.92] expansion card and that specifically will work native support just seems to play more nicely with
[1385.92 → 1392.00] things overall that's right so like I know like on the upcoming um the kb lake from intel that is
[1392.00 → 1398.80] going to have native I think um USB 3.1 perhaps without needing like an add-in chip I think kb lake was
[1398.80 → 1403.92] also going to add uh thunderbolt 3 that that's what it might be both yeah I think you're
[1403.92 → 1408.80] right actually it was one or the other yeah it had three in it, I just remember that but yeah all right
[1409.84 → 1415.36] um so the flash memory summit this is sort of a big deal if you're into if you're into that kind
[1415.36 → 1419.68] of thing the original article here is from Engadget have you not been able to load this up yet I have
[1419.68 → 1425.76] two factors so yeah just go get it okay that's fine don't worry don't worry I'm all good I'm all good
[1425.76 → 1436.32] in the hood Seagate's new 60 terabyte SSD dwarfs others on the market, and we're talking both in
[1436.32 → 1443.68] terms of the capacity and in terms of the actual physical size now Seagate's 60 terabyte SSD that
[1443.68 → 1449.68] they showed off is not the first three and a half inch SSD that I've ever seen in fact let's see if i
[1449.68 → 1459.36] can find a picture of it the Oct colossus with a whopping two-star rating over on newegg.ca here
[1459.36 → 1467.68] the Oct colossus took a similar approach back in oh man what was this like around 2013 2012
[1468.40 → 1474.40] something like that I want to say where they just went to a three and a half inch form factor
[1474.40 → 1481.92] only so that they could stuff more flash chips onto a larger PCB in order to ship a capacity that
[1481.92 → 1487.28] otherwise wasn't possible the problem with the colossus and the reason that you're not going to
[1487.28 → 1493.60] be buying one of Seagate's 60 terabyte SSDs unless you are I actually have no idea who the customers are
[1493.60 → 1500.40] for these no idea video production companies maybe no I don't think so I'm kidding I don't think so like
[1500.40 → 1505.76] who needs 60 terabytes of solid state storage and doesn't already have like on a single drive
[1505.76 → 1511.04] okay yeah on a single drive with a SAS interface I mean the cheap way the incredibly cheap response
[1511.04 → 1517.60] here would be no one will ever need more than 64 kb of ram, but you make I said it was a cheap response
[1517.60 → 1522.48] you make a good point that is a cheap response especially the fact that it's on a single drive
[1522.48 → 1528.16] over us well okay it's a dual interface drive but over over over just a dual SAS interface
[1528.88 → 1533.60] instead of being like 60 terabytes of flash storage in like a ginormous server that has
[1533.60 → 1538.24] oodles and oodles of read and write bandwidth and can handle hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[1538.24 → 1544.24] IOPS to like this you know ball and interface thing anyway so the problem that they're going to run into
[1544.24 → 1549.20] is the same one as before it's a lot of capacity it's a single interface still so you're not really
[1549.20 → 1555.28] getting a performance benefit for the size and last but not least there is not really a cost benefit
[1555.28 → 1563.28] because you still have to buy all of those flash dies so let's go ahead and see if we can find the uh
[1564.88 → 1571.20] let's see where is it blah blah blah how many how many packages can't remember it was
[1571.20 → 1576.80] something ridiculous and unfortunately this version of the article doesn't have that information there was
[1576.80 → 1583.28] a different one that I was looking at when I was just like tooling around reading about this but uh blah blah blah
[1583.28 → 1590.48] blah blah blah this is great the actual marketing line for this is reach one petabyte of
[1590.48 → 1598.00] storage with only 17 drives wow fantastic
[1598.00 → 1608.00] um right now it is only a demo unit in fact we have reached out to Seagate asking if they can get
[1608.00 → 1614.32] us a unit just for like another an episode of holy shit or something like that because this thing's
[1614.32 → 1621.68] going to cost like okay if I had to guess I'd say it's going to cost over 25 000 for sure probably more
[1621.68 → 1627.04] depending on who exactly the target is because the performance of it is shockingly not that bad again
[1627.04 → 1631.28] this is something that was covered in the other article I was looking at and unfortunately isn't in this one
[1631.92 → 1641.36] um four terabytes per watt of power consumption that's fantastic uh ultra dense NAND technology from micron
[1641.36 → 1650.64] and uses a unique approach where Seagate is actually still using a single controller to access all the NAND flash
[1650.64 → 1657.44] so then they're just using what are effectively kind of like switch technology to allow each
[1657.44 → 1662.32] uh like each channel of the controller to access many many many more flash dies than they otherwise
[1662.32 → 1665.76] would be able to is this like a proprietary controller they developed or is it something else well Seagate's
[1665.76 → 1672.80] been investing very heavily in flash even though they don't actually fab anything as I recall
[1673.36 → 1679.20] um so yeah it wouldn't surprise me and they I mean they acquired um they acquired LSI a little while back yeah more
[1679.20 → 1684.80] companies seem to be getting involved and then WD um start um trying to get involved with NAND
[1684.80 → 1690.64] yeah they purchased SanDisk or maybe that's not true no I think that happened I remember hearing
[1690.64 → 1696.00] about it but I could be wrong uh it said no it completes 2016 completes the act so a couple of months
[1696.00 → 1701.92] like three months ago they finished up with that yep okay all right so I guess that's pretty much
[1701.92 → 1708.40] all there is to it there's a 60 terabyte SSD which is four times the capacity of the next leading SSD
[1708.40 → 1716.96] Samsung's pm whatever it's called pm 1633a which is a 15 terabyte SSD we had actually reached out to
[1716.96 → 1720.72] Samsung that's in a two and a half inch form factor though by the way we had actually reached out to
[1720.72 → 1726.00] Samsung about getting us one of those, and they were not able to do so nor did they even reply
[1726.00 → 1732.16] to our emails i actually wanted it for a specific project I wanted it for the world's most
[1732.16 → 1739.12] expensive PlayStation 4 a water-cooled PlayStation 4 with you know 15 terabytes of solid state storage
[1739.12 → 1745.68] I thought that'd be pretty cool but no all right also from the flash summit to Shiva and the original
[1745.68 → 1755.68] article here is from the register.co.uk to Shiva teases an even higher capacity SSD quad level cell
[1756.00 → 1761.60] uh yes I'm assuming that's what the q stands for yeah so four bits per cell which we should probably
[1761.60 → 1767.28] explain a little bit uh there's the fastest possible episode about bits per cell why don't you do that
[1767.28 → 1771.12] explanation I've been doing a lot of talking I'm going to go get a drink of water you explain why
[1771.12 → 1779.36] oh yeah okay it's been a while since I've looked at this but the gist of it is that so if you were buying
[1779.36 → 1784.96] a SSD usually what you'll see on the product page is it'll indicate whether the SSD
[1785.52 → 1793.36] is SLC MLC or TLC and what that refers to is how many bits of data each little memory cell inside
[1793.36 → 1800.64] the Nan flash can hold so a SLC drive can only hold one bit per cell whereas a TLC drive can hold
[1800.64 → 1807.68] three and more sounds better as far as um it just more obviously sounds better but uh the capacity but
[1807.68 → 1813.92] um as far as capacity sounds better but um usually TLC drives they tend to be um a little bit slower
[1813.92 → 1822.40] performance wise um, so this is a new q PLC drive that holds four bits per cell so we might be able
[1822.40 → 1827.76] to see some really, really good capacities with it and indeed they're teasing their this I guess
[1827.76 → 1831.84] it's a prototype, but they're teasing it as being a hundred terabytes there's not a lot that's
[1831.84 → 1838.48] been confirmed right now on this it looks like it's all talk um the PLC technology was also released
[1838.48 → 1844.72] released very recently um it looks like it would be a 3d SSD so um I guess the company that's most
[1844.72 → 1850.64] famous for this is Samsung because they marketed their um 3d their 3d SSDs pretty heavily where
[1850.64 → 1856.00] instead of having the chips all on one plane they're actually stacked like so it'll increase
[1856.00 → 1863.04] uh the data density um so we're looking at a 3d SSD with um PCIE gen 3 interface so it's not SATA
[1863.04 → 1870.16] is PCI Express um over 100 terabytes of capacity and oh hi Linus um three gigabytes a second uh
[1870.72 → 1875.76] sequential read and one gigabyte per second um sequential right um that three gigabytes per
[1875.76 → 1881.12] second yeah that's that's quite a bit more than like Samsung has their 950 which is I think their
[1881.12 → 1886.48] their highest-end thing right now that I can find but um three I think is almost a whole gig higher than
[1886.48 → 1892.32] that if my memory serves me correctly yeah, and it's not even NVMe either because this is uh let's see what
[1892.32 → 1898.40] like what interface is it even using uh blah blah blah blah blah blah blah well that's that's a big
[1898.40 → 1905.28] deal isn't it because um more bits per cell usually means it's a bit slower yeah so yeah but I'm so but
[1905.28 → 1912.16] this is but because it's its 3d, and it's NVMe so there are a couple of things to bear in mind here so
[1912.16 → 1920.96] you've got a lot of NAND dyes you have many many many flash chips that you can read from and
[1920.96 → 1925.20] you can write too so assuming your controller isn't a bottleneck assuming you have a sophisticated
[1925.20 → 1933.28] enough controller you can do these massive throughput numbers even though we're talking PLC flash which
[1934.88 → 1938.64] it surprises me that they're putting this in an enterprise product first quite frankly well I think
[1938.64 → 1943.52] um it seems to be focused more on kind of like playing the copy and paste game or moving huge files
[1943.52 → 1950.64] around because also you look at the random read and write which is measured in iOS it's only 50 000 and 14 000 for
[1950.64 → 1955.52] read and write respectively and you's extremely easy to find very affordable consumer level
[1956.32 → 1962.72] SATA SSD I think SATA SSDs yeah SATA SSDs that have numbers way above that so it's oh yeah it seems
[1962.72 → 1967.60] to be more suited for a media farm where you're moving around huge files where you get those sorts
[1967.60 → 1971.52] of like perfect speeds like something that I would even okay so here again like so here's something
[1971.52 → 1979.52] I would wonder are you even better off let's say you were um you were one of Netflix's uh one
[1979.52 → 1986.72] of Netflix's things where they want to install their hardware in an ISP's um space right so yeah
[1988.40 → 1994.40] the term is escaping me, but it's its Friday okay it's Friday it's been a long week for everyone
[1995.12 → 2002.56] so if I was Netflix the idea is I want to use as little rack space as possible I want to store as many
[2002.56 → 2008.72] movies as I can and I want to serve as many customers without unnecessary delays and buffering
[2008.72 → 2015.92] as I can so very high capacity drives look like well hey that might be a very very very good idea
[2016.80 → 2022.56] except that by the time you are starting to hit these drives with a lot of random operations are they
[2022.56 → 2028.08] even any better off than mechanical well couldn't you split your workload then like let's say just
[2028.08 → 2033.52] just accesses to your web page or things like validating a login couldn't you couldn't, you do
[2033.52 → 2040.48] that with like something faster on the random, and then you just have these do nothing but um host videos
[2040.48 → 2044.40] and then if you were going to do that if you're going to split the workload anyway then why don't
[2044.40 → 2049.76] you just have why don't you spread out this data over more drives so that people are less likely to be
[2049.76 → 2055.68] trying to hit the same thing at the same time well you you could just like to buy a bunch of
[2055.68 → 2060.08] these and array them together, but then that would get very expensive probably, so this is kind of
[2060.08 → 2067.04] scary um the PLC drive would have a three petabyte to six petabyte workloads over its lifetime
[2069.68 → 2078.00] so what does that workload over its lifetime what that sounds like to me is that you could only write
[2078.00 → 2084.48] this drive and correct me if I'm wrong somewhere between 30 to 60 times okay, so a petabyte is a thousand
[2084.48 → 2091.76] TB so so like a million gigabytes yeah would be a petabyte yeah yeah that actually yeah you think
[2091.76 → 2097.28] of something like Netflix that would so it seems like you would have to get a lot of these so well
[2097.28 → 2101.84] no you would to be so you're right I mean they only change their library every once in a while uh-huh so
[2101.84 → 2108.08] as long as they're smart about how they utilize them maybe it helps oh no okay so hold on a second
[2108.08 → 2112.40] this is using a PCI Express interface by the way I think I might have said it was sassed or something before but
[2112.40 → 2120.72] yeah no it's PCI let's move into sponsors for today number one is Squarespace and Nick isn't here so
[2120.72 → 2125.52] I don't have to do the Squarespace read the way he says to do it so I'm going to say Squarespace
[2126.40 → 2132.72] old slogans about Squarespace has many slogans some of which were very good like I personally liked build
[2132.72 → 2139.68] it is beautiful a lot and some of them well should have been changed like Squarespace you should but they
[2139.68 → 2146.88] change it yeah they change it all the time now it appears to be Squarespace set your website apart
[2146.88 → 2153.28] by using one of our template designs okay no but really Squarespace is a great way to build a website
[2153.28 → 2158.24] and not all Squarespace sites look the same they have a wide variety of different templates and once
[2158.24 → 2163.52] you gussy them up with artwork you customize them you put your own copy on their boom you end up with a
[2163.52 → 2169.52] gorgeous website that just freaking works all the time Squarespace allows you to edit your website through
[2169.52 → 2175.20] their cloud-based tool they uh oh I had ah crap I was leading oh yes they handle all the hosting so
[2175.20 → 2179.84] you don't have to worry about like a server somewhere that you might accidentally throw an USB drive or
[2179.84 → 2185.20] whatever the case may be and our Squarespace site this is actually this is such a fun fact our Squarespace
[2185.20 → 2191.60] site has never gone down linusmediagroup.com well okay it did go down, but that was a domain registrar
[2191.60 → 2195.92] issue that actually had so we were actually we were directing the domain to the wrong place due to a
[2195.92 → 2202.16] compromised account etc, etc anyway um it did not go down because of Squarespace's service all their
[2202.16 → 2206.80] templates are feature responsive design so it means they look great on any size screen they've got
[2206.80 → 2212.00] commerce that comes with every site so you can sell stuff on your page if you want to and their cover
[2212.00 → 2218.40] pages feature allows you to be one of those obnoxious web 2.0 companies who have no information on their
[2218.40 → 2223.52] website whatsoever other than the name of the company and like a slogan they have video backgrounds now too
[2223.52 → 2231.28] please don't make those sites but if you must make it using Squarespace you can save 10 off your
[2231.28 → 2238.64] first purchase by heading over to oh there we go squarespace.com when and by the way you can try it
[2238.64 → 2243.20] for free for a couple of weeks to just decide if it's right for you there's no credit card required
[2244.32 → 2249.60] speaking of trying things have you ever thought to yourself gee I'd sure like to learn something today but
[2250.24 → 2257.44] going to school is expensive and a lot of work and my life is busy and I have stuff to do well lynda.com
[2257.44 → 2261.44] could be the solution for you, it's used by literally millions of people around the world which is you
[2261.44 → 2268.16] go and crunch the numbers means that lynda.com at what is it 25 bucks a month is where their plans start
[2268.80 → 2270.80] is like a pretty balling company
[2272.96 → 2278.80] seriously like balling which I guess is why they sponsor the wan show and also because they're just
[2278.80 → 2283.76] generally good guys we have a number of people here at Linus media group that use skills they
[2283.76 → 2289.92] learned on lynda.com to get ahead in life by getting a job at Linus media group they've got more than
[2289.92 → 2294.88] 3 000 courses available in topics like web development photography visual design business
[2294.88 → 2301.04] software training like excel WordPress photoshop things like digital camera operation video editing
[2301.04 → 2305.60] that's pretty cool I don't know what you're doing right now oh you're touching the screen okay that's good
[2305.60 → 2310.80] they show you how to operate computers actually they have tons of different courses, and they're
[2310.80 → 2315.60] taught by industry experts with new courses added every week so whether you want to take your hobby
[2315.60 → 2320.32] to the next level or you want to take your career to the next level try out lynda.com and find out if
[2320.32 → 2325.04] it's right for you there's a free 10-day trial at lynda.com slash wan show and then
[2326.40 → 2332.96] no I do not have an offer code for that so sorry, but it's worth it I'm not sure what you're doing
[2332.96 → 2342.24] reading the wan doc me no what you just said to me oh no, no I just know I couldn't see the screen
[2342.24 → 2346.40] through the microphone, and you were just like kind of like it looked like you were kind of like
[2346.40 → 2351.12] fawning at the screen or something I was like is he playing with it, I just wasn't sure what was going
[2351.12 → 2359.60] on I wasn't sure what was going on uh all right Denuvo has been successfully cracked this has been a long
[2359.60 → 2365.44] time coming actually Denuvo has held up surprisingly well so for those of you who don't know Denuvo is
[2365.44 → 2375.36] a copy protection scheme for games, and it's over it has been successfully cracked with both doom and
[2375.36 → 2381.84] rise of the Tomb Raider apparently already available online with a functional bypass for Denuvo's anti
[2381.84 → 2391.60] tampering technology it was the crack was created by a Bulgarian hacker called Roxy Roxy Roxy Roxy can
[2391.60 → 2399.04] you do a Bulgarian accent I have no idea what they sound like Bulgaria all right uh well he's also
[2399.04 → 2405.68] working on a crack for just cause 3 along with several other recent Denuvo titles the crack exploits
[2405.68 → 2411.60] a bug in steam which allows users to play the full game while steam thinks the game is a free demo version
[2412.48 → 2417.84] it appears as though just given that this is a steam exploit uh that it could be fixed
[2417.84 → 2425.12] with a steam update so it may not be functional for long so there you have it so you will either
[2425.12 → 2430.96] have to buy the game, or you will have to never update steam again DRM versus hackers it's just like
[2430.96 → 2440.72] a never-ending battle all right quantum break is officially coming to steam this is in our rapid fire
[2440.72 → 2445.76] news topics let's go ahead and drop that in the twitch chat in case you guys are sort of curious
[2445.76 → 2450.32] about it at all let's go the original article here is from overclock3d.net
[2450.32 → 2460.40] I will go ahead and go back to my thing so basically it's coming September 14th 2016 so in about a month
[2460.40 → 2466.40] uh it this will end its exclusivity in the Windows store I would love to say that I think this is
[2466.40 → 2472.56] because Microsoft just has the best interests of gamers at heart and wants to support a more open
[2472.56 → 2476.88] ecosystem in fact they've even made some statements that would seem to support that kind of do not
[2476.88 → 2484.08] walk on the green screen second person I caught doing that today we're going to have to repaint that
[2484.08 → 2490.96] whole thing that is a hassle that is a royal hassle hashtag fired hashtag no he's not fired I'm just
[2490.96 → 2502.08] if he does it again he might be oh man anyway sorry uh it includes all the updates that are
[2502.08 → 2507.52] available in the Windows 10 store version will support direct x 11 and will not be a universal
[2507.52 → 2511.44] windows platform game meaning that any of the limitations that come with that whether they're
[2511.44 → 2519.28] related to benchmarking multimap or whatever the case may be frame rate limits will not be imposed on it
[2520.96 → 2526.88] I'm still a little bit surprised that games that there are Windows app store no sorry not windows
[2526.88 → 2533.04] app store just Windows store exclusive games yeah it surprises me a little bit by the time it sinks in
[2533.04 → 2538.72] for you my hope is that it will be over yeah there you go but then again they've demonstrated as they
[2538.72 → 2542.88] did with games for windows live that they're willing to stick with a terrible thing for an awful long
[2542.88 → 2549.04] time before giving up that's kind of human nature I guess so yeah well this thing is basically on fire
[2549.04 → 2556.80] but let's stick with it anyway yeah pretty much yeah all right let's go ahead and uh oh this is kind
[2556.80 → 2563.20] of fun, so the first commercial mission to the moon approved for Florida company moon express
[2564.00 → 2568.96] I already love the name of their company it sounds like a planet express from fissural
[2568.96 → 2574.72] it is really like a delivery service to the moon i I have to I have to wonder if it's intentional
[2574.72 → 2580.72] like I hope it's intentional that's freaking awesome so the U.S. government has given them the
[2580.72 → 2587.44] go ahead to launch the first commercial mission to the moon so the moon express CEO and co-founder said
[2588.16 → 2595.60] it's a huge milestone for us not quite as catchy as one small step for man one large whatever leap giant
[2595.60 → 2600.72] giant leap thank you for mankind not quite as catchy as that, but maybe he didn't have quite as long to
[2600.72 → 2605.84] write it given that he didn't sit in a spacecraft for you know a long time before he got there you
[2605.84 → 2610.16] know i wonder what the story is behind that I'm sure I'm sure it's been talked about like
[2610.16 → 2615.52] whether he whether it was spontaneous or whether he is like thought about it and planned it is had to
[2615.52 → 2622.32] require at least a few minutes of pre-planning I mean it's frustrating because you're a sports fan
[2622.32 → 2630.40] so you'll be able to relate to this it's frustrating because the greatest moments in sports are sometimes
[2630.40 → 2637.20] made as much by the commentator as they are by the athlete oh yeah because they put it in the
[2637.20 → 2645.12] appropriate context they get you amped up for it, they they they make the moment something that goes
[2645.12 → 2652.48] beyond a fantastic athletic feat and something that becomes culturally iconic because you can like you
[2652.48 → 2664.00] can okay so the uh the bobby Orr goal it's amazing to watch but with that commendation
[2664.00 → 2669.52] a commentary commendation commentary thank you with that commentary it's something that
[2669.52 → 2674.08] like is like moving to a hockey fan anyway some most people wouldn't care um
[2674.08 → 2684.08] um doesn't it drive you crazy when you can tell that they had a sheet of paper on in front of them
[2684.08 → 2689.76] with like epic moment quotes that they've been thinking up over the last month and they just say
[2689.76 → 2694.64] one oh you can always tell when it's like oh you were staying up late at night last week just
[2694.64 → 2700.48] trying to think of this stuff and now you have your moment America American commentators are the worst
[2700.48 → 2709.44] I'm sorry in what regard though you could be right depending on doing that I notice it so much less
[2709.44 → 2718.88] on Canadian broadcasts the contrived fake nonsense on a big game win especially when it's like not a
[2718.88 → 2724.96] close game like when when the outcome has basically been decided since the know middle of
[2724.96 → 2730.88] the second period or beginning of the third quarter or whatever yeah yeah yeah where like they've got
[2730.88 → 2735.12] like this quote that they were obviously saving that makes it sound like all epic like an epic
[2735.12 → 2742.08] triumph when it was just kind of a beat down I've seen I've actually seen um I don't disagree with you
[2742.08 → 2747.36] but I have seen it um in other countries as well like if I'm watching the like Premier League in
[2747.36 → 2752.96] English soccer okay there could be a game put away by halftime, and then you know the announcer will go on
[2752.96 → 2757.52] in this golf announcer style drone for the second 45 minutes and then when the final whistle goes
[2757.52 → 2763.12] and there it is and I'm just like okay like so i your point is very well taken though I understand
[2763.12 → 2769.20] what you're saying um all right so back to going to the moon um the company has raised more
[2769.20 → 2776.56] than 30 million dollars so far and plan to unveil their me lander at the cape carnival air station
[2776.56 → 2782.80] the first launch is targeted for late 2017 this is kind of funny the FAA has not actually issued a
[2782.80 → 2788.48] launch license yet um and that will be considered separately from the mission itself so while they
[2788.48 → 2794.40] do have permission to travel between earth's stratosphere and the moon and land there they
[2794.40 → 2799.92] do not have permission actually what which layer of the atmosphere does the FAA's jurisdiction end
[2799.92 → 2806.00] I actually don't know either so I don't know if you ask the FAA maybe it never ends
[2806.00 → 2808.56] you know what it wouldn't surprise me
[2811.28 → 2818.40] all right uh what else we got oh the Kansas thing I thought was pretty okay let's move on to that
[2818.40 → 2828.08] where is that oh where is that indeed I saw what Kansas farm sues max mind over quote massive IP glitch
[2828.08 → 2832.96] unquote so let's go ahead I'll pull up the original article from the Washington Post you want to go ahead and
[2832.96 → 2839.52] uh get us going on this yeah, so this is pretty nuts, so max mind is a company out of uh Waltham
[2839.52 → 2844.48] Massachusetts actually right across the river from where I lived uh when I was in law school and they
[2844.48 → 2852.80] are a company that map sip addresses to geographical areas now what they did is um they had one
[2852.80 → 2859.44] point that they considered the default centre of the U.S. so um and this was therefore centre of the
[2859.44 → 2868.00] universe exactly hashtag Canadian commentary okay so and basically what this is what the geographic
[2868.00 → 2874.56] centre of the of a country or anything else is suppose you had um a cardboard cutout shaped
[2874.56 → 2879.68] exactly like the U.S., and you balanced it on a pin the geographic centre is where it would bounce like
[2879.68 → 2885.44] where the pin would be and this happened to be very close to these folks house that lived in Kansas
[2885.44 → 2893.44] and so what ended up happening is all this IP traffic was being mapped back to essentially their
[2893.44 → 2900.96] front yard and what ended up happening was for years they had cops showing up at their door at all hours
[2900.96 → 2906.48] accusing them of being involved in all sorts of crime or whatever other shenanigans and there
[2906.48 → 2910.80] were just this like random elderly couple that lived on the farm or something had no idea what was going on
[2910.80 → 2923.92] so basically max mind is responsible for mapping IP addresses, and they used this geographical centre
[2923.92 → 2933.76] as the default location for any U.S. base dip address so let's say that you know um oh man like what even
[2933.76 → 2938.40] would be an example of something that didn't have a proper IP address, and they just default like why would
[2938.40 → 2944.72] they even be doing this i i i I'm it was a little bit unclear from the story honestly maybe if someone
[2944.72 → 2950.64] was like you know using a VPN but even then like so sometimes when mapping IPS apparently they're able
[2950.64 → 2957.68] to only determine the country of origin that's it yeah okay so there it is so if all they know is oh
[2957.68 → 2962.48] you're somewhere in the United States you get mapped to this random place in Kansas I mean these are some
[2962.48 → 2968.40] of the complaints that this poor family has been dealing with um they've been accused of interrupting
[2968.40 → 2974.48] email service for customers of a certain small business they've been accused of harbouring a stolen
[2974.48 → 2980.64] vehicle harbouring runaway children and keeping girls in the house to make pornographic films I mean i
[2980.64 → 2988.32] really like how that last one was in quotation marks but yeah so it says um ambulances have appeared to
[2988.32 → 2994.40] prepare to save suicidal persons FBI agents federal marshal sirs collectors and other law enforcement
[2994.40 → 2999.20] officers have appeared on their doorsteps at all hours of the day and night and even one random
[2999.20 → 3006.16] morning a broken toilet was left in their driveway without explanation all right, so max mind has since
[3006.80 → 3014.72] changed their default location in the U.S. to the centre of a lake west of Wichita um but in the meantime
[3014.72 → 3020.00] the Arnold's have filed a lawsuit against mac mine max mind seeking compensatory and punitive damages
[3020.00 → 3025.68] in excess of 75 000. Can I make a comment on that yes so the reason they chose that dollar amount um
[3025.68 → 3031.92] in excess of 75 000 so here's the reason for this um super quick crash course in jurisdiction of American
[3031.92 → 3037.76] law so um they followed the case in federal court and if you want to file something in federal court in
[3037.76 → 3042.80] the U.S. there's two require there you can do it in one of two ways one is if it involves a federal
[3042.80 → 3047.84] question or a federal law, but the other is if there's what's called diversity of citizenship where
[3047.84 → 3052.40] it's the two parties in this case the old couple and maximized are from two different states and they
[3052.40 → 3061.04] are and the amount in controversy is above 75 000 so that's why the there's a sort of vague in excess we
[3061.04 → 3067.04] won't in excess of 75 grand like who knows how much the actual amount they'll get will be, but that is
[3067.04 → 3072.24] just sort of like a venue selection trick to get them into federal court as opposed to state court
[3072.24 → 3080.32] oh I see okay makes sense yeah let's move on to a pretty important rumour so the original post here
[3080.32 → 3086.48] is actually from the Linus tech tips' forum because I think uh I think they are quickly being wiped out
[3087.04 → 3094.40] and I'm not going to say anything about this because I may or may not actually have real information
[3094.40 → 3104.40] um but basically here there's an Imgur post of what appears to be I'm going to read it word for
[3104.40 → 3111.52] word it is this Imgur post that is the entire that is the entire source of everything that I'm saying
[3111.52 → 3121.36] it appears to be an Asus rogue strip g752 VMC 033 t 7.3 inch uh what seems to be a laptop of some sort
[3121.36 → 3130.64] this potentially completely photoshopped page um says that it oh okay it seems to be a laptop
[3130.64 → 3137.60] because it has a core i7 6700hq processor word next to this picture of what appears to be a laptop so
[3137.60 → 3148.40] I guess the implication being that one of those is inside one of those um ddr4 8 gig ram 256 GB SSD m period 2
[3148.40 → 3155.52] uh 1tb 7200 rpm something that's a word in a language that I don't understand
[3156.48 → 3170.96] NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6 GB, so the implication is that a laptop with a GTX 1060 6 GB
[3170.96 → 3180.72] could potentially be a thing for uh 19 999 of whatever the devil these are the region crone
[3181.28 → 3186.48] is that right I think that's what it said i wish Luke were here because Luke is very
[3186.48 → 3190.64] good at Scandinavian currency we were having a discussion about this the other day that's an
[3190.64 → 3198.40] interesting talent don't worry about it um so an interesting actually no I'm not going to point
[3198.40 → 3202.96] out anything that's interesting about it there were also some uh let's see if any of the other listings
[3202.96 → 3208.48] are still live it looks like this stuff is being pulled down so all the links that were
[3208.48 → 3217.36] originally given for expert.no are yep nope not I don't know what any of this is but it definitely
[3217.36 → 3226.08] isn't that so hmm very very interesting I like Scandinavian letters where is
[3226.08 → 3227.60] Luke anyway Britain
[3230.72 → 3235.20] that's as much information as I have that's all the information I have too all right
[3235.92 → 3243.20] self-driving tesla original article here is from the telegraph.co.uk saves a man's life by steering him
[3243.20 → 3250.24] to the hospital, so this opens up and okay let's go through the basics of the story first
[3250.96 → 3255.76] uh so original article from telegraph oh I think I already said that uh originally posted by fake
[3255.76 → 3262.64] ZZ on the forum so it has tesla model x is credited with having helped save an American man's life after
[3262.64 → 3268.16] its autopilot function got him to the hospital when he suffered a pulmonary embolism the man's name is
[3268.16 → 3272.40] Joshua Neely a lawyer from Springfield Missouri he called his wife and said something was wrong that he
[3272.40 → 3276.88] couldn't breathe and thinking it would be quicker than pulling over to call an ambulance he set the
[3276.88 → 3282.80] autopilot autonomous function of the tesla model x he just got the car a few weeks before this happened
[3282.80 → 3287.84] he doesn't remember much after he set the mode as the car drove him over 20 miles to Branson
[3290.00 → 3294.16] he managed to steer the car the last mile or so between the motorway and the hospital
[3294.16 → 3306.56] so this is an interesting debate how is it that we consider tesla's autopilot record because a couple
[3306.56 → 3315.12] people have died now do they get one in the bank if autopilot saves a life is that how it is that how
[3315.12 → 3321.28] it works like life saved versus lives taken I don't know I'm not making the rules for this I'm just asking
[3321.28 → 3329.92] questions we're going to straw pull this friends we haven't got a straw pull this go ahead hit me
[3332.48 → 3341.28] i I mean I feel like this was inevitable when you have when the design when whoever's idea this was
[3341.28 → 3348.24] first said hey why don't we try to make a self-driving car but i I don't know how do you measure something
[3348.24 → 3354.88] like this whether like this is a good or bad thing because okay I'll say this so how much
[3354.88 → 3363.28] testing has been done versus death rate because people who just drive regular cars both kill
[3363.28 → 3370.40] themselves and other people all the time yeah so even though it's easy to say oh you can't trust these
[3370.40 → 3376.80] computers to drive cars if their fatality rate is still much lower than you know some random person
[3376.80 → 3383.84] behind the wheel, but you're you're okay the problem though is that you're approaching this from a very
[3383.84 → 3394.48] um a very scientific standpoint like a purely fact-based standpoint and the reality of it is even for
[3394.48 → 3398.32] even for people who care more about facts than feelings
[3398.32 → 3409.92] let's say it was you know uh your mom who died in a self-driving car do you care that the odds were
[3410.56 → 3416.72] better for her like that the overall odds like fewer people would die if we were all in self-driving
[3416.72 → 3423.92] cars do you care your mom's dead and maybe wouldn't have been dead if she had been operating the steering
[3423.92 → 3429.36] wheel like that's something to consider is that while it's easy to kind of go oh the greater good
[3429.36 → 3436.00] and this and that that doesn't change that you're going to be dealing with people who are inherently
[3436.64 → 3442.40] emotionally distraught and very upset and prepared to make a very loud noise about why self-driving
[3442.40 → 3448.32] cars are bad if someone close to them dies in one or is seriously injured in one whereas
[3448.32 → 3455.76] we all accept just because of because we've all been born into a world where cars operated by people
[3455.76 → 3462.64] are the norm we all accept the risks that come along with a manually operated car people also
[3462.64 → 3468.16] like to feel like they're in control which is why people tend to be more afraid of flying than they
[3468.16 → 3472.32] are driving even though flying is statistically much safer you have a feeling of not being in control and
[3472.32 → 3475.68] if something goes wrong there's nothing you can do about it that's right and I would also make the
[3475.68 → 3481.84] argument that flying is a much more terrifying way to die because there is I can think of very few
[3481.84 → 3487.44] scenarios where you won't have an awful lot of time to think about it yeah, and you just like plummet
[3487.44 → 3493.28] for quite a while I don't know what the terminal velocity of a human being is, but it's not that high
[3493.28 → 3504.00] yeah so no it's not so we've got 65 of you saying yes we can evaluate autopilot systems on the
[3504.00 → 3509.60] bank system well to be fair one in one out you come out net even when these start becoming more
[3509.60 → 3514.56] mainstream I feel like this is how we're going to make decisions on them like this is how governments
[3514.56 → 3519.04] are going to regulate them this is the way that companies are going to be approaching safety it's
[3519.04 → 3523.12] so it's ultimately going to affect like how people use them so
[3526.32 → 3531.36] I don't know i just I'm wondering with the whole you know the march of progress and all that like I'm
[3531.36 → 3540.24] wondering how many voices of people um that oh I lost a loved one in a self-driving car accident
[3540.24 → 3545.28] maybe I wouldn't have had they actually been controlling the car I wonder if those boys will
[3545.28 → 3551.04] just voices will just end up being lost in the conversation because ultimately I think we want
[3551.04 → 3555.92] to make decisions based on more what are the numbers I don't know I mean the thing is that it's
[3555.92 → 3560.00] pretty hard to lose a voice in the conversation these days with social media being what it is
[3560.00 → 3566.32] that's true yeah I mean people can you know with through amplification factors like twitter and red
[3566.32 → 3571.84] it all takes is one viral incident that's right suddenly the conversation changes you know at least
[3571.84 → 3580.96] a little bit so and at the end of the day I mean any politician is at the mercy of the voters so
[3580.96 → 3586.72] whatever they can do quietly behind closed doors that is something that their voters wouldn't agree
[3586.72 → 3591.68] with is all fine and good but as soon as something goes viral and there's a bunch of pressure and it
[3591.68 → 3596.64] looks like they might actually not get re-elected if you're a career politician not getting re-elected
[3596.64 → 3602.96] is like getting fired effectively exactly or like, or you know if you're let's say a senator, and you have
[3602.96 → 3610.80] to go back to being the mayor of you know three sticks Nebraska then you know that it is like getting a huge
[3610.80 → 3615.76] demotion um with and with the incumbency advantage it does become a career I think I don't know how
[3615.76 → 3620.32] it is in Canada but like in the U.S. house incumbency success rate in the election is like over 90 percent
[3620.32 → 3624.88] like most of these people were there for a long time so basically we're looking at something that
[3624.88 → 3632.96] is potentially very emotional and um and can be driven by fear absolutely so I don't know yeah I mean
[3632.96 → 3638.64] because yeah I mean how many self or like autonomous vehicles other than cars are there, there still
[3638.64 → 3643.52] really aren't all that many like most metro systems and train systems they have a human conductor
[3643.52 → 3649.52] or a human driver you know I don't think the sky train has one I think there might be a remote
[3649.52 → 3652.88] controller though I'm actually not sure as slow as a sky train is I don't see how it matters but
[3654.96 → 3661.12] okay if you're going to hate on the sky train hate on the sky train right okay the sky train doesn't go
[3661.12 → 3667.92] anywhere it covers yeah that's true a tiny fraction yeah of the greater Vancouver area
[3668.40 → 3673.28] that it's basically irrelevant our mass transit in North Carolina is a joke too I'm not trying to
[3673.28 → 3678.56] take home Vancouver it's just it's bad so all right well speaking of things that are bad
[3678.56 → 3685.60] the end of the show is bad because the show's ending not because the show's bad
[3686.40 → 3689.68] or maybe the show was well that would make sense if it was a bad if it was a bad show
[3689.68 → 3692.88] it would be good at this ending so yes maybe I'll do a straw poll
[3697.04 → 3699.92] is the show bad or the end bad
[3699.92 → 3707.60] the show is bad the show was bad actually we even like that it's perfect the end is bad
[3708.96 → 3716.24] this poll is bad all right let's find out what's bad and I did not put an option for Michael Jackson
[3718.00 → 3718.24] oh
[3722.56 → 3728.16] all right it has been a long week it's been a very long I don't even know why
[3728.16 → 3732.24] probably because last week was a holiday week we're also a little bit short-handed this week
[3732.24 → 3734.72] yeah we're a little short-handed this week um
[3737.04 → 3739.44] what was Luke not here Brandon's out today
[3741.44 → 3747.20] what was people hating they're saying yeah every single voter is
[3747.20 → 3751.76] saying something's bad it's like look at this negativity they mostly hate your poll
[3751.76 → 3755.04] mostly hate my poll I can tell you one person who doesn't hate my poll
[3758.16 → 3772.16] I'm not going to say it sees you next week same bad time same bad channel
[3772.16 → 3779.84] discover do something you're talking about
[3779.84 → 3786.96] I hope you're enjoying I love him
[3793.12 → 3794.72] baby
