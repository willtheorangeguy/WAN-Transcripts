[0.00 --> 12.30]  Hey! How's it going? It's Friday. TGI Friday. I'm out of water. So welcome to the... Cars.
[13.00 --> 19.42]  You're out of cars. Because you had a supply of cars before and now you don't. And water.
[19.70 --> 25.92]  Can you... See... I'm out of crime, man. There's no more crime in this town.
[25.92 --> 31.56]  It's not an issue when I throw things on the ground because I'll clean them up. Yeah, your crime came back. That's what happens with crime.
[31.82 --> 41.86]  You lock up crime and the crime comes back because it doesn't pay. And if it doesn't pay, it can't afford the rent where you sent it.
[42.44 --> 46.94]  Oh, so it has to come home. Yes. It's like living back in your parents' basement. Yes.
[47.08 --> 53.28]  All the criminals are like, man, we tried to leave and then we weren't very successful, so we came back.
[53.28 --> 57.16]  We should tell them to steal better stuff next time. That's kind of cute.
[57.70 --> 60.20]  Yeah. They need training. They need crime training.
[60.48 --> 67.72]  Like, you know, can you imagine? Like, I mean, surely people must learn crime somehow.
[68.14 --> 70.40]  Like crime school? Yeah, like crime school.
[70.66 --> 77.46]  Like, I mean, obviously not in North America or like anywhere with a government that's paying attention at all.
[77.46 --> 80.84]  But like, can you imagine? Like an actual crime school?
[80.86 --> 85.38]  Opening up a crime school in like, you know, middle of Africa somewhere.
[85.38 --> 89.88]  Somewhere. Yeah. Where it's like, okay. And like the ads.
[89.88 --> 94.12]  But like actually not have it be like child soldiers. Like actually have it be like just.
[94.24 --> 94.48]  Yeah.
[94.60 --> 96.02]  We're just going to teach you how to do the things.
[96.02 --> 105.12]  Like a pop-up ad in your browser that's like for only, you know, $5,000 will help you make however much a day through a life of crime.
[105.50 --> 110.46]  And it actually includes like a legitimate plane ticket. You go there, there's classes, there's practical studies.
[110.46 --> 111.52]  You're saying use a bolt cutter.
[111.80 --> 114.44]  Yeah, bolt cutter. Well, no. No, because there's a lot more than that.
[114.54 --> 117.18]  Like there's a lot of like tricks of the trade.
[117.28 --> 120.50]  Like when we had a lot of the security done on this place, they're like, yeah, this is what they do.
[120.54 --> 121.80]  And this is what they do. And this is what they do.
[121.80 --> 126.58]  And I'm sitting here going, how do they all know how to do this? Well, crime school.
[127.50 --> 131.32]  Maybe you and I are just smart enough that we never clicked the link.
[132.60 --> 137.10]  Maybe this woman is making $10,000 a week in Canada.
[137.26 --> 138.30]  It's actually crime school.
[138.32 --> 139.20]  Maybe it's crime school.
[139.30 --> 139.70]  Canadian crime school.
[139.82 --> 140.06]  Yeah.
[140.64 --> 140.90]  Wow.
[141.16 --> 145.18]  But not the crime school in Canada. The people come back to Canada with criminal knowledge.
[145.48 --> 146.98]  Oh, okay.
[147.12 --> 147.44]  Yeah.
[147.46 --> 149.56]  But you can advertise to people currently in Canada.
[149.56 --> 155.84]  Yeah, because I mean, it's like it's sketchy advertising, sketchy sites, you know, where you see those kinds of things.
[155.92 --> 159.90]  I mean, obviously, you know, LinusTechTips.com is not going to have crime school banner ads.
[160.84 --> 163.10]  And if we did, you know, we'd charge a lot for them.
[163.22 --> 165.56]  So there'd be a good justification for them to be there.
[165.66 --> 165.76]  Yeah.
[167.54 --> 168.84]  We should probably start the show.
[168.84 --> 170.60]  That's because one of our guys went to marketing school.
[171.56 --> 174.72]  Which is maybe not that different from crime school.
[174.74 --> 175.38]  Might be pretty similar.
[175.38 --> 179.22]  We also have someone who went to law school. Not that different from crime school.
[179.40 --> 182.12]  In fact, they learn a lot about crime.
[182.24 --> 183.04]  Pretty much the same.
[183.24 --> 183.44]  Yeah.
[184.46 --> 185.14]  I mean, it's just...
[185.14 --> 186.62]  So maybe the school of law...
[186.62 --> 188.36]  Law school are crime schools.
[188.46 --> 188.86]  Yes.
[190.74 --> 192.86]  Police Academy is crime school.
[193.04 --> 193.42]  Yes.
[194.38 --> 194.88]  The police...
[194.88 --> 198.60]  Okay, so the law academy is like metaphysical crime school.
[198.82 --> 200.80]  And the police academy is like quite definitely physical crime school.
[200.80 --> 201.54]  Oh, like practical.
[201.82 --> 202.00]  Yeah.
[202.10 --> 203.60]  Practical application crime school.
[203.66 --> 205.40]  Yeah, so it's like theory versus practical.
[205.56 --> 205.82]  Yeah.
[206.70 --> 207.76]  BCIT versus UBC.
[207.76 --> 210.92]  Well, I think they both have the opposite as well.
[210.92 --> 214.48]  Because in law, you'll have some practical training.
[214.68 --> 216.60]  Like how to write a letter that will...
[216.60 --> 218.00]  Courtroom, essays, written letters.
[218.00 --> 220.94]  Yeah, enable a crime to be committed and not be punished.
[221.06 --> 221.28]  Right.
[221.50 --> 223.18]  And the same in police academy.
[223.30 --> 227.42]  They're going to have theoretical studies as well.
[227.72 --> 227.94]  Yeah.
[229.18 --> 229.48]  Yeah.
[229.66 --> 230.66]  Yeah, that totally makes sense.
[230.92 --> 231.32]  I get it.
[231.44 --> 233.46]  It's just like what one you want your strength to be in.
[233.48 --> 234.10]  Yeah, so I mean...
[234.10 --> 235.46]  But you do get an all around either way.
[235.50 --> 237.18]  Yeah, we still have...
[237.18 --> 238.96]  I mean, if you went to super...
[238.96 --> 240.02]  We just have formal crime school.
[240.18 --> 241.34]  Super criminal school.
[241.80 --> 244.34]  That would be both law school and police academy.
[244.52 --> 245.08]  And maybe like...
[245.08 --> 245.88]  Get a degree in both.
[245.88 --> 248.40]  And maybe like some programming mixed in.
[248.76 --> 248.90]  Yeah.
[249.06 --> 249.96]  Super criminal school.
[250.06 --> 250.18]  Yeah.
[250.36 --> 251.04]  Networking stuff.
[251.14 --> 251.34]  Yeah.
[251.62 --> 251.84]  Yeah.
[252.14 --> 252.34]  Yeah.
[252.56 --> 253.10]  That makes sense.
[253.78 --> 254.56]  Basic scripting.
[254.68 --> 259.58]  I mean, that's the only difference between, you know, the so-called first world and the rest of
[259.58 --> 260.68]  the world is that...
[260.68 --> 260.92]  Naming.
[261.92 --> 263.04]  It's all spin.
[263.40 --> 263.58]  Yeah.
[263.66 --> 264.12]  It's spin.
[264.74 --> 264.78]  Yeah.
[264.92 --> 267.74]  People are probably wondering what the hell show it is that they're watching.
[267.74 --> 268.66]  This is the WAN show.
[268.68 --> 269.58]  It is the WAN show.
[269.68 --> 271.82]  We are going to actually have a show at some point today.
[271.82 --> 274.16]  The sometimes unrecognizable.
[274.38 --> 277.12]  The unapologetically unrecognizable WAN show.
[277.42 --> 281.14]  So this week we've got some call-out topics.
[281.50 --> 288.74]  Hulk Hogan might have single-handedly taken out both his friendship and Gawker Media.
[289.22 --> 291.60]  Actually, if I remember correctly, like his friend was cool with it.
[292.24 --> 292.54]  Oh.
[294.66 --> 295.98]  I don't know if that story's true.
[296.64 --> 299.82]  There's a grocery store in Sweden with no staff.
[300.08 --> 300.30]  None.
[300.58 --> 301.20]  None at all.
[301.20 --> 304.84]  AMD made announcements.
[305.30 --> 306.10]  Many announcements.
[306.34 --> 307.00]  Lots of them.
[307.44 --> 311.40]  Also, Oculus has 30 VR games that'll be ready at launch.
[311.64 --> 312.22]  Oh, hi.
[312.86 --> 315.14]  Well, I'm just trying to center the heads on the table.
[315.24 --> 316.40]  Let's just roll the intro.
[316.40 --> 316.50]  Let's go.
[331.20 --> 345.12]  What the crap.
[345.12 --> 348.82]  There. Hold on. I got this.
[350.06 --> 350.78]  Backspace!
[351.56 --> 353.44]  Ooh, deep dive sessions.
[356.00 --> 358.14]  Dollar Shave Club!
[360.74 --> 361.26]  Squarespace!
[362.78 --> 363.66]  You should.
[364.56 --> 365.46]  You should.
[365.88 --> 367.90]  No, no, you should do what?
[370.40 --> 371.46]  Build it beautiful?
[371.80 --> 373.28]  But that's not their current...
[373.28 --> 374.40]  Do we care? No.
[375.12 --> 375.88]  It's not really.
[380.28 --> 382.58]  All right, guys.
[382.80 --> 388.12]  So we've got a pretty good show for you guys today, I hope.
[388.40 --> 390.18]  That was definitely not prepped at crime school.
[390.36 --> 391.82]  Yeah, that was not...
[391.82 --> 394.56]  It contains none of our knowledge from crime school
[394.56 --> 397.30]  because, quite frankly, if you're going to go to crime school,
[397.48 --> 399.36]  you're going to have to pay for tuition.
[399.92 --> 401.22]  That's how school works.
[401.36 --> 401.78]  Okay?
[402.16 --> 402.34]  Yep.
[402.72 --> 403.90]  Crime school tuition.
[404.24 --> 404.44]  Yep.
[404.44 --> 405.44]  It's like...
[405.44 --> 406.44]  It's like...
[407.14 --> 409.58]  I mean, can you imagine the invoice they send you?
[409.66 --> 410.92]  Like, I would double-check that.
[412.72 --> 413.84]  Invoice from criminals.
[414.14 --> 415.48]  Extra zero here and there.
[415.52 --> 416.14]  Extra zero.
[416.30 --> 417.54]  Give us your credit card.
[417.74 --> 418.26]  Trust us.
[418.92 --> 419.42]  It's okay.
[419.78 --> 421.06]  And then if you pay for...
[421.06 --> 421.48]  You know what?
[421.48 --> 422.64]  That's probably the final exam.
[422.64 --> 424.32]  If you pay for crime school...
[424.32 --> 424.64]  You fail.
[424.78 --> 425.34]  You fail.
[426.94 --> 429.34]  So you have to find some way to not pay.
[430.36 --> 432.38]  And then they just have to make the tuition insane
[432.38 --> 434.36]  so the people that do pay end up paying for everyone else.
[434.40 --> 434.58]  Yeah.
[435.04 --> 436.46]  And, I mean, you know,
[436.76 --> 440.02]  not every criminal is the most brilliant person on the face of the earth.
[440.08 --> 443.68]  So you've got to imagine that some of the people who fail their final exam
[443.68 --> 445.40]  probably pay to try again.
[445.56 --> 445.80]  Yep.
[445.80 --> 448.20]  So they can subsidize the people who are passing.
[448.38 --> 448.72]  Oh, definitely.
[448.80 --> 449.34]  And not paying.
[449.50 --> 449.64]  Yeah.
[450.96 --> 451.48]  I like it.
[451.76 --> 452.16]  Okay.
[452.46 --> 453.24]  Strong business model.
[453.30 --> 454.92]  So, you know...
[454.92 --> 457.92]  You have a much more interesting story about this than I do.
[458.06 --> 458.10]  Okay.
[458.10 --> 462.50]  This was originally posted by ChevBHD on the forum.
[462.62 --> 465.20]  I'm just going to pull up the original article here from Anant Tech
[465.20 --> 468.98]  and post it in the good old Twitch chat-a-maroonie.
[469.14 --> 469.94]  Here we go.
[471.18 --> 473.60]  AMD to showcase latest innovation...
[473.60 --> 475.20]  Okay, well, this is just the general coverage.
[475.20 --> 476.52]  Dang it, where's the...
[476.52 --> 479.76]  There's an Ars Technica article about it, if you go back to the thing.
[481.50 --> 483.04]  Bleeding heck, sir.
[483.90 --> 485.22]  Bleeding heck indeed.
[486.38 --> 490.10]  In crime school, they teach you how to say cool things, like bleeding heck.
[490.40 --> 491.32]  Sulon Q.
[491.48 --> 495.02]  Hold on, I'm just going to throw this in the Twitch chat so you guys can check that bit.
[495.30 --> 495.52]  Oh!
[496.10 --> 496.70]  All right.
[497.36 --> 503.74]  AMD-powered Sulon Q is like wearing a VR-capable Windows PC on your head.
[503.74 --> 503.88]  Yeah.
[504.30 --> 506.98]  Can you tell me a little bit about your experience with this?
[507.06 --> 507.76]  When was it?
[507.86 --> 508.08]  Okay.
[508.08 --> 508.64]  Because that's important.
[508.66 --> 509.50]  It was a little bit ago.
[509.62 --> 513.36]  It wasn't this year, so I believe it was CES 2015.
[513.78 --> 514.06]  Okay.
[514.12 --> 515.38]  I'm pretty sure it was CES 2015.
[515.38 --> 515.58]  Okay.
[516.48 --> 518.06]  There was the Sulon Cortex.
[518.82 --> 519.12]  Okay.
[519.28 --> 520.82]  We figured out that they were on the floor.
[520.98 --> 521.98]  But we never covered it.
[521.98 --> 525.06]  No, but we really tried.
[525.66 --> 526.94]  We super duper tried.
[527.04 --> 527.96]  Brandon's walking way over there.
[528.06 --> 528.88]  Brandon definitely remembers.
[529.14 --> 530.84]  Hey, Brandon, remember the Sulon Cortex?
[532.20 --> 533.16]  It was terrible.
[533.64 --> 535.06]  Yeah, he just said it was terrible.
[535.20 --> 536.80]  That's basically the conclusion here.
[536.88 --> 537.10]  Okay.
[537.10 --> 542.50]  When I saw this headline, AMD announces Sulon Q, I did multiple double takes, which actually
[542.50 --> 544.06]  equals something that isn't a double take.
[544.36 --> 547.60]  I did like a quadruple or whatever the six version would equal.
[547.84 --> 548.60]  But I like...
[548.60 --> 549.62]  Six double takes.
[549.66 --> 551.10]  I checked multiple...
[553.48 --> 555.60]  He can find out what he wants.
[555.70 --> 555.78]  Sure.
[555.80 --> 557.22]  He doesn't usually do that unless it's a problem.
[557.64 --> 558.10]  Hello, MAPE.
[559.56 --> 561.10]  One of our forum moderators.
[561.10 --> 569.52]  When you're screen sharing, there's really, really loud chirping, and it's quite painful.
[569.92 --> 570.32]  Chirping?
[571.54 --> 571.98]  Fantastic.
[572.30 --> 574.04]  We had problems screen sharing last week, too.
[574.18 --> 574.72]  So I don't know what's going on.
[574.82 --> 575.32]  Thanks, MAPE.
[575.56 --> 576.20]  Thanks, MAPE.
[577.14 --> 577.56]  Okay, bye.
[578.48 --> 578.84]  Okay.
[579.06 --> 582.52]  Well, I'll attempt to diagnose that in the background here.
[583.32 --> 584.12]  So carry on.
[584.28 --> 584.62]  Anyways.
[584.92 --> 585.72]  So, yeah.
[585.84 --> 587.98]  So it was at that point in time called the Sulon Cortex.
[588.16 --> 590.18]  I can tell you right now, it's changed a lot.
[590.18 --> 593.86]  Even just the specs are way improved.
[594.34 --> 597.98]  We don't know the battery life, all that kind of stuff, but it has a built-in 256 gigabyte
[597.98 --> 602.96]  SSD, four compute cores, eight cores unlocked through heterogeneous system architecture.
[603.74 --> 609.14]  It has a four-core FX 8800P processor, OC to around 3.4 gigahertz.
[609.38 --> 610.56]  Runs Windows 10.
[610.92 --> 613.32]  Has an R7 graphics card.
[613.78 --> 614.86]  No information other than that.
[616.40 --> 616.68]  Yeah.
[616.80 --> 618.70]  So the specs have taken a big jump upwards.
[618.70 --> 623.22]  That might have something to do with AMD theoretically acquiring them.
[623.22 --> 628.12]  It just says, with Toronto-based startup, Sulon Technologies.
[628.34 --> 632.48]  This is another Toronto startup that I was super excited for and then was super let down
[632.48 --> 632.70]  by.
[632.94 --> 635.50]  The watch was one of those as well.
[635.66 --> 636.00]  Right.
[636.00 --> 638.22]  But basically what happened was we went there.
[638.30 --> 642.64]  I was super excited that Sulon Cortex was at CES because I had seen and heard tons of stuff
[642.64 --> 643.02]  about them.
[643.18 --> 644.64]  It was supposed to be this awesome experience.
[644.76 --> 648.32]  They had cameras on the front of the headset so you could do like augmented reality stuff,
[648.40 --> 652.44]  but then it was completely tether free because it's all in the headset.
[653.26 --> 654.02]  Super cool.
[654.42 --> 655.56]  Brandon and I went to go check it out.
[655.56 --> 657.64]  Almost first thing, CES 2015.
[658.06 --> 663.72]  It, like, I'm comfortable saying literally didn't work at all.
[665.58 --> 666.02]  Yeah.
[666.26 --> 667.86]  So we were like, can we come back?
[667.96 --> 669.38]  And they encouraged that.
[669.46 --> 670.16]  So we went back later.
[670.26 --> 670.98]  Still didn't work.
[671.08 --> 671.70]  Did that again.
[671.80 --> 672.38]  Went back later.
[672.66 --> 673.30]  Still didn't work.
[673.40 --> 674.96]  I think we did it one more time.
[675.32 --> 675.80]  Went back.
[675.94 --> 681.66]  Was able to fight our way through two demos that were both gratuitously horrible.
[681.66 --> 686.24]  So I didn't end up releasing a video about it because I didn't think the communication
[686.24 --> 688.50]  to the audience would have been worth them watching.
[691.46 --> 698.24]  And now AMD has announced iteration two, I guess, called the Sulon Q.
[698.70 --> 700.92]  So hopefully it's good.
[703.48 --> 704.00]  Okay.
[704.56 --> 706.06]  That's basically all I have to say about that.
[706.06 --> 706.52]  Hopefully it's good.
[706.62 --> 707.76]  That's all you have to say.
[707.76 --> 712.22]  I'm really, like, the specs look way better.
[712.34 --> 715.50]  If AMD can pull those specs off, it could be sweet.
[715.62 --> 723.14]  I mean, all they're saying is Radeon R7 graphics card, which tells us absolutely nothing, basically.
[723.48 --> 726.10]  I mean, you could call anything an R7 graphics card.
[726.12 --> 726.58]  It could be a 240.
[727.78 --> 728.52]  That's true.
[728.64 --> 729.52]  It could be a 240.
[729.52 --> 734.54]  It could literally be not much more powerful than, like, a high-end tablet.
[734.54 --> 735.54]  Right.
[736.76 --> 737.78]  I don't know what it is.
[737.86 --> 738.82]  I'm hopeful.
[740.00 --> 742.40]  Here's, okay, so, but this is another thing that I...
[742.40 --> 744.42]  This seems like the wrong direction for AMD to go with.
[744.42 --> 747.86]  Yeah, there's another thing that I don't really understand about this product.
[747.88 --> 748.68]  Did you watch the video?
[749.40 --> 750.52]  No, I actually didn't.
[750.84 --> 752.78]  Oh, that won't help you understand things.
[753.58 --> 756.04]  They spend the entire video just saying first.
[757.18 --> 757.46]  Okay.
[757.46 --> 758.96]  It might be really loud chirping noises.
[759.30 --> 760.10]  Nope, I fixed it.
[760.20 --> 760.40]  Okay.
[761.30 --> 764.68]  I haven't used this capture card in a long time because I was having some issues with it.
[765.24 --> 769.42]  But the new driver fixed some issues but didn't fix the issues that it seems to be my laptop having.
[769.48 --> 772.64]  I think I need to update my sound drivers because I was trying to stream from my laptop yesterday.
[773.20 --> 774.52]  And I was having issues with that, too.
[774.62 --> 774.96]  Oh, my God.
[775.60 --> 776.46]  What is this?
[776.64 --> 779.02]  My dad texted me, so I thought it was important because it's during the show.
[779.08 --> 779.68]  He just texted me.
[779.80 --> 781.06]  Just wanted to say you're a noob.
[782.06 --> 783.48]  Your dad's awesome, by the way.
[783.56 --> 784.02]  Thanks, Dad.
[784.08 --> 784.88]  I like your dad.
[785.38 --> 786.06]  It's a cool dad.
[786.06 --> 787.08]  What is this?
[787.44 --> 790.80]  Yeah, it's really, really, really close-up shots of the headset.
[790.92 --> 791.28]  There you go.
[791.36 --> 791.90]  That's the headset.
[791.90 --> 795.64]  So the compute unit, I think, is partially on the back or entirely on the back.
[795.88 --> 799.54]  So basically, it's Gear VR but bulky.
[803.94 --> 804.90]  I mean...
[805.50 --> 806.90]  It's probably...
[808.22 --> 815.66]  And it won't be running experiences that are tailored for lightweight hardware.
[816.06 --> 817.92]  And operating systems like Android.
[817.92 --> 821.06]  It will be running full-fat Windows 10.
[823.22 --> 825.72]  With VR experiences that are...
[825.72 --> 825.88]  Like...
[825.88 --> 828.08]  It's all about...
[828.08 --> 829.72]  When you want to adopt something,
[830.08 --> 833.56]  you want to adopt the same one that everyone else is adopting
[833.56 --> 838.70]  to have at least some chance of ongoing support from third parties.
[838.70 --> 841.52]  Because it's simple business.
[841.84 --> 846.46]  If I'm a third party making a piece of software, a PC VR experience,
[846.84 --> 852.50]  am I going to target the HTC Vive, which sold, what was it, 15,000 units within 10 minutes
[852.50 --> 853.46]  or something absurd?
[853.60 --> 854.66]  Just completely obscene.
[854.80 --> 855.84]  Like, looks amazing.
[855.96 --> 856.58]  And looks awesome.
[856.58 --> 864.06]  Or would I go after the Oculus Rift, which is the just, you know, favorite, favorite nephew
[864.06 --> 865.94]  of the entire industry?
[868.14 --> 869.88]  Where both of those companies...
[869.88 --> 870.18]  Looks like it will be amazing.
[870.38 --> 870.52]  Yeah.
[870.52 --> 871.44]  Once the touch controllers come out.
[871.54 --> 873.28]  Where both of those companies are saying,
[873.40 --> 876.84]  yep, you're going to need a super powerful PC in order to have the experiences
[876.84 --> 878.34]  that we expect you to have on our headset.
[878.34 --> 882.06]  Or are you going to target this thing, which...
[882.06 --> 882.86]  Who's going to buy?
[883.10 --> 884.16]  Like, who's going to buy this?
[884.46 --> 888.06]  So, like, you and the other 16 people who buy it are going to expect...
[888.06 --> 888.44]  I don't...
[888.44 --> 888.58]  Okay.
[888.92 --> 892.16]  ...a software developer to make an experience for this that's going to be good.
[892.30 --> 893.66]  I genuinely don't know if I will.
[893.96 --> 896.66]  And I know that might be kind of surprising because I basically said I'm going to buy it.
[896.66 --> 897.42]  If you will what?
[898.94 --> 900.28]  You were considering it?
[900.34 --> 900.52]  No.
[900.60 --> 902.80]  Well, you said you and the other...
[902.80 --> 903.46]  So, like, I'm not...
[903.46 --> 903.78]  Oh, no.
[903.88 --> 904.04]  Yeah.
[904.14 --> 904.62]  I mean...
[904.62 --> 905.04]  I'm not...
[905.04 --> 907.22]  The main reason why I didn't release a video...
[907.22 --> 911.08]  I've released videos from shows and I've released videos from around the office
[911.08 --> 913.26]  where I tear things apart before.
[913.64 --> 914.58]  I could have done that again.
[914.78 --> 917.92]  The reason why I didn't was because I didn't want this thing to get press.
[919.08 --> 921.04]  I've been actively worried it was...
[921.04 --> 922.28]  It was bad.
[922.28 --> 926.64]  I've been actively worried the entire time since DK1 was announced
[926.64 --> 931.38]  that I don't really want bad press about bad products around VR.
[932.46 --> 936.90]  If there's bad press about the Vive or if there's bad press about the Rift,
[937.22 --> 939.12]  maybe they deserved that.
[939.16 --> 940.20]  I don't know what it would have been.
[940.42 --> 942.06]  There's been pretty good press about both of them.
[942.24 --> 942.98]  So, I don't...
[942.98 --> 943.78]  I'm not saying anything.
[943.92 --> 944.40]  I'm just...
[944.40 --> 946.40]  Like, if there happened to be for whatever reason,
[947.00 --> 950.36]  then they need to get their act together and keep on moving up
[950.36 --> 951.86]  and they can fix it and then they can keep going.
[952.22 --> 954.98]  Both of those headsets and the Gear VR, to a lesser degree,
[954.98 --> 958.92]  are doing a good job of showing, like, this is what VR can be.
[959.50 --> 959.60]  Right.
[960.46 --> 964.76]  Actually, Vive especially has shown off that, like,
[965.14 --> 967.38]  this can be for a wider audience.
[967.66 --> 967.78]  Yeah.
[967.86 --> 969.58]  You can walk around and explore Everest.
[970.02 --> 971.50]  You can do all these, like, super cool things.
[971.58 --> 972.70]  Like, awesome.
[972.82 --> 973.62]  You guys are doing great.
[973.66 --> 976.54]  I want to talk about that so that people hear it and get excited.
[976.72 --> 977.94]  I don't want to talk about this.
[977.94 --> 981.42]  You don't want to talk about how long an FX 8800p processor
[981.42 --> 984.20]  overclocked to 3.4 gigahertz is going to run on battery
[984.20 --> 985.22]  when it's strapped to your head.
[985.22 --> 986.00]  Yeah.
[987.56 --> 990.24]  Like, actually, specifically, I don't really want to talk about it.
[990.24 --> 992.50]  Could you imagine how warm that would be?
[992.72 --> 994.96]  Between the headset across the front of your face
[994.96 --> 997.44]  and a computer taped to the back of it.
[997.68 --> 998.48]  I think we'll wait for a second.
[999.18 --> 999.58]  Yeah.
[1000.08 --> 1001.86]  I mean, did they even say anything about weight?
[1002.12 --> 1003.70]  No weight or battery.
[1003.70 --> 1005.70]  No weight or battery spec.
[1006.62 --> 1010.00]  That thing is not big enough to have a decent battery
[1010.00 --> 1012.78]  and it is too big to be light.
[1012.78 --> 1016.10]  But then, you know, here's something, though.
[1017.38 --> 1020.00]  I don't know what an FX 8800p is.
[1020.04 --> 1022.26]  Does anyone know what an FX 8800p is?
[1022.28 --> 1023.02]  I've never heard of that.
[1023.84 --> 1024.96]  FX 8800p.
[1025.04 --> 1026.22]  This is a notebook processor.
[1026.38 --> 1028.42]  I didn't even know anything still made notebook processors.
[1028.76 --> 1030.42]  I think the R7 bit.
[1032.32 --> 1032.72]  Okay.
[1032.86 --> 1033.98]  So what is it?
[1034.64 --> 1035.04]  Integrated.
[1035.04 --> 1037.60]  So this is some kind of, like, APU or something like that
[1037.60 --> 1038.36]  by the look of things.
[1038.50 --> 1041.46]  So let's just have a quick look at what this...
[1041.46 --> 1042.12]  And are over here.
[1042.26 --> 1044.74]  Products.amd.com page has on it.
[1045.44 --> 1046.54]  Man, their site is slow.
[1047.12 --> 1047.36]  Okay.
[1048.14 --> 1051.36]  Probably because everyone's just super excited for the Suvon queue.
[1052.52 --> 1053.00]  Specificate.
[1053.78 --> 1055.14]  Why am I on the French page?
[1055.38 --> 1055.90]  Well, whatever.
[1056.06 --> 1056.22]  Okay.
[1057.96 --> 1058.44]  Fondation.
[1060.78 --> 1061.22]  OPN.
[1061.90 --> 1063.00]  O-O-P-A-N.
[1063.80 --> 1064.24]  Trey?
[1064.24 --> 1064.74]  Trey, yeah.
[1065.12 --> 1065.84]  Yeah, okay.
[1066.50 --> 1067.96]  Total Cash L2.
[1067.96 --> 1072.14]  I love how French just gets butchered when it comes to technical terms.
[1072.88 --> 1073.74]  A lot of languages do.
[1075.88 --> 1076.28]  Okay.
[1077.94 --> 1078.34]  Version.
[1078.74 --> 1079.90]  PCI Express.
[1080.90 --> 1081.46]  Okay.
[1082.46 --> 1082.90]  Okay.
[1083.12 --> 1084.16]  So four hearts.
[1085.94 --> 1087.72]  Eight GPU cores.
[1087.72 --> 1090.58]  So here are their cores.
[1090.70 --> 1091.40]  Here are their cores.
[1095.54 --> 1096.96]  AMD, you don't get to do this.
[1097.04 --> 1101.56]  You don't get to add up CPU and GPU cores and just be like, yeah, it has 12 cores.
[1102.72 --> 1103.64]  Four threads.
[1103.98 --> 1105.28]  It's kind of 12 cores.
[1106.28 --> 1107.90]  Vitesse d'olage de base.
[1108.16 --> 1108.30]  Okay.
[1108.68 --> 1110.88]  And 3.4 gigahertz is not overclocked.
[1110.88 --> 1112.28]  So the article seems to have missed that.
[1112.28 --> 1113.36]  That is a Max Turbo.
[1114.14 --> 1116.80]  And it is a 15 watt TDP processor.
[1117.00 --> 1117.14]  Okay.
[1117.22 --> 1122.68]  So we're not talking about necessarily like a tablet processor.
[1122.86 --> 1125.12]  But it's definitely a notebook processor.
[1125.26 --> 1127.14]  It's one that I've never seen in a laptop.
[1127.30 --> 1128.40]  800 megahertz R7.
[1128.54 --> 1128.74]  Wow.
[1128.76 --> 1132.62]  They're not even saying like how many stream processors it has or anything like that.
[1132.68 --> 1135.18]  So this is some underpowered nonsense.
[1135.18 --> 1142.02]  So what this means to me then anyway is if we're looking at a 28 nanometer AMD chip with four cores,
[1142.48 --> 1146.58]  maybe this just isn't about gaming at all then.
[1146.84 --> 1150.42]  Maybe this was the first VR experience that I wanted to quit.
[1151.44 --> 1151.88]  Oh.
[1153.96 --> 1160.20]  I mean, they're talking about, you know, the virtual mapping of the environment around you.
[1160.22 --> 1160.76]  Well, okay, not this.
[1161.36 --> 1162.50]  The Suelon Cortex was.
[1162.52 --> 1163.04]  Yeah, right.
[1163.06 --> 1164.18]  I have not tried the Q.
[1164.18 --> 1165.92]  I have no idea what the experience is like.
[1166.66 --> 1167.66]  I can guess.
[1169.36 --> 1172.24]  Why would you even need wireless keyboard and mouse support?
[1172.68 --> 1175.90]  What would you do with a keyboard and mouse with this thing strapped to your head?
[1175.94 --> 1178.78]  I can't think of a reason to have a thing.
[1178.80 --> 1180.86]  How does it have wireless keyboard and mouse support?
[1181.02 --> 1181.64]  I don't know.
[1182.02 --> 1183.16]  Well, Bluetooth, I guess.
[1183.24 --> 1185.88]  But like, why would you ever care?
[1186.56 --> 1186.72]  Why?
[1187.22 --> 1187.66]  Okay.
[1187.92 --> 1188.32]  Fine.
[1188.46 --> 1189.04]  We're done.
[1190.44 --> 1193.04]  Let's pull up the Inontech article that,
[1193.04 --> 1194.46]  are you copying that into Twitch chat?
[1194.48 --> 1194.64]  Yeah.
[1195.64 --> 1198.52]  Let's pull up the Inontech article that should have some,
[1198.58 --> 1200.66]  oh, no, this article is not an article.
[1200.82 --> 1206.32]  This is just a link to an investor relations page and their webcast announcement page.
[1206.32 --> 1208.76]  So, way to go, Colton.
[1210.10 --> 1211.60]  Okay, let's talk GP roadmap.
[1212.00 --> 1212.44]  So, yeah.
[1212.54 --> 1214.60]  Original article here is from PC Perspective.
[1214.62 --> 1215.28]  Good job, PC Per.
[1215.44 --> 1215.76]  Yeah.
[1215.96 --> 1217.18]  Go, Mr. Shrout.
[1217.28 --> 1218.42]  Actually, John Walroth.
[1218.68 --> 1219.36]  But, you know, whatever.
[1220.02 --> 1222.24]  Mr. Shrout gets at least some of the...
[1222.24 --> 1223.50]  Did I say John?
[1224.06 --> 1224.66]  Oh, sorry.
[1224.76 --> 1224.94]  Sorry.
[1225.00 --> 1226.90]  I still had the Hulk Hogan story on the mind.
[1227.12 --> 1228.30]  We'll talk more about that later.
[1228.38 --> 1228.74]  We will.
[1228.74 --> 1232.02]  So, some hints at what comes next.
[1232.30 --> 1239.82]  I love these GPU architecture roadmap slides because they're just so completely meaningless.
[1240.08 --> 1240.20]  Yeah.
[1241.04 --> 1242.46]  A, okay.
[1242.62 --> 1245.46]  So, A, it's gazing into the crystal ball,
[1245.72 --> 1250.66]  which hasn't actually worked out very well for us over the last two to three years
[1250.66 --> 1254.92]  where we've been, like, looking at these, like, great slides of, like,
[1254.92 --> 1256.94]  how much better GPUs are going to be.
[1257.10 --> 1259.12]  But then you have to read the fine print, too,
[1259.18 --> 1261.08]  because the thing that they're telling you
[1261.08 --> 1264.74]  doesn't necessarily even have a whole lot to do with what you would want to know.
[1265.02 --> 1267.24]  This is a performance per watt graph.
[1268.58 --> 1269.36]  Which is like...
[1269.36 --> 1273.92]  It could potentially even get worse in terms of...
[1273.92 --> 1275.74]  I'm not saying it is.
[1275.92 --> 1277.38]  I mean, Intel came out and said that.
[1278.14 --> 1278.40]  Yeah.
[1278.60 --> 1279.28]  Well, like...
[1279.28 --> 1280.38]  Our CPUs could get worse.
[1280.76 --> 1280.96]  Yeah.
[1281.04 --> 1283.58]  Like, theoretically, the performance could go down.
[1283.58 --> 1288.08]  If the wattage used goes way down, that graph is still possible.
[1288.20 --> 1289.26]  Then that comes up with...
[1289.26 --> 1292.76]  And then we end up with, like, a really, like, super, like, awesome-looking graph.
[1292.88 --> 1296.78]  So, Polaris is 2.5x performance per watt.
[1296.86 --> 1299.10]  So, what we're sort of hoping for, I guess,
[1299.88 --> 1305.32]  is between sometime in 2016, we're going to get that,
[1305.46 --> 1309.68]  and we're going to see maybe similar power draw or hopefully a little bit less.
[1309.68 --> 1313.64]  Maybe a little bit less power draw than current AMD top-tier cards.
[1314.18 --> 1317.68]  And maybe about, hey, 1.5x to 2x the performance.
[1318.32 --> 1323.46]  And then Vega is, like, even, like, way better sort of-ish.
[1324.00 --> 1326.70]  So, what, three times or...
[1326.70 --> 1326.86]  Really?
[1327.06 --> 1328.20]  Features HBM2.
[1328.34 --> 1329.24]  Yeah, maybe, actually.
[1329.32 --> 1331.36]  Yeah, it's actually not that much different.
[1331.58 --> 1331.94]  It just...
[1331.94 --> 1338.50]  It looks more impressive because nothing happened between the end of 2014 and the middle of 2016.
[1339.46 --> 1342.04]  Literally nothing happened on the AMD side of things.
[1342.68 --> 1345.06]  So, Vega is looking like another similar improvement,
[1345.20 --> 1347.26]  and then they're going, like, oh, yeah, it's going to take a little bit longer,
[1347.32 --> 1349.34]  and then we're going to have Navi sort of later.
[1349.72 --> 1350.02]  Okay.
[1351.76 --> 1352.16]  Cool.
[1353.64 --> 1355.00]  What else we got here?
[1355.00 --> 1359.26]  Why can't I move over?
[1359.34 --> 1360.24]  What's wrong with your thing?
[1360.50 --> 1361.00]  There we go.
[1361.06 --> 1361.18]  Oh.
[1361.64 --> 1365.08]  HBM1 is limited in the next-gen parts.
[1365.42 --> 1365.78]  Okay.
[1365.98 --> 1369.88]  So, that's some more news out of AMD that I guess is fascinating.
[1371.40 --> 1373.72]  I guess we already kind of knew this.
[1373.78 --> 1378.82]  The word on the street is that NVIDIA's flagship, at least to start with, Pascal,
[1379.04 --> 1380.46]  which is not Big Pascal.
[1380.66 --> 1382.18]  That's going to be the next step down Pascal.
[1382.18 --> 1384.10]  It's going to be using GDDR5X.
[1385.12 --> 1389.92]  So, it's probably just one of those things where NVIDIA would have maybe loved to use HBM,
[1390.52 --> 1394.34]  but because they're moving a much higher volume of parts than AMD,
[1394.52 --> 1398.98]  there may simply not be enough HBM for AMD,
[1399.30 --> 1403.24]  let alone for someone like NVIDIA to come in and put it on, you know,
[1403.28 --> 1407.06]  a hot-selling SKU like a replacement for something like the GTX 970.
[1408.78 --> 1410.02]  What else we got here?
[1410.02 --> 1418.18]  AMD announces the absolutely most powerful graphics card in the world.
[1418.46 --> 1421.88]  So, our original article here is from Legit Reviews.
[1422.38 --> 1427.74]  And this, my friends, is the Radeon Pro Duo.
[1427.74 --> 1436.00]  It features three PCI Express 8-pin power connectors.
[1437.06 --> 1437.78]  Wow.
[1438.58 --> 1438.98]  Woo!
[1439.20 --> 1439.60]  Woo!
[1440.10 --> 1442.84]  It features liquid cooling.
[1443.18 --> 1443.86]  Which is probably smart.
[1443.86 --> 1450.64]  And it features pretty much two R9 Furies on a single card.
[1451.48 --> 1452.52]  Pretty impressive.
[1452.84 --> 1455.28]  So, having a look at some Fire Strike numbers here,
[1455.66 --> 1461.58]  it is, you know, definitely faster than an R9 295X2.
[1461.58 --> 1466.46]  It is definitely faster than a GTX Titan Z,
[1466.60 --> 1470.10]  which is the last dual GPU card that NVIDIA released.
[1471.16 --> 1473.88]  Total, total flop the Titan Z was.
[1474.24 --> 1480.36]  They didn't even bother to redo a Titan, a dual GPU card for the flagship GPU of this generation.
[1480.36 --> 1490.66]  And, yeah, so it has definitely taken back, you know, if 3DMark scores are something to sort of go on,
[1491.00 --> 1496.22]  it has definitely taken back the most powerful graphics card award for AMD.
[1497.22 --> 1498.80]  We don't know if we're getting one.
[1499.40 --> 1500.30]  I have been in touch.
[1500.30 --> 1504.80]  They had said they wanted to give us a briefing before talking about sampling,
[1505.10 --> 1508.30]  so I actually CC'd you and John on the email,
[1508.56 --> 1513.42]  because you guys would probably be the ones to get briefed on it.
[1513.70 --> 1514.62]  When did you do this?
[1514.82 --> 1515.48]  Earlier this week.
[1517.68 --> 1518.80]  When was the briefing?
[1519.72 --> 1521.24]  Well, no, they never replied.
[1522.20 --> 1525.76]  So they haven't actually sent any information about the briefing,
[1525.90 --> 1527.20]  so hopefully that's coming soon.
[1527.22 --> 1528.02]  I don't think I saw this email.
[1528.02 --> 1531.94]  Yeah, hopefully we will get some kind of coverage for you guys.
[1533.92 --> 1536.84]  The card has a combined 8 gigs of HBM memory,
[1537.08 --> 1543.88]  so we are seeing, I guess, GTX 690 syndrome again,
[1544.34 --> 1547.36]  where, like, yeah, okay, it's, like, really powerful,
[1547.60 --> 1553.32]  but the problem with the 690 is that because it only had 2 gigs of RAM per GPU,
[1553.64 --> 1556.46]  that was effectively 2 gigs of RAM.
[1556.46 --> 1564.00]  So whether it's HBM allocation or whether it's the complexity of adding more of it to the board,
[1564.44 --> 1570.60]  AMD is limited to 4 gigs of HBM memory per core,
[1570.84 --> 1573.18]  which is effectively 4 gigs for the entire system,
[1573.26 --> 1578.66]  because the way that Crossfire and SLI work at this time is that they are not able to just go,
[1578.66 --> 1581.46]  okay, well, each GPU has 4 gigs, so now we've got 8 gigs total,
[1582.12 --> 1585.52]  making, you know,
[1585.58 --> 1591.12]  making other cards of similar power that come out in the future,
[1591.66 --> 1595.54]  whether they are based on Pascal or whether they're based on Polaris,
[1596.10 --> 1598.68]  probably make more sense to wait for.
[1598.68 --> 1602.80]  However, I'm not a huge fan of dual GPU cards,
[1602.84 --> 1605.62]  and there are a wide variety of reasons for that,
[1605.68 --> 1608.76]  not the least of which is the fact that the drivers for them,
[1609.26 --> 1610.96]  it comes down to what I was talking about before.
[1611.34 --> 1615.10]  You are better off investing in something that more people are going to buy
[1615.10 --> 1619.24]  because it puts more pressure on the manufacturer to fix it if there's a problem.
[1619.24 --> 1623.86]  So we had an issue in Scrapyard Wars 3 where Austin's system,
[1624.24 --> 1626.38]  because he had a, what was it?
[1626.52 --> 1627.58]  295X2, wasn't it?
[1627.78 --> 1629.94]  No, no, it was a 6990.
[1630.16 --> 1630.92]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1630.94 --> 1631.84]  Had a 6990.
[1632.16 --> 1632.98]  Yeah, not, yeah.
[1633.14 --> 1637.98]  Couldn't run PCMark because there is no way in AMD's,
[1638.04 --> 1640.18]  on AMD's dual GPU cards,
[1640.38 --> 1641.72]  so single card dual GPU,
[1642.08 --> 1643.94]  to disable Crossfire.
[1645.12 --> 1647.06]  There were some guides we found,
[1647.06 --> 1649.62]  and there were some people suggesting that there were ways to do it,
[1649.86 --> 1653.26]  but we did not successfully disable Crossfire.
[1653.94 --> 1655.16]  Because even though you can do it,
[1655.22 --> 1657.06]  when you've got two cards in one system,
[1657.76 --> 1658.30]  you just,
[1658.72 --> 1660.02]  nope, you just can't.
[1660.08 --> 1661.32]  And it felt like,
[1661.62 --> 1665.02]  because you were supposed to do it on like an application-based level
[1665.02 --> 1666.62]  in order to disable Crossfire.
[1666.92 --> 1668.30]  There was like some weird tool.
[1668.50 --> 1669.56]  Yeah, there didn't seem to be any,
[1669.64 --> 1670.42]  well, it's not that weird,
[1670.48 --> 1671.14]  it's a pretty common tool,
[1671.24 --> 1672.56]  but anyways, it does other stuff.
[1672.56 --> 1674.28]  It wasn't the AMD driver,
[1674.44 --> 1675.52]  which means it's not good enough.
[1675.58 --> 1675.86]  Okay.
[1676.14 --> 1676.88]  Yeah, that's true.
[1677.36 --> 1678.38]  I'm not going to argue that.
[1678.46 --> 1679.82]  It is a relatively common tool, though.
[1679.90 --> 1680.22]  Anyways,
[1680.48 --> 1684.18]  so you're supposed to disable it on an application-based level.
[1684.24 --> 1685.90]  You don't just turn off Crossfire at all
[1685.90 --> 1689.26]  and let your computer see two individual separate GPUs.
[1689.28 --> 1689.90]  Which I kind of get.
[1691.60 --> 1692.84]  PCI Express is complicated.
[1693.04 --> 1693.78]  It's not simple.
[1693.92 --> 1694.52]  Yeah, that's fair.
[1694.54 --> 1695.66]  So having a single interface,
[1695.88 --> 1696.28]  like, okay.
[1696.40 --> 1696.90]  But then,
[1697.28 --> 1699.52]  I guess it didn't pick up the application properly,
[1699.56 --> 1700.94]  or the application wasn't reporting properly,
[1700.98 --> 1701.28]  or something.
[1701.28 --> 1702.18]  I don't know what was going on,
[1702.26 --> 1703.10]  but it just wasn't working,
[1703.22 --> 1704.98]  and it was going straight Crossfire right into the application.
[1704.98 --> 1705.60]  So it was like,
[1705.72 --> 1706.30]  okay.
[1707.02 --> 1707.98]  Nothing else we can really do.
[1708.90 --> 1709.54]  So yeah,
[1709.76 --> 1710.66]  I would recommend,
[1710.94 --> 1713.56]  whether you're on the red team or the green team,
[1713.78 --> 1716.56]  I would wait for a single GPU card
[1716.56 --> 1720.48]  that is going to not only deliver probably very similar performance,
[1720.48 --> 1721.88]  but sort of,
[1721.88 --> 1722.04]  what?
[1722.26 --> 1722.54]  Echo.
[1724.12 --> 1724.44]  Echo?
[1724.44 --> 1724.56]  Echo?
[1725.28 --> 1725.56]  Echo?
[1725.92 --> 1726.26]  Or what?
[1726.64 --> 1727.04]  I don't know.
[1727.12 --> 1728.08]  Apparently there's an echo.
[1730.00 --> 1732.24]  I have literally not touched the computer.
[1733.76 --> 1734.04]  So.
[1734.58 --> 1736.30]  Why is this happening?
[1738.20 --> 1739.60]  Everything is awesome.
[1741.54 --> 1744.06]  Everything is cool when you're on the WEN show.
[1744.06 --> 1748.76]  Everything is awesome when you echo,
[1748.98 --> 1749.44]  echo.
[1750.00 --> 1750.14]  Oh,
[1750.22 --> 1750.90]  that was pretty good.
[1751.92 --> 1754.24]  I wonder how many echoes they're going to hear of you saying that.
[1754.30 --> 1754.56]  Echo,
[1754.68 --> 1754.86]  yeah.
[1756.88 --> 1757.82]  Got some people saying it's fine.
[1757.82 --> 1758.68]  What if we echo ourselves?
[1758.80 --> 1759.48]  This is good enough.
[1759.94 --> 1760.98]  What if we echo ourselves?
[1761.30 --> 1762.26]  What if we echo each other?
[1763.58 --> 1764.60]  What if we echo each other?
[1764.70 --> 1765.14]  Each other.
[1765.34 --> 1765.74]  Each other.
[1765.94 --> 1766.32]  Each other.
[1766.40 --> 1766.68]  Each other.
[1766.68 --> 1767.08]  Each other.
[1767.08 --> 1769.02]  People are like,
[1769.06 --> 1769.72]  you unplugged something.
[1769.84 --> 1769.98]  No,
[1770.06 --> 1770.66]  I didn't.
[1771.62 --> 1776.56]  My hands have been visible the whole time.
[1776.64 --> 1777.34]  You actually didn't.
[1777.44 --> 1778.50]  If I unplugged anything,
[1778.66 --> 1780.82]  it was definitely in my pants.
[1781.00 --> 1781.24]  So,
[1781.38 --> 1781.62]  okay,
[1781.72 --> 1784.02]  let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.
[1784.78 --> 1788.08]  Polaris 11 running 4K VR content pictured.
[1788.26 --> 1790.08]  Few Polaris 10 details.
[1790.80 --> 1791.00]  So,
[1791.12 --> 1792.66]  Ryan Shrout tweeted,
[1792.94 --> 1797.02]  I did get to see AMD's Polaris 11 GPU running,
[1797.08 --> 1797.84]  passively,
[1798.36 --> 1801.86]  while playing back 4K VR content last night.
[1802.38 --> 1804.10]  Pretty impressive.
[1805.20 --> 1805.42]  Dun,
[1805.52 --> 1805.76]  dun,
[1805.88 --> 1806.22]  dun.
[1806.96 --> 1808.00]  For Polaris 10,
[1808.08 --> 1811.56]  the sample used during their event had five display outputs,
[1812.00 --> 1814.54]  three DisplayPort 1.3s,
[1814.92 --> 1816.30]  8K,
[1816.78 --> 1817.28]  8K,
[1818.08 --> 1819.28]  HDMI 2.0,
[1819.64 --> 1820.04]  finally,
[1820.48 --> 1821.12]  thank you AMD,
[1821.58 --> 1823.52]  and DVI-D Dual Link.
[1823.52 --> 1823.76]  Although,
[1823.86 --> 1827.00]  it still bothers me that AMD has removed VGA output,
[1827.08 --> 1828.44]  from their cards entirely.
[1828.98 --> 1830.32]  I don't remember why,
[1830.64 --> 1831.98]  but it inconvenienced me,
[1832.08 --> 1833.12]  not that long ago,
[1833.22 --> 1835.46]  when I was stuck with VGA,
[1835.72 --> 1837.06]  and I had an AMD card,
[1837.12 --> 1837.40]  and I was like,
[1837.44 --> 1837.60]  oh,
[1837.64 --> 1837.92]  crap.
[1839.20 --> 1839.82]  Cannot do.
[1840.08 --> 1841.16]  According to VR World,
[1841.16 --> 1846.38]  the PCB of the Polaris 10 engineering sample was not much bigger than the R9 Nano.
[1847.10 --> 1847.44]  So,
[1847.64 --> 1849.08]  AMD has taken this whole,
[1849.26 --> 1849.46]  yep,
[1849.54 --> 1851.46]  we are serious about improving efficiency,
[1851.72 --> 1853.36]  and reducing the size.
[1853.52 --> 1854.42]  Let's see if we have a picture.
[1854.42 --> 1854.50]  Well,
[1854.50 --> 1855.78]  the Nano is a damn cool card.
[1855.98 --> 1856.06]  Yeah.
[1856.06 --> 1856.22]  So,
[1856.22 --> 1856.52]  like,
[1857.20 --> 1858.70]  I don't blame them for going that direction.
[1858.74 --> 1860.00]  And if you're running HBM memory,
[1860.22 --> 1862.14]  you don't have to have all those traces,
[1862.32 --> 1863.94]  and all that additional PCB complexity,
[1864.12 --> 1865.84]  so you might as well simplify things,
[1865.96 --> 1870.16]  and improve compatibility with smaller cases while you're at it.
[1870.18 --> 1870.30]  Now,
[1870.34 --> 1871.08]  with that said,
[1871.48 --> 1873.54]  what we have observed about the R9 Nano,
[1873.54 --> 1877.28]  is there aren't really a whole lot of cases that can handle the thermals,
[1877.68 --> 1882.86]  but are not designed for a larger 10.5 inch sort of NVIDIA reference card these days.
[1883.26 --> 1884.38]  But if AMD keeps this up,
[1884.38 --> 1887.24]  maybe we'll see that change.
[1887.64 --> 1887.76]  Well,
[1887.92 --> 1892.84]  I think the problems with the bomb were as much operator error as anything else.
[1893.04 --> 1893.06]  Hey,
[1893.16 --> 1893.94]  that was mean.
[1894.36 --> 1895.22]  I thought it was cool.
[1896.04 --> 1896.26]  Hey,
[1896.30 --> 1898.62]  it's not like you don't go after me about the servers periodically.
[1899.12 --> 1899.32]  Yeah.
[1900.34 --> 1900.74]  Frequently.
[1901.04 --> 1901.16]  Well,
[1901.16 --> 1901.66]  it's fair game.
[1902.00 --> 1902.36]  Frequently,
[1902.60 --> 1902.74]  like,
[1902.84 --> 1903.48]  quite frequently.
[1903.98 --> 1904.00]  So,
[1904.10 --> 1904.48]  yeah.
[1904.96 --> 1905.60]  To be fair,
[1905.64 --> 1907.56]  I think the servers have more problems than the bomb did.
[1907.72 --> 1908.46]  Had enough of,
[1908.50 --> 1909.72]  had enough of your crap.
[1910.18 --> 1910.44]  So,
[1910.54 --> 1911.28]  yeah.
[1912.44 --> 1913.68]  Want to talk about the crazy NUC?
[1915.10 --> 1915.62]  Like,
[1915.78 --> 1917.22]  absolutely insane NUC?
[1917.30 --> 1917.50]  Yeah,
[1917.56 --> 1918.68]  let's talk about the NUC.
[1919.00 --> 1919.26]  So,
[1919.42 --> 1922.20]  this was originally posted on the forum by Alex Goes High.
[1922.26 --> 1923.54]  Have you already posted the PC per link?
[1923.56 --> 1923.90]  Going right now.
[1924.14 --> 1924.38]  Alright,
[1924.46 --> 1925.08]  let's do it.
[1925.74 --> 1926.16]  Meet
[1926.16 --> 1928.80]  the new Intel
[1928.80 --> 1930.62]  Skull Trail NUC
[1930.62 --> 1932.76]  changing the game.
[1932.76 --> 1934.22]  No,
[1934.22 --> 1934.32]  no,
[1934.32 --> 1936.52]  this is a reference to a demo
[1936.52 --> 1938.04]  that Intel did,
[1938.14 --> 1938.70]  I think,
[1938.76 --> 1943.64]  I think this is a reference to a demo that Intel did back at CES 2015,
[1943.64 --> 1947.08]  where they had a Skull Trail system,
[1947.08 --> 1954.58]  and they were showing a Skull Trail system accelerating a demo where you could zoom in and zoom out of this,
[1954.64 --> 1954.76]  like,
[1954.80 --> 1956.28]  really cool photo manager that,
[1956.36 --> 1956.50]  like,
[1956.58 --> 1959.54]  in real time was resizing pictures as you moved in and out of it.
[1959.54 --> 1964.72]  and then they also had a NUC running that demo at the same speed.
[1964.72 --> 1965.16]  Ooh.
[1965.16 --> 1965.80]  Now,
[1965.96 --> 1969.24]  that's not because the NUC had the same CPU performance,
[1970.02 --> 1974.66]  but because the Skull Trail was running purely on CPU,
[1975.04 --> 1977.08]  and the NUC was DPU accelerating it.
[1977.08 --> 1981.28]  and then it was a demo of how the change in the way that we have,
[1981.70 --> 1983.64]  in the way that Intel has approached,
[1983.72 --> 1984.84]  and the industry as a whole,
[1984.94 --> 1985.20]  actually,
[1985.30 --> 1989.32]  but the way that Intel has approached improving computer power
[1989.32 --> 1993.08]  has allowed new experiences with much lower power consumption.
[1993.60 --> 1994.42]  I love that logo.
[1995.48 --> 1995.90]  Yeah,
[1995.96 --> 1996.14]  I know.
[1996.18 --> 1997.42]  I never looked at a NUC and be like,
[1997.54 --> 1998.40]  that looks sick.
[1998.50 --> 1998.72]  So,
[1998.86 --> 2000.32]  this is the actual device.
[2000.84 --> 2001.00]  So,
[2001.36 --> 2002.58]  tell us about it then.
[2003.38 --> 2003.52]  I,
[2003.64 --> 2004.10]  I,
[2004.10 --> 2004.64]  I,
[2004.64 --> 2005.24]  I,
[2005.24 --> 2005.46]  I,
[2005.46 --> 2005.48]  I,
[2005.48 --> 2006.88]  You're just staring at it.
[2007.14 --> 2007.46]  You're just,
[2007.58 --> 2007.92]  you're just,
[2007.92 --> 2008.52]  It looks nice.
[2008.58 --> 2009.88]  You're just agape.
[2010.04 --> 2013.58]  It has an i7-6700HQ processor with a 45 watt TDP.
[2013.82 --> 2015.08]  Holy crap.
[2016.14 --> 2016.42]  Like,
[2016.56 --> 2017.00]  real deal,
[2017.12 --> 2017.34]  kids.
[2017.50 --> 2019.80]  I wasn't sure if I cared when I saw a NUC,
[2019.96 --> 2021.34]  because I don't really care about NUCs,
[2021.42 --> 2022.10]  and then I read that.
[2022.22 --> 2022.34]  I was like,
[2022.42 --> 2022.54]  okay,
[2022.54 --> 2022.80]  I care.
[2022.80 --> 2023.54]  Dual M.2 slots,
[2023.68 --> 2023.86]  you know,
[2023.96 --> 2024.24]  whatever.
[2024.48 --> 2026.44]  Intel Iris Pro Graphics 580,
[2026.54 --> 2028.00]  which you probably could have discerned.
[2028.94 --> 2029.72]  Thunderbolt 3,
[2029.72 --> 2032.68]  40 gigabit per second with USB 3.1,
[2033.04 --> 2033.68]  and,
[2033.82 --> 2034.24]  uh,
[2034.24 --> 2036.54]  DisplayPort 1.2 over USB-C.
[2036.94 --> 2037.52]  Holy crap,
[2037.60 --> 2038.20]  that's badass.
[2038.36 --> 2039.54]  Support for DDR4 memory,
[2039.58 --> 2042.42]  up to 32 gigs at some speed,
[2042.48 --> 2043.40]  which probably doesn't matter,
[2043.50 --> 2044.42]  but it's 2133.
[2044.64 --> 2044.82]  Yep.
[2044.98 --> 2045.52]  Um,
[2045.52 --> 2047.16]  full size HDMI 2.0 port,
[2047.26 --> 2048.50]  so he's gonna be happy again.
[2048.62 --> 2048.90]  Yep.
[2049.08 --> 2049.56]  Um,
[2049.60 --> 2051.00]  Intel dual band wireless AC.
[2051.10 --> 2052.88]  HDMI 2.0 is kind of a big deal.
[2053.06 --> 2053.34]  Just saying.
[2053.34 --> 2053.54]  It is.
[2053.60 --> 2053.82]  I know,
[2053.90 --> 2054.06]  I know,
[2054.06 --> 2054.38]  I know.
[2054.38 --> 2054.76]  I know.
[2054.84 --> 2055.28]  I was just saying,
[2055.36 --> 2055.44]  like,
[2055.50 --> 2055.90]  specifically.
[2056.06 --> 2056.48]  Just saying.
[2056.60 --> 2057.12]  I know.
[2057.36 --> 2058.44]  Everyone should be happy.
[2058.62 --> 2059.70]  I'm not saying they aren't.
[2060.72 --> 2061.62]  SD card slot.
[2062.40 --> 2062.96]  That's good.
[2063.18 --> 2063.80]  That's good to have.
[2063.82 --> 2063.96]  Hey,
[2064.04 --> 2065.74]  I like the SD card slot.
[2065.94 --> 2066.30]  Standard,
[2066.30 --> 2066.54]  like,
[2066.54 --> 2068.30]  audio gigabit LAN,
[2068.44 --> 2069.22]  stuff like that.
[2069.42 --> 2070.18]  Infrared sensor,
[2070.34 --> 2071.58]  so that could actually be kind of cool.
[2071.70 --> 2071.80]  Yeah.
[2071.80 --> 2073.12]  People could do some stuff with that.
[2073.12 --> 2075.18]  This is like one BA little machine.
[2075.74 --> 2076.74]  It ships with two lids.
[2076.92 --> 2077.90]  One with the skull logo,
[2078.00 --> 2079.20]  which you should probably use,
[2079.50 --> 2081.72]  and one with a plain matte black,
[2081.84 --> 2083.20]  which is a good idea for them to include.
[2083.28 --> 2083.98]  Also matte black.
[2084.28 --> 2085.14]  Good idea for them to include.
[2085.20 --> 2085.22]  You know,
[2085.22 --> 2087.50]  it's really funny talking to Intel people,
[2087.60 --> 2088.30]  and I hope I'm not,
[2088.36 --> 2088.56]  like,
[2088.62 --> 2089.78]  saying something that I,
[2089.94 --> 2090.12]  you know,
[2090.18 --> 2092.06]  someone told me in confidence or anything.
[2092.16 --> 2092.94]  I don't think so.
[2093.46 --> 2095.32]  But talking to Intel people
[2095.32 --> 2098.02]  about how edgy
[2098.02 --> 2100.54]  putting a skull on something is
[2100.54 --> 2101.56]  internally at Intel.
[2102.16 --> 2102.52]  Meanwhile,
[2102.72 --> 2103.12]  it's like,
[2104.04 --> 2105.78]  skulls are so passe, man.
[2105.84 --> 2106.10]  Yeah.
[2106.10 --> 2106.22]  Like,
[2107.02 --> 2108.68]  when was that even edgy?
[2109.12 --> 2109.34]  Like,
[2109.50 --> 2109.70]  like,
[2109.80 --> 2111.02]  we're talking like,
[2111.18 --> 2112.10]  no fear clothing.
[2113.06 --> 2113.24]  Yeah.
[2113.44 --> 2113.72]  Like,
[2113.96 --> 2116.38]  putting evil eyes on things is like,
[2116.62 --> 2117.00]  edgy.
[2118.28 --> 2118.84]  Intel,
[2119.06 --> 2119.52]  you're like,
[2119.72 --> 2120.92]  stuck in the 90s.
[2121.20 --> 2121.74]  On the one hand,
[2121.74 --> 2122.12]  you're like,
[2122.12 --> 2122.82]  And it's not even like,
[2123.04 --> 2124.24]  a bone style,
[2124.42 --> 2125.58]  it's like this cool,
[2125.68 --> 2125.88]  like,
[2126.44 --> 2127.94]  It's very stylized.
[2127.94 --> 2128.22]  Yeah.
[2128.44 --> 2128.62]  Like,
[2128.64 --> 2129.24]  it looks like,
[2129.32 --> 2130.40]  it looks like a circuit board.
[2130.40 --> 2130.58]  Like,
[2130.62 --> 2131.48]  it's very Intel.
[2131.90 --> 2132.84]  So on the one hand,
[2132.94 --> 2133.72]  you're this like,
[2134.16 --> 2135.26]  forward looking,
[2135.44 --> 2135.66]  like,
[2135.82 --> 2136.78]  working on crap
[2136.78 --> 2137.92]  that you and I won't touch
[2137.92 --> 2139.48]  for 10 to 20 years,
[2139.82 --> 2140.18]  company.
[2140.64 --> 2141.46]  And on the other hand,
[2141.50 --> 2142.26]  you can't figure out
[2142.26 --> 2143.58]  that a skull is not edgy anymore.
[2143.60 --> 2144.98]  we're not sure about skulls.
[2145.04 --> 2145.30]  Yeah.
[2145.80 --> 2146.48]  Maybe it's,
[2146.70 --> 2147.24]  maybe it's,
[2147.28 --> 2147.62]  you know,
[2147.72 --> 2148.10]  too,
[2148.32 --> 2148.38]  too aggressive.
[2148.38 --> 2149.62]  We might scare the children.
[2149.96 --> 2150.36]  Yeah,
[2150.46 --> 2150.60]  it's too scary.
[2150.60 --> 2151.46]  Make sure you ship it
[2151.46 --> 2153.28]  with a matte black cover as well.
[2153.32 --> 2153.56]  Yeah,
[2153.76 --> 2154.20]  you know,
[2154.20 --> 2155.06]  just in case,
[2155.50 --> 2157.04]  because we're too afraid
[2157.04 --> 2158.28]  of skulls or something.
[2158.28 --> 2159.00]  Um,
[2159.10 --> 2160.02]  so now,
[2160.14 --> 2160.80]  to be clear,
[2161.60 --> 2163.34]  it's not as small
[2163.34 --> 2165.32]  as your grandpa's nook.
[2165.54 --> 2165.66]  It's,
[2165.66 --> 2168.00]  it's a 0.69 liter,
[2168.20 --> 2168.40]  though,
[2168.50 --> 2169.04]  which is like,
[2169.16 --> 2170.42]  pretty damn small.
[2170.48 --> 2171.20]  So it's still small.
[2171.30 --> 2171.42]  So,
[2171.50 --> 2171.62]  you know,
[2171.68 --> 2172.44]  like a quart of milk
[2172.44 --> 2173.12]  for the Americans
[2173.12 --> 2174.14]  or a liter of milk
[2174.14 --> 2175.12]  for the non-Americans,
[2175.12 --> 2176.82]  it's still only about
[2176.82 --> 2178.52]  70% of that,
[2178.94 --> 2180.22]  which is not that small.
[2180.30 --> 2180.58]  So it's about
[2180.58 --> 2182.52]  20 centimeters long,
[2182.58 --> 2183.58]  about eight inches long.
[2183.68 --> 2184.88]  I'm doing rough math.
[2184.92 --> 2185.96]  I know that's not quite right.
[2186.38 --> 2186.86]  Um,
[2186.96 --> 2189.52]  by 11 centimeters wide,
[2189.52 --> 2191.18]  by 23 millimeters.
[2191.30 --> 2192.52]  So only about an inch thick.
[2192.56 --> 2193.78]  So it is very,
[2193.90 --> 2194.58]  very small,
[2195.18 --> 2196.42]  pretty darn high powered,
[2196.80 --> 2199.24]  and still not good enough
[2199.24 --> 2200.78]  to run a VR experience
[2200.78 --> 2201.68]  and be strapped
[2201.68 --> 2202.64]  to the back of my head.
[2202.64 --> 2210.46]  Oh my God,
[2210.56 --> 2211.26]  shots fired.
[2211.38 --> 2212.40]  I did not expect that.
[2212.72 --> 2214.36]  I was not prepared for that.
[2214.48 --> 2214.98]  That was good.
[2215.36 --> 2215.68]  That was,
[2215.74 --> 2216.24]  that was good.
[2217.10 --> 2218.22]  But what you could do
[2218.22 --> 2219.16]  is,
[2219.28 --> 2219.48]  you know,
[2219.54 --> 2220.48]  like this doesn't work.
[2220.58 --> 2220.96]  Don't worry.
[2221.04 --> 2221.80]  I know it doesn't work.
[2221.90 --> 2222.26]  It's okay.
[2222.64 --> 2223.60]  You could get one of these
[2223.60 --> 2224.22]  and then get one of those
[2224.22 --> 2225.78]  like external graphics card enclosures
[2225.78 --> 2227.20]  and just hang the whole thing.
[2227.20 --> 2228.16]  It actually could work.
[2228.72 --> 2229.08]  How?
[2229.22 --> 2230.28]  How can you hook it up to this?
[2231.04 --> 2231.30]  Uh,
[2231.36 --> 2231.74]  Thunderbolt?
[2231.74 --> 2232.34]  Thunderbolt.
[2232.34 --> 2233.36]  It's got Thunderbolt, yo.
[2233.62 --> 2234.72]  No, but wouldn't that be,
[2235.00 --> 2235.32]  that could,
[2235.44 --> 2236.68]  oh, that could,
[2237.02 --> 2238.54]  oh, that could sick work.
[2238.54 --> 2238.78]  We have to do that now.
[2239.82 --> 2240.96]  I didn't think that was going to work.
[2241.12 --> 2241.48]  No, because,
[2241.58 --> 2242.04]  because in my head,
[2242.08 --> 2242.82]  I saw one output,
[2242.90 --> 2243.76]  but then you just go to the graphics card
[2243.76 --> 2245.00]  and then go from the graphics card to the,
[2245.10 --> 2247.20]  how long do you think,
[2247.34 --> 2248.66]  okay,
[2249.34 --> 2250.54]  how long do you think,
[2250.78 --> 2252.80]  I didn't think that was going to work.
[2252.80 --> 2254.68]  How long do you think you could carry
[2254.68 --> 2257.20]  like an APC UPS around on your back
[2257.20 --> 2257.80]  in a backpack?
[2258.52 --> 2259.36]  I'll do it.
[2259.76 --> 2262.28]  If we could run one of these Nux
[2262.28 --> 2264.30]  with like a Razer Core,
[2264.76 --> 2265.10]  okay,
[2265.32 --> 2268.34]  so like with like a GTX 980 Ti.
[2268.34 --> 2269.02]  This is the stupidest thing
[2269.02 --> 2270.90]  because we could just do a laptop.
[2271.54 --> 2271.66]  Oh,
[2271.74 --> 2273.08]  but that's so mainstream.
[2274.28 --> 2276.88]  That is way too mainstream.
[2277.10 --> 2277.72]  Not cray cray,
[2277.84 --> 2278.66]  not for Linus Tech Tips.
[2278.68 --> 2278.92]  Yeah, no,
[2279.04 --> 2279.64]  no, no, no, no, no.
[2279.90 --> 2280.38]  I'm down.
[2280.54 --> 2282.36]  I'll like specifically work out for this.
[2282.50 --> 2283.38]  Like we would have to,
[2283.44 --> 2285.10]  like we would have to actually get like,
[2285.16 --> 2286.74]  like a metal framed hiking backpack.
[2287.18 --> 2287.40]  Yep,
[2287.46 --> 2287.60]  right?
[2287.60 --> 2287.96]  I have one.
[2288.88 --> 2289.10]  No,
[2289.14 --> 2290.04]  but we'd have to butcher it.
[2290.22 --> 2291.02]  We should go to like,
[2291.02 --> 2292.14]  we should go to like,
[2292.20 --> 2293.30]  like a swap store.
[2293.30 --> 2293.54]  Yeah,
[2293.66 --> 2293.80]  yeah,
[2293.80 --> 2294.14]  like,
[2294.14 --> 2294.58]  like,
[2294.58 --> 2295.32]  like set plate.
[2295.46 --> 2296.12]  What is that?
[2296.88 --> 2298.04]  Sports replay or like,
[2298.04 --> 2299.98]  like a secondhand equipment store
[2299.98 --> 2301.64]  because all we really want is the,
[2301.68 --> 2302.62]  is the metal frame.
[2302.98 --> 2305.16]  And then we would have to basically find a way
[2305.16 --> 2306.12]  to get like,
[2306.12 --> 2308.20]  some kind of a UPS on there
[2308.20 --> 2310.04]  to power the graphics card and the NUC.
[2310.32 --> 2311.42]  And you'd only be able to play
[2311.42 --> 2312.44]  for probably like nine minutes.
[2312.76 --> 2312.98]  Like,
[2313.02 --> 2314.10]  I hope you know that already.
[2314.46 --> 2315.08]  Because the battery?
[2315.40 --> 2315.62]  Yeah.
[2316.04 --> 2316.26]  Yeah.
[2316.40 --> 2318.40]  Because like that kind of a graphics card
[2318.40 --> 2320.34]  sucking back like a couple hundred watts,
[2320.44 --> 2323.50]  like no UPS that you can physically carry
[2323.50 --> 2326.14]  is designed to run for longer than like,
[2326.14 --> 2326.74]  you know,
[2326.92 --> 2327.86]  10 to 15,
[2328.06 --> 2328.90]  maybe 20 minutes.
[2329.64 --> 2332.84]  But that would be bananas.
[2332.84 --> 2333.04]  Anyways,
[2333.54 --> 2336.44]  does HTC and Valve,
[2336.44 --> 2339.34]  do HTC and Valve intend to have like,
[2340.06 --> 2341.60]  lighthouses on steroids?
[2342.66 --> 2343.52]  What do you know?
[2343.66 --> 2344.10]  What do you mean?
[2344.16 --> 2345.34]  Like lighthouse units,
[2345.52 --> 2346.08]  but like,
[2346.66 --> 2347.38]  on steroids.
[2347.88 --> 2348.74]  So you could,
[2348.82 --> 2349.04]  you know,
[2349.10 --> 2349.68]  they're lighthouses,
[2349.84 --> 2349.94]  right?
[2349.94 --> 2350.06]  Yeah,
[2350.12 --> 2351.44]  but I don't understand the on steroids.
[2351.68 --> 2352.80]  On steroids is like,
[2352.84 --> 2354.38]  if we had an empty warehouse,
[2354.52 --> 2355.22]  say for example,
[2355.60 --> 2356.86]  putting it in the corners of it.
[2356.86 --> 2357.30]  Oh.
[2359.46 --> 2360.06]  I mean,
[2360.14 --> 2360.90]  theoretically.
[2362.70 --> 2363.22]  They,
[2363.32 --> 2365.14]  they have the play box dimensions.
[2365.14 --> 2365.58]  Like,
[2367.12 --> 2367.72]  no.
[2369.32 --> 2370.88]  So we'll have to wait for,
[2371.06 --> 2374.54]  a new generation of UPS batteries
[2374.54 --> 2376.10]  that is much lighter.
[2376.30 --> 2377.98]  And a new generation of lighthouses.
[2377.98 --> 2379.00]  We should just get like,
[2379.40 --> 2381.64]  attach like a wire frame around my waist
[2381.64 --> 2384.22]  and have like big long wire arms go out
[2384.22 --> 2385.44]  that hold the lighthouses.
[2385.44 --> 2388.96]  Now that's just done.
[2389.06 --> 2389.20]  Oh,
[2389.28 --> 2390.94]  it was a great idea up until then.
[2391.00 --> 2391.48]  What a dick.
[2392.10 --> 2392.82]  What a dick.
[2393.04 --> 2394.02]  We could also just like,
[2394.32 --> 2396.18]  have a helmet with a pole going out on it
[2396.18 --> 2396.82]  and then hang,
[2397.32 --> 2397.78]  uh,
[2397.82 --> 2398.70]  an Oculus one.
[2399.04 --> 2399.96]  Or a Mac Pro.
[2400.30 --> 2402.38]  So you could selfie your VR experience.
[2404.32 --> 2406.00]  The Mac Pro is just for selfies.
[2406.52 --> 2407.46]  Did you see that?
[2407.56 --> 2409.26]  Did you not see the Mac Pro selfie stick?
[2409.42 --> 2409.58]  No.
[2409.68 --> 2410.50]  Someone did it as like,
[2410.50 --> 2410.74]  an art project.
[2410.74 --> 2410.80]  Oh,
[2410.80 --> 2410.92]  no,
[2411.02 --> 2411.52]  I did see that.
[2411.62 --> 2411.78]  Okay,
[2411.82 --> 2412.06]  yeah,
[2412.06 --> 2412.28]  yeah,
[2412.28 --> 2412.38]  yeah,
[2412.38 --> 2412.62]  yeah.
[2414.12 --> 2414.76]  People are like,
[2414.84 --> 2415.28]  WTF,
[2415.44 --> 2415.70]  Luke.
[2416.02 --> 2417.84]  This used to be a Dennis stream.
[2419.70 --> 2421.26]  We need to bring back Dennis.
[2421.44 --> 2422.28]  I tried last time.
[2422.34 --> 2423.38]  It didn't really work that well.
[2423.62 --> 2423.78]  People,
[2423.86 --> 2424.34]  someone's like,
[2424.46 --> 2424.70]  worst,
[2424.80 --> 2426.64]  worst when show ever.
[2427.36 --> 2428.48]  So not worst,
[2428.60 --> 2430.26]  but it is worse.
[2430.46 --> 2431.50]  Worst when show ever.
[2431.54 --> 2432.84]  So as long as it's not the best,
[2432.96 --> 2434.70]  then technically it is the worst.
[2435.18 --> 2436.32]  The worst when show.
[2436.50 --> 2438.08]  But is it best or best?
[2438.08 --> 2438.64]  Uh,
[2438.64 --> 2439.60]  I don't know.
[2439.66 --> 2445.02]  But what I do know is that the longer we make fun of the grammar and spelling of our audience,
[2445.02 --> 2448.34]  the closer we're getting to it being the worst when show ever.
[2449.50 --> 2449.94]  Um,
[2449.94 --> 2451.48]  speaking of worst when show ever,
[2451.56 --> 2453.88]  why don't we talk about the sponsors of today's when show?
[2454.02 --> 2454.50]  Yeah.
[2454.50 --> 2455.50]  Dollar shave club.
[2455.58 --> 2456.08]  Dot com.
[2456.16 --> 2459.34]  Proud sponsor of the worst when show ever.
[2459.34 --> 2461.98]  So if you guys were thinking to yourself,
[2462.08 --> 2462.22]  gee,
[2463.34 --> 2464.36]  I've got a neck beard.
[2464.90 --> 2467.36]  I want to shave a forementioned neck beard,
[2467.84 --> 2470.58]  but I don't want anyone to see my neck beard.
[2471.50 --> 2479.78]  How could I get shaving supplies delivered directly to my door for less than it would cost me to go to the grocery store,
[2480.06 --> 2485.34]  wait around for someone to unlock the stupid locked cabinet that the freaking like,
[2485.34 --> 2487.82]  between razor blades,
[2488.72 --> 2489.46]  printer ink,
[2489.68 --> 2490.42]  and perfume.
[2490.98 --> 2496.50]  We've got like a trifecta of overpriced stuff that shouldn't cost that much.
[2496.50 --> 2497.32]  That you need to use all the time.
[2497.34 --> 2499.04]  That you need to use all the time,
[2499.14 --> 2504.70]  especially if you're hairy and you stink and you need to make a lot of printer copies.
[2505.60 --> 2506.08]  Okay.
[2506.90 --> 2509.02]  Then dollar shave club is the answer.
[2509.30 --> 2511.68]  By going to dollar shave club.com,
[2511.68 --> 2519.90]  you can get reasonably priced shaving supplies delivered straight to your door once a month.
[2520.00 --> 2521.06]  And not just razors.
[2521.52 --> 2523.04]  Also their aftershave.
[2523.18 --> 2523.28]  Yeah.
[2523.46 --> 2524.88]  Their Dr. Carver shave butter.
[2524.90 --> 2525.78]  Their Dr. Carver shave butter.
[2525.80 --> 2526.54]  Or like Charlie's.
[2526.58 --> 2529.34]  And even their peppermint scented butt wipes for men.
[2529.88 --> 2531.68]  So visit dollarshaveclub.com
[2532.34 --> 2534.68]  slash Linus
[2534.68 --> 2536.50]  and join the club.
[2536.76 --> 2536.98]  Yep.
[2536.98 --> 2539.64]  In the US, Canada, and Australia.
[2539.98 --> 2542.04]  In the US, Canada, and Australia.
[2542.22 --> 2544.24]  If you have a neckbeard in Europe, like, I'm sorry, bro.
[2544.42 --> 2544.70]  Yeah.
[2544.84 --> 2546.36]  Then you're just going to have to go out
[2546.36 --> 2549.70]  and wear that neckbeard loud and proud.
[2550.76 --> 2553.70]  I mean, can you imagine having a neckbeard that was so bearded
[2553.70 --> 2555.66]  that it was legitimately loud?
[2556.42 --> 2557.92]  You'd have to have things living in it.
[2558.92 --> 2562.20]  Which, unfortunately, has probably happened at some point.
[2562.38 --> 2562.76]  Probably, yeah.
[2563.26 --> 2563.74]  All right.
[2563.80 --> 2564.96]  Moving on to our next sponsor.
[2565.10 --> 2566.60]  This is a more serious sponsor.
[2566.60 --> 2568.04]  They don't have butt wipes.
[2568.16 --> 2573.58]  What they do have is top-tier managed cloud computing solutions.
[2573.80 --> 2575.40]  They've got dedicated storage options
[2575.40 --> 2578.08]  to meet your performance, security, network capacity,
[2578.34 --> 2580.02]  and compliance needs.
[2580.40 --> 2584.48]  And they are backed by what they call fanatical support.
[2584.62 --> 2585.42]  Which they're really well known for.
[2585.48 --> 2588.46]  24-7, 365, baby.
[2588.60 --> 2593.36]  If you have a problem on Christmas Eve or even Christmas Day,
[2593.36 --> 2597.56]  that is one of the 365 days in the year,
[2597.64 --> 2598.76]  and they will take care of it.
[2598.76 --> 2601.24]  Now, this year was a leap year.
[2601.66 --> 2606.12]  So, unfortunately, 19 days ago, you were pretty much SOL.
[2606.46 --> 2606.92]  Not true.
[2607.04 --> 2609.20]  Because this year had 366 days.
[2609.74 --> 2611.92]  They advertised 365, okay?
[2612.34 --> 2613.68]  They're better than advertised.
[2613.82 --> 2615.26]  Once every four years...
[2615.26 --> 2616.54]  They under-promise, over-deliver.
[2616.54 --> 2618.06]  Rackspace takes a day off.
[2618.26 --> 2619.02]  They don't.
[2619.16 --> 2619.66]  They don't.
[2620.76 --> 2622.10]  What are we talking about?
[2622.68 --> 2623.04]  Rackspace.
[2623.26 --> 2625.12]  They're inviting you to deep dive sessions.
[2625.34 --> 2627.98]  They take about an hour every week or two
[2627.98 --> 2629.88]  to discuss benefits of dedicated solutions
[2629.88 --> 2630.48]  in a largely cloud world.
[2630.48 --> 2631.42]  I have a link for that.
[2631.42 --> 2633.94]  So, if you want to take a Rackspace deep dive,
[2634.02 --> 2635.40]  you guys can check that out.
[2635.84 --> 2639.20]  The long and short of it is they will discuss...
[2639.20 --> 2640.00]  You just said it.
[2640.54 --> 2640.76]  Yep.
[2640.82 --> 2642.88]  On March 23rd, they'll have one on
[2642.88 --> 2644.50]  improving your operational efficiency,
[2644.74 --> 2647.08]  which is, like, good for everything ever.
[2647.32 --> 2649.28]  They typically do about three sessions a month
[2649.28 --> 2650.36]  via Google Hangouts,
[2650.46 --> 2652.08]  and they will provide you with downloads
[2652.08 --> 2653.98]  to reference architecture, e-books,
[2654.12 --> 2656.40]  and white papers on the sessions' landing pages.
[2656.94 --> 2659.14]  So, it's live with active participation,
[2659.14 --> 2661.64]  so you can go ask your questions and interact with them.
[2661.72 --> 2664.34]  So, there's deep dives coming up on March 23rd
[2664.34 --> 2666.34]  and on March 30th.
[2666.40 --> 2668.34]  The second one is how to optimize
[2668.34 --> 2670.88]  SQL Server for performance and reliability.
[2671.16 --> 2673.68]  This kind of stuff is just plain beneficial.
[2674.26 --> 2675.22]  So, check it out.
[2675.36 --> 2677.66]  Give yourself a chance to talk to Rackspace experts
[2677.66 --> 2681.04]  and learn a little something while you are at it.
[2681.54 --> 2684.68]  Which leads us to our last sponsor of the day.
[2684.70 --> 2685.98]  Which has out-of-date notes.
[2685.98 --> 2689.02]  A totally serious one as well.
[2689.44 --> 2689.72]  Squarespace.
[2689.92 --> 2690.64]  Yeah, yeah.
[2690.94 --> 2693.40]  When is the sales team ever going to update
[2693.40 --> 2695.12]  our Squarespace notes, sales team?
[2695.12 --> 2696.62]  Maybe this is part of their crime school.
[2696.74 --> 2697.82]  You know what we should do?
[2698.18 --> 2700.14]  Is we should completely ignore
[2700.14 --> 2702.58]  any new Squarespace talking points
[2702.58 --> 2704.66]  until they update our talking points.
[2704.92 --> 2706.78]  I'm going to pretend that I still think
[2706.78 --> 2708.34]  Squarespace's slogan is...
[2708.34 --> 2709.72]  You know what? You probably should.
[2709.88 --> 2712.34]  Simple, powerful, beautiful.
[2712.90 --> 2713.48]  You should do that.
[2713.56 --> 2714.60]  You know what else I'm going to say?
[2715.08 --> 2717.62]  I'm going to say that they have 24-7 support
[2717.62 --> 2718.82]  via live chat and email.
[2718.92 --> 2719.56]  You should say that.
[2719.66 --> 2720.08]  Thank you.
[2720.14 --> 2720.82]  That would be applicable.
[2720.90 --> 2722.42]  I'm going to say that Squarespace starts
[2722.42 --> 2723.98]  at only $8 a month
[2723.98 --> 2725.02]  and you get a free domain
[2725.02 --> 2726.52]  if you buy Squarespace for a year.
[2726.58 --> 2727.30]  You should also say that.
[2727.34 --> 2727.90]  That would be accurate.
[2728.26 --> 2730.26]  I'm going to say that their templates
[2730.26 --> 2731.82]  feature responsive design
[2731.82 --> 2734.52]  so your website scales to look great on any device.
[2734.66 --> 2735.72]  You should also say
[2735.72 --> 2737.72]  that they have commerce modules
[2737.72 --> 2738.94]  so you can buy stuff.
[2739.08 --> 2739.52]  Yeah, yeah.
[2739.52 --> 2740.58]  or well you can sell stuff
[2740.58 --> 2741.70]  or buy stuff from other people
[2741.70 --> 2742.10]  that have websites.
[2742.10 --> 2743.36]  And if the notes said anything
[2743.36 --> 2744.64]  about cover pages
[2744.64 --> 2745.88]  then you should...
[2745.88 --> 2747.72]  Talk about how you can have a cover page
[2747.72 --> 2748.38]  if you want to do something
[2748.38 --> 2749.54]  like a resume style website.
[2749.62 --> 2751.24]  Just like a simple online presence
[2751.24 --> 2753.66]  and the most important thing
[2753.66 --> 2755.62]  that you should cover
[2755.62 --> 2757.46]  is that when you decide
[2757.46 --> 2758.34]  to sign up for Squarespace
[2758.34 --> 2759.70]  after your two week free trial
[2759.70 --> 2760.42]  to try it out
[2760.42 --> 2761.56]  and see how simple it is
[2761.56 --> 2765.28]  you should save 10%
[2765.28 --> 2767.20]  by using offer code Linus.
[2767.20 --> 2767.42]  Yeah.
[2767.56 --> 2768.04]  Which...
[2768.04 --> 2769.56]  You should do.
[2769.66 --> 2770.20]  You should do.
[2770.70 --> 2771.18]  Thank you.
[2771.64 --> 2773.64]  Thank you for watching the WAN show.
[2773.66 --> 2774.50]  You should probably build it beautiful.
[2774.56 --> 2775.84]  You should probably build it beautiful.
[2776.22 --> 2777.42]  You should probably build it simple
[2777.42 --> 2778.66]  and powerful too.
[2783.04 --> 2784.20]  It is a miracle
[2784.20 --> 2785.58]  that anyone sponsors us.
[2789.58 --> 2789.94]  Good.
[2790.30 --> 2791.16]  Brandon informs us
[2791.16 --> 2792.70]  we're making Colton and Nick cringe.
[2793.96 --> 2795.54]  I wish we could do more to them.
[2797.20 --> 2798.00]  But alas,
[2798.06 --> 2799.82]  our words are only so powerful
[2799.82 --> 2800.72]  from down here.
[2800.96 --> 2802.98]  They learned to get away from us
[2802.98 --> 2803.60]  in crime school.
[2803.84 --> 2804.88]  Yeah, crime school.
[2806.20 --> 2807.86]  What have we even talked about
[2807.86 --> 2808.70]  on the show today?
[2808.70 --> 2808.80]  I don't know.
[2809.08 --> 2810.52]  Broken baby food jar
[2810.52 --> 2811.74]  leads to Sweden's first
[2811.74 --> 2813.12]  unstaffed grocery store.
[2813.20 --> 2814.72]  How does that make any freaking sense?
[2814.80 --> 2815.16]  I don't know,
[2815.24 --> 2815.88]  but I'll tell you.
[2815.88 --> 2815.90]  Fascinating.
[2816.26 --> 2817.58]  Sweden IT specialist
[2817.58 --> 2818.50]  Robert...
[2818.50 --> 2819.52]  Whoa.
[2821.52 --> 2822.20]  Um...
[2822.20 --> 2824.20]  Swedish...
[2824.20 --> 2825.82]  I'm gonna...
[2825.82 --> 2826.32]  I tried.
[2826.42 --> 2828.10]  Swedish IT specialist Robert
[2828.10 --> 2830.28]  owns a store that is unmanned.
[2831.12 --> 2832.06]  It's a town...
[2832.06 --> 2833.30]  It's a town in...
[2833.30 --> 2834.24]  Yeah, it's in a town in Sweden.
[2834.32 --> 2834.82]  The store is...
[2834.82 --> 2836.66]  Basically, he's trying to feed his...
[2836.66 --> 2838.96]  I didn't see Nick behind the camera.
[2839.82 --> 2840.72]  I see him now.
[2840.84 --> 2841.00]  Yeah.
[2841.10 --> 2842.02]  Basically, he's trying to feed...
[2842.02 --> 2843.66]  I believe it was his baby daughter?
[2843.98 --> 2844.68]  Baby whatever.
[2845.12 --> 2846.66]  And he broke a food jar
[2846.66 --> 2847.94]  and had to drive really far
[2847.94 --> 2848.72]  to find somewhere
[2848.72 --> 2849.60]  that was still open
[2849.60 --> 2850.84]  because it was really late at night
[2850.84 --> 2851.50]  or early in the morning
[2851.50 --> 2851.94]  or something.
[2852.12 --> 2852.98]  And he got frustrated
[2852.98 --> 2853.42]  and was like,
[2853.48 --> 2854.50]  why don't we just have stores
[2854.50 --> 2855.66]  that can be open all the time?
[2855.88 --> 2856.20]  Everywhere!
[2856.50 --> 2857.40]  So he made a store
[2857.40 --> 2859.26]  that can be open all the time.
[2859.74 --> 2860.76]  You sign up.
[2860.86 --> 2861.90]  There's a credit check
[2861.90 --> 2862.78]  that you have to go through.
[2863.08 --> 2864.68]  You get an app on your phone
[2864.68 --> 2866.56]  so you can manage your purchase and stuff.
[2866.62 --> 2867.40]  You can just walk in,
[2867.74 --> 2868.90]  scan the things that you want,
[2868.98 --> 2869.56]  and walk out,
[2869.62 --> 2870.82]  and then you get a bill once a month.
[2871.24 --> 2872.36]  That is so cool.
[2872.40 --> 2873.28]  If the door stays open
[2873.28 --> 2874.48]  for longer than eight seconds
[2874.48 --> 2875.58]  or is tampered with,
[2876.22 --> 2878.54]  Robert will receive an alert.
[2879.70 --> 2880.36]  There you go.
[2880.70 --> 2881.50]  I mean, to be clear,
[2881.60 --> 2882.50]  this isn't the kind of thing
[2882.50 --> 2883.50]  that we're expecting...
[2883.84 --> 2884.62]  I don't know.
[2884.76 --> 2885.12]  Iliason?
[2885.66 --> 2887.82]  This is not the kind of thing
[2887.82 --> 2889.58]  that I'm expecting personally
[2889.58 --> 2891.54]  to be able to be rolled out
[2891.54 --> 2892.78]  in like, you know, New York.
[2893.26 --> 2894.00]  Or that was terrible.
[2894.22 --> 2894.48]  New York.
[2895.26 --> 2896.04]  I tried.
[2896.16 --> 2896.80]  I'm going there,
[2896.90 --> 2898.12]  so I was trying to like...
[2898.12 --> 2898.92]  Oh my God.
[2900.22 --> 2900.66]  New York.
[2901.02 --> 2902.22]  Just screw off.
[2902.78 --> 2903.78]  New York.
[2903.78 --> 2905.36]  Or like, you know,
[2905.48 --> 2907.26]  LA or whatever anytime soon
[2907.26 --> 2907.92]  because you'd need
[2907.92 --> 2908.82]  a fair bit more security.
[2908.96 --> 2909.98]  But right now,
[2910.02 --> 2911.56]  it's deployed out in a small town,
[2911.66 --> 2913.32]  only about 4,200 residents.
[2913.66 --> 2915.42]  So exactly the kind of town,
[2915.54 --> 2916.56]  especially in Europe.
[2916.94 --> 2917.84]  Like, I've noticed that.
[2918.10 --> 2919.24]  Where the grocery store
[2919.24 --> 2920.66]  would close at like,
[2921.40 --> 2922.20]  4 p.m.
[2922.20 --> 2922.82]  Oh my God.
[2923.04 --> 2924.52]  And you'd just be like...
[2924.52 --> 2925.18]  Switzerland,
[2925.48 --> 2927.00]  everything closes so early.
[2927.34 --> 2928.12]  Well, it was the same thing
[2928.12 --> 2928.52]  in Germany.
[2928.80 --> 2929.14]  Yeah.
[2929.50 --> 2930.30]  Remember the day
[2930.30 --> 2931.22]  we landed in Germany,
[2931.22 --> 2932.50]  it was like 2 in the afternoon
[2932.50 --> 2933.66]  and freaking everything
[2933.66 --> 2934.18]  was closed.
[2934.18 --> 2934.68]  Dead zone, yeah.
[2934.68 --> 2935.82]  Like, we couldn't get food.
[2935.98 --> 2936.24]  Yeah.
[2936.50 --> 2937.58]  This is ridiculous.
[2937.58 --> 2940.44]  So it's exactly
[2940.44 --> 2941.32]  the sort of environment
[2941.32 --> 2941.96]  where something,
[2942.28 --> 2942.84]  where you would have
[2942.84 --> 2943.64]  a lot of trust
[2943.64 --> 2944.22]  between members
[2944.22 --> 2944.76]  of the community,
[2944.82 --> 2945.74]  very small community.
[2945.94 --> 2946.10]  Yeah.
[2946.28 --> 2948.26]  And you would have
[2948.26 --> 2948.86]  the frustration
[2948.86 --> 2949.70]  of not being able
[2949.70 --> 2950.90]  to buy baby food
[2950.90 --> 2952.12]  in the middle of the night
[2952.12 --> 2953.02]  when your baby's
[2953.02 --> 2953.68]  freaking hungry.
[2954.06 --> 2954.46]  And like,
[2954.62 --> 2955.78]  I don't give a crap
[2955.78 --> 2956.50]  about, you know,
[2956.68 --> 2957.84]  Sweden's
[2957.84 --> 2958.96]  and the Swedish people's
[2958.96 --> 2959.76]  philosophy
[2959.76 --> 2961.46]  about not working too hard
[2961.46 --> 2962.26]  and all that stuff
[2962.26 --> 2963.26]  when my baby's hungry.
[2963.50 --> 2964.82]  So if you can have a store
[2964.82 --> 2965.50]  that just plain
[2965.50 --> 2966.18]  doesn't need anyone
[2966.18 --> 2966.70]  working in it
[2966.70 --> 2967.16]  and I can go get
[2967.16 --> 2968.02]  a freaking thing
[2968.02 --> 2968.56]  of baby food
[2968.56 --> 2968.92]  and hey,
[2968.98 --> 2969.52]  maybe it could be
[2969.52 --> 2970.18]  more expensive
[2970.18 --> 2970.94]  so that, you know,
[2970.98 --> 2972.14]  you could offset
[2972.14 --> 2973.74]  the jobs that'll be lost
[2973.74 --> 2974.14]  or whatever
[2974.14 --> 2975.92]  and justify something.
[2976.30 --> 2977.34]  My first, like,
[2977.82 --> 2979.68]  legit non, like,
[2979.92 --> 2980.62]  I'm a ref
[2980.62 --> 2981.68]  or a paper boy
[2981.68 --> 2983.20]  or I mow your lawn,
[2983.32 --> 2983.94]  like, that kind of stuff.
[2984.00 --> 2985.16]  My first legit, like,
[2985.64 --> 2986.44]  I get a paycheck
[2986.44 --> 2987.80]  every two weeks
[2987.80 --> 2989.28]  from a big corporation
[2989.28 --> 2989.98]  kind of job
[2989.98 --> 2991.16]  was at a grocery store.
[2991.66 --> 2993.12]  So part of,
[2993.12 --> 2994.34]  like, this story is cool.
[2994.54 --> 2995.60]  When I go to grocery stores,
[2995.68 --> 2996.48]  I use automated tills.
[2996.72 --> 2997.48]  When I go to Home Depot,
[2997.88 --> 2998.78]  I use automated tills.
[2999.30 --> 3000.42]  I'm that person already.
[3001.40 --> 3002.26]  Probably horrible
[3002.26 --> 3003.32]  because it's contributing
[3003.32 --> 3004.00]  to stuff like this
[3004.00 --> 3004.68]  which is contributing
[3004.68 --> 3005.96]  to massive amounts
[3005.96 --> 3007.02]  of especially low-end jobs
[3007.02 --> 3007.46]  going away.
[3007.66 --> 3008.22]  With that said,
[3008.40 --> 3009.38]  if there was anywhere
[3009.38 --> 3010.40]  where I would want
[3010.40 --> 3011.44]  to be working
[3011.44 --> 3012.92]  at an entry-level job
[3012.92 --> 3014.18]  only to have it swept out
[3014.18 --> 3014.98]  from under my feet,
[3015.34 --> 3016.28]  it would probably be Sweden
[3016.28 --> 3018.32]  because they will probably
[3018.32 --> 3018.88]  figure out
[3018.88 --> 3019.86]  how to support those people
[3019.86 --> 3021.64]  before other people.
[3021.66 --> 3022.90]  But a lot of other countries won't.
[3022.90 --> 3023.96]  Can you imagine
[3023.96 --> 3025.90]  a Donald Trump America
[3025.90 --> 3028.32]  supporting people
[3028.32 --> 3029.32]  who have lost their jobs?
[3031.32 --> 3032.22]  This is really,
[3032.26 --> 3033.12]  this is really funny.
[3033.50 --> 3034.16]  This is, like,
[3034.22 --> 3035.24]  super, super funny.
[3035.46 --> 3036.74]  I was reading an article
[3036.74 --> 3040.54]  that was about,
[3040.66 --> 3042.38]  it was talking to a writer
[3042.38 --> 3043.80]  of an episode of The Simpsons
[3043.80 --> 3045.36]  from 16 years ago
[3045.36 --> 3046.58]  where, like,
[3046.62 --> 3047.10]  I'm pretty sure
[3047.10 --> 3048.58]  every show has done this.
[3048.58 --> 3049.18]  Oftentimes,
[3049.44 --> 3050.36]  it's a Christmas special
[3050.36 --> 3053.02]  where the ghost of the future
[3053.02 --> 3053.76]  comes back
[3053.76 --> 3055.18]  and shows the character
[3055.18 --> 3057.28]  how their life is,
[3057.48 --> 3057.82]  you know,
[3057.94 --> 3058.54]  heading anyway.
[3058.64 --> 3059.46]  So it's the episode
[3059.46 --> 3060.12]  where Bart
[3060.12 --> 3062.28]  gets to see his future self
[3062.28 --> 3063.10]  and he's in, like,
[3063.20 --> 3063.86]  he's in, like,
[3063.88 --> 3065.00]  a crappy band
[3065.00 --> 3066.80]  and he works in gigs
[3066.80 --> 3067.32]  at, like,
[3067.56 --> 3068.70]  Nelson's Club
[3068.70 --> 3070.34]  and his sister
[3070.34 --> 3070.98]  has just,
[3071.06 --> 3073.14]  just won the presidency
[3073.14 --> 3074.16]  of the United States
[3074.16 --> 3075.04]  and Milhouse,
[3075.16 --> 3076.12]  one of her top aides,
[3076.20 --> 3076.72]  comes in
[3076.72 --> 3078.90]  and holds up a chart
[3078.90 --> 3079.84]  of the,
[3079.84 --> 3081.64]  of the staggering deficit
[3081.64 --> 3082.52]  that they've inherited
[3082.52 --> 3083.96]  from President Trump.
[3085.26 --> 3085.86]  Seriously.
[3085.86 --> 3088.54]  It was so,
[3088.54 --> 3090.40]  it was so ludicrous.
[3090.60 --> 3090.62]  Like,
[3090.90 --> 3091.10]  and,
[3091.10 --> 3092.10]  and so the writer's saying,
[3092.18 --> 3092.30]  like,
[3092.38 --> 3093.84]  we were trying to write
[3093.84 --> 3096.88]  an America's gone crazy,
[3097.30 --> 3097.78]  like,
[3097.92 --> 3099.34]  completely unbelievable
[3099.34 --> 3101.18]  worst case scenario.
[3101.42 --> 3102.38]  Simpsons has done that,
[3102.48 --> 3102.56]  like,
[3102.58 --> 3103.52]  a few times.
[3103.62 --> 3104.68]  And that's what we came up with.
[3104.68 --> 3104.98]  Like,
[3105.04 --> 3105.24]  like,
[3105.28 --> 3105.48]  not,
[3105.58 --> 3105.74]  like,
[3105.92 --> 3106.36]  once.
[3106.64 --> 3106.82]  Like,
[3106.84 --> 3107.98]  they've made crazy predictions,
[3107.98 --> 3108.28]  like,
[3108.36 --> 3109.40]  quite a few times.
[3109.98 --> 3110.70]  And I just,
[3110.84 --> 3111.78]  I thought it was,
[3111.86 --> 3113.20]  I thought it was amazing.
[3113.52 --> 3114.12]  Didn't they do something
[3114.12 --> 3114.30]  with,
[3114.30 --> 3114.42]  like,
[3114.42 --> 3115.42]  the iPad or something?
[3115.86 --> 3115.94]  I,
[3116.04 --> 3116.80]  I'm not sure.
[3117.06 --> 3117.54]  I'm not sure.
[3117.86 --> 3118.78]  Extremely accurately.
[3119.02 --> 3119.32]  What's up,
[3119.38 --> 3119.46]  Nick?
[3119.50 --> 3120.46]  Can I help you?
[3120.58 --> 3120.82]  Yeah,
[3120.96 --> 3121.74]  I'm just gonna say,
[3121.92 --> 3123.44]  if you've ever actually
[3123.44 --> 3124.16]  read the notes,
[3124.26 --> 3125.38]  maybe people would give me
[3125.38 --> 3125.84]  the notes
[3125.84 --> 3126.78]  so that I could give you
[3126.78 --> 3127.34]  the notes.
[3128.00 --> 3128.34]  Sorry,
[3128.40 --> 3129.02]  I can't hear you.
[3129.06 --> 3129.22]  Sorry,
[3129.26 --> 3130.44]  the microphone can't hear you.
[3131.48 --> 3132.42]  Nick's trying to give us
[3132.42 --> 3133.40]  crap about not reading
[3133.40 --> 3133.86]  his notes.
[3133.86 --> 3134.18]  I'm just,
[3134.18 --> 3135.10]  I'm just sitting here
[3135.10 --> 3135.64]  judging you,
[3135.70 --> 3135.80]  man.
[3136.50 --> 3137.64]  Maybe I should come down
[3137.64 --> 3138.34]  and talk about,
[3138.38 --> 3138.60]  you know,
[3138.66 --> 3139.56]  how the mantra's always
[3139.56 --> 3140.06]  during this,
[3140.06 --> 3140.34]  like.
[3140.56 --> 3140.88]  Hey,
[3141.30 --> 3141.54]  hey,
[3142.28 --> 3143.16]  that was because
[3143.16 --> 3144.14]  my capture card
[3144.14 --> 3145.22]  stopped working today.
[3145.22 --> 3146.94]  This week is my capture card.
[3147.06 --> 3148.46]  Last week it was my camera.
[3148.66 --> 3149.66]  Next week it's gonna be
[3149.66 --> 3150.32]  my laptop.
[3151.10 --> 3152.04]  It actually might be
[3152.04 --> 3152.78]  his laptop next week.
[3152.82 --> 3153.08]  I know.
[3153.24 --> 3153.96]  We had some problems
[3153.96 --> 3154.28]  this time.
[3154.34 --> 3155.34]  My phone's not working.
[3155.74 --> 3156.44]  That's why this dream
[3156.44 --> 3156.84]  can't start.
[3156.96 --> 3157.46]  This phone's not working.
[3157.48 --> 3158.66]  I'm just gonna film it all
[3158.66 --> 3159.72]  so we can't get any notes.
[3159.72 --> 3161.72]  My dream cast stopped working.
[3164.72 --> 3165.76]  Is that where you cast
[3165.76 --> 3166.34]  your dreams of
[3166.34 --> 3167.32]  artwork and it else
[3167.32 --> 3167.66]  in the park?
[3167.72 --> 3168.00]  Yeah.
[3168.34 --> 3168.52]  Hey,
[3168.60 --> 3169.68]  that was a cool article.
[3170.02 --> 3170.22]  Alright,
[3170.36 --> 3171.46]  so this next article,
[3171.60 --> 3172.24]  the original one,
[3172.28 --> 3172.94]  it was posted by
[3172.94 --> 3174.38]  Dave Hasland
[3174.38 --> 3175.70]  on the forum.
[3176.70 --> 3177.06]  Nick,
[3177.16 --> 3177.78]  John needs you.
[3178.64 --> 3179.98]  It was originally posted
[3179.98 --> 3181.84]  on Oculus.com
[3181.84 --> 3183.82]  and this is looking
[3183.82 --> 3185.40]  pretty impressive,
[3185.64 --> 3186.08]  we hope,
[3186.16 --> 3187.16]  except we've all seen
[3187.16 --> 3188.08]  this story before.
[3188.24 --> 3188.46]  Yeah,
[3188.60 --> 3188.92]  we hope.
[3188.92 --> 3189.98]  Do you remember
[3189.98 --> 3191.36]  Valve's whole like,
[3191.46 --> 3191.92]  oh yeah,
[3192.06 --> 3193.28]  there's so many games
[3193.28 --> 3194.32]  for SteamOS.
[3196.00 --> 3196.90]  Who cares?
[3198.00 --> 3199.14]  Just because you have
[3199.14 --> 3199.88]  a lot of games
[3199.88 --> 3200.94]  doesn't mean that they're good.
[3202.10 --> 3202.58]  However,
[3203.08 --> 3204.22]  30 games is
[3204.22 --> 3205.62]  more than I expected
[3205.62 --> 3207.26]  Oculus to have
[3207.26 --> 3210.00]  as actual VR games,
[3210.26 --> 3211.04]  not just games
[3211.04 --> 3212.36]  that will work.
[3212.40 --> 3212.68]  Although,
[3213.22 --> 3213.90]  I said that
[3213.90 --> 3215.30]  and I was told that,
[3215.56 --> 3216.54]  but looking closely
[3216.54 --> 3216.94]  at the list,
[3217.10 --> 3217.58]  there's some things
[3217.58 --> 3218.06]  I didn't actually
[3218.06 --> 3218.90]  really notice the first time.
[3219.02 --> 3220.34]  Keep Talking Nobody Explodes.
[3221.96 --> 3222.28]  Actually,
[3222.36 --> 3222.44]  no,
[3222.48 --> 3222.96]  that was originally
[3222.96 --> 3223.50]  a VR game.
[3223.76 --> 3224.56]  It was later made
[3224.56 --> 3225.44]  into a non-VR game.
[3226.44 --> 3227.12]  Where was the
[3227.12 --> 3228.64]  Elite Dangerous?
[3229.26 --> 3229.56]  No,
[3229.66 --> 3230.20]  that's not the one
[3230.20 --> 3230.72]  I was looking for.
[3230.82 --> 3231.76]  Where's the Sniper one?
[3231.90 --> 3232.42]  I swear to God,
[3232.46 --> 3233.38]  I just read a Sniper one.
[3236.24 --> 3236.98]  Project Cars.
[3238.16 --> 3238.38]  Nope,
[3238.44 --> 3238.86]  that probably
[3238.86 --> 3239.16]  is what you're thinking.
[3239.16 --> 3239.64]  I'm crazy.
[3239.90 --> 3240.76]  I think I dyslexiated
[3240.76 --> 3241.38]  the crap out of
[3241.38 --> 3241.94]  Elite Dangerous
[3241.94 --> 3242.38]  and thought it was
[3242.38 --> 3243.98]  like the Elite Sniper.
[3244.08 --> 3244.62]  Sniper Elite.
[3244.82 --> 3245.34]  Sniper Elite,
[3245.48 --> 3245.68]  yeah.
[3246.22 --> 3246.54]  So,
[3246.78 --> 3248.08]  I guess that's not in here
[3248.08 --> 3249.10]  because dyslexia,
[3249.24 --> 3250.06]  so everything's fine.
[3250.12 --> 3250.52]  Never mind.
[3250.84 --> 3252.22]  VR Tennis Online.
[3252.46 --> 3253.02]  Some of these things,
[3253.18 --> 3253.30]  like,
[3253.46 --> 3253.68]  okay,
[3253.80 --> 3254.54]  Adventure Time,
[3254.92 --> 3256.38]  Magic Man's Head Games.
[3257.08 --> 3258.00]  Makes me excited
[3258.00 --> 3259.22]  because it's Adventure Time.
[3259.60 --> 3260.28]  Makes me worry
[3260.28 --> 3260.90]  that it's rushed
[3260.90 --> 3261.84]  because it's $5.
[3261.84 --> 3263.26]  Do you still follow
[3263.26 --> 3263.80]  Adventure Time?
[3263.94 --> 3264.12]  No.
[3264.38 --> 3264.56]  Oh,
[3264.62 --> 3264.84]  okay.
[3265.34 --> 3265.64]  Do you?
[3266.06 --> 3266.90]  It was like,
[3267.10 --> 3267.72]  good and good
[3267.72 --> 3268.26]  and good and good
[3268.26 --> 3268.50]  and good
[3268.50 --> 3269.06]  and then it kind of
[3269.06 --> 3269.56]  lulled
[3269.56 --> 3269.92]  and this kid
[3269.92 --> 3270.28]  seems to be
[3270.28 --> 3270.74]  getting good again.
[3270.98 --> 3271.14]  Cool.
[3271.48 --> 3271.68]  Yeah,
[3271.78 --> 3272.18]  that's cool.
[3272.94 --> 3273.10]  Yep.
[3273.64 --> 3274.48]  Gunjack is like,
[3274.60 --> 3276.00]  that's a gear VR game.
[3276.42 --> 3276.70]  Mm-hmm.
[3277.14 --> 3277.38]  It,
[3277.62 --> 3277.90]  like,
[3277.94 --> 3278.86]  has no place
[3278.86 --> 3280.14]  on Rift
[3280.14 --> 3281.36]  because it's just
[3281.36 --> 3283.06]  way worse than Valkyrie
[3283.06 --> 3283.92]  and that's like about it.
[3284.32 --> 3284.56]  Okay,
[3284.62 --> 3284.76]  cool.
[3284.84 --> 3285.82]  You just can't move
[3285.82 --> 3287.38]  and it's now
[3287.38 --> 3288.00]  a turret game.
[3288.22 --> 3288.34]  Like,
[3288.48 --> 3288.82]  okay.
[3288.82 --> 3292.34]  I don't know.
[3293.50 --> 3293.78]  Okay.
[3294.30 --> 3294.68]  I am,
[3294.76 --> 3295.34]  I'm like,
[3295.46 --> 3295.64]  this,
[3295.76 --> 3296.50]  this doesn't really
[3296.50 --> 3297.04]  a rapid fire topic,
[3297.12 --> 3297.40]  I guess.
[3297.54 --> 3297.84]  Yeah,
[3297.98 --> 3299.06]  doesn't really make
[3299.06 --> 3299.64]  much of a difference
[3299.64 --> 3300.28]  to me
[3300.28 --> 3302.26]  because these could all suck.
[3302.82 --> 3303.60]  You get Lucky's Tale
[3303.60 --> 3304.82]  for free with every purchase
[3304.82 --> 3305.74]  and E! Valkyrie
[3305.74 --> 3306.44]  with pre-orders.
[3306.88 --> 3307.10]  Yeah.
[3307.34 --> 3307.78]  Wow,
[3307.88 --> 3308.38]  I can't believe
[3308.38 --> 3309.10]  they're not just going to
[3309.10 --> 3310.16]  ship it with E! Valkyrie.
[3310.16 --> 3311.26]  that worries me,
[3311.36 --> 3312.02]  which we already knew,
[3312.22 --> 3313.04]  but that worries me
[3313.04 --> 3314.44]  is the E! Valkyrie
[3314.44 --> 3315.36]  is called Founder's Pack.
[3316.98 --> 3317.22]  Yep.
[3317.22 --> 3318.20]  Super makes it
[3318.20 --> 3318.34]  so,
[3318.54 --> 3318.84]  yep.
[3319.74 --> 3320.26]  DLC!
[3321.80 --> 3322.32]  DLC,
[3322.56 --> 3323.24]  or it's like
[3323.24 --> 3325.18]  even possibly
[3325.18 --> 3325.58]  going to be
[3325.58 --> 3326.18]  free to play
[3326.18 --> 3327.06]  with purchases,
[3327.98 --> 3329.14]  which might even
[3329.14 --> 3329.54]  be worse.
[3331.26 --> 3331.82]  Okay,
[3331.98 --> 3332.10]  so,
[3332.18 --> 3333.00]  so much for
[3333.00 --> 3334.30]  WD not completing
[3334.30 --> 3335.34]  their acquisition
[3335.34 --> 3336.54]  of SanDisk.
[3336.82 --> 3337.98]  It has been
[3337.98 --> 3339.32]  overwhelmingly approved
[3339.32 --> 3340.30]  on both sides.
[3340.54 --> 3341.06]  SanDisk,
[3341.40 --> 3342.90]  98% of their shareholders
[3342.90 --> 3343.70]  approved the merger
[3343.70 --> 3344.36]  and WD,
[3344.46 --> 3345.70]  it was about 90%.
[3345.70 --> 3346.62]  So,
[3346.62 --> 3350.10]  yeah,
[3350.50 --> 3351.30]  there you go.
[3351.56 --> 3351.68]  So,
[3351.78 --> 3352.66]  WD officially
[3352.66 --> 3353.80]  has
[3353.80 --> 3354.82]  NAND
[3354.82 --> 3355.84]  fabrication
[3355.84 --> 3356.58]  capacity.
[3357.44 --> 3357.98]  Good for them.
[3358.22 --> 3358.34]  Yeah.
[3361.16 --> 3362.00]  Russian billionaire
[3362.00 --> 3362.84]  saying that he can
[3362.84 --> 3364.08]  put your brain
[3364.08 --> 3365.44]  into a robot
[3365.44 --> 3366.26]  in 30 years.
[3366.42 --> 3366.84]  Posted by
[3366.84 --> 3367.32]  NoNerg
[3367.32 --> 3368.02]  on the forum.
[3369.20 --> 3370.18]  He's really confident
[3370.18 --> 3371.02]  he spent a lot of money
[3371.02 --> 3371.32]  on it.
[3371.32 --> 3373.02]  I think he wants
[3373.02 --> 3373.56]  to live forever.
[3373.86 --> 3374.32]  I think that's
[3374.32 --> 3374.86]  what's going on.
[3374.94 --> 3375.40]  I wouldn't mind
[3375.40 --> 3375.94]  living forever.
[3377.34 --> 3377.88]  You know,
[3377.96 --> 3378.42]  it's actually
[3378.42 --> 3379.10]  kind of sad
[3379.10 --> 3380.02]  because looking at
[3380.02 --> 3380.58]  a lot of the
[3380.58 --> 3381.08]  advancements
[3381.08 --> 3381.92]  that are being made
[3381.92 --> 3382.78]  in both
[3382.78 --> 3383.70]  transferring
[3383.70 --> 3384.26]  consciousness
[3384.26 --> 3385.38]  into a machine
[3385.38 --> 3387.36]  and slowing
[3387.36 --> 3388.28]  or reversing
[3388.28 --> 3389.18]  the aging process,
[3389.70 --> 3391.02]  I feel like
[3391.02 --> 3392.08]  our generation
[3392.08 --> 3392.92]  just barely
[3392.92 --> 3393.52]  didn't make it.
[3393.60 --> 3393.74]  Yeah,
[3393.78 --> 3394.14]  we're going to
[3394.14 --> 3394.96]  just slightly miss.
[3394.96 --> 3395.34]  Yeah.
[3396.02 --> 3396.42]  Like,
[3396.54 --> 3397.68]  I could totally
[3397.68 --> 3399.28]  see a near future
[3399.28 --> 3399.90]  reality
[3399.90 --> 3401.54]  where if you agree
[3401.54 --> 3402.50]  to sterilization
[3402.50 --> 3403.58]  or something like that,
[3403.70 --> 3404.64]  you can prolong
[3404.64 --> 3405.56]  your life indefinitely
[3405.56 --> 3406.66]  or something.
[3406.76 --> 3406.90]  Like,
[3407.00 --> 3408.28]  I hope
[3408.28 --> 3409.42]  they make people
[3409.42 --> 3410.42]  agree to sterilization
[3410.42 --> 3410.88]  because
[3410.88 --> 3412.38]  the last thing
[3412.38 --> 3412.74]  we need
[3412.74 --> 3413.16]  is a bunch of
[3413.16 --> 3413.88]  people living
[3413.88 --> 3414.36]  forever
[3414.36 --> 3416.04]  and procreating
[3416.04 --> 3416.54]  at the rate
[3416.54 --> 3417.26]  that humans do.
[3418.14 --> 3418.20]  But,
[3418.30 --> 3418.66]  um,
[3419.40 --> 3420.50]  anyway.
[3421.10 --> 3421.26]  Although,
[3421.34 --> 3421.88]  if you get turned
[3421.88 --> 3422.58]  into a robot.
[3423.50 --> 3423.84]  Yeah,
[3423.92 --> 3424.76]  that would be,
[3424.76 --> 3425.44]  yes,
[3425.58 --> 3426.60]  then sterilization
[3426.60 --> 3427.30]  would be a thing.
[3427.50 --> 3427.68]  But,
[3427.76 --> 3428.10]  um,
[3428.20 --> 3428.64]  unless you,
[3428.76 --> 3428.86]  like,
[3429.96 --> 3430.40]  have a little
[3430.40 --> 3431.68]  manufacturing plant.
[3431.88 --> 3432.08]  So,
[3432.16 --> 3432.62]  he founded
[3432.62 --> 3433.78]  the 2045
[3433.78 --> 3434.32]  initiative
[3434.32 --> 3435.24]  in 2011
[3435.24 --> 3436.20]  with the goal
[3436.20 --> 3437.08]  to create
[3437.08 --> 3437.96]  a more advanced
[3437.96 --> 3439.18]  non-biological
[3439.18 --> 3439.98]  carrier
[3439.98 --> 3441.38]  for an individual's
[3441.38 --> 3442.04]  personality.
[3442.78 --> 3443.12]  Um,
[3443.28 --> 3444.74]  I'm 100% confident
[3444.74 --> 3445.50]  it will happen,
[3445.62 --> 3446.16]  he says.
[3446.64 --> 3446.96]  Otherwise,
[3447.14 --> 3447.76]  I wouldn't have
[3447.76 --> 3448.36]  started it.
[3448.58 --> 3449.20]  Doesn't have a
[3449.20 --> 3450.04]  god complex at all.
[3450.10 --> 3450.50]  I have no idea
[3450.50 --> 3450.90]  what you're saying.
[3451.24 --> 3451.50]  Yeah.
[3451.50 --> 3452.00]  Um,
[3453.44 --> 3453.78]  okay.
[3453.78 --> 3454.92]  First part of the project
[3454.92 --> 3456.00]  is to create a robotic
[3456.00 --> 3457.10]  version of a human body
[3457.10 --> 3458.00]  that can be controlled
[3458.00 --> 3458.86]  by the brain,
[3459.18 --> 3459.74]  which is scheduled
[3459.74 --> 3460.36]  to be completed
[3460.36 --> 3461.02]  by 2020.
[3461.84 --> 3462.24]  I mean,
[3462.36 --> 3463.88]  it's amazing.
[3464.00 --> 3464.50]  We're only hearing
[3464.50 --> 3465.40]  about this now
[3465.40 --> 3465.74]  when,
[3465.86 --> 3466.12]  like,
[3466.28 --> 3466.48]  you know,
[3466.52 --> 3467.44]  we're at CES
[3467.44 --> 3469.38]  watching 3D printed
[3469.38 --> 3470.02]  prosthetics
[3470.02 --> 3470.90]  need to be controlled
[3470.90 --> 3471.72]  via muscle movement.
[3471.72 --> 3472.04]  and I mean,
[3472.76 --> 3473.14]  surely,
[3473.14 --> 3473.74]  if you can build
[3473.74 --> 3474.68]  a whole body
[3474.68 --> 3475.42]  in the next
[3475.42 --> 3477.24]  four and a three quarters of
[3477.24 --> 3477.38]  Well,
[3477.44 --> 3478.14]  they have the monkey
[3478.14 --> 3478.72]  that was walking
[3478.72 --> 3479.34]  on the treadmill,
[3479.88 --> 3480.18]  I think,
[3480.26 --> 3480.86]  in the States,
[3481.28 --> 3482.94]  who made a robotic
[3482.94 --> 3483.68]  version of the monkey
[3483.68 --> 3484.40]  walk on a treadmill
[3484.40 --> 3484.76]  in,
[3484.86 --> 3485.28]  I believe,
[3485.40 --> 3486.08]  Japan?
[3486.50 --> 3487.44]  Both of those locations
[3487.44 --> 3488.72]  could be super inaccurate.
[3488.86 --> 3489.10]  Anyways,
[3489.20 --> 3489.92]  it was super far away.
[3490.04 --> 3490.26]  Mm-hmm.
[3490.56 --> 3490.82]  So,
[3491.58 --> 3491.88]  I don't know.
[3491.90 --> 3492.42]  He has poured
[3492.42 --> 3494.20]  1.43 billion
[3494.20 --> 3495.62]  into the project
[3495.62 --> 3496.26]  so far.
[3496.26 --> 3497.40]  Who says
[3497.40 --> 3498.58]  money doesn't buy
[3498.58 --> 3499.24]  happiness
[3499.24 --> 3501.74]  if living in a robot
[3501.74 --> 3502.56]  makes you happy?
[3503.68 --> 3504.88]  Very interesting.
[3506.72 --> 3507.92]  Team is made up
[3507.92 --> 3508.86]  of Russian specialists
[3508.86 --> 3509.52]  from the fields
[3509.52 --> 3510.46]  of neural interfaces,
[3510.72 --> 3511.10]  robotics,
[3511.28 --> 3511.72]  neuroscience,
[3511.94 --> 3513.26]  and artificial organs.
[3514.00 --> 3515.10]  This was originally
[3515.10 --> 3516.76]  posted on Ars Technica.
[3518.06 --> 3519.22]  $150 million
[3519.22 --> 3520.04]  verdict
[3520.04 --> 3520.98]  in the Hulk Hogan
[3520.98 --> 3522.06]  sex tape lawsuit
[3522.06 --> 3524.16]  could wipe out
[3524.16 --> 3524.86]  Gawker.
[3524.86 --> 3526.54]  which,
[3526.68 --> 3527.54]  if you guys
[3527.54 --> 3528.30]  don't know,
[3528.44 --> 3529.12]  would include,
[3529.30 --> 3530.48]  let's see,
[3530.72 --> 3531.50]  Lifehacker,
[3532.04 --> 3532.80]  Gizmodo,
[3533.04 --> 3533.52]  Deadspin,
[3533.62 --> 3534.18]  Kotaku,
[3534.40 --> 3534.84]  Jezebel,
[3535.00 --> 3535.86]  and Jalopnik.
[3536.46 --> 3537.28]  Gawker employs
[3537.28 --> 3539.30]  about 250 people
[3539.30 --> 3540.08]  and they were sued
[3540.08 --> 3541.00]  for publishing
[3541.00 --> 3542.40]  a sex tape
[3542.40 --> 3544.02]  showing Hulk Hogan
[3544.02 --> 3545.00]  having sex
[3545.00 --> 3546.14]  with his friend's wife.
[3546.92 --> 3547.08]  So,
[3547.20 --> 3548.08]  Hogan's lawyer says
[3548.08 --> 3549.00]  that the Gawker editor
[3549.00 --> 3550.40]  was playing God
[3550.40 --> 3551.78]  with my client's privacy.
[3552.94 --> 3553.40]  The sum
[3553.40 --> 3554.14]  may have
[3554.14 --> 3555.10]  punitive damages
[3555.10 --> 3555.94]  added to it
[3555.94 --> 3557.22]  as well
[3557.22 --> 3558.20]  and the jury
[3558.20 --> 3559.42]  found two men
[3559.42 --> 3560.68]  personally liable
[3560.68 --> 3561.60]  in addition
[3561.60 --> 3562.82]  to Gawker Media.
[3564.42 --> 3565.06]  Wow.
[3565.22 --> 3565.38]  So,
[3565.54 --> 3565.90]  I guess
[3565.90 --> 3566.42]  the lesson
[3566.42 --> 3567.04]  that we learned
[3567.04 --> 3568.08]  here is that
[3568.08 --> 3569.32]  Linus Media Group
[3569.32 --> 3570.70]  should only publish
[3570.70 --> 3571.34]  sex tapes
[3571.34 --> 3572.16]  if they are
[3572.16 --> 3573.30]  of its employees.
[3573.54 --> 3574.54]  With consent,
[3574.72 --> 3574.90]  yeah.
[3575.48 --> 3575.84]  Sure.
[3576.76 --> 3577.24]  That too.
[3577.24 --> 3578.54]  That's a good idea.
[3579.38 --> 3579.56]  Yeah.
[3579.76 --> 3579.88]  So,
[3580.02 --> 3580.80]  now we know.
[3581.46 --> 3582.18]  Now we know.
[3582.36 --> 3583.14]  Good to know.
[3583.28 --> 3584.00]  I'm glad we know.
[3584.14 --> 3584.44]  Yes.
[3584.56 --> 3585.14]  We've got another
[3585.14 --> 3585.78]  really cool thing
[3585.78 --> 3586.38]  to show you guys.
[3586.72 --> 3586.98]  This,
[3587.46 --> 3588.26]  for those of you
[3588.26 --> 3588.96]  who tuned in
[3588.96 --> 3590.14]  to the Twitch chat
[3590.14 --> 3592.40]  earlier this week,
[3593.12 --> 3594.36]  or the Twitch chat,
[3594.40 --> 3594.96]  the Twitch stream
[3594.96 --> 3595.98]  earlier this week
[3595.98 --> 3596.64]  where,
[3596.78 --> 3596.98]  like,
[3596.98 --> 3597.82]  I basically
[3597.82 --> 3598.56]  was only
[3598.56 --> 3599.86]  intermittently streaming.
[3600.20 --> 3600.88]  There was a reason
[3600.88 --> 3601.36]  for that.
[3601.78 --> 3602.74]  It's really cool.
[3602.74 --> 3605.04]  Eight members
[3605.04 --> 3606.16]  of Linus Media Group
[3606.16 --> 3607.48]  have Counter-Strike
[3607.48 --> 3608.18]  models
[3608.18 --> 3609.56]  with their faces
[3609.56 --> 3610.10]  on them
[3610.10 --> 3611.20]  and they look
[3611.20 --> 3613.08]  freaking awesome.
[3613.88 --> 3614.92]  I don't have
[3614.92 --> 3615.50]  the application
[3615.50 --> 3615.96]  installed,
[3616.06 --> 3616.56]  so unfortunately
[3616.56 --> 3617.56]  I can't show you guys
[3617.56 --> 3617.76]  the,
[3617.80 --> 3617.90]  oh,
[3617.98 --> 3618.28]  here we go,
[3618.30 --> 3618.64]  here we go.
[3619.10 --> 3619.62]  There we go.
[3619.74 --> 3619.92]  Yeah,
[3619.92 --> 3620.68]  you don't have to have the,
[3620.74 --> 3621.64]  that's a better look at it.
[3621.74 --> 3622.52]  How do I pan?
[3623.14 --> 3623.62]  Do you know how to pan?
[3623.62 --> 3623.80]  Well,
[3623.92 --> 3624.16]  okay,
[3624.30 --> 3625.10]  go to edit.
[3626.20 --> 3626.48]  Yeah.
[3629.92 --> 3632.10]  Once it loads,
[3632.74 --> 3633.64]  there's some problems.
[3633.64 --> 3634.60]  It's very beta,
[3634.74 --> 3635.14]  which is why
[3635.14 --> 3635.94]  we couldn't get it working.
[3636.04 --> 3636.60]  They tell us,
[3636.68 --> 3636.80]  though,
[3636.86 --> 3637.32]  that the server
[3637.32 --> 3638.06]  should be back up
[3638.06 --> 3638.60]  next week
[3638.60 --> 3639.96]  and we can try again
[3639.96 --> 3640.22]  because,
[3640.44 --> 3640.46]  Well,
[3640.46 --> 3641.92]  I think the server
[3641.92 --> 3642.76]  might even be live
[3642.76 --> 3643.08]  right now,
[3643.16 --> 3643.70]  but it's not,
[3643.92 --> 3644.10]  like,
[3644.36 --> 3645.50]  with how hard we hit it,
[3645.60 --> 3646.08]  trying to put,
[3646.16 --> 3646.20]  like,
[3646.22 --> 3646.88]  a whole team on there
[3646.88 --> 3647.14]  and stuff,
[3647.26 --> 3648.72]  it has major problems
[3648.72 --> 3649.62]  and they're making,
[3649.72 --> 3649.78]  like,
[3649.80 --> 3650.62]  a North American one
[3650.62 --> 3651.22]  just for us
[3651.22 --> 3651.88]  and all this kind of stuff.
[3652.52 --> 3652.72]  Okay,
[3652.76 --> 3652.88]  well,
[3652.96 --> 3654.54]  that is not loading,
[3654.76 --> 3655.22]  so.
[3655.68 --> 3656.08]  Anyways,
[3656.32 --> 3657.14]  it's pretty cool.
[3657.16 --> 3657.84]  It's cool.
[3658.08 --> 3659.40]  The real sense part of it
[3659.40 --> 3660.86]  is not beta.
[3661.30 --> 3661.54]  Yeah.
[3661.54 --> 3663.06]  And actually works super well.
[3663.70 --> 3664.24]  I was impressed.
[3664.24 --> 3665.68]  The real sense with iSeize 3D
[3665.68 --> 3667.28]  scans really well.
[3667.76 --> 3669.10]  If you guys saw the,
[3669.90 --> 3671.44]  what was it called?
[3675.38 --> 3676.56]  3D scanner that I did
[3676.56 --> 3677.60]  probably about a year ago.
[3677.68 --> 3678.00]  I don't remember
[3678.00 --> 3678.52]  what it was called.
[3678.64 --> 3679.04]  I'm sorry.
[3679.14 --> 3680.26]  I had to attach it to an iPad.
[3680.50 --> 3681.20]  I scanned Taryn.
[3681.44 --> 3682.04]  I scanned the room.
[3682.04 --> 3682.24]  Yeah,
[3682.30 --> 3683.32]  I remember what it was called.
[3683.32 --> 3683.92]  I did some other stuff.
[3684.98 --> 3685.20]  Yeah.
[3685.60 --> 3685.78]  Yeah.
[3686.42 --> 3686.82]  Anyways,
[3687.22 --> 3688.66]  it's,
[3688.66 --> 3689.04]  like,
[3689.14 --> 3689.92]  better than that
[3689.92 --> 3690.42]  other than,
[3690.42 --> 3691.40]  it doesn't,
[3691.40 --> 3692.84]  does it do room scanning?
[3693.18 --> 3693.54]  Scanning?
[3693.66 --> 3694.44]  The program I use
[3694.44 --> 3695.90]  doesn't do room scanning.
[3696.08 --> 3696.90]  I think it theoretically
[3696.90 --> 3697.96]  could do room scanning
[3697.96 --> 3698.66]  just fine.
[3699.04 --> 3699.68]  Just the program
[3699.68 --> 3700.96]  I specifically use
[3700.96 --> 3701.74]  does not do it.
[3702.62 --> 3703.08]  But,
[3703.16 --> 3703.36]  like,
[3703.46 --> 3703.76]  yeah,
[3703.88 --> 3704.72]  you can kind of see.
[3704.88 --> 3705.02]  There you go.
[3705.56 --> 3706.92]  I wasn't that bullish
[3706.92 --> 3707.70]  on real sense,
[3707.80 --> 3709.14]  to be perfectly honest.
[3709.76 --> 3710.66]  This demo
[3710.66 --> 3712.74]  has sold me on it
[3712.74 --> 3714.08]  in a much,
[3714.24 --> 3715.16]  much bigger way.
[3715.22 --> 3715.40]  I mean,
[3715.40 --> 3716.16]  look at that.
[3716.16 --> 3718.12]  If that doesn't look
[3718.12 --> 3718.84]  like a terrorist,
[3719.38 --> 3720.14]  I don't know what does.
[3720.14 --> 3721.66]  He's making a crazy smile
[3721.66 --> 3721.98]  and stuff,
[3722.06 --> 3722.98]  which is actually cool
[3722.98 --> 3723.68]  because it made
[3723.68 --> 3724.44]  some differentiation
[3724.44 --> 3725.34]  between different
[3725.34 --> 3726.16]  people's avatars.
[3726.70 --> 3727.12]  And,
[3727.24 --> 3727.30]  like,
[3727.34 --> 3728.20]  if his head's
[3728.20 --> 3728.90]  at a weird tilt
[3728.90 --> 3729.42]  or something,
[3730.06 --> 3730.42]  don't.
[3732.80 --> 3733.92]  What just happened?
[3734.46 --> 3734.80]  Look at,
[3734.86 --> 3735.74]  it's like a pixel.
[3735.82 --> 3736.14]  Yeah.
[3736.82 --> 3737.18]  Whoa.
[3737.90 --> 3738.54]  If his head's
[3738.54 --> 3739.06]  at a weird tilt
[3739.06 --> 3739.34]  and stuff,
[3739.40 --> 3740.08]  don't worry about that
[3740.08 --> 3741.10]  because you can fix that.
[3741.54 --> 3742.08]  But anyways,
[3742.18 --> 3742.86]  the real sense scanning
[3742.86 --> 3743.48]  went really well.
[3743.66 --> 3744.52]  Then we had to import it
[3744.52 --> 3745.94]  into this thing,
[3746.24 --> 3746.46]  which,
[3746.58 --> 3747.52]  you know.
[3747.94 --> 3748.86]  Didn't work as well.
[3749.10 --> 3749.26]  It,
[3749.34 --> 3750.52]  yeah.
[3751.16 --> 3752.60]  I usually got to work.
[3752.70 --> 3753.36]  I don't know what's going on
[3753.36 --> 3753.96]  with his laptop
[3753.96 --> 3755.24]  or what's currently
[3755.24 --> 3756.04]  going on with the site.
[3756.30 --> 3756.60]  They have,
[3756.70 --> 3756.78]  like,
[3756.84 --> 3757.86]  two different beta sites
[3757.86 --> 3758.82]  they've been having us use
[3758.82 --> 3759.82]  and one's kind of better
[3759.82 --> 3760.30]  than the other one
[3760.30 --> 3760.90]  so I don't really know
[3760.90 --> 3761.60]  if this is the right one
[3761.60 --> 3761.88]  or not.
[3762.04 --> 3762.40]  Anyways,
[3762.92 --> 3764.18]  this part had some problems
[3764.18 --> 3765.52]  but we got through that,
[3765.66 --> 3766.36]  made it all work
[3766.36 --> 3767.16]  and then we tried
[3767.16 --> 3768.10]  to integrate it on the server
[3768.10 --> 3769.26]  it was kind of weird.
[3769.36 --> 3769.66]  It's supposed to,
[3769.72 --> 3769.78]  like,
[3769.80 --> 3770.92]  attach with your Steam ID
[3770.92 --> 3772.16]  so that when you connect
[3772.16 --> 3774.06]  it puts your model mesh
[3774.06 --> 3775.20]  onto your character
[3775.20 --> 3776.70]  and only you
[3776.70 --> 3777.46]  onto your character.
[3778.34 --> 3778.68]  But,
[3778.72 --> 3779.80]  there were some major problems
[3779.80 --> 3780.06]  like,
[3780.30 --> 3781.30]  everyone spawning in
[3781.30 --> 3781.70]  is Colton.
[3782.14 --> 3782.60]  This is a,
[3782.60 --> 3783.40]  we have like four Coltons.
[3783.46 --> 3783.78]  By the way,
[3783.82 --> 3783.98]  guys,
[3784.02 --> 3784.98]  this is important to note.
[3785.08 --> 3786.64]  This is a low resolution preview.
[3787.02 --> 3787.56]  This is not,
[3787.60 --> 3788.84]  it looks nearly as good
[3788.84 --> 3789.28]  as it is.
[3789.36 --> 3789.82]  It actually looks
[3789.82 --> 3790.78]  considerably better than that.
[3790.84 --> 3791.02]  Yeah.
[3791.24 --> 3792.30]  I sure wish I could.
[3792.84 --> 3793.72]  It looks really good.
[3794.04 --> 3794.24]  Yeah,
[3794.32 --> 3795.02]  and it's like,
[3795.14 --> 3795.30]  yeah,
[3795.36 --> 3796.88]  it looks shockingly good
[3796.88 --> 3797.56]  and I wish I could
[3797.56 --> 3798.64]  show it to you properly
[3798.64 --> 3799.26]  but like,
[3799.86 --> 3800.10]  I,
[3800.10 --> 3801.52]  I'm kind of giving up
[3801.52 --> 3802.22]  on that at this point
[3802.22 --> 3802.88]  but I mean,
[3802.92 --> 3803.60]  you guys can probably
[3803.60 --> 3804.08]  tell someone.
[3804.08 --> 3804.22]  Try to launch it.
[3804.62 --> 3804.84]  Sorry?
[3805.24 --> 3805.72]  Launch it.
[3806.14 --> 3807.50]  Just stream some Counter-Strike, dog.
[3807.88 --> 3808.32]  Uh.
[3808.56 --> 3808.82]  Deploy.
[3809.02 --> 3809.46]  Uh.
[3809.78 --> 3810.04]  Do it.
[3811.10 --> 3811.64]  It might work.
[3812.06 --> 3812.78]  It might work.
[3812.92 --> 3813.32]  Who knows?
[3813.46 --> 3814.60]  I don't think it's gonna work.
[3814.92 --> 3815.68]  I guess no one will be able
[3815.68 --> 3816.72]  to see you actually.
[3817.18 --> 3818.00]  Because you kill yourself
[3818.00 --> 3818.66]  and you look at yourself
[3818.66 --> 3819.12]  on the floor.
[3819.96 --> 3820.32]  Uh,
[3820.42 --> 3820.70]  yeah,
[3820.78 --> 3821.10]  but you,
[3821.26 --> 3821.68]  okay,
[3821.80 --> 3822.38]  so I'll have to be like
[3822.38 --> 3823.08]  running backwards
[3823.08 --> 3823.98]  while I kill myself
[3823.98 --> 3825.44]  so I ragdoll backwards.
[3826.06 --> 3826.56]  Do you want to do
[3826.56 --> 3827.08]  the next topic
[3827.08 --> 3827.84]  while I try and get this working?
[3827.84 --> 3828.06]  Sure.
[3830.12 --> 3830.58]  Uh.
[3836.22 --> 3837.20]  PlayStation VR
[3837.20 --> 3837.74]  to release
[3837.74 --> 3839.08]  October 2016
[3839.08 --> 3840.56]  which is not that bad
[3840.56 --> 3841.26]  and it costs
[3841.26 --> 3842.40]  $399 USD
[3842.40 --> 3845.04]  or $549 Canadian.
[3846.00 --> 3846.20]  Oh!
[3847.04 --> 3848.18]  Remember what that used to be?
[3848.26 --> 3849.34]  $399 Canadian?
[3849.48 --> 3849.74]  Yeah,
[3849.82 --> 3850.94]  I do remember that actually.
[3851.16 --> 3851.42]  Thank you.
[3851.44 --> 3852.38]  Oh my god.
[3853.08 --> 3853.48]  Anyways,
[3853.80 --> 3855.52]  that's really freaking cool.
[3856.40 --> 3857.26]  Might not exactly be
[3857.26 --> 3858.34]  what everyone expected me to say
[3858.34 --> 3859.16]  but that's awesome
[3859.16 --> 3859.74]  because
[3859.74 --> 3861.58]  the cost of a
[3861.58 --> 3862.66]  PlayStation 4
[3862.66 --> 3864.28]  and a PlayStation VR
[3864.28 --> 3866.44]  is cheaper
[3866.44 --> 3867.76]  than
[3867.76 --> 3868.82]  some entire
[3868.82 --> 3869.58]  VR solutions.
[3869.76 --> 3870.56]  Which is true
[3870.56 --> 3871.08]  but
[3871.08 --> 3872.34]  the thing that we're
[3872.34 --> 3872.96]  ignoring here
[3872.96 --> 3873.78]  is that a PlayStation
[3873.78 --> 3874.92]  Move is not included.
[3875.78 --> 3876.02]  Okay.
[3876.26 --> 3876.96]  You could play
[3876.96 --> 3877.62]  with the controller.
[3877.70 --> 3878.18]  And what else
[3878.18 --> 3878.92]  was not included?
[3879.02 --> 3879.90]  I forget what it was.
[3880.00 --> 3880.32]  There was
[3880.32 --> 3881.34]  something,
[3881.56 --> 3881.76]  there was
[3881.76 --> 3882.36]  You could definitely
[3882.36 --> 3883.24]  just play with the controller.
[3883.42 --> 3883.52]  Yeah,
[3883.56 --> 3884.68]  but there was some other
[3884.68 --> 3885.62]  and I can't look it up
[3885.62 --> 3886.54]  on my laptop right now
[3886.54 --> 3887.00]  but there was
[3887.00 --> 3888.10]  some other
[3888.10 --> 3889.42]  super important
[3889.42 --> 3889.92]  peripheral
[3889.92 --> 3891.10]  that would
[3891.10 --> 3892.04]  dramatically improve
[3892.04 --> 3892.48]  the experience.
[3892.48 --> 3893.32]  I think it was a camera
[3893.32 --> 3894.68]  that is also
[3894.68 --> 3895.50]  not included.
[3896.74 --> 3897.06]  Oh,
[3897.16 --> 3897.82]  because the camera
[3897.82 --> 3898.52]  does need to see
[3898.52 --> 3899.14]  the lights that are
[3899.14 --> 3899.58]  on the headset.
[3900.08 --> 3900.80]  So I don't,
[3900.88 --> 3901.00]  yeah,
[3901.06 --> 3901.96]  I don't remember
[3901.96 --> 3902.32]  what exactly the deal was.
[3902.32 --> 3902.66]  Either way,
[3902.70 --> 3903.78]  it's actually a pretty
[3903.78 --> 3904.74]  low cost solution
[3904.74 --> 3905.70]  to getting into VR
[3905.70 --> 3906.82]  which does have
[3906.82 --> 3908.32]  a dedicated processing unit
[3908.32 --> 3909.48]  which is a lot better
[3909.48 --> 3910.34]  than like a phone
[3910.34 --> 3910.66]  or something.
[3910.68 --> 3911.42]  And if Sony's
[3911.42 --> 3912.14]  optimizations
[3912.14 --> 3914.14]  are as good
[3914.14 --> 3914.88]  as they say
[3914.88 --> 3915.84]  they're going to be
[3915.84 --> 3916.70]  then
[3916.70 --> 3917.38]  It could be
[3917.38 --> 3918.72]  a pretty good solution
[3918.72 --> 3919.52]  for its price.
[3919.72 --> 3920.04]  It could be.
[3920.42 --> 3921.14]  They're doing
[3921.14 --> 3922.00]  actually very
[3922.00 --> 3922.80]  respectable things
[3922.80 --> 3923.32]  like saying
[3923.32 --> 3923.84]  if people's
[3923.84 --> 3924.26]  frame rates
[3924.26 --> 3924.78]  are too low
[3924.78 --> 3925.14]  we're just
[3925.14 --> 3926.24]  not allowing them
[3926.24 --> 3926.96]  to have the game
[3926.96 --> 3927.42]  on the store
[3927.42 --> 3929.04]  which is awesome
[3929.04 --> 3929.98]  because they don't
[3929.98 --> 3930.64]  want to allow
[3930.64 --> 3931.52]  shitty experiences.
[3931.92 --> 3932.24]  I'm actually
[3932.24 --> 3933.30]  really excited for it.
[3933.40 --> 3933.64]  Yeah,
[3933.78 --> 3934.74]  there's the other article.
[3935.10 --> 3935.78]  Sony to reject
[3935.78 --> 3937.12]  any PlayStation VR games
[3937.12 --> 3938.52]  that drop below 60 FPS.
[3938.92 --> 3939.32]  Good.
[3939.88 --> 3940.12]  Yeah,
[3940.18 --> 3940.70]  like that's
[3940.70 --> 3941.58]  awesome.
[3942.46 --> 3942.98]  Good job,
[3943.16 --> 3943.32]  Sony.
[3944.14 --> 3944.50]  So like
[3944.50 --> 3944.88]  I'm actually
[3944.88 --> 3945.40]  kind of stoked
[3945.40 --> 3945.76]  for this
[3945.76 --> 3946.34]  because
[3946.34 --> 3950.98]  yeah,
[3951.50 --> 3952.36]  hopefully it's
[3952.36 --> 3953.02]  actually good.
[3953.28 --> 3953.58]  Like that's
[3953.58 --> 3954.06]  why I wasn't
[3954.06 --> 3954.96]  stoked for the
[3954.96 --> 3956.10]  Sulan G
[3956.10 --> 3956.56]  or Q
[3956.56 --> 3957.30]  or whatever it was
[3957.30 --> 3958.42]  because it doesn't
[3958.42 --> 3959.36]  look like it's
[3959.36 --> 3960.18]  actually going to be good.
[3961.56 --> 3962.12]  Dang it.
[3965.66 --> 3966.62]  I think you have
[3966.62 --> 3967.26]  to restart
[3967.26 --> 3968.74]  the round
[3968.74 --> 3969.28]  or something.
[3970.02 --> 3970.42]  So I think
[3970.42 --> 3970.80]  I'll actually
[3970.80 --> 3971.58]  have to wait
[3971.58 --> 3972.26]  three minutes
[3972.26 --> 3973.04]  and 40 seconds
[3973.04 --> 3974.00]  to find out
[3974.00 --> 3975.06]  if my
[3975.06 --> 3977.56]  if my thing
[3977.56 --> 3977.96]  will load.
[3979.76 --> 3981.00]  This is a weird
[3981.00 --> 3981.84]  server, man.
[3982.36 --> 3983.14]  Like the chickens
[3983.14 --> 3983.76]  have like
[3983.76 --> 3984.70]  Playboy bunny ears
[3984.70 --> 3985.06]  on them
[3985.06 --> 3985.54]  or something.
[3987.68 --> 3988.92]  Like what the heck
[3988.92 --> 3990.56]  is up with these guys?
[3990.58 --> 3990.88]  Easter.
[3991.80 --> 3992.26]  Oh,
[3992.56 --> 3993.14]  Easter.
[3993.34 --> 3994.42]  Not Playboy bunny ears.
[3994.44 --> 3995.18]  Easter chicken.
[3995.76 --> 3997.12]  That makes perfect sense.
[3997.24 --> 3998.64]  Why didn't I realize it?
[3999.82 --> 4000.78]  I don't know.
[4000.80 --> 4001.86]  What else we got?
[4003.36 --> 4004.36]  George Hots.
[4004.82 --> 4005.08]  So
[4005.08 --> 4006.64]  Geo Hots.
[4006.86 --> 4007.62]  You guys might know him.
[4008.32 --> 4009.42]  Attended South by Southwest
[4009.42 --> 4010.28]  this year to announce
[4010.28 --> 4011.54]  his new company
[4011.54 --> 4013.04]  Comma.ai.
[4014.94 --> 4015.46]  Yeah.
[4015.76 --> 4016.32]  Discusses plans
[4016.32 --> 4017.48]  for replacing many jobs
[4017.48 --> 4017.96]  with AI.
[4018.12 --> 4019.06]  Plans to start by eliminating
[4019.06 --> 4020.04]  all jobs
[4020.04 --> 4020.86]  in the global
[4020.86 --> 4022.06]  transportation sector.
[4022.42 --> 4022.98]  Replacing them
[4022.98 --> 4024.36]  with self-driving cars.
[4024.70 --> 4025.82]  Says his self-driving tech
[4025.82 --> 4026.98]  will ship for no more
[4026.98 --> 4028.00]  than $1,000
[4028.00 --> 4029.36]  and will work on
[4029.36 --> 4030.52]  any car made
[4030.52 --> 4032.08]  after 2012.
[4032.92 --> 4033.80]  Once driving jobs
[4033.80 --> 4034.42]  Yeah, me too.
[4034.80 --> 4035.66]  Once driving jobs
[4035.66 --> 4036.20]  are gone
[4036.20 --> 4037.22]  he plans to go on
[4037.22 --> 4038.24]  to the cashiers
[4038.24 --> 4039.18]  the secretaries
[4039.18 --> 4040.06]  the sales people
[4040.06 --> 4041.24]  quote unquote
[4041.24 --> 4042.08]  those people
[4042.08 --> 4043.04]  that are easy
[4043.04 --> 4044.22]  to replace with AI.
[4044.22 --> 4048.76]  All right.
[4049.50 --> 4049.94]  Wrecked.
[4053.20 --> 4053.64]  Okay.
[4054.04 --> 4054.88]  I'm not surprised.
[4055.12 --> 4055.74]  It's Geo Hots.
[4058.00 --> 4058.76]  Original article
[4058.76 --> 4059.56]  was from The Verge
[4059.56 --> 4060.42]  so
[4060.42 --> 4061.08]  there you go.
[4063.68 --> 4064.90]  The Razor Core
[4064.90 --> 4066.22]  finally has a price
[4066.22 --> 4067.70]  I think I nailed it
[4067.70 --> 4068.58]  I don't remember
[4068.58 --> 4069.06]  what I said
[4069.06 --> 4069.52]  I thought it was
[4069.52 --> 4070.34]  going to be at the time
[4070.34 --> 4071.88]  but it'll cost
[4071.88 --> 4072.60]  $500
[4072.60 --> 4073.62]  so you will actually
[4073.62 --> 4074.08]  have to pay
[4074.08 --> 4074.74]  $500
[4074.74 --> 4076.02]  just for the privilege
[4076.02 --> 4077.14]  of putting a $500
[4077.14 --> 4078.54]  graphics card into it
[4078.54 --> 4079.96]  to run off of your laptop.
[4080.64 --> 4081.72]  You can save $100
[4081.72 --> 4082.30]  however
[4082.30 --> 4083.10]  when pairing it
[4083.10 --> 4083.72]  with a Blade
[4083.72 --> 4084.84]  or a Blade Stealth
[4084.84 --> 4085.44]  notebook.
[4086.12 --> 4087.12]  I hope they've got
[4087.12 --> 4087.98]  the hot plug issue
[4087.98 --> 4088.56]  sorted out
[4088.56 --> 4089.60]  because if they do
[4089.60 --> 4090.24]  it is going to make
[4090.24 --> 4092.06]  the Blade Stealth 2
[4092.06 --> 4093.78]  the next gen Blade Stealth
[4093.78 --> 4095.94]  a very compelling option.
[4096.54 --> 4096.90]  Current gen
[4096.90 --> 4097.90]  2 little RAM.
[4097.90 --> 4098.78]  Current gen
[4098.78 --> 4099.38]  is limited to
[4099.38 --> 4100.20]  8 gigs of RAM
[4100.20 --> 4100.80]  which as
[4100.80 --> 4101.54]  you know
[4101.54 --> 4103.40]  people who have
[4103.40 --> 4104.06]  paid attention
[4104.06 --> 4104.82]  to what I think
[4104.82 --> 4105.88]  about 8 gigs of RAM
[4105.88 --> 4106.38]  will know
[4106.38 --> 4107.78]  I do not think
[4107.78 --> 4108.26]  is enough.
[4108.50 --> 4108.96]  I don't know
[4108.96 --> 4109.56]  that that sentence
[4109.56 --> 4110.34]  made any sense
[4110.34 --> 4111.46]  but it doesn't have to
[4111.46 --> 4112.62]  I ran out of memory.
[4113.74 --> 4114.82]  I almost just did
[4114.82 --> 4115.58]  a
[4115.58 --> 4117.38]  sorry?
[4117.58 --> 4118.08]  a spoiler.
[4118.62 --> 4119.00]  I did?
[4119.18 --> 4120.04]  I almost did.
[4120.28 --> 4120.52]  Oh.
[4120.66 --> 4122.00]  And then I didn't
[4122.00 --> 4122.74]  for Scrapyard Wars.
[4123.00 --> 4123.44]  Oh yeah
[4123.44 --> 4124.56]  don't spoil Scrapyard Wars.
[4125.04 --> 4125.48]  Okay yeah
[4125.48 --> 4126.20]  Scrapyard Wars
[4126.20 --> 4128.00]  is being worked on
[4128.00 --> 4129.76]  so as of today
[4129.76 --> 4131.20]  all the footage
[4131.20 --> 4132.14]  has been logged.
[4132.32 --> 4133.24]  People keep asking.
[4133.46 --> 4134.04]  Why does it take
[4134.04 --> 4135.36]  so long to edit a video?
[4136.08 --> 4136.76]  Because it takes
[4136.76 --> 4137.40]  a long time
[4137.40 --> 4138.14]  to edit a video
[4138.14 --> 4139.04]  if you want it to be good.
[4139.04 --> 4139.76]  So many stages.
[4140.50 --> 4142.06]  So the first stage
[4142.06 --> 4142.66]  is to take
[4142.66 --> 4143.76]  all the hours
[4143.76 --> 4145.22]  and hours of footage
[4145.22 --> 4145.90]  Oh my god.
[4145.94 --> 4147.10]  and not just watch them
[4147.10 --> 4148.46]  but actually
[4148.46 --> 4149.44]  log
[4149.44 --> 4150.98]  in an application
[4150.98 --> 4151.78]  that is
[4151.78 --> 4152.78]  for logging footage.
[4152.78 --> 4153.50]  How important
[4153.50 --> 4153.62]  was it?
[4153.62 --> 4154.14]  What happened?
[4154.54 --> 4155.30]  How did it apply
[4155.30 --> 4156.04]  to the storyline?
[4156.28 --> 4156.82]  What was happening
[4156.82 --> 4156.96]  elsewhere?
[4156.96 --> 4157.52]  Where should this go?
[4158.92 --> 4159.60]  Grading it.
[4159.76 --> 4160.74]  Is there a problem
[4160.74 --> 4161.66]  with the audio
[4161.66 --> 4162.40]  for example?
[4162.62 --> 4163.56]  Does it need extra work?
[4163.62 --> 4164.44]  Is there a better clip
[4164.44 --> 4165.02]  that could also
[4165.02 --> 4165.76]  fill in this gap?
[4165.92 --> 4166.74]  Did they retake it?
[4166.90 --> 4167.84]  So logging
[4167.84 --> 4169.38]  is now done.
[4170.30 --> 4170.92]  So now
[4170.92 --> 4171.58]  the editing
[4171.58 --> 4172.48]  well no now
[4172.48 --> 4173.48]  I think
[4173.48 --> 4174.44]  Ed is currently
[4174.44 --> 4175.36]  working on
[4175.36 --> 4176.58]  putting together
[4176.58 --> 4177.60]  the story arc
[4177.60 --> 4178.54]  for the season
[4178.54 --> 4179.88]  and this is part
[4179.88 --> 4180.26]  of the issue
[4180.26 --> 4181.28]  that we've run into
[4181.28 --> 4182.28]  with previous seasons
[4182.28 --> 4182.72]  is we
[4182.72 --> 4183.50]  I am so happy
[4183.50 --> 4184.08]  he's doing this.
[4184.26 --> 4185.42]  Haven't taken the time
[4185.42 --> 4186.26]  because we've been
[4186.26 --> 4187.24]  too swamped
[4187.24 --> 4188.14]  to do that
[4188.14 --> 4188.96]  and even then
[4188.96 --> 4189.68]  it takes a long time
[4189.68 --> 4190.22]  just to be clear.
[4190.64 --> 4191.58]  We haven't taken the time
[4191.58 --> 4191.90]  to do that
[4191.90 --> 4192.54]  so we've ended up
[4192.54 --> 4193.44]  with sort of like
[4193.44 --> 4194.72]  action packed
[4194.72 --> 4195.72]  and then kind of boring
[4195.72 --> 4196.40]  and then action packed
[4196.40 --> 4197.04]  and then kind of boring
[4197.04 --> 4198.68]  so we're getting away
[4198.68 --> 4199.12]  from that
[4199.12 --> 4200.12]  not going to be a thing
[4200.12 --> 4201.10]  I'm super excited
[4201.10 --> 4201.82]  When I saw him
[4201.82 --> 4202.98]  doing storyboarding stuff
[4202.98 --> 4203.36]  I was like
[4203.36 --> 4204.02]  what is this?
[4204.34 --> 4204.80]  And then he explained
[4204.80 --> 4205.20]  it all to me
[4205.20 --> 4205.52]  I was like
[4205.52 --> 4206.26]  thank you
[4206.26 --> 4207.22]  and I think I just
[4207.22 --> 4207.60]  walked away
[4207.60 --> 4208.62]  but like that's
[4208.62 --> 4209.54]  super awesome
[4209.54 --> 4210.32]  and I think
[4210.32 --> 4211.86]  will make a huge difference
[4211.86 --> 4212.68]  in the watchability
[4212.68 --> 4213.28]  of the Scrapyard Wars
[4213.28 --> 4213.96]  Big part of the issue
[4213.96 --> 4214.82]  is we just haven't
[4214.82 --> 4215.74]  had the manpower for it
[4215.74 --> 4216.26]  I get it
[4216.26 --> 4217.16]  And like we've had
[4217.16 --> 4217.86]  Ed creating
[4217.86 --> 4218.78]  graphical assets
[4218.78 --> 4220.68]  and like editing LTTs
[4220.68 --> 4221.40]  and even things
[4221.40 --> 4222.36]  like Fast as Possible
[4222.36 --> 4223.08]  in between
[4223.08 --> 4223.54]  trying to get
[4223.54 --> 4224.42]  Scrapyard Wars done
[4224.42 --> 4225.08]  in the past
[4225.08 --> 4226.40]  but this time
[4226.40 --> 4227.76]  we are going to
[4227.76 --> 4228.46]  he's going to put in
[4228.46 --> 4229.04]  his earphones
[4229.04 --> 4230.00]  for a month
[4230.00 --> 4231.66]  and no one will
[4231.66 --> 4232.22]  talk to him
[4232.22 --> 4234.12]  and I am really excited
[4234.12 --> 4235.02]  because Scrapyard Wars
[4235.02 --> 4235.52]  Season 4
[4235.52 --> 4235.88]  is going to be
[4235.88 --> 4236.74]  the best ever
[4236.74 --> 4239.82]  Alright
[4239.82 --> 4240.56]  so there's a new
[4240.56 --> 4241.14]  Blade 14
[4241.14 --> 4243.06]  I have checked in
[4243.06 --> 4245.12]  with Razer
[4245.12 --> 4245.82]  we are definitely
[4245.82 --> 4246.86]  getting a review unit
[4246.86 --> 4249.22]  so basically
[4249.22 --> 4250.16]  not a whole lot
[4250.16 --> 4250.86]  has changed
[4250.86 --> 4252.04]  it's got a
[4252.04 --> 4253.32]  Core i7-6700
[4253.32 --> 4254.46]  now instead of
[4254.46 --> 4255.90]  a 4th gen processor
[4255.90 --> 4256.44]  which is what
[4256.44 --> 4258.12]  the existing Blade
[4258.12 --> 4258.56]  had
[4258.56 --> 4260.02]  the 256 gig model
[4260.02 --> 4260.88]  gets a
[4260.88 --> 4262.04]  price reduction
[4262.04 --> 4263.38]  it still has
[4263.38 --> 4264.54]  a 3200x1800
[4264.54 --> 4265.86]  QHD plus display
[4265.86 --> 4266.90]  it now has
[4266.90 --> 4268.46]  an RGB backlit
[4268.46 --> 4268.88]  keyboard
[4268.88 --> 4269.66]  a PCI Express
[4269.66 --> 4270.22]  SSD
[4270.22 --> 4273.36]  GPU is the same
[4273.36 --> 4274.52]  still a 970M
[4274.52 --> 4276.00]  970Ms are pretty solid
[4276.00 --> 4277.00]  and
[4277.00 --> 4278.22]  that's pretty much it
[4278.22 --> 4279.74]  not much else
[4279.74 --> 4279.98]  to say
[4279.98 --> 4280.48]  probably a thermal
[4280.48 --> 4280.96]  thing
[4280.96 --> 4281.78]  original article
[4281.78 --> 4282.82]  was from Engadget
[4282.82 --> 4284.04]  USB charging
[4284.04 --> 4284.54]  and
[4284.54 --> 4285.50]  it has support
[4285.50 --> 4286.38]  for a Thunderbolt 3
[4286.38 --> 4287.34]  graphics amplifier
[4287.34 --> 4288.06]  upon release
[4288.06 --> 4289.62]  so if a 970M
[4289.62 --> 4290.64]  is just not enough
[4290.64 --> 4291.08]  for you
[4291.08 --> 4292.12]  or you don't want
[4292.12 --> 4292.76]  your palms to sweat
[4292.76 --> 4293.24]  while you're gaming
[4293.24 --> 4294.36]  then
[4294.36 --> 4295.28]  you can use
[4295.28 --> 4296.02]  one of those puppies
[4296.02 --> 4297.08]  you could
[4297.08 --> 4297.72]  like if you're
[4297.72 --> 4298.34]  if you're plugging
[4298.34 --> 4299.12]  into something
[4299.12 --> 4299.70]  you could probably
[4299.70 --> 4300.52]  plug in a keyboard
[4300.52 --> 4301.42]  as well
[4301.42 --> 4305.32]  just saying man
[4305.32 --> 4306.18]  I'm just saying
[4306.18 --> 4307.14]  that's it
[4307.14 --> 4307.58]  show's over
[4307.58 --> 4308.12]  I'm just saying
[4308.12 --> 4308.56]  nope
[4308.56 --> 4309.68]  nope
[4309.68 --> 4310.48]  show's over
[4310.48 --> 4311.18]  we gotta go study
[4311.18 --> 4311.76]  for crime school
[4311.76 --> 4312.44]  yeah we gotta go
[4312.44 --> 4313.12]  study for crime school
[4313.12 --> 4313.82]  okay there's a couple
[4313.82 --> 4314.60]  topics here that I do
[4314.60 --> 4315.38]  want to hit next week
[4315.38 --> 4316.56]  um
[4316.56 --> 4318.30]  but I'm tired
[4318.30 --> 4319.18]  and it's time
[4319.18 --> 4319.86]  to go to crime school
[4319.86 --> 4320.32]  yeah
[4320.32 --> 4321.70]  alright so we'll see
[4321.70 --> 4322.28]  you guys again
[4322.28 --> 4323.00]  next week
[4323.00 --> 4324.06]  oh you know what
[4324.06 --> 4324.78]  oh I don't think
[4324.78 --> 4325.28]  we're gonna get away
[4325.28 --> 4325.78]  with not talking
[4325.78 --> 4326.40]  about this
[4326.40 --> 4328.50]  gamespot.com
[4328.50 --> 4329.38]  original article
[4329.38 --> 4330.40]  oh
[4330.40 --> 4331.94]  Sony responds
[4331.94 --> 4332.96]  to Microsoft's
[4332.96 --> 4333.92]  invite to connect
[4333.92 --> 4334.80]  the Xbox One
[4334.80 --> 4336.10]  and PS4 networks
[4336.10 --> 4338.98]  um
[4338.98 --> 4340.16]  doesn't directly
[4340.16 --> 4340.68]  acknowledge
[4340.68 --> 4341.32]  Microsoft's
[4341.32 --> 4341.98]  open invitation
[4341.98 --> 4343.02]  but suggests
[4343.02 --> 4344.26]  that it is
[4344.26 --> 4345.18]  open minded
[4345.18 --> 4346.46]  to partnership
[4346.46 --> 4347.96]  that is pretty
[4347.96 --> 4348.46]  exciting
[4348.46 --> 4349.86]  opening the door
[4349.86 --> 4351.14]  to cross platform
[4351.14 --> 4352.22]  play was such a
[4352.22 --> 4353.18]  huge thing
[4353.18 --> 4353.72]  for Microsoft
[4353.72 --> 4354.36]  to do
[4354.36 --> 4354.98]  shouldn't have
[4354.98 --> 4355.34]  been a huge
[4355.34 --> 4355.58]  thing
[4355.58 --> 4355.98]  it should have
[4355.98 --> 4356.44]  been a thing
[4356.44 --> 4357.30]  from pretty much
[4357.30 --> 4359.10]  day zero
[4359.10 --> 4360.48]  since Microsoft
[4360.48 --> 4361.90]  owned a console
[4361.90 --> 4363.26]  and a PC platform
[4363.26 --> 4364.34]  just saying
[4364.34 --> 4364.60]  yeah
[4364.60 --> 4365.38]  but at least
[4365.38 --> 4365.78]  we are
[4365.78 --> 4366.98]  finally
[4366.98 --> 4368.72]  making progress
[4368.72 --> 4369.92]  um
[4369.92 --> 4371.52]  thanks to
[4371.52 --> 4372.10]  Microsoft
[4372.10 --> 4373.42]  finally
[4373.42 --> 4374.06]  pulling
[4374.06 --> 4375.22]  its head
[4375.22 --> 4376.20]  out of its butt
[4376.20 --> 4377.58]  and saying
[4377.58 --> 4378.10]  that they
[4378.10 --> 4378.64]  wanted
[4378.64 --> 4379.46]  cross platform
[4379.46 --> 4379.96]  play
[4379.96 --> 4380.88]  to be
[4380.88 --> 4381.72]  a thing
[4381.72 --> 4382.66]  so
[4382.66 --> 4383.26]  developers
[4383.26 --> 4384.38]  building games
[4384.38 --> 4384.80]  for the Xbox
[4384.80 --> 4385.28]  One and Windows
[4385.28 --> 4385.76]  10 will be able
[4385.76 --> 4386.20]  to support the
[4386.20 --> 4386.58]  feature
[4386.58 --> 4387.10]  Rocket League
[4387.10 --> 4387.46]  will be one
[4387.46 --> 4388.08]  of the first
[4388.08 --> 4388.88]  titles to support
[4388.88 --> 4389.26]  this makes
[4389.26 --> 4390.02]  perfect sense
[4390.02 --> 4390.58]  given that it's
[4390.58 --> 4391.10]  a controller
[4391.10 --> 4392.02]  optimized game
[4392.02 --> 4392.62]  so the
[4392.62 --> 4393.84]  Xbox One
[4393.84 --> 4394.26]  owners won't
[4394.26 --> 4394.78]  have to feel
[4394.78 --> 4395.58]  too bad
[4395.58 --> 4396.38]  about their
[4396.38 --> 4396.86]  controller
[4396.86 --> 4398.40]  in that game
[4398.40 --> 4398.96]  that'll come
[4398.96 --> 4399.36]  later
[4399.36 --> 4400.10]  too bad
[4400.10 --> 4400.44]  it's like
[4400.44 --> 4401.04]  it's actually
[4401.04 --> 4402.12]  I know
[4402.12 --> 4402.46]  it's like
[4402.46 --> 4403.18]  totally controller
[4403.18 --> 4403.50]  optimized
[4403.50 --> 4403.86]  yeah
[4403.86 --> 4404.80]  um
[4404.80 --> 4406.60]  so that's
[4406.60 --> 4407.00]  pretty much
[4407.00 --> 4407.18]  it
[4407.18 --> 4407.94]  oh man
[4407.94 --> 4408.20]  there's
[4408.20 --> 4408.46]  okay
[4408.46 --> 4408.82]  okay
[4408.82 --> 4409.18]  fine
[4409.18 --> 4409.52]  we'll just
[4409.52 --> 4409.86]  have to blow
[4409.86 --> 4410.26]  through this
[4410.26 --> 4410.60]  as well
[4410.60 --> 4411.42]  there's a bunch
[4411.42 --> 4411.80]  of actually
[4411.80 --> 4412.38]  really important
[4412.38 --> 4412.90]  stuff that we
[4412.90 --> 4413.30]  sort of didn't
[4413.30 --> 4413.70]  talk about
[4413.70 --> 4414.02]  this week
[4414.02 --> 4414.66]  originally posted
[4414.66 --> 4415.76]  by iCushDreams
[4415.76 --> 4416.42]  on the forum
[4416.42 --> 4417.66]  T-Mobile
[4417.66 --> 4419.44]  is back
[4419.44 --> 4419.94]  baby
[4419.94 --> 4421.16]  announcing
[4421.16 --> 4421.98]  YouTube
[4421.98 --> 4422.60]  streaming
[4422.60 --> 4423.80]  that no
[4423.80 --> 4424.92]  longer affects
[4424.92 --> 4425.86]  your mobile
[4425.86 --> 4426.76]  data cap
[4426.76 --> 4429.34]  dun dun dun
[4429.34 --> 4430.26]  so they now
[4430.26 --> 4430.68]  have more than
[4430.68 --> 4431.58]  50 providers
[4431.58 --> 4431.94]  including
[4431.94 --> 4432.58]  Discovery Go
[4432.58 --> 4433.18]  Fox Business
[4433.18 --> 4433.66]  Google Play
[4433.66 --> 4434.08]  Movies
[4434.08 --> 4434.50]  Red Bull
[4434.50 --> 4434.92]  TV
[4434.92 --> 4435.64]  YouTube
[4435.64 --> 4437.00]  and more
[4437.00 --> 4438.82]  pretty freaking
[4438.82 --> 4439.10]  cool
[4439.10 --> 4439.52]  it's part of
[4439.52 --> 4439.66]  their
[4439.66 --> 4440.26]  binge on
[4440.26 --> 4440.72]  program
[4440.72 --> 4441.34]  now with that
[4441.34 --> 4441.62]  said
[4441.62 --> 4442.32]  this is a
[4442.32 --> 4443.04]  this is a
[4443.04 --> 4443.50]  post on
[4443.50 --> 4444.02]  the T-Mobile
[4444.02 --> 4444.62]  dot com
[4444.62 --> 4445.06]  site
[4445.06 --> 4446.08]  and some
[4446.08 --> 4446.40]  of the
[4446.40 --> 4446.98]  customer
[4446.98 --> 4447.44]  feedback
[4447.44 --> 4448.08]  of binge
[4448.08 --> 4448.26]  on
[4448.26 --> 4448.78]  hasn't been
[4448.78 --> 4449.74]  as positive
[4449.74 --> 4450.98]  saying that
[4450.98 --> 4451.86]  the coverage
[4451.86 --> 4452.44]  of it is not
[4452.44 --> 4453.14]  necessarily that
[4453.14 --> 4453.60]  great
[4453.60 --> 4454.50]  but
[4454.50 --> 4455.40]  hey
[4455.40 --> 4456.18]  it's a
[4456.18 --> 4456.56]  whole lot
[4456.56 --> 4457.16]  better than
[4457.16 --> 4457.98]  a big fat
[4457.98 --> 4458.28]  load of
[4458.28 --> 4458.54]  nothing
[4458.54 --> 4459.04]  which is what
[4459.04 --> 4459.38]  the other
[4459.38 --> 4460.14]  providers are
[4460.14 --> 4461.18]  offering you
[4461.18 --> 4461.56]  so
[4461.56 --> 4463.28]  there you go
[4463.28 --> 4464.14]  apparently
[4464.14 --> 4465.04]  these bundled
[4465.04 --> 4465.92]  services represent
[4465.92 --> 4467.16]  70% of all
[4467.16 --> 4467.78]  the video that
[4467.78 --> 4468.52]  T-Mobile customers
[4468.52 --> 4469.22]  watch on their
[4469.22 --> 4469.64]  phones and
[4469.64 --> 4469.98]  tablets
[4469.98 --> 4470.56]  monthly
[4470.56 --> 4471.96]  in four months
[4471.96 --> 4472.40]  since binge
[4472.40 --> 4472.92]  on was launched
[4472.92 --> 4473.40]  these are pretty
[4473.40 --> 4474.74]  crazy statistics
[4474.74 --> 4475.58]  customers are
[4475.58 --> 4476.36]  watching twice
[4476.36 --> 4477.14]  as many hours
[4477.14 --> 4477.76]  per day
[4477.76 --> 4478.36]  more than
[4478.36 --> 4479.56]  57 petabytes
[4479.56 --> 4480.28]  have been burned
[4480.28 --> 4480.64]  up without
[4480.64 --> 4481.36]  using customers
