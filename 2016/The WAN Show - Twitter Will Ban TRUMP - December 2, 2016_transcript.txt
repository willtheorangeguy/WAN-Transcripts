[0.00 --> 1.18]  It couldn't possibly go wrong.
[1.30 --> 2.02]  I'm starting the stream.
[2.18 --> 2.84]  Sounds good, dude.
[3.76 --> 4.28]  Oh, hey!
[4.84 --> 5.76]  Do-do-do.
[6.18 --> 7.10]  Do-do.
[7.34 --> 8.10]  Do-do-do.
[8.10 --> 10.18]  I don't know much.
[11.48 --> 13.42]  But I do know that.
[13.50 --> 14.96]  I know it's a wenchow.
[15.98 --> 17.78]  Oh, I thought you were going with, like, Meatloaf there.
[18.26 --> 23.02]  And that may be all I need to know.
[23.24 --> 24.10]  So not Meatloaf.
[24.22 --> 24.80]  Not Meatloaf.
[24.86 --> 25.30]  No, okay.
[25.50 --> 28.26]  That's What's-Her-Face and some other guy.
[28.26 --> 30.10]  I don't know.
[30.52 --> 31.46]  Linda Ronstadt.
[31.52 --> 32.74]  But it's, like, a cover or something.
[32.82 --> 33.22]  Oh, yeah.
[33.30 --> 34.68]  I like Meatloaf.
[34.80 --> 38.46]  She's, like, actually kind of, like, pretty famous for a cover artist.
[38.62 --> 38.78]  Yeah.
[40.66 --> 41.18]  All right.
[41.24 --> 42.50]  Sorry, I'm still loading up the doc.
[42.56 --> 43.54]  I have no idea what the topic is up for this week.
[43.54 --> 44.22]  My doc's up.
[44.64 --> 48.90]  I'm just going to read the first four in the doc because we don't really know what they are anyways.
[49.18 --> 52.54]  Twitter says that they will ban Trump if he breaks hate speech rules.
[52.56 --> 53.68]  Can they do that retroactively?
[53.86 --> 55.12]  Like, how does he still have an account?
[57.22 --> 57.58]  Boom.
[57.58 --> 62.58]  Casey Neistat sold his Beam app and himself to CNN.
[63.58 --> 69.02]  And Netflix 4K streaming requires Kaby Lake, Windows 10, and Edge browser.
[69.26 --> 70.70]  You know what the problem is?
[71.94 --> 77.18]  And Canada wants software backdoors, mandatory decryption capability, and record storage.
[77.50 --> 80.04]  That's why I look so small.
[80.04 --> 80.50]  The table was moved.
[80.52 --> 82.44]  It's the table that was moved.
[82.68 --> 83.58]  Yeah, because you're...
[84.18 --> 85.70]  Also, your chair is higher.
[85.70 --> 91.84]  I bet it's on the other side because I bet your chair was assembled backwards.
[91.84 --> 93.22]  Oh, no, no, it is on that side.
[93.22 --> 93.60]  Is it?
[94.00 --> 94.56]  You got this.
[94.60 --> 95.22]  You got this, bro.
[95.28 --> 96.02]  I'm cheering for him.
[96.52 --> 97.54]  You can do it.
[97.80 --> 98.66]  You can do it.
[98.84 --> 99.20]  Is this doing something?
[99.20 --> 100.26]  Yeah, it's not doing anything.
[100.38 --> 101.54]  Oh, is that as low as yours goes?
[101.92 --> 102.60]  Try lifting it.
[102.60 --> 108.40]  Oh, so yours just doesn't go as low.
[108.94 --> 110.58]  Because it's like a bigger person chair.
[110.70 --> 110.90]  Yeah.
[111.14 --> 111.70]  Okay, well, fine.
[111.78 --> 113.40]  I'll just lift my chair up a bit.
[113.74 --> 114.34]  There we go.
[114.38 --> 115.40]  Yeah, this is as low as my chair is.
[115.40 --> 116.06]  All right.
[116.42 --> 117.28]  We got this.
[117.34 --> 118.02]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[118.16 --> 119.50]  My chair isn't higher.
[119.60 --> 120.54]  No, I just lifted mine, though.
[121.00 --> 121.28]  Oh.
[121.42 --> 121.60]  Yeah.
[121.60 --> 123.46]  There we go.
[123.48 --> 124.00]  Now my chair is lower.
[124.00 --> 127.60]  Now we look like the same species, at least, even if he's a larger specimen.
[129.24 --> 130.12]  What else we got?
[130.18 --> 135.04]  The Reddit CEO actively altered and censored user comments.
[135.30 --> 140.16]  And Canada wants software backdoors, mandatory decryption capability, and record storage for,
[140.32 --> 143.18]  I believe, at least a year of everything you do on any service.
[143.72 --> 144.16]  Cool.
[144.84 --> 145.64]  Oh, Canada.
[146.00 --> 147.20]  Freaking man.
[147.90 --> 149.92]  So don't say anything bad about anything.
[149.92 --> 152.28]  And everything you do will always be tracked forever.
[153.68 --> 155.86]  Why is it going so slow?
[157.12 --> 158.96]  Does that seem, like, broken?
[163.50 --> 164.02]  Weird.
[164.32 --> 165.42]  Is the audio screwed?
[165.88 --> 167.04]  I have no idea.
[168.36 --> 172.34]  I'm sure Twitch chat is, like, spazzing out about it by now, if it is.
[172.52 --> 178.12]  It was like, LOL, WTF, 5 FPS, you suck, LOL, freaking noobs.
[178.12 --> 180.30]  You'd think they'd figured out by now, LOL.
[180.58 --> 182.22]  Are you even reading this or are you just guessing?
[182.54 --> 185.34]  I read, like, a couple comments and then I guess.
[185.44 --> 185.94]  Oh, yeah.
[186.08 --> 187.32]  No, I see it.
[187.42 --> 187.86]  I see it.
[187.86 --> 187.96]  Yeah.
[187.96 --> 188.30]  Yeah.
[188.74 --> 189.76]  It was pretty accurate.
[189.88 --> 190.48]  That's fine.
[191.74 --> 192.60]  No problem.
[193.38 --> 194.04]  No problem.
[194.92 --> 195.70]  That's fine.
[195.88 --> 196.90]  The sponsor spots work.
[196.98 --> 198.04]  That's all that matters anyway.
[198.28 --> 198.66]  Hell yeah.
[198.74 --> 200.16]  We're going to rename the WAN show.
[200.26 --> 201.68]  It's just going to be the sponsor show.
[202.12 --> 207.46]  I mean, based on that, the sponsor segment was, like, the most popular part of last week's WAN show anyway.
[207.64 --> 209.92]  We might as well just do an entire show only of sponsors.
[210.06 --> 211.66]  We should probably do that.
[212.04 --> 219.10]  This show, sponsored by Canada, not giving a bleep word about your privacy or rights at all as a person.
[219.10 --> 221.90]  No, I don't want them as a sponsor.
[223.90 --> 225.34]  No, no, I mean real sponsors.
[225.46 --> 226.28]  Okay, okay, think about it.
[226.30 --> 228.42]  Because you know how there's, like, an awareness to everything.
[228.56 --> 232.02]  There's, like, Breast Cancer Awareness Month and there's, like, Movember.
[232.28 --> 239.86]  Is there, like, a blatant, shameless advertising celebration?
[240.98 --> 242.84]  Like, is there, like, Sellout Month?
[243.14 --> 244.38]  Could we create this?
[244.38 --> 244.86]  Yes.
[245.18 --> 250.78]  So, to kick off Sellout Month, we do an entire WAN show of nothing but sponsor spots.
[251.50 --> 252.86]  We should see if Nick could sell it.
[255.80 --> 257.12]  He probably could.
[258.22 --> 259.82]  I think Nick can sell anything.
[260.82 --> 262.68]  The live demonstration show?
[263.54 --> 266.00]  We show a live demonstration of every single sponsor's product?
[266.20 --> 266.62]  Mm-hmm.
[266.98 --> 268.56]  How would we show a live, like, we could spend...
[268.56 --> 271.58]  You get a 15-minute segment and we use your product for 15 minutes on stream.
[271.58 --> 274.42]  We could spend 15 minutes creating a Squarespace site.
[274.60 --> 274.80]  Yeah.
[275.12 --> 275.80]  That could be done.
[276.00 --> 276.20]  Yeah.
[276.36 --> 277.98]  We could spend 15 minutes...
[277.98 --> 282.06]  We could partially disassemble a device with an iFixit kit.
[282.06 --> 284.96]  We wouldn't be able to finish anything, but we could do that.
[285.08 --> 286.96]  We could, like, expense some stuff.
[287.32 --> 288.36]  With FreshBooks.
[288.56 --> 288.62]  Yeah.
[289.16 --> 290.24]  We could shave.
[290.98 --> 291.86]  Oh, I need to.
[291.96 --> 292.46]  Dollar Shave.
[292.86 --> 294.40]  I think it could be done.
[294.54 --> 294.76]  Yeah.
[294.96 --> 295.86]  I think it could be done.
[295.96 --> 296.10]  Yeah.
[296.20 --> 296.82]  What else have we got?
[297.12 --> 299.76]  We could make a call if we hosted it in the States and used Ting.
[300.12 --> 300.38]  Yep.
[300.38 --> 304.00]  And then we could make another call and use Discord.
[304.52 --> 304.86]  Yes.
[305.10 --> 305.42]  Yes.
[306.18 --> 307.00]  A VoIP call.
[307.00 --> 307.44]  Internet, yeah.
[307.70 --> 308.02]  That's right.
[308.20 --> 313.02]  While you're calling people, I can cook stuff with a Chef Steps jewel.
[313.86 --> 314.16]  Yeah.
[314.44 --> 317.38]  No, that could be, like, the one that runs in the background of the entire show and then
[317.38 --> 318.10]  we eat it at the end.
[318.16 --> 321.46]  So it's, like, 10 minutes of preparation and then five minutes of eating it.
[321.58 --> 321.82]  Yep.
[321.82 --> 326.82]  So we could host the show on an Intel NUC.
[328.06 --> 328.46]  One sec.
[329.38 --> 329.94]  Hi, Mom.
[330.00 --> 330.74]  You're on the WAN show.
[333.14 --> 335.78]  I feel like it's been a while since we've, uh...
[335.78 --> 335.80]  One second.
[335.80 --> 336.18]  One second.
[336.86 --> 337.54]  Oh, boy.
[337.62 --> 338.00]  There we go.
[338.04 --> 338.82]  You're on speaker, Mom.
[338.92 --> 339.58]  Oh, boy.
[340.28 --> 341.38]  Hi, Linus.
[341.60 --> 342.04]  Hey.
[342.24 --> 343.10]  How's it going?
[343.84 --> 344.82]  It's been so long.
[344.90 --> 345.54]  I miss you.
[345.60 --> 345.90]  I know.
[345.98 --> 349.34]  I love it when you call into the show live like this without announcing it first.
[349.96 --> 351.08]  I know you love it.
[351.12 --> 352.26]  That's why I do it.
[353.64 --> 354.42]  What's up, Mom?
[354.48 --> 355.44]  To what do I owe the pleasure?
[355.44 --> 358.84]  I would need to know Luke's shoe size.
[359.14 --> 360.14]  Luke's shoe size.
[361.14 --> 361.52]  Okay.
[361.78 --> 364.70]  Now, I fully understand that he wouldn't know this.
[366.14 --> 368.42]  But were you really expecting me to know?
[369.84 --> 371.62]  I thought you were in charge of him.
[372.34 --> 374.04]  I know his sweater size.
[375.04 --> 376.78]  So I can meet you halfway here.
[377.90 --> 378.62]  Is that your child?
[378.90 --> 379.20]  Yes.
[379.60 --> 380.60]  Hello, Stephanie's child.
[380.66 --> 383.24]  Oh, the wardrobe ladies are saying hello.
[383.42 --> 383.66]  Hello?
[384.22 --> 384.54]  Hello?
[385.44 --> 391.16]  It's generally a 12, Mom.
[391.28 --> 394.44]  It can range from 11 to 13, but it's usually a 12.
[394.52 --> 395.32]  You set this up.
[395.62 --> 399.62]  You had your mom call into WAN Show and ask about your shoe size just so you could talk about it.
[400.14 --> 402.36]  Just so you could talk about how big your shoes are.
[402.72 --> 404.48]  I know why you want to talk about that.
[404.48 --> 406.50]  I think that's semi-average for like a tall dude.
[407.60 --> 408.88]  Linus, just leave it alone.
[408.88 --> 416.28]  All right.
[416.34 --> 417.34]  Thanks for calling in.
[417.60 --> 418.06]  Bye, Mom.
[418.10 --> 418.54]  I love you.
[418.76 --> 419.02]  Bye.
[419.02 --> 419.54]  Bye.
[419.64 --> 420.12]  Love you, too.
[420.20 --> 420.46]  Bye.
[422.42 --> 423.28]  Oh, wow.
[423.44 --> 424.06]  All right.
[424.22 --> 425.10]  So...
[425.10 --> 428.16]  Linus, just leave it alone.
[428.16 --> 434.00]  Oh, my God.
[434.00 --> 434.68]  That was good.
[434.76 --> 435.22]  All right.
[435.30 --> 437.40]  Let's move into our first topic here.
[437.54 --> 444.34]  Twitter says it will ban Trump if he breaks hate speech rules.
[444.34 --> 448.38]  So this was originally posted on Quartz.com.
[448.78 --> 448.98]  Quartz.
[448.98 --> 452.18]  And the article is...
[452.18 --> 453.78]  Just...
[453.78 --> 455.40]  I mean, the way it begins is great.
[455.52 --> 457.42]  Twitter's been fighting hate speech for years.
[457.54 --> 459.04]  Some would argue not very successfully.
[459.40 --> 463.62]  Now it faces what may be the world's most powerful troll.
[463.96 --> 467.32]  The president of the United States.
[468.28 --> 469.40]  It has the best memes.
[470.36 --> 470.88]  So...
[470.88 --> 471.82]  The greatest memes.
[471.82 --> 476.04]  Facebook has already indicated to Slate...
[476.04 --> 478.36]  So there's another article here from Facebook...
[478.36 --> 479.64]  From Facebook.com.
[479.76 --> 480.08]  From...
[480.08 --> 481.24]  Please load.
[481.50 --> 482.70]  From Slate.com.
[482.76 --> 483.24]  Here we go.
[483.54 --> 486.34]  Would Facebook or Twitter ever ban President Trump?
[486.44 --> 487.52]  One says it wouldn't.
[487.76 --> 488.92]  One says it would.
[488.92 --> 494.02]  So Facebook has already said they are willing to bend the rules for President-elect Trump.
[494.18 --> 497.74]  Twitter told Slate no one is exempt from their rules.
[497.92 --> 499.20]  Not even the president.
[499.84 --> 501.36]  And you know what I have to say to that?
[501.36 --> 502.64]  That is good for you, Twitter.
[503.20 --> 507.94]  So Twitter has recently suspended the accounts of several leading pundits and activists from
[507.94 --> 509.24]  the alt-right.
[511.04 --> 516.58]  Which has been linked with notions of white supremacy, white nationalism, and anti-Semitism.
[516.58 --> 522.24]  So asked whether Twitter would consider banning government officials, the Twitter spokesperson
[522.24 --> 530.34]  said the Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account
[530.34 --> 531.10]  abuse.
[531.10 --> 533.76]  Wow.
[534.02 --> 539.64]  Honestly, like, being a person who admins a forum, you own your platform.
[539.64 --> 543.26]  If you want to do that, you want to do that.
[543.32 --> 546.58]  Like, I'm not going to tell Twitter or Facebook how to run their stuff, because I wouldn't
[546.58 --> 548.28]  want them to tell me how to run my stuff.
[548.74 --> 551.42]  And like, we ban people for various reasons.
[551.42 --> 553.36]  But, hold on a second.
[553.36 --> 559.22]  You wouldn't tell them how to run their stuff, but could you not make the argument that due
[559.22 --> 561.00]  to their ubiquity...
[561.00 --> 561.40]  Their size?
[561.60 --> 563.68]  Their size, their scale, their impact.
[563.68 --> 564.62]  I don't think they should.
[564.62 --> 571.22]  Though there's been a lot of debate, and I think Facebook has come out and said they
[571.22 --> 575.34]  don't feel like they influenced the election one way or the other, or they didn't think
[575.34 --> 576.78]  that there was proof that they had.
[577.08 --> 583.10]  I think that's stupid for them to say something like that, that they didn't influence it one
[583.10 --> 583.84]  way or the other.
[585.76 --> 592.00]  And given their size, given their scale, do you feel like, while we are not legally entitled
[592.00 --> 595.30]  to tell them how to operate their platform, do you feel like they have a social responsibility
[595.30 --> 595.98]  to do it?
[596.34 --> 598.04]  Social responsibility to ban him, though.
[598.24 --> 604.02]  No, social responsibility to enforce the rules equally to all people, regardless of whether
[604.02 --> 609.32]  it's just, it creates, like, a PR poop storm for them.
[609.76 --> 611.76]  I think it depends, personally.
[611.86 --> 615.28]  Because, like, one way that you could look at it is, like, yeah, this is bannable stuff.
[615.28 --> 620.36]  But then he's a leader of a country where probably the majority of your users are from.
[620.36 --> 621.82]  Mm-hmm.
[621.92 --> 629.14]  So, like, there's being informed and knowledgeable about extremely important things that are
[629.14 --> 630.04]  happening in your country.
[630.24 --> 634.28]  And then there's, like, Joe Blow down the block being a dick.
[634.76 --> 635.20]  Right.
[635.74 --> 640.52]  And I think there, whether the comments might be the same.
[640.92 --> 645.84]  Okay, so if you're saying, you're saying if someone important is a dick, they should get
[645.84 --> 646.58]  special treatment.
[647.20 --> 647.66]  But that's...
[647.66 --> 648.64]  How are you draining the swamp?
[648.64 --> 652.64]  No, that's just to spread knowledge about...
[653.32 --> 654.60]  It's different when it's a president.
[654.70 --> 655.78]  It's not just someone important.
[655.92 --> 657.16]  It's the president of the United States.
[657.56 --> 658.00]  It, like...
[658.00 --> 658.16]  Elect.
[658.42 --> 659.00]  It's a...
[659.00 --> 659.28]  Elect.
[659.40 --> 659.64]  Whatever.
[659.84 --> 660.04]  Yes.
[660.92 --> 662.00]  It's a tier above.
[662.14 --> 662.56]  You know what I mean?
[662.58 --> 666.08]  And you need to know what's going on with your president or prime minister or whoever
[666.08 --> 667.10]  is the leader of your country.
[667.30 --> 668.48]  You need to know what's going on.
[668.56 --> 669.72]  I think that's an important thing.
[669.98 --> 671.96]  I like to be informed about what Trudeau's doing.
[672.28 --> 673.24]  I like to be informed about what...
[673.24 --> 673.90]  Do you like it?
[674.20 --> 674.52]  Trump is doing it?
[674.52 --> 675.32]  Do you enjoy it?
[675.32 --> 678.22]  I don't necessarily enjoy it, but I think it's an important thing.
[678.22 --> 678.98]  Knowledge is important.
[679.06 --> 681.38]  The last week hasn't been a high point for...
[681.38 --> 682.38]  No, it hasn't.
[682.38 --> 682.74]  ...PM Trudeau.
[682.84 --> 683.62]  It really hasn't.
[683.74 --> 686.70]  But knowing that he has said those things is important.
[687.34 --> 689.70]  And I would like to see that feed.
[690.14 --> 690.48]  Okay.
[690.88 --> 691.28]  So then...
[691.28 --> 696.94]  I think knowledge goes above not necessarily feeling comfortable all the time.
[697.18 --> 699.56]  So I would want to know what is being said.
[699.64 --> 700.80]  Whether or not I agree with it.
[700.82 --> 701.34]  It doesn't matter.
[701.44 --> 703.28]  I would want to be able to see that.
[703.36 --> 703.66]  Okay.
[704.00 --> 704.40]  So...
[704.40 --> 705.06]  So...
[705.06 --> 705.30]  Okay.
[705.48 --> 706.40]  I mean, honestly...
[706.40 --> 706.66]  So here.
[706.76 --> 709.24]  I got to straw poll this because we got to hear from you guys.
[710.60 --> 711.88]  Should presidents...
[711.88 --> 713.94]  I think it would be hilarious if he was banned.
[714.86 --> 715.62]  Have a...
[715.62 --> 717.24]  Let's call it like a so-called...
[717.88 --> 719.24]  A diplomatic immunity...
[719.24 --> 720.70]  Yeah.
[721.70 --> 724.60]  ...to social media bans.
[724.92 --> 725.24]  Should presidents...
[725.90 --> 726.34]  PMs...
[726.34 --> 727.48]  Heads of state...
[727.48 --> 728.24]  We're going to go...
[729.06 --> 730.06]  Yes, no.
[731.34 --> 732.14]  Create poll.
[732.24 --> 735.60]  Let's go ahead and drop this in the Twitch chat so you guys can start hitting us with these.
[736.36 --> 736.68]  But...
[736.68 --> 737.70]  Someone in chat's like...
[737.70 --> 742.86]  So basically Luke is saying make sure all politicians have a platform to say stupid bleep word on.
[743.42 --> 748.94]  The thing is, if they're saying all this stupid bleep word stuff, elect someone else.
[749.24 --> 755.00]  Or use those things to campaign against them so that your country elects someone else.
[755.00 --> 765.02]  I don't personally enjoy living in ignorance and hiding everything away so that I don't know what's going on so that I don't feel bad about things that other people are saying.
[765.14 --> 769.68]  I would rather know what other people are saying, feel bad about it, but know what's going on more.
[769.76 --> 770.60]  That's me personally.
[771.32 --> 774.80]  Like I said earlier, I don't want to tell these platforms what they need to do.
[774.80 --> 779.92]  But like we have a rule on the forum where you can attack us.
[780.94 --> 782.92]  We don't like you attacking other users.
[784.10 --> 787.88]  And personally, I would enforce that whether it's President Trump or not.
[788.74 --> 789.80]  President Trump came on the forum...
[790.86 --> 791.88]  And attacked our users.
[792.24 --> 792.90]  And was like, I would ban him.
[793.38 --> 793.68]  Right.
[794.82 --> 796.38]  That's the way I'm going to do it.
[796.78 --> 797.80]  I don't feel like...
[797.80 --> 803.84]  But you're also saying that Facebook isn't outright wrong.
[803.96 --> 804.90]  I don't want them to.
[805.62 --> 805.88]  You don't want them to.
[805.88 --> 807.32]  If I was them, it might be different.
[807.48 --> 809.94]  I don't want them to because I want to be able to see what he's doing.
[810.64 --> 811.46]  As a user.
[811.94 --> 812.30]  Interesting.
[814.06 --> 816.14]  As a user, I don't care if he's making fun of me.
[816.96 --> 820.48]  I want to be able to see what he's doing because I care about knowledge.
[820.48 --> 826.74]  As an admin of the Linus Actives forum, I don't want anyone making fun of my users or attacking different people on my platform.
[827.40 --> 831.22]  If they attack us, if they're like, wow, they made this video.
[831.58 --> 834.46]  There's such NVIDIA shills is common.
[835.28 --> 836.24]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[836.36 --> 837.14]  I hate these guys.
[837.94 --> 848.90]  Like someone created a thread in the general section of the forum not that long ago in a response to mine and John's video on MacBook RAM.
[848.90 --> 849.60]  Mm-hmm.
[849.74 --> 849.90]  Yeah.
[850.48 --> 856.82]  Saying that we were horribly ill-informed and he was looking for other YouTube channels to go watch.
[857.30 --> 857.48]  Yep.
[857.54 --> 858.52]  I didn't pull that down.
[858.66 --> 859.50]  I didn't ban that guy.
[859.64 --> 860.86]  I didn't give him warning points or anything.
[861.14 --> 870.28]  It made me sad, but he was left completely alone because that's how I think we should be running the forum.
[871.46 --> 879.42]  So you think, okay, so on our forum, President Trump would be allowed to attack us, but he would not be allowed to attack other users.
[879.42 --> 880.46]  Yeah.
[880.46 --> 881.66]  So, but then...
[881.66 --> 882.76]  That's how I...
[882.76 --> 912.76] 
[912.76 --> 914.00]  Yeah.
[914.00 --> 920.50]  chips for him. Yes. Would you feel the same way if you or or it's great that your mom called in
[920.50 --> 925.72]  if it was your mom being attacked on Twitter or on Facebook how would you feel about Facebook
[925.72 --> 933.04]  not banning a bully no matter who they are if they were campaigning against your mother
[933.04 --> 938.96]  for being a cast member of let's say a show for example for I think that happened right
[938.96 --> 944.72]  with I don't remember the name of it but there was a show yeah so some show in my opinion my mom is an
[944.72 --> 952.34]  extremely wonderful lady and I truly believe that people would back up my mom because she's a
[952.34 --> 959.82]  wonderful person and I'd love to believe that I would like to have the knowledge out there that
[959.82 --> 966.64]  this theoretical person is attacking my lovely mom and if someone would do that they would be a
[966.64 --> 972.96]  deplorable person but if someone came on the Linus Tech Tips forum personally attacking your
[972.96 --> 977.50]  mother they would be banned within seconds oh yeah nanoseconds yeah but on another platform
[977.50 --> 985.46]  my mom is a user on the forum but but on another platform okay I mean I'm uh so Twitter is a
[985.46 --> 991.22]  platform that people very specifically use for like political things and has been set up to be very good
[991.22 --> 996.18]  for that Linus Tech Tips is not a platform at all that has been set up for political things
[996.18 --> 1001.54]  in the slightest right it is a technology discussion community it is not the same place
[1001.54 --> 1011.02]  and it will be admin and moderated as such okay well 75 percent of you or so say that presidents and PMs
[1011.02 --> 1017.92]  should not have diplomatic immunity to social media bans with 25 percent of you approximately about a
[1017.92 --> 1024.16]  quarter of you saying that they should to be clear have immunity I respect and totally understand the
[1024.16 --> 1029.74]  people voting against my thing and again I would probably run the platform differently yeah just
[1029.74 --> 1035.50]  as a user I appreciate the knowledge interesting okay I want to be able to know what's going on
[1035.50 --> 1040.22]  maybe it's not on Facebook and Twitter and he has some other place that's fine just as far as I
[1040.22 --> 1046.16]  know he doesn't really he just tweets things I don't know um that's the only place I monitor I don't
[1046.16 --> 1051.86]  follow him so that he doesn't get more followers even though he has so many but like I don't know
[1051.86 --> 1059.56]  oh man uh I don't actually know if it made it into the uh the doc this week 140 characters for
[1059.56 --> 1066.24]  politic talks luke dumb that's literally what it's for what some guy was like calling me dumb because
[1066.24 --> 1071.28]  it's only 140 character for like politicians because twit longer doesn't exist because putting one out of
[1071.28 --> 1075.26]  four two out of four three out of four four out of four at the end of tweets doesn't exist because
[1075.26 --> 1080.30]  taking pictures of something and then posting it doesn't exist and linking off to another site
[1080.30 --> 1086.88]  and because pms don't exist or dms as they call them on that platform yes yes so um yeah there's that
[1086.88 --> 1093.16]  uh on the subject of president trump and his twitter followers do you know that as the president
[1093.16 --> 1102.12]  he can sms the entire country right okay oh my god I don't think any president has ever actually
[1102.12 --> 1109.18]  used it but if there was anyone who was gonna who was gonna sms because it's it's mostly like the
[1109.18 --> 1114.38]  network exists this person made fun of me go look at her porno sms entire country emergency like
[1114.38 --> 1119.06]  information and stuff like that that makes sense yeah there's like three different like oh my god
[1119.06 --> 1123.22]  can access it yeah like like things that would be extremely get to the chopper that kind of thing
[1123.22 --> 1132.16]  um but uh but yeah yeah president-elect trump will have the keys to texting everybody's cell phones
[1132.16 --> 1133.54]  oh man at three in the morning
[1133.54 --> 1142.36]  well no no no no you've shown no see comments like that you show a clear misunderstanding of
[1142.36 --> 1148.48]  time zones because it cannot be three in the morning across the entire country
[1148.48 --> 1155.52]  right the the us of a is a very big place okay we're talking three different time zones
[1155.52 --> 1159.92]  that more if you count hawaii i was just gonna say what yep there's more they're important too
[1159.92 --> 1168.24]  yep to someone oh hawaiians they have a really cool observatory so i mean to be clear i i love hawaii
[1168.24 --> 1173.44]  i actually have never been there have you not been there i went for amd's uh hawaii gp oh yeah
[1173.44 --> 1180.88]  yeah it's beautiful yeah it's awesome um it makes sense yeah but um but they just they kind of get
[1180.88 --> 1185.28]  forgotten in the whole how many time zones why do you ever waste space uploading this to youtube why
[1185.28 --> 1191.44]  do you ever waste time watching it ask yourself maybe they're not watching it maybe that's like
[1191.44 --> 1197.28]  maybe like trump they are specifically not following us so we don't get any more followers they're sitting
[1197.28 --> 1202.48]  at their computer kind of looking at the screen like this right so all they can see is the chat window
[1202.48 --> 1206.80]  and they're not watching it and they have they pop out the chat and then they close the stream the
[1206.80 --> 1213.68]  finger in the ear the shoulder against the other ear and they're going i am warrior-ing my keyboard
[1215.44 --> 1219.20]  that's what they probably look like right now so good oh my god
[1220.08 --> 1227.04]  so good all right speaking of speaking of canada things and being informed and caring about knowledge
[1227.04 --> 1233.44]  original article here is from tom's hardware yeah this is why i like to know what's going on because
[1234.32 --> 1239.84]  i mean between this and the fidel castro thing it has not been a proud week for canada no it hasn't
[1239.84 --> 1244.80]  it's funny because i've been really enjoying all my smug canadianness over the last little bit since
[1244.80 --> 1249.92]  the americans elected trump yeah but i'm i'm not i'm not having a good time this where's the happy in
[1249.92 --> 1259.04]  between man i know right the beginning of this bill was not proposed by his party um but this one
[1259.04 --> 1265.20]  should have been axed by his party and it has not been so literally not better is how i'm gonna apply
[1265.20 --> 1272.24]  that anyways canada wants software backdoors mandatory decryption capability and record storage
[1272.24 --> 1279.68]  extensive record storage for everything so you know what's really funny is did you also read because i i
[1279.68 --> 1286.64]  was reading some article somewhere saying he was going to kill c51 no no no no nothing he said that
[1286.64 --> 1295.12]  yeah um he's expanding it no no no um dick hole um it's weird yeah i think i think i think dick is
[1295.12 --> 1300.56]  considered a swear in the same way that pussy is like i think it's one of those like it's not an f-bomb
[1300.56 --> 1307.52]  but it's also not hell like i think it sits in this awkward in between right but if president trump can say
[1307.52 --> 1311.44]  pussy then you should probably be able to say dick
[1315.68 --> 1318.88]  i'm down i'm down it's 2016 say what you want
[1320.56 --> 1327.76]  uh just don't expect the government to not be able to decrypt it and look at it yeah and store it so uh
[1327.76 --> 1333.84]  man i forget what i said right right right right right so i i i had read some article about someone
[1333.84 --> 1338.48]  wanting to move like a backup of the internet onto storage servers in canada or something because
[1338.48 --> 1344.56]  they were worried about like president trump something like yeah i understand google the uk is a mess right now oh yeah
[1345.28 --> 1351.68]  canada looks like it's going to be a mess yeah the us is who knows google canadian spy palace
[1351.68 --> 1360.08]  it sounds just as amazing as it is just check it out canada like canada's not doing as great as a lot
[1360.08 --> 1367.12]  of people think yeah let's move up there oh they're screwed whoops um anyways yeah so last year canada passed
[1367.12 --> 1373.68]  an anti-terrorism law called bill c51 which just like screwed over everyone who wasn't a terrorist and was
[1373.68 --> 1379.12]  extremely easy to bypass by anyone who like actually really wanted to do anything bad exactly like this one
[1379.12 --> 1383.76]  will be because you can still use vpns and stuff it will just cost more money to get a good one
[1384.72 --> 1392.48]  you idiots god damn it and it's not like vpns are hard to like google it's like how do i get away from
[1392.48 --> 1398.16]  people tracking my oh wow every single website has made a thing about using vpns tunnelbear a sponsor
[1398.16 --> 1403.12]  today no they're not unfortunately they should yeah like what country is going to be safe to tunnel
[1403.12 --> 1409.12]  through at a certain point uh well there's like there's there's uh what are they called bunker
[1410.24 --> 1415.28]  bunker isp bunker servers something like that okay they like literally host their stuff in a bunker
[1415.28 --> 1419.76]  and i believe sweden it's where the it's where the pirate bay was hosted and stuff how'd that work out
[1419.76 --> 1425.12]  for them uh pretty good they never got the servers i don't think i don't think they ever got into the bunker
[1425.12 --> 1433.44]  there's like there's places you can vpn through um of course you don't see um no
[1435.44 --> 1441.04]  the government has complained aw about not being able to intercept communications oh that's so
[1441.04 --> 1445.84]  unfortunate and that it should be allowed to intercept uh allowed to use intercept capability
[1445.84 --> 1450.48]  against some service providers i feel so bad for you you could use a warrant i don't know if you've ever
[1450.48 --> 1456.16]  heard of that um but it's a thing that you can use to do this kind of stuff if you need to instead
[1456.16 --> 1460.40]  of just doing it to everyone all the time so they're allowing back doors that they're asking
[1460.40 --> 1466.32]  for back doors that will allow this interception and warrantless access to basic subscriber information
[1467.60 --> 1474.80]  um so yeah the canadian service intelligence service which is cs is
[1474.80 --> 1481.92]  security intelligence service instead of uh isis surprisingly close oh that's maybe a bad
[1481.92 --> 1489.52]  this is not comparable to a terrorist organization that was a little rough jeez in other things about
[1489.52 --> 1495.12]  privacy and things changing and whatnot reddit ceo actively altered and censored user comments i
[1495.12 --> 1500.96]  believe this was in the donald or whatever that crazy yeah it was in the donald sub subreddit um
[1500.96 --> 1507.36]  um so there was a thing that was like f you uh you slash spes which is supposed to tag him but it
[1507.36 --> 1513.28]  doesn't work he turned that off a long time ago um because people were mad about him setting setting
[1513.28 --> 1522.24]  down a subreddit called pizzagate which was about people uh theory crafting the idea that there was
[1522.24 --> 1528.96]  potentially a pedophilia ring involving people at the highest levels of the democratic party operating out of
[1528.96 --> 1534.80]  a washington pizza restaurant that they got this information out of emails that were leaked through
[1534.80 --> 1540.88]  wikileaks i read some of them they're actually pretty quick um anyways they're they're weird emo like
[1540.88 --> 1545.52]  regardless of what's going on they're weird i know that's all i have to say i don't know what's going on
[1545.52 --> 1556.16]  but them are some weird emails um so he changed the comments from being against him to being against
[1556.16 --> 1562.80]  moderators of the donald if i remember correctly yeah i was reading this article and like the way
[1562.80 --> 1569.52]  the guy convoluted the way he handled it was very childish yes yeah so spes screwed up real bad
[1570.64 --> 1577.76]  um i don't know i mean this is shortly following um like when people are attacking you
[1577.76 --> 1581.92]  a really good way to deal with it is just like being mature
[1584.40 --> 1590.64]  usually i don't know not that we're the kings of no we're not but like when that dude attacked us and
[1590.64 --> 1597.60]  was like what are some people i can go watch that aren't you can just ignore it yeah just let it blow
[1597.60 --> 1603.68]  over or if you need to address something just address it and then let it fly over yeah address it properly
[1603.68 --> 1609.92]  and fully and then move on yeah and sometimes addressing it just means sorry my bad which is
[1609.92 --> 1613.52]  yeah which he did after should have done it before yeah should have done it in the first place but
[1613.52 --> 1620.24]  maybe he learned um i mean this this comes i mean ellen powell when did she resign was that even a year
[1620.24 --> 1625.36]  ago a year and a bit yeah it feels like it wasn't that long ago i don't know but didn't she do stupid
[1625.36 --> 1630.88]  stuff i don't remember what it was or so whoa no no she closed down the fat shaming reddits i think
[1630.88 --> 1634.72]  something like that i don't remember what she i don't remember what it was but basically i mean
[1634.72 --> 1640.56]  one of the comments in the article here was even she didn't change user comments because and this
[1640.56 --> 1646.48]  is that's that's brutal that's a pretty sensitive topic especially on a platform that is supposed to
[1646.48 --> 1651.60]  be front page of the internet you know like a like a kind of a free speech yeah um what has happened
[1651.60 --> 1656.72]  on linus tech tips is we've edited user comments before yeah but i say i edit it but what happens is
[1656.72 --> 1662.16]  there's a flag that goes on the bottom that says who it was edited by and a reason and we usually
[1662.16 --> 1667.68]  post in the thread saying that it happened and the edits are like usually hilarious like we'll take
[1667.68 --> 1673.04]  someone like insulting another user with crazy slurs and swear words and stuff and make it like rainbows
[1673.04 --> 1677.92]  and bunnies and happiness and stuff yep and then say that it was edited by us like we we've done stuff
[1677.92 --> 1685.68]  like that before but we're very clear i've done stuff like if someone posts um like uh uh like a guide to
[1685.68 --> 1690.80]  something and refers to my video that i did on it or something and they weren't sure where it was
[1691.36 --> 1696.88]  like i'll go in and i'll put it in and i'll put it like a thing at the bottom edit edited by linus
[1696.88 --> 1704.88]  admin added youtube link yeah yeah i mean we tell them that it was there are transparent and harmless ways
[1704.88 --> 1711.12]  to edit user comments on a site and this especially and non-destructive because we can just go into the
[1711.12 --> 1716.40]  history and see what it was did you expect people not to notice yeah that part's pretty weird eh like
[1716.40 --> 1725.52]  that's the thing is if it had been a subtle edit like changing it to a misspelling or something or like
[1725.52 --> 1731.60]  even i i don't know especially like an angry personal attack changing the subject of it yeah
[1732.16 --> 1737.12]  yeah because those people are gonna get tagged yeah they're gonna notice and they were moderators of
[1737.12 --> 1740.80]  the donald like you don't think they're gonna jump on that i don't the whole thing was just odd
[1742.00 --> 1749.60]  just poorly planned so his statement is funny that was brandon hey everyone yup i messed i messed with
[1749.60 --> 1757.04]  the f you spaz comments replacing spaz with are the donald admins for our mods for about an hour it's been
[1757.04 --> 1763.12]  a long week here trying to unwind the r slash pizzagate stuff as much as we try to maintain a good
[1763.12 --> 1769.44]  relationship with you all it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly as the ceo i shouldn't
[1769.44 --> 1776.16]  play such games and it's all fixed now our community team is pretty pissed at me so i most assuredly
[1776.16 --> 1782.64]  won't do this again and there was some leaked screenshots of the community team's slack which
[1782.64 --> 1789.92]  one of you guys needs to not leak that because that's lame but the slack was like very unhappy
[1789.92 --> 1795.44]  because it's like the the reddit admins that need to go like clean all this yeah now it's their
[1795.44 --> 1803.12]  problem yeah and they're like oh god it would have been super cool if my day hadn't been completely
[1803.12 --> 1812.40]  ruined by you yeah thanks for that pretty much um speaking of days being completely ruined this is
[1812.40 --> 1819.44]  such a great show this is the best show the best show it's the greatest show no one else could make a
[1819.44 --> 1826.40]  show like our show yeah what the flicks original article here from tom harbert no i got it do not want
[1827.04 --> 1833.04]  notifications sorry what are you asking notifications what hold on hold on but you know what i realized
[1833.04 --> 1841.52]  i am doing this wrong what i need to view this page in the best browser oh god the greatest browser come on
[1841.52 --> 1849.84]  now microsoft edge no i mean look at this look at how these ads are chopped off halfway on the page
[1849.84 --> 1856.56]  nice you know what it's like halfway ad block it's oh why is it zoomed 250 i don't know edge and wait
[1856.56 --> 1867.36]  what is 100 why is it 100 look like this what why are you terrible like that's tom's tom's isn't formatted
[1867.36 --> 1874.08]  barley why are you so terrible well no look at chrome did it just fine look here's chrome yep my oh
[1874.08 --> 1880.00]  oh again oh shoot that's not edge's fault yeah that no that's not edge's fault hold on i got this
[1880.72 --> 1887.84]  really anyways okay okay okay tell them what's going on net netflix 4k streaming is going to require
[1887.84 --> 1898.80]  a kaby lake processor windows 10 and edge browser so considering i've had so many endless problems
[1898.80 --> 1904.96]  with windows 10 and streaming at home and i'm planning on going back to windows 7 the obvious solution
[1904.96 --> 1912.56]  is to go to an immature browser on a brand new platform from intel all at the same time for the
[1912.56 --> 1921.68]  best user experience yes wow yep wow the best part is that it's completely unnecessary although it's
[1921.68 --> 1927.52]  probably because it's using something crazy yeah it's probably hardware coding support for 10-bit
[1927.52 --> 1936.80]  hevc which i guess the question from my side would be why can't we use software decoding
[1936.80 --> 1946.64]  just like we can right now yeah this very moment exactly right now now i do actually understand why
[1947.28 --> 1955.36]  playready 3.0 hardware based drm it has to do okay so yes so playready 3.0 is a hardware based drm system
[1955.36 --> 1962.64]  that requires dedicated and supported decoding hardware uh which prevents the video stream from being
[1962.64 --> 1970.00]  captured in software or via an external capture device don't you just love drm i actually had a
[1970.00 --> 1976.08]  great week with drm this week nice yeah and so did john everyone had a great week with drm awesome john
[1976.08 --> 1984.16]  wanted to capture some ps4 pro gameplay yeah and uh and discovered that due to the hdmi 2.0 implementation
[1984.16 --> 1991.20]  of the ps4 pro our capture card just straight up couldn't do it that was great yeah and i was trying to
[1991.20 --> 2000.40]  do my evaluation of 4k blu-ray with legitimate discs on an xbox one s a legitimate player with a high-end
[2000.40 --> 2011.84]  receiver from onkyo with hdcp 2.2 and arguably the best hdr tv on the market lg signature oled and thanks
[2011.84 --> 2021.12]  to hdcp 2.2 half the time my stuff wouldn't handshake nice wasn't it wonderful that's awesome yeah i
[2021.12 --> 2028.80]  thought it was wonderful drm and hardware is great um yeah i mean especially when firmware updates
[2030.00 --> 2036.08]  upgrade the drm and downgrade the functionality oh nice do you know how long it's been since i've
[2036.08 --> 2046.08]  been able to have my gtx 980 go directly into the hdcp 2.2 ports on my tv no since halfway through my review
[2046.08 --> 2046.80]  nice
[2049.76 --> 2055.68]  isn't that great god so my understanding is it may actually be nvidia's fault on that one and it's the
[2055.68 --> 2059.76]  kind of thing that doesn't come up a lot so i didn't mention it in my review or it wasn't even
[2059.76 --> 2070.08]  really a review anyway but the point is i am not a fan at all um and i'm even more not a fan now that i
[2070.08 --> 2075.68]  pay for media so like the last stream was like the we don't have anything to talk about so we're
[2075.68 --> 2079.68]  just going to like talk about random stuff and laugh about things stream and this stream is the like
[2079.68 --> 2085.12]  everything sucks everything is terrible there's lots of news it's just all terrible yeah um like
[2085.12 --> 2090.00]  oh you just all had a good black friday cyber monday little like spend all your money deal well get
[2090.00 --> 2099.68]  screwed speaking of getting screwed and spending all your money oh wow let's stuff some sponsor messages
[2099.68 --> 2105.12]  down your throats first up is vertigear yeah they have gaming chairs and you can check them out over
[2105.12 --> 2113.52]  at vertigear.com the sline is uh great for overall comfort it just takes one person to assemble the chair
[2113.52 --> 2118.72]  and i know this for a fact because i was personally reassembling it before the stream not
[2119.36 --> 2124.56]  it was not vertigear's fault there's a very clear thing no i'm gonna lift it up no no we're not
[2124.56 --> 2129.92]  gonna have to let's just let's just do this do this the right way okay you see down there you see
[2129.92 --> 2138.00]  that sticker right there yeah so that sticker says front it's a white sticker with big capitalized bold
[2138.00 --> 2144.32]  red font it says front with an arrow so i had to reassemble this chair myself before the show because
[2144.32 --> 2151.12]  someone put it on backwards and i was sitting in the chair i was like this is really uncomfortable
[2151.12 --> 2155.36]  like i don't know if i want to do a sponsor spot for these guys because this thing's awful
[2156.80 --> 2161.84]  and it was assembled backwards put it the right way it's fine it's it's pretty good all right so
[2161.84 --> 2166.48]  anyway glides very smoothly on any surface has a tall backrest meant for the neck shoulder and it
[2166.48 --> 2171.12]  has lumbar support built in instead of just adding a cushion to it like some uh you can adjust the seat to
[2171.12 --> 2174.48]  fit your height it has adjustable armrest the knob under the seat can be set in order to match your
[2174.48 --> 2180.96]  weight so you can rock yeah you can rock with these and the backrest can be altered from 80 degrees to
[2180.96 --> 2193.84]  150 degrees luke's chair oh it's the plus line yep yep yep yep yep so you know what's great too my shoulders
[2193.84 --> 2200.80]  don't actually you know what's really funny even on the plus is you are you are effectively a plus
[2200.80 --> 2205.68]  size model right now but like i still don't fit so i'm like a plus plus size model you kind of are
[2205.68 --> 2210.96]  yep because my my arm is like over top of this you are such an enormous hunk of man
[2212.56 --> 2219.76]  um so the plus size extra large construction on the padding and headset headset headrest to provide more
[2219.76 --> 2225.44]  support and uh glide also glide smoothly on any surface all mechanical parts are covered by leather
[2225.44 --> 2230.32]  and the material is easy to clean that'll be good for you because you can be very messy sometimes
[2231.36 --> 2236.72]  i remember that one time i came into your office and on your chair there was like a cereal bowl with
[2236.72 --> 2242.96]  milk all over it that was you don't pin that on me i knew you were going there too don't pin that on me
[2242.96 --> 2251.04]  so you can check out vertigear at uh vertigear.com and uh we will have a link and uh something etc at
[2251.04 --> 2254.56]  that spot below all right moving on to squarespace
[2257.68 --> 2268.88]  square space is a space that's square or rectangular not but not a circle no unless you were to browse a
[2268.88 --> 2274.96]  square space website in on your watch oh and not this watch because this is not a circular watch
[2274.96 --> 2279.12]  but normally the watch i wear is a circle does android wear have a browser
[2281.84 --> 2286.72]  well whatever squarespace allows you to make your website the way you want to make it as long as
[2286.72 --> 2292.64]  you do it on a browser in vr you could yes but that would still wouldn't be a not really circle no
[2292.64 --> 2297.52]  you can move it around you could spin in a circle while you yeah so i guess we've achieved what
[2297.52 --> 2304.96]  we would still be viewing it in a sir if you spin it around in a circle and you are within the circle
[2304.96 --> 2310.72]  would you be viewing it within a circle viewing it in a circle because like if you if you spin
[2310.72 --> 2317.20]  it around as you're as you're as you're rotating where is he going with this would you be within
[2317.20 --> 2321.04]  the circle that you're viewing it in so you could say that you're viewing it in a circle what if some
[2321.04 --> 2325.76]  of the people out there are legitimately wondering what squarespace is squarespace is a easy to use
[2325.76 --> 2331.60]  website where you can make a website that's kind of is it in a nutshell isn't it yeah they have 24
[2331.60 --> 2336.24]  7 tech support if you sign up for a year you get a domain for free it starts at 12 bucks a month yep
[2336.24 --> 2342.40]  um they all include a store so you could sell your craft or your whatever else the case tons of different
[2342.40 --> 2346.48]  themes so you can make it look nice even if you're not good at making things look nice like squarespace
[2346.48 --> 2351.68]  you can make the page any way you want as long as it's one of their templates um which actually isn't
[2351.68 --> 2356.48]  which is a solid way to go yeah not as restrictive as it might sound uh they've got their cover pages
[2356.48 --> 2362.48]  feature which lets you set up a one page online presence in minutes and you can start a trial
[2362.48 --> 2367.68]  with no credit card required and start building your website today we want you to build a squarespace
[2367.68 --> 2374.40]  website and you can get 10 off your first purchase by using offer code wang that's how i'm gonna say
[2374.40 --> 2382.48]  wang from now on you got a whammy bar now the wang show it's annoying isn't it wang a little bit a
[2382.48 --> 2387.68]  little bit are you getting that from your kids nope wang it sounds like it sounds kind of like it yeah
[2387.68 --> 2393.44]  but they're higher pitched than me actually even higher pitch uh speaking of my kids i feel like your
[2393.44 --> 2398.72]  voice has gotten considerably deeper since we started working together i'm i have a cold so that might have
[2398.72 --> 2403.76]  something to do with maybe the last couple days yeah i've just really noticed linus you really went
[2403.76 --> 2411.36]  through puberty lately good on you for that it's like the chill the aforementioned children are sort
[2411.36 --> 2417.52]  of evidence that the puberty did happen at least four and a half five years ago whatever the math works
[2417.52 --> 2423.60]  out too because that's the whole puberty thing is the cubic you know right area and the hair happened
[2423.60 --> 2433.68]  yeah and then you know yeah what a little bit a little bit i don't know what that gesture means
[2433.68 --> 2441.04]  don't worry about it there's also fresh books who i'm sure appreciates very much the all the pubic

[2501.92 --> 2507.84]  true story yes on my stream thing last night people brought up fresh books and we're all talking
[2507.84 --> 2513.12]  about not all of them the ones that had used it we're talking about how they liked it and that's
[2513.12 --> 2518.72]  kind of cool we just had a cool story bro moment and then i talked i loved it no exactly yeah and then
[2518.72 --> 2523.60]  we talked about how like we will drop a sponsor if we genuinely think that we don't like them
[2523.60 --> 2528.88]  and then someone guessed which ones they were and i was like oh really heck do you know that
[2530.24 --> 2536.00]  yeah we generally don't uh kiss and tell they guessed like right away absolutely immediately
[2536.00 --> 2541.68]  it was weird i don't know maybe it was like nick's alt account or something oh yeah i don't know yeah nick
[2541.68 --> 2547.28]  would know all the sponsors we've dropped yeah um all right let's move on to some more topics i guess
[2547.28 --> 2557.12]  we do have more topics right yeah um there was like a netflix offline so they're they're like
[2557.92 --> 2566.00]  putting drm up our butts but they're also giving us a delicious uh offline offline viewing you know
[2566.64 --> 2572.64]  chocolate sundae so yeah i guess um as long as they don't get the chocolate and the butt mixed up
[2572.64 --> 2578.88]  then we should be pretty good uh netflix finally lets you download shows and movies to watch
[2578.88 --> 2588.40]  offline this has been one of the biggest reasons asterisk small amount of that i have bought
[2588.40 --> 2595.20]  certain media because i intended to watch it on a plane so i'll buy it rip it throw it on plex and then
[2595.20 --> 2600.08]  transcode it onto my devices which is an awful lot of work and if i could just since i have a netflix
[2600.08 --> 2606.16]  account anyway if i could just download it and watch offline later it's it's been confusing to me
[2606.16 --> 2614.16]  for some time that their licensing deal doesn't account for them to just be able to track through
[2614.16 --> 2619.84]  the app the next time you log in what you've watched and make sure that the payments are all
[2619.84 --> 2627.36]  processed correctly so with that said it's not like available for everything but they announced that
[2627.36 --> 2632.00]  members can download in addition to streams series and films at no additional cost you just click the
[2632.00 --> 2639.04]  download button on the details page and uh currently orange is the new black narcos and the crown are
[2639.04 --> 2644.24]  available for download as of november 30th 2016. your netflix app needs to be up to date to enable the
[2644.24 --> 2652.96]  feature and it looks a little something like this pretty straightforward yep looks like a download button to me
[2652.96 --> 2657.68]  yep they did a good job of that download button look at how downloady that the line at the bottom
[2658.32 --> 2662.64]  i'm using the wrong mouse showing yeah look at that showing where down is yeah this well no this is the
[2662.64 --> 2667.20]  line at the bottom doesn't show where down is well it does but it shows where the down that the arrow
[2667.20 --> 2670.48]  was pointing at would be which is what you said but in a different way
[2675.76 --> 2678.32]  fitbit is reportedly close to buying pebble
[2678.32 --> 2687.04]  i really enjoyed the moment of silence for my uh my coherency there and it was lost it was good
[2688.88 --> 2696.64]  fitbit is reportedly buying pebble apparently for a small amount um pebble's ceo saying that money is
[2696.64 --> 2703.84]  pretty tight these days openly um just happened to my link there were offers to pebble in the past
[2703.84 --> 2712.08]  um that were much higher than what this offer and deal is apparently going to be apparently the pebble
[2712.08 --> 2718.24]  brand will be phased out um fitbit will be taking pebble's intellectual property such as its os
[2719.20 --> 2728.08]  and etc maybe this is a ah maybe the smart watches seem to be not doing well at all
[2728.08 --> 2738.48]  well you don't use one right nope i used to and then i was like wow it super drains the battery on
[2738.48 --> 2744.24]  my phone for like not a ton of benefit and then i stopped i would be fine if it didn't affect if it
[2744.24 --> 2751.04]  didn't uh adversely affect my phone but it does so i don't know see i started and then there's the
[2751.04 --> 2756.88]  neptune pine we all know about that i started using a smart watch right around the time i switched to the
[2756.88 --> 2765.84]  droid turbo and since then i have leaned very heavily towards phones with just outrageous battery
[2765.84 --> 2772.00]  life like i might be able to do it now that i have my pixel right but like it was not a thing with the
[2772.00 --> 2778.64]  z5 i'm kind of disappointed nothing i've seen from fitbit has particularly impressed me their software is
[2778.64 --> 2787.20]  just trash whereas pebble even though i was not a fan of the pebble time the pebble time felt like
[2787.20 --> 2794.32]  a cheap crappy device it felt like they were they were cheaping out trying to eke out more margin
[2794.32 --> 2799.68]  which makes sense and they ultimately compromised what could have been a very good user experience
[2799.68 --> 2806.80]  because i actually didn't mind the software like for third-party software it did a better job
[2806.80 --> 2814.48]  on ios and android than i think apple could do on an android phone with the apple watch or that
[2815.20 --> 2820.40]  google has done with android wear paired to an iphone like they actually managed to bridge that gap
[2820.40 --> 2827.36]  where i think they achieved really 90 of what i would care about and they managed to do it on both
[2827.36 --> 2834.16]  platforms i thought that was really cool about it but um someone in the chat said it was just kind of a
[2834.16 --> 2841.84]  crappy device with a really bad screen someone in the chat said that uh real smart watches like the
[2841.84 --> 2849.60]  apple watch and the gear are doing well uh i think you should re-conjigger how you view well apple has
[2849.60 --> 2854.24]  like pretty much straight up said that the apple watch isn't doing well haven't they um i i don't know
[2854.96 --> 2861.52]  actually but i what i will say is that they now have a second generation apple watch and they have
[2861.52 --> 2867.68]  slashed the price of the first generation apple watch which when you look at the apple watch and
[2867.68 --> 2873.04]  the price delta that they're trying to go at between the two generations of it basically means to me they
[2873.04 --> 2877.76]  have a lot of inventory they're sitting on like i don't think i don't think apple watch is a big
[2877.76 --> 2883.52]  success how many of them do you see my vet has one that's the only person i know with an apple watch and
[2883.52 --> 2888.96]  it was a gift from someone who thought she would like an apple watch like that's what they've largely became
[2888.96 --> 2892.48]  it kind of sucks right now because like two of the most
[2896.00 --> 2900.56]  highest anticipated within the last little while sections of technology i guess is how i'll phrase
[2900.56 --> 2907.12]  that like vr and smart watches are wearables in general both just like drunk and then are stuck
[2907.12 --> 2913.12]  down here right well i think vr stands stands a chance of coming back well i think wearables definitely
[2913.12 --> 2917.20]  do too maybe they'll come back on similar to no i was gonna say i thought vr might come back sooner
[2917.20 --> 2923.28]  because at least the vr like the good vr that's out today is really good and very compelling whereas
[2923.28 --> 2929.04]  even the best wearables right now i think are trying to be all the wrong things like i've been
[2929.04 --> 2937.04]  wearing the apple watch as a daily driver for at least two weeks i don't actually remember how long
[2937.04 --> 2942.80]  it's been but i've been using it for a bit because i switched to the macbook pro and i switched to the iphone 7
[2942.80 --> 2951.52]  and i've been like in the apple ecosystem i haven't been tempted to press the crown and open up any of
[2951.52 --> 2959.84]  the other apps on the stupid thing once how could i possibly care the time that it takes to press the
[2959.84 --> 2965.68]  crown navigate these tiny little icons to the weather by then i could have pulled out my phone like
[2965.68 --> 2970.96]  there's just so few things that really make sense it's mostly a notification device why
[2973.12 --> 2981.76]  okay can it come back okay that was scary um i guess they're just they're trying to instead of just
[2981.76 --> 2988.32]  trying to be really elegant and beautiful one thing and that is like tell time for one thing yes um
[2989.52 --> 2995.44]  they're either trying to be too much or their their business is too dependent on just selling wearables
[2995.44 --> 2999.92]  they need too much margin they can't build a good enough product just no one's really no one's
[2999.92 --> 3007.84]  really gotten it quite right um yeah so anyway this this news comes off after pebble laid off 25
[3007.84 --> 3015.84]  of its staff earlier in the year and um this is all despite funding rounds in 2015 and 2016 that raised
[3015.84 --> 3025.36]  26 million so there you go so much for that in continued
[3025.44 --> 3030.80]  bad news uh uk asa concludes that no man's sky ads were not misleading
[3032.24 --> 3036.72]  which actually sounds like impossible original article here was from the bbc
[3037.68 --> 3043.12]  no man's sky's ads were not misleading says the uk's advertising watchdog
[3044.80 --> 3051.04]  what kind of watchdog is that bad dog doesn't watch very well bad dog no supper
[3051.04 --> 3059.52]  bad so the asa um has rejected these complaints with their statement reading that we understood
[3059.52 --> 3065.44]  that the screenshots and videos in the ad had been created using game footage and acknowledged that
[3066.08 --> 3071.60]  in doing this the advertisers would aim to show the product in the best light we considered that the
[3071.60 --> 3077.28]  overall impression of the ad was consistent with the gameplay and the footage provided both in terms of
[3077.28 --> 3083.60]  that captured by hello games and by third parties and that it did not exaggerate the expected player
[3083.60 --> 3084.48]  experience of the game
[3088.24 --> 3096.72]  delusional is the is the one keyword reaction i'm going to give to that and moving on i guess because
[3096.72 --> 3101.04]  i don't know i've got a good one okay i have some good news i have cool news oh yeah so we're moving on
[3101.04 --> 3109.76]  now um so the original article here this was posted by spider on the forum and it's aws.amazon.com amazon
[3109.76 --> 3118.56]  snowmobile they have cool names for things i know right so uh last year they announced the aws snowball
[3118.56 --> 3126.88]  which allows you to transfer one petabyte per week using amazon owned storage appliances into the cloud
[3126.88 --> 3133.12]  so this is for like large scale data migrations so with 80 terabytes of storage these appliances
[3133.12 --> 3136.88]  would address the needs of many of their customers and are in widespread use blah blah blah blah blah
[3136.88 --> 3143.44]  however customers with exabyte scale on-premises storage look at the 80 terabytes and realize that
[3143.44 --> 3149.12]  an all-out data migration would require lots of devices and some headache and using logistics introducing
[3149.12 --> 3159.68]  snowmobile where is it where is it physically snowmobile is a ruggedized tamper resistant shipping container
[3161.68 --> 3170.40]  45 feet long 9.6 feet high and 8 feet wide it is waterproof climate controlled and can be parked
[3170.40 --> 3177.68]  in a covered or uncovered area adjacent to your existing data center each snowmobile consumes about 350
[3177.68 --> 3184.00]  kilowatts of ac power if you don't have sufficient capacity on site we can arrange for a generator
[3187.36 --> 3195.68]  so each truck is equipped with uh how what was it 100 gigabit per second or 400 gigabit per second or
[3195.68 --> 3204.56]  some some ridiculous kind of networking capacity and these trucks can store up to 100 petabytes of data
[3204.56 --> 3211.12]  allowing you to move exabytes to aws in a matter of weeks one terabit per second of data transfer
[3211.12 --> 3217.28]  speed across multiple 40 gigabit per second connections one terabit assuming that your existing
[3217.28 --> 3222.00]  network can transfer data at that rate you can fill a snowmobile in about 10 days
[3224.24 --> 3229.28]  and then they show snowmobile in action and they did it with lego characters did you see that i scrolled
[3229.28 --> 3234.48]  through it okay yeah so i have more good news about this one as soon as i heard about this
[3235.28 --> 3242.08]  i fired off as many emails as i could to anyone i could think of and i i okay it's nothing concrete
[3242.64 --> 3249.60]  but i did get a reply that someone at an agency who knows someone at amazon aws is looking into whether it
[3249.60 --> 3254.96]  be feasible for me to go down and take a look at a snowmobile oh i wonder if we want here ah they're
[3254.96 --> 3259.60]  not gonna bring oh it would have been cool what would we even do with it i don't know this would
[3259.60 --> 3267.12]  have been sweet transfer everything we have there in like not long at all just for funsies just for
[3267.12 --> 3273.20]  fun like delete it afterwards i guess i don't know yeah i have a feeling they're not going to invest that
[3273.20 --> 3282.64]  kind of time and effort do it worth it you should you should uh what else we got should ah yes it will
[3282.64 --> 3290.16]  soon be illegal for businesses to punish customers for leaving negative reviews that's good that is
[3290.16 --> 3296.24]  actually really just needs president obama's signature to be official and that assumes that the republicans
[3296.24 --> 3302.96]  and professor trump don't repeal it because it's a bad idea because obama was involved in his signature
[3302.96 --> 3310.00]  was on it but in a nutshell what this means is that congress just passed a bill protecting
[3310.00 --> 3315.68]  consumers rights to post negative reviews online passed by unanimous consent by the pass the ah blah
[3315.68 --> 3320.88]  blah blah the consumer review fairness act will make it illegal for businesses to include a non-disbargement
[3320.88 --> 3327.60]  or gag clause which limits a customer's right to share bad reviews by ending gag clauses this
[3327.60 --> 3332.16]  legislation supports consumer rights and the integrity of critical feedback about the products and services
[3332.16 --> 3336.72]  sold online so that's cool i guess
[3339.84 --> 3345.28]  uh more bad news uh uber now tracks passengers locations even after they're dropped off
[3349.20 --> 3356.40]  yay in its latest update uber gathers user location information even when the app is not open during a ride
[3356.40 --> 3362.16]  so let's go ahead and make our way through this so in the latest update uh after the update is completed
[3362.16 --> 3367.92]  uber prompts users to accept the new policy by enabling their phones to make the change previously
[3367.92 --> 3373.52]  uber only collected data from the user if the rider had the app open now if a rider calls for an uber and
[3373.52 --> 3378.80]  closes the app uber says it will continue to collect location data up until five minutes after the ride
[3378.80 --> 3384.16]  ends uber says on their website they do this to improve pickups drop-offs consumer service and to
[3384.16 --> 3393.04]  enhance safety wouldn't it improve literally nothing no because what it will tell them is where people
[3393.04 --> 3399.76]  are going and what it will tell them is more accurately but you just verbally tell your driver where
[3399.76 --> 3405.28]  the drop-off point is yes i know so it would only need to track where the car is no but it will tell
[3405.28 --> 3411.36]  them what specific place you are specifically going so you could get dropped off at an intersection
[3411.36 --> 3415.36]  and now uber will know that you were going to get your hair cut at joe's barber why do they need to
[3415.36 --> 3422.00]  how would that help them with drop-off i i'm i'm just saying you you asked like what it would tell
[3422.00 --> 3426.80]  them i said no i meant okay no i meant what it would help them i don't see how it would help them with
[3426.80 --> 3429.92]  these things i don't see how that would help you with drop-off because you probably got dropped off
[3429.92 --> 3432.72]  at the intersection because you just wanted to get out of the car because it'd be easier for you to
[3432.72 --> 3441.60]  get there it could improve the next pickup i mean you already have gps yeah so there's that and if
[3441.60 --> 3446.48]  they tracked you before you got in the car that actually makes sense but then they're going to get
[3446.48 --> 3454.16]  a bunch of positive pr from this the first time someone like gets kidnapped or some crap like within
[3454.16 --> 3459.76]  five minutes after they got dropped off from an uber and uber is able to be like yeah they went this
[3459.76 --> 3466.80]  way except that that seems like it would be a breach of every privacy policy ever but then in the event
[3466.80 --> 3472.32]  of safety being involved but then now they have that information so they could use it any way they want
[3473.76 --> 3480.88]  basically it's a brave new world folks i like gave up my privacy a long time ago once i started being on
[3480.88 --> 3489.04]  camera so much but like if i hadn't i feel like i would just be constantly pissed off from like
[3489.04 --> 3498.56]  nvidia drivers taking telemetry data like what you don't need to know all this junk to like this stuff
[3498.56 --> 3503.44]  like leave me alone all i wanted to do is get a car ride that wasn't terrible like a taxi you don't need
[3503.44 --> 3514.64]  to do this leave me alone canada installing back doors like duh all i know is my back door is uh
[3516.32 --> 3517.60]  basically open at this point
[3520.08 --> 3527.76]  yeah pretty much so thanks for watching the wanshow guys i hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed it
[3527.76 --> 3532.88]  yeah i enjoyed it actually this is kind of a depressing it was a really depressing show this is not like
[3533.44 --> 3540.24]  not my favorite land show let's see if um let's see if the outro works oh it's gonna lag one thing i
[3540.24 --> 3546.48]  know for sure is that my my twitch chat on my laptop is super not working you can see here i mean you're
[3546.48 --> 3555.52]  ending the show so fixing it now is well whatever intro oh beautiful oh it's broken yeah it's broken oh
[3555.52 --> 3567.20]  okay oh oh crap no no we didn't talk about the casey neistat thing we didn't talk about beam okay so uh
[3567.20 --> 3571.60]  so casey neistat sold his name to cnn no no he sold beam he sold the beam app
[3572.48 --> 3576.64]  casey neistat sold and he's there shutting down just got what okay
[3576.64 --> 3583.20]  casey neistat and his beam app just got acquired by cnn for 25 million his beam app was a terrible
[3583.20 --> 3589.04]  idea um he's building a company with cnn but he's building a company that is going to be some type of
[3589.04 --> 3595.76]  news thing yeah um and here's some sponsored links there's people speculating that it's going to be
[3595.76 --> 3602.32]  very much like extremely topical things like this is happening now and you can tune into like live feeds
[3602.32 --> 3608.80]  kind of deal sort of makes sense apparently beam has an 11 person team
[3611.12 --> 3617.68]  wow um hell yeah so the head the global head of cnn digital told the new york times
[3617.68 --> 3624.32]  casey has tapped into nearly six million really powerful viewers most of which do not tune in to
[3624.32 --> 3631.68]  see oh my god the whole chat is like what what is this what is beam wtf is beam like seriously that's
[3631.68 --> 3636.32]  like what the whole chat is apparently it's worth 25 million dollars actually it's not what's worth 25
[3636.32 --> 3642.72]  million dollars is casey neistat so good for him he sold casey neistat for 25 million dollars
[3643.28 --> 3648.32]  um cnn also said to build this audience authentically we need to build something new
[3648.96 --> 3653.92]  um speaking to the verge casey neistat hit on the main challenge that he'll have to overcome is that there is
[3654.56 --> 3659.60]  a tremendous distrust between those six million viewers and traditional media
[3659.60 --> 3665.84]  the project whatever it ends up being is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2017 all i know for
[3665.84 --> 3674.00]  sure is i'm gonna set my watch and i'm gonna wait with bated breath for what for them like the man of
[3674.00 --> 3681.04]  the year months of development for the yeah for the six months of development whoo good luck coding house
[3682.08 --> 3686.80]  dang that's a lot of eyes on you for six months of development time yeah
[3686.80 --> 3689.92]  eat well try to sleep at some point
[3693.92 --> 3700.40]  i mean the guy just got 25 million dollars to sit and work on this thing for presumably like
[3700.96 --> 3706.72]  i would say they've at least locked him up for two years i think i don't know to work on this like i
[3706.72 --> 3713.76]  don't know much about the details of the uh of the agreement there's an article here but i feel bad for
[3713.76 --> 3720.80]  any programmer on that project yeah six months like just man i feel bad for everything about this
[3720.80 --> 3728.88]  project because you know what maybe i don't maybe this will be the one the one mainstream traditional
[3728.88 --> 3737.12]  media acquisition of a new age media property that works out maybe this will be the one time
[3737.12 --> 3746.08]  except that they bought one that wasn't working except for that all right thank you for watching
[3746.08 --> 3750.48]  the wan show we will see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[3750.48 --> 3766.96]  people are like pewdiepie is quitting no he's not he uploaded a video that says he'll delete his channel at 50 million subscribers
[3766.96 --> 3779.84]  watch him just do it everyone's like ltt will be acquired by something you know what time how true that yes
[3779.84 --> 3786.24]  bullet time that's what it is it's on purpose if he did that he would get so much press from doing that
[3786.24 --> 3791.12]  that he could rebuild knowing that subscribers don't actually matter that much and get his views back
[3791.12 --> 3798.56]  insanely fast he made not fast enough he made jets jacksepticeye 2 which was like a troll fake side
[3798.56 --> 3805.12]  channel and got it to like 2.8 million subscribers as a joke with one video that i think he recorded on
[3805.12 --> 3809.60]  his cell phone being like yeah i want another play button so they shipped him another gold play button
[3809.60 --> 3814.24]  for it you know he mentioned it one time in one video and he got like almost three million we even
[3814.24 --> 3818.16]  talked about doing that except we were going to try and get silver play buttons we wanted a hundred
[3818.16 --> 3822.48]  thousand subscribers yeah we figured it would take us a lot he went like way higher than his goal i
[3822.48 --> 3828.16]  guarantee you he could delete his channel get in like every news everywhere recreate and be completely
[3828.16 --> 3832.88]  fine he probably wouldn't even have to recreate it because youtube has tools to restore them it just
[3832.88 --> 3838.56]  like it restores it kind of jankily from at least it did four years ago five years ago whenever i had to do
[3838.56 --> 3839.04]  it yeah
[3842.00 --> 3844.56]  bye he's not gonna do it i'm calling his bluff right now
