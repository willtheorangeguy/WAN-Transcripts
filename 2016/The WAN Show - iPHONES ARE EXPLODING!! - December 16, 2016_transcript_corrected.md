[0.00 → 7.74] Damn it, it looks like I have a hickey, but it's actually just me scratching my neck right
[7.74 → 8.68] before the show started.
[11.20 → 15.40] And on that note, the show has now started.
[15.72 → 18.06] Welcome to the WAN show.
[18.28 → 19.86] Oh, this is awesome.
[20.72 → 23.32] I messaged Brandon about 10 minutes ago.
[23.44 → 24.98] Hey, can I borrow you for a minute?
[24.98 → 29.98] I'm at the WAN show set, and he pokes his head out the door as I'm recording the pre-published
[30.00 → 36.48] pre-show starting bit deal, and thinks that I'm live, and goes back away, and then I
[36.48 → 38.40] messaged him right afterwards when I was done.
[38.46 → 40.34] I'm like, oh, hey, I'm ready for you now.
[40.62 → 42.52] It takes him like eight minutes to see it.
[42.60 → 43.22] Now he comes out.
[43.26 → 44.12] I'm actually live.
[44.56 → 48.00] Brandon, I just wanted you to have a look at the colour temperature of this light.
[48.06 → 48.56] It looks off.
[48.62 → 49.98] It's been on for quite some time.
[50.04 → 50.62] Is it adjustable?
[51.82 → 54.82] It's like, there's like voodoo magic that goes on around here.
[55.10 → 57.16] Adjustable colour temperatures of lights.
[57.16 → 62.66] He's actually kick-started some legitimately colour-changing lights that are going to be
[62.66 → 65.00] like, now you can adjust the white point.
[65.12 → 66.48] You can adjust the colour point.
[66.62 → 71.54] I'm clearly just stalling for time while I wait for this dock to load up on my screen
[71.54 → 73.18] here, but that's okay because it's here now.
[73.46 → 75.48] We've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[75.58 → 78.10] Luke's going to be joining me on the show very, very shortly.
[78.26 → 82.16] He's actually just finishing up a video right behind me there.
[82.16 → 83.92] Yep, he's there.
[84.02 → 86.90] See, trust me, it is the actual Luke.
[87.10 → 87.98] Do I look better now?
[88.18 → 91.84] I'm like really bright now, but that's okay.
[94.08 → 94.76] That's fine.
[94.88 → 95.74] Don't worry about it, Brandon.
[95.88 → 96.48] It's all good.
[96.86 → 98.84] So we've got a lot of great stuff for you guys today.
[99.64 → 101.98] AMD's Ry zen.
[102.64 → 103.84] Did I say it right this time?
[105.14 → 106.90] Ry zen has been detailed.
[107.44 → 110.96] It's going to be outscore, 2.4 gigahertz, dynamic overclocking.
[110.96 → 113.44] We will talk more about that for sure.
[114.00 → 118.60] Amazon's first prime air delivery has taken place.
[119.12 → 125.54] Microsoft is bringing Cortana to fridges, toasters, thermostats, and space marine suits
[125.54 → 126.04] near you.
[126.40 → 129.96] And Creek is sinking.
[130.86 → 132.14] Wages unpaid.
[132.54 → 133.26] Talent leaving.
[134.10 → 135.62] Will there be another crisis?
[135.62 → 140.64] This, I mean, yes, but not with a Y.
[140.96 → 144.46] So let's go ahead and roll the intro, which has no audio.
[144.88 → 146.56] Long story, couldn't get it working.
[146.66 → 150.32] Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[150.32 → 155.56] I'm going to use this time to post to Facebook that we are starting the WAN show.
[155.92 → 158.80] Do, do, do, do, do, do.
[158.80 → 160.04] Only audio on the left channel?
[160.22 → 160.38] Yeah.
[161.14 → 162.06] How does that work?
[162.68 → 164.16] How do these things change?
[164.16 → 166.18] I occasionally get a crackle on the right channel, I would say.
[166.28 → 167.54] So I think it's like an issue with the mic.
[167.74 → 170.00] Who changes these things?
[170.96 → 171.86] Oh, God.
[172.02 → 172.42] Oh, damn.
[173.08 → 173.60] Um.
[175.60 → 177.76] Hold on a second.
[178.80 → 179.48] Wait, what?
[180.40 → 180.70] How?
[180.96 → 181.44] How?
[182.02 → 183.62] How is this even possible?
[184.80 → 187.82] How is anything that...
[187.82 → 189.28] It doesn't even have the...
[189.28 → 190.40] There's like a feature.
[190.40 → 193.98] There's a feature in Split to mix them together.
[194.22 → 194.90] Oh, here we go.
[195.04 → 195.84] Copy left to right.
[195.92 → 196.42] Let's try that.
[196.50 → 197.20] It was on automatic.
[198.22 → 199.02] I don't know.
[199.52 → 200.46] Go try that.
[200.76 → 201.52] Go let me know.
[202.20 → 203.26] Why is life hard?
[204.42 → 206.08] Speaking of life being hard,
[207.08 → 209.40] Squarespace makes it so that your life is not...
[209.48 → 210.38] Not so hard.
[210.76 → 210.98] If...
[210.98 → 214.84] That is to say, if your life is making a website on Squarespace.
[215.52 → 216.78] Also, fixity.
[217.44 → 220.90] Which, again, maybe doesn't make your life easier.
[221.28 → 223.66] But does make your life cheaper.
[224.48 → 224.90] Um.
[225.46 → 227.64] Which maybe came across wrong.
[227.90 → 228.48] But, uh.
[228.96 → 230.00] You save money.
[230.46 → 231.50] So, there you go.
[231.58 → 232.90] You save money on your repairs.
[233.24 → 235.32] So, it's like it's harder to do it yourself.
[236.12 → 238.96] But you don't have to pay someone else to do it.
[239.38 → 242.36] But it's easier than if you didn't have the necessary...
[242.36 → 242.76] You know what?
[242.78 → 243.26] I give up.
[243.34 → 243.90] Let's just...
[243.90 → 246.08] Let's just cancel WAN show this week.
[247.12 → 247.48] Sick?
[247.64 → 247.92] Nope.
[248.02 → 248.62] I can't do it.
[248.68 → 248.88] Nope.
[248.94 → 250.12] Not because I'm sick.
[250.84 → 251.08] No.
[251.16 → 251.98] I meant like...
[251.98 → 253.10] No.
[253.22 → 254.32] We're not cancelling WAN show.
[254.36 → 254.82] I'm back.
[254.96 → 255.42] I'm back.
[256.60 → 257.62] All right.
[259.90 → 261.86] Non-existent human figures.
[262.68 → 267.54] His or her left ear is now more used than his or her right ear.
[267.62 → 268.14] You know what?
[268.14 → 268.78] I...
[268.78 → 272.48] I take no responsibility for any of that.
[272.58 → 273.82] Brendan, I think it looks fine now.
[273.82 → 275.34] Thank you very much for your hard work.
[275.90 → 277.86] Except for that bounce card.
[277.88 → 278.62] That's what I was getting.
[278.82 → 279.58] Oh, okay.
[279.84 → 280.90] Thank you very much.
[280.96 → 282.68] Yes, you may retrieve the bounce card.
[283.60 → 288.36] You know, Brandon and I had a deal.
[288.94 → 292.18] We had a deal when we moved into this warehouse.
[292.18 → 303.52] The deal was that he would get his very own corner of this 6,000 square foot space that
[303.52 → 304.18] I acquired.
[304.82 → 312.02] And if I allocated him that corner, I wouldn't have to deal with all of his crap all over
[312.02 → 312.58] the place.
[313.10 → 314.50] That was the deal.
[314.50 → 320.34] So, that covenant, that covenant, Brandon, has been broken.
[320.52 → 322.24] By you, because he doesn't have his spot yet.
[322.56 → 323.44] He, okay.
[323.66 → 330.84] The only reason he doesn't have his spot is that it has taken him over a year to get
[330.84 → 332.08] the set built in it.
[332.48 → 336.76] He had a budget from before we moved in.
[336.82 → 337.56] I tried, Brandon.
[337.58 → 338.58] To get that done.
[339.06 → 339.82] I did where I could.
[339.82 → 341.54] He just didn't get it done.
[343.18 → 347.62] Also, oh, I have some other things that we just couldn't get done.
[347.76 → 349.02] News for you guys.
[349.48 → 356.50] This one's really exciting and closely related to the audio issues that we had shortly before
[356.50 → 357.72] the show started here.
[358.30 → 359.82] So, Focus rite.
[360.22 → 364.68] I don't know if you're familiar with them, but they make, we actually have one of their
[364.68 → 365.68] doodads here.
[365.68 → 369.30] And the only reason we're not using it is that we've had issues with our compressor
[369.30 → 371.00] and the microphone that we've had hooked up to it.
[371.04 → 374.62] Anyway, Focus rite reached out to us.
[374.70 → 375.64] And this is kind of funny.
[375.72 → 379.82] They reached out about doing a review of some of their gear.
[379.88 → 382.00] And I kind of went, you know what?
[382.00 → 392.02] I don't think that it is going to carry a lot of credibility if I come in and start reviewing
[392.02 → 394.86] like professional audio gear.
[395.66 → 396.06] And they're like, oh.
[396.06 → 397.60] My mic setup is like pretty good.
[397.68 → 397.80] Yeah.
[397.86 → 398.28] You know what?
[398.46 → 398.82] So.
[399.46 → 400.08] Get out of here.
[400.54 → 402.40] You're supposed to be not on the show right now.
[404.00 → 406.72] So, so they're like, oh, why is that?
[406.72 → 413.02] And I go, well, you see, we've got this live show, and we can never get the we can never
[413.02 → 414.14] get the audio working.
[414.58 → 417.26] And it's taken literally years.
[417.54 → 421.60] And they kind of go, oh, well, we could help you with that.
[422.24 → 424.18] And I'm like, well, heck yeah.
[424.62 → 428.80] So the plan right now is for them to come down here next week.
[428.80 → 434.88] And we are going to share with you guys all in one video, everything that we've done to
[434.88 → 438.64] improve WAN show over the last little bit here.
[438.76 → 443.18] So the new capture cards, you've noticed actually for the last couple of months, we haven't had
[443.18 → 444.30] any capture issues.
[445.00 → 449.28] The new lighting setup that we've got, actually the lights themselves didn't change, but it's
[449.28 → 451.96] really quick to set up now, which is pretty freaking cool.
[452.48 → 456.02] We are completely redoing the WAN show computer.
[456.02 → 461.58] So Corsair has given us their new case, and we're going to like do up the WAN show PC.
[461.98 → 471.00] And finally, Focus rite is coming in to, they are actually sending technicians, not just gear.
[471.16 → 473.40] They were like, yeah, we can send you all the gear you want.
[473.48 → 475.38] And I'm like, that's great.
[475.50 → 476.34] We have gear.
[476.54 → 477.84] That's really not the problem.
[477.84 → 485.92] So they are sending us actual texts, either one or two, to come and not just set everything
[485.92 → 489.06] up for us, but actually show us how it all works.
[489.18 → 495.56] So I'm super-duper excited, and it is going to be freaking awesome.
[495.56 → 502.96] And with all these improvements, says John D03, why is the show still late?
[503.34 → 511.40] Well, today the show is late because I had the brilliant idea of not working on the video
[511.40 → 516.96] I was supposed to be working on today, which is a review of the Asus G20, which is freaking
[516.96 → 518.04] awesome so far.
[518.04 → 519.64] I mean, review is not out.
[520.06 → 522.46] Take this as early impressions, okay?
[522.92 → 524.66] So let me just bring this.
[525.16 → 526.56] I thought I had the page up already.
[526.60 → 527.08] Yeah, here it is.
[527.10 → 528.44] Let's go ahead and screen share here.
[529.38 → 531.06] So this puppy right here.
[532.80 → 535.64] So take this as the early impressions that it is.
[535.64 → 537.40] The G20CB.
[538.00 → 539.56] Man, their names suck.
[541.22 → 547.02] But it's tiny, about 10 litres, I think, 9.5 litres.
[548.04 → 551.18] It's got a Core i7-6700 in it.
[551.62 → 559.80] And the model I've got has a GTX 1080 with 512 gigs of SSD storage and one terabyte of
[559.80 → 561.12] hard drive-based storage.
[561.88 → 571.36] And it is unbelievably quiet for all the performance they have managed to pack in that tiny little
[571.36 → 571.88] enclosure.
[572.02 → 573.48] I'm really, really impressed so far.
[573.48 → 578.20] Anyway, so instead of working on that, I was like, you know what would be cool?
[578.76 → 585.44] If I could find a way to get OS X Sierra running on a legitimately powerful laptop.
[585.44 → 589.16] So I was like, I'm going to try and Hackintosh a laptop today.
[589.16 → 592.78] And I ran into a wide variety of problems.
[593.02 → 599.80] Everything from Apple's download server being so slow, it took me an hour to download OS X
[599.80 → 603.22] Sierra on a gigabit connection.
[604.04 → 604.98] So there was that.
[605.52 → 609.26] There was the I'm doing it through Unpaid.
[609.34 → 610.74] I'm actually doing it through a VM.
[610.96 → 611.20] Yeah.
[611.38 → 611.82] Because.
[612.10 → 614.18] Which might actually be easier for you.
[614.18 → 614.58] Yes.
[614.74 → 619.58] So I found a like step-by-step guide, which is pretty much what I need to do any Hackintosh
[619.58 → 619.90] stuff.
[620.02 → 621.94] Because I'm not an experienced mackintoshes.
[622.14 → 626.82] The last time we did a Hackintosh thing, I very closely followed a step-by-step guide
[626.82 → 627.68] and still had problems.
[628.00 → 628.24] Yeah.
[628.48 → 631.98] So what were some of the other problems I had today?
[632.12 → 633.76] I, oh yes, right.
[633.76 → 641.08] So the, the, the guide was based on creating the Sierra installer on Yosemite, I believe,
[641.28 → 643.08] or El Capitan or something like that.
[643.08 → 645.02] So the disk utility has changed.
[645.58 → 648.60] And then I wasn't able to create an image doing a thing.
[648.66 → 652.30] Anyway, I had the original image I created was on a 64 gig USB drive.
[652.70 → 657.14] So, so it was a 64 gig image because I'm an idiot.
[657.60 → 660.22] And like, it was just, it was one of those, I'm in a rush.
[660.22 → 664.94] So I'm doing things that are dumb, and it's not working very well types of days today.
[665.48 → 666.58] Those are always brutal.
[667.18 → 667.54] Yeah.
[667.72 → 669.78] Uh, not that you'd know anything about that today.
[672.42 → 672.82] Yup.
[674.26 → 674.78] I like.
[674.86 → 677.84] If I'm going to be under the bus, I'm pulling you down with me, buddy.
[677.92 → 678.72] Oh, that's fair.
[678.86 → 682.26] I was trying to do a, uh, I'm not going to tell you exactly what it is, but I was trying
[682.26 → 685.62] to do a video on a laptop thing that I was doing.
[685.68 → 689.26] It included a laptop, and I'm going to go back and keep working on it now.
[689.26 → 695.16] But the brightness was so low that trying to record it with a camera showed like crazy
[695.16 → 695.74] flickering.
[696.06 → 700.14] And then I was like, I was the genius who came in and was like, Hey, why don't we just
[700.14 → 701.50] capture it on a separate device?
[702.64 → 703.50] And then.
[704.82 → 707.04] Uh, yeah, it doesn't have an HDMI port.
[707.74 → 710.76] So VGA, I don't think we have a single VGA capture device.
[710.88 → 711.04] All right.
[711.04 → 713.68] So get, get back to, get back to what you're doing.
[713.74 → 714.00] All right.
[714.02 → 714.26] All right.
[714.26 → 714.46] All right.
[714.46 → 722.10] Everybody wants me to talk about AMD Ryzen, which is not the same as the Ry zen from Breaking
[722.10 → 724.04] Bad in that it won't kill you.
[724.60 → 728.96] Um, I am going to start with this.
[729.88 → 731.48] So first, let's go ahead.
[731.56 → 735.48] And HK05 was the original poster on the forum.
[735.48 → 741.46] And the source for the article here was, um, videocards.com.
[741.64 → 743.24] Here's a bunch of information.
[743.84 → 747.50] Um, I'm going to kick off with this.
[748.12 → 750.36] That name is terrible.
[750.36 → 755.42] They might as well have brought back Huron.
[756.30 → 763.54] As far as I'm concerned, nobody is going to pronounce that Ry zen.
[764.92 → 766.00] It's risen.
[766.94 → 767.74] Why are you?
[767.90 → 776.36] And like, why would you even draw attention to something that your fans have been in denial
[776.36 → 778.30] of for so long?
[778.30 → 781.66] Why would you call the product risen?
[782.00 → 784.32] Because let's face it, it is not Ry zen.
[784.48 → 785.30] It is risen.
[785.82 → 787.22] Why would you call it risen?
[787.50 → 791.50] That is an admission that you had fallen somewhere.
[792.32 → 794.78] How many people are going to be disappointed about that?
[794.84 → 800.88] Anyway, from the look of things, there's nothing to be disappointed about spec wise.
[801.52 → 804.18] So we've got, um, here we go.
[804.24 → 806.64] Where's the, uh, information on this page?
[806.64 → 807.12] Here we go.
[808.30 → 811.48] Um, so the key info is here.
[811.48 → 817.92] Um, eight cores, 16 threads, 3.4 gigahertz plus.
[818.42 → 820.28] They've done some comparisons.
[820.62 → 827.44] They've done some demos that lead us to believe it is something similar to Bradwell in terms
[827.44 → 828.44] of the performance per clock.
[828.44 → 835.18] So, um, the performance per clock, which would make this a very compelling CPU if it comes
[835.18 → 836.60] in at the right kind of price.
[836.60 → 840.16] 20 legs of level 2 and level 3 cache.
[840.16 → 841.16] An extended frequency range.
[841.16 → 842.72] An extended frequency range.
[842.72 → 852.34] So, some kind of, uh, turboboost or, like, GPU boost-like technology that will reward users
[852.34 → 854.68] who are cooling the CPU well.
[854.68 → 861.40] Um, fully automated, apparently, with no user intervention required, which is pretty cool.
[861.40 → 864.72] Okay, so a bunch of, uh, caching stuff.
[864.94 → 865.94] DA-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[866.34 → 868.88] Uh, temperature, speed, and voltage monitoring.
[868.88 → 873.90] It adaptively controls all of that stuff in real time for lower power usage.
[874.56 → 875.52] So, that's cool.
[875.84 → 877.60] Fine-grained frequency control boost.
[877.68 → 884.78] I mean, the reality of it is there's not a lot to say about a CPU, um, other than
[884.78 → 887.70] that, like, yes, it's fast, and it's power efficient.
[888.08 → 893.64] So, as long as you've got that stuff nailed down, then, if the price is right, then, uh,
[893.64 → 894.64] you've got my attention.
[895.30 → 896.30] Here we go.
[896.44 → 898.00] The AM4 platform.
[898.00 → 905.92] This, honestly, is more out of date than AMD's existing CPUs from a pure performance standpoint.
[906.52 → 908.96] Um, that, no, sorry, AM4 is not.
[909.22 → 910.74] AM3 Plus was.
[911.06 → 914.62] I mean, it was still PCI Express 2.0 for crying out loud.
[914.82 → 926.84] AMD has been building GPUs designed to work best on an Intel platform for, like, three, four
[926.84 → 927.64] years now?
[927.64 → 930.26] Like, a long, long time.
[930.44 → 934.34] So, finally, AMD is bringing the platform up to date.
[934.52 → 935.56] DDR4.
[936.06 → 938.66] And it looks like we're going to get four slots there.
[938.76 → 941.14] So, dual channel DDR4 by the look of things.
[941.80 → 943.46] PCI Express Gen 3.
[944.30 → 946.20] USB 3.1 Gen 2.
[946.32 → 947.78] So, 10 gigabits USB.
[948.56 → 950.58] NVMe, SATA Express.
[950.58 → 957.32] I guess, uh, AMD didn't get the memo when they were working on AM4 that Santa Express is completely
[957.32 → 958.26] dead in the water.
[958.42 → 959.64] But, that's okay.
[959.74 → 960.26] That's okay.
[960.84 → 965.10] They're still not going to have Intel-exclusive technologies like Thunderbolt.
[965.10 → 965.72] Thunderbolt.
[965.72 → 973.58] But, I mean, this is, um, this is actually almost an entirely separate discussion for WAN Show.
[973.58 → 979.78] Does Thunderbolt matter much?
[979.78 → 992.64] And you can look at, um, you can look at a variety of different indicators that tell us what industry leaders think of Thunderbolt.
[992.64 → 1003.56] So, Apple equipped the latest MacBook Pro with anywhere from two, to on most SKUs, four Thunderbolt 3 ports.
[1004.44 → 1020.52] But, they also did this in a way that, to me, indicates that they don't, they were just trying to give their users the utmost in expandability and flexibility moving forward.
[1020.52 → 1023.34] In terms of what they can plug into those ports.
[1023.44 → 1029.26] Because, they're Type-C ports that support USB 3.1 Gen 2.
[1029.36 → 1030.30] So, that's 10 gigabits.
[1030.82 → 1031.78] Thunderbolt 3.
[1032.00 → 1033.24] So, that's 40 gigabits.
[1033.30 → 1037.22] As well as HDMI, DisplayPort, all that stuff.
[1037.28 → 1040.20] So, the idea was just, like, the ultimate versatility.
[1040.72 → 1043.36] Um, like, simplifying life for the Mac user.
[1043.48 → 1048.34] Just, you plug your power, you plug your display, you plug anything into this and boo pity-bopity-blah.
[1048.40 → 1048.98] It just works.
[1048.98 → 1050.88] Except for one thing.
[1052.32 → 1066.76] Apple, apparently, didn't think the actual Thunderbolt 3 functionality was important enough to bother to have their laptop work with any Thunderbolt 3 devices that are on the market.
[1067.76 → 1070.20] I don't know if you guys have been paying attention to this.
[1070.20 → 1078.00] But, go shop for a Thunderbolt 3 peripheral that's certified to work on the MacBook Pro.
[1078.74 → 1079.76] You won't find one.
[1080.30 → 1086.92] And the reason for that, and I cover this in my MacBook Pro review, which is coming to YouTube, I think, sometime next week.
[1087.42 → 1088.04] Something like that.
[1088.04 → 1089.66] Anyway, my MacBook Pro review is coming.
[1089.66 → 1091.00] But, I cover this.
[1091.32 → 1101.76] And, all the Thunderbolt 3 devices out there right now are running a first-generation Texas Instruments chipset for USB power delivery and all that nonsense.
[1101.76 → 1113.92] And, Apple specifically locked out any devices using that first-generation chipset from working in OS X Sierra on the MacBook Pro.
[1113.92 → 1118.92] So, you can boot camp into Windows.
[1119.62 → 1121.62] And, you can run a Racer Core.
[1122.08 → 1126.18] Or, we've got an Kite external drive enclosure that works just fine.
[1126.44 → 1128.00] You plug it in an OS X.
[1128.56 → 1128.96] Nothing.
[1129.66 → 1131.02] It doesn't even give you an error.
[1131.60 → 1139.26] It's not even like, oh, hey, so, we're a bunch of, like, buttheads, and we decided not to validate for that older controller.
[1139.48 → 1140.80] I suspect there's a reason.
[1140.80 → 1148.46] It might have to do with the because it's a power management, like, it's a power delivery circuit of some sort.
[1148.70 → 1155.04] Like, it manages, it might have something to do with the way that the MacBook charges on any of the ports or something.
[1155.04 → 1164.98] Or, it could have something to do with the fact that I believe it also handles USB connectivity, and it only handles USB 3.1 Gen 1 speeds.
[1165.14 → 1173.42] Like, maybe it was, like, for the most seamless possible experience, everything that works in this port is 10 gigabits USB 3 or, I don't know.
[1173.48 → 1175.00] I'm trying to find a reason for them.
[1175.12 → 1181.24] But, maybe Phil Schiller will post somewhere, he'll talk to The Verge, and he'll say, Linus is an idiot.
[1181.34 → 1182.06] He got it wrong.
[1182.16 → 1184.42] There's a thousand reasons why this makes perfect sense.
[1184.42 → 1188.96] But, it works on Windows, and it doesn't even bother to give you an error message in OS X.
[1188.96 → 1195.78] So, what this means, what I'm coming back to, is Apple apparently thought it was important enough to put on their laptop,
[1196.28 → 1202.28] but didn't think it was important enough for there to actually be any Thunderbolt devices that plug into it.
[1202.54 → 1206.10] For, like, weeks after the launch.
[1206.10 → 1212.50] And, maybe, maybe they weren't wrong.
[1213.30 → 1221.22] Because, I was looking, I was actually trying to find some Thunderbolt 3 docs, because I wanted to do, like, a roundup or something on Amazon.
[1221.64 → 1225.46] And, that was when I realized there was this whole issue, because I couldn't find any.
[1225.46 → 1237.56] And, what I realized was, 99% of anything I could possibly want to do on a laptop, even high-speed external storage, at 10 gigabits.
[1237.92 → 1240.64] I mean, we're talking 1 gigabyte per second.
[1240.64 → 1252.72] There's nothing. 8K red footage doesn't require more than 1 gigabyte per second to a nice, high-performance USB Type-C SSD.
[1253.42 → 1255.46] There's nothing that requires this.
[1255.58 → 1258.84] And, why would you want to plug anything into it that wasn't first-party Macintosh anyway?
[1260.00 → 1262.78] Really? You came onto the show to contribute that.
[1263.72 → 1264.94] Why are you even here?
[1265.66 → 1267.04] Why even bother?
[1267.04 → 1269.46] Bring in the hardcore arguments, okay?
[1270.16 → 1271.02] So, anyway.
[1271.46 → 1272.48] Everything else.
[1272.84 → 1278.50] So, there's my dongle that, it's not in my bag, because I was actually doing something on the MacBook just a minute ago.
[1278.60 → 1284.28] But, I've got a dongle that does SD, micros, HDMI, three USB 3.0s.
[1284.32 → 1285.14] I think it's actually sweet.
[1286.00 → 1286.86] And, power in.
[1287.10 → 1287.56] Pass through.
[1287.92 → 1294.74] And, I'm sitting here going, so that's, like, all the I.O. that I would have already had on, like, a laptop that has I.O.
[1294.94 → 1295.92] Just like that.
[1296.18 → 1296.58] Plus some.
[1296.58 → 1298.14] And, I've got three more.
[1298.40 → 1300.00] Yeah, plus this doesn't even have an SD card reader.
[1300.18 → 1300.64] Or, Ethernet.
[1300.82 → 1301.66] And, I've got three.
[1301.70 → 1301.92] Oh, yeah.
[1301.94 → 1302.70] It has Ethernet, too.
[1302.74 → 1303.62] It's a really cool adapter.
[1303.70 → 1304.52] I'm going to have a video coming.
[1304.58 → 1304.80] Anyway.
[1305.08 → 1310.70] And, I've got three more that I can plug in, like, a Type-C to DisplayPort or a Type-C to another DisplayPort.
[1310.80 → 1310.98] Bam!
[1311.02 → 1312.32] Now, I've got dual external monitor.
[1312.36 → 1313.32] I've still got one more.
[1314.18 → 1318.64] So, what do I actually need Thunderbolt 3 for?
[1318.64 → 1321.78] And, I guess Apple kind of had the same thought.
[1321.78 → 1323.88] It's like, what is this actually for?
[1323.88 → 1334.58] What, 99, I would even say .5% of users are ever going to plug into a MacBook Pro is handled just fine by USB.
[1334.58 → 1343.26] So, bringing it all the way back to AMD's platform not having support for Thunderbolt 3.
[1343.66 → 1345.32] Does that matter?
[1345.32 → 1348.32] It remains to be seen.
[1348.90 → 1355.58] But, I would speculate that it will only affect some very, very niche edge cases.
[1356.16 → 1358.52] And, most people won't care.
[1359.12 → 1364.24] The main one for me on a laptop is support for an external GPU.
[1364.66 → 1366.62] Because, I think that's the future.
[1367.02 → 1370.64] As the price comes down for those external GPU enclosures.
[1370.96 → 1372.86] I mean, Alienware is only a couple of hundred bucks.
[1372.86 → 1374.50] And, they get less screwed up.
[1374.50 → 1375.36] A lot more reasonable.
[1376.18 → 1380.18] And, the intercompatibility gets way better.
[1381.54 → 1386.10] That, to me, is how people are going to game in the future.
[1386.92 → 1388.58] It's just like, we're not there yet.
[1389.02 → 1389.72] In total?
[1390.04 → 1390.28] Yeah.
[1390.42 → 1392.76] You think everyone's going to be on laptops with external GPUs?
[1393.06 → 1399.78] I think, to make a prediction like everyone will do anything, would be shooting myself in the foot.
[1399.84 → 1400.04] Right.
[1400.28 → 1403.26] Because, someone's going to find this clip.
[1403.38 → 1403.56] Yeah.
[1403.94 → 1404.10] Yeah.
[1404.10 → 1407.64] Maybe even not a large percentage of people for a long time.
[1407.70 → 1409.36] Because, you've got to think about the upgrade cycle, right?
[1409.66 → 1414.16] Like, people aren't going to want to just throw out a perfectly functional computer.
[1414.42 → 1423.28] And, the rate at which CPU performance is increasing, there's a lot of very perfectly functional computers that are three, four years old at this point.
[1423.28 → 1431.04] But, I think, and especially looking at Skylike versus Kaby Lake, the performance increase we're seeing, even on the laptop side of things.
[1431.04 → 1439.60] I think people are going to start to think about, gee, this laptop I have is still pretty darn good.
[1439.60 → 1442.08] I just wish I could game on it.
[1442.08 → 1446.00] And, those are going to get cheaper, and they're going to go, this makes a ton of sense.
[1446.00 → 1448.84] And, people are going to start to invest in it.
[1448.84 → 1450.92] And, Ed's doing a lot of gaming on his laptop already.
[1451.16 → 1451.56] Mm-hmm.
[1451.56 → 1457.36] So, it's an interesting, and like, with Blades being able to play, like, pretty much kind of everything.
[1457.64 → 1457.98] Yep.
[1458.10 → 1459.00] It's an interesting idea.
[1459.00 → 1460.64] Alright.
[1460.98 → 1463.32] So, there you guys have it.
[1464.56 → 1465.70] Risen or Risen.
[1466.04 → 1466.46] You know what?
[1466.66 → 1469.20] I am stubbornly calling it the Titan XP forever.
[1469.48 → 1471.88] I think I'm going to stubbornly call it Risen forever.
[1474.18 → 1476.40] I think I'm going to commit to that.
[1476.60 → 1481.58] So, you guys let me know in Twitch chat if you hate that.
[1481.78 → 1484.08] But, I don't think any of you will.
[1484.26 → 1486.66] I think you guys are probably going to be with me on this one.
[1488.10 → 1488.54] Alright.
[1489.00 → 1491.48] What other important topics do we have today?
[1492.32 → 1496.90] The iPhone 6S reportedly explodes post-charging.
[1496.96 → 1500.26] The original article here is from Yahoo.com.
[1500.64 → 1506.08] That is a huge bummer for Nick Light, who just bought my old iPhone 6S off me.
[1506.32 → 1507.24] What a loser.
[1508.48 → 1509.82] And, it's pink.
[1512.04 → 1513.34] Oh, I hate that guy.
[1515.28 → 1516.72] So, what have we got in here?
[1516.72 → 1523.42] Apple announced that it will be releasing an iOS update next week that will allow them to better diagnose any battery issues.
[1523.42 → 1527.76] On December 6th, reports of exploding iPhones surfaced in China.
[1527.76 → 1538.40] We do have to, of course, take this with a grain of salt because there have been cases of exploding iPhones in the past.
[1538.40 → 1542.74] That, and again, I'm making up statistics on the spot.
[1542.74 → 1556.70] But, it seems to me that well over half of them have been caused by unauthorized third-party chargers that were doing a bad job of managing Apple's proprietary battery management algorithm nonsense.
[1556.70 → 1560.70] So, lets kind of keep an eye on this.
[1560.70 → 1574.94] But, allegedly, the Shanghai Consumer Council has received eight separate reports of iPhones exploding, adding that it had seen a big rise in the number of complaints against iPhones in the past two months.
[1574.94 → 1582.70] On Friday, an iPhone 6S started spewing immediately after it was unplugged from charging, then went up in flames.
[1582.82 → 1585.84] I'm assuming smoke is missing from that sentence in my notes.
[1586.54 → 1591.74] Apple blames the problem on ambient air during the manufacturing process.
[1592.14 → 1598.92] Said the problem is limited to a few iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015.
[1598.92 → 1606.68] Hopefully, it's not the pink 128 gig ones.
[1608.00 → 1609.66] Moving on to our next topic.
[1609.76 → 1613.08] This was originally posted by Speed on the forum.
[1613.96 → 1620.16] Facebook is now partnering with fact-checkers to stop fake news.
[1620.38 → 1623.44] The original article here is from The Verge.
[1623.44 → 1630.48] And, basically, they're creating some new tools for reporting hoaxes.
[1631.12 → 1639.90] And, as much as they've denied any responsibility for having any kind of effect on the outcome of the 2016 U.S. election,
[1640.52 → 1647.28] it seems as though, internally at least, they are taking very seriously what others are alleging,
[1647.52 → 1650.08] and that is that they did have an effect.
[1650.08 → 1654.04] So, in a nutshell, here's what they're doing.
[1654.16 → 1660.60] They've got tools that are designed to make it easier to report links shared in the news feed as fake news,
[1660.84 → 1668.14] and they're working with four independent fact-checking organizations to assess the accuracy of viral stories.
[1668.46 → 1673.00] Slopes, Political, ABC News, and FactCheck.org.
[1673.00 → 1682.32] Facebook users who share a story that's been marked as false will be warned that independent fact-checkers have disputed its accuracy.
[1683.18 → 1688.06] Facebook will use a variety of signals to identify stories that are likely to be false.
[1688.48 → 1691.74] So, this includes stories that people post but later delete,
[1691.96 → 1695.56] and also includes lots of comments about them being fake.
[1695.56 → 1699.98] They will use these and other signals to populate a dashboard of dubious stories,
[1700.24 → 1703.60] and fact-checking partners will get access to the dashboard.
[1703.98 → 1709.98] They will then investigate the article's claims and mark it as disputed and link to their own article debunking it.
[1710.32 → 1714.26] If at least two fact-checking organizations mark a story as disputed,
[1714.56 → 1719.00] users will begin seeing a banner under the article if it appears in their news feed.
[1719.16 → 1722.36] And we've got a picture of what that banner would look like.
[1722.36 → 1725.36] So, here we go. Let me just blow that up for you guys.
[1726.02 → 1728.46] Disputed by third-party fact-checkers.
[1730.52 → 1732.06] What else is going on here?
[1732.18 → 1735.28] Yeah, so Facebook's product management lead, Adam Mosseri,
[1735.40 → 1738.84] said they are focusing their efforts on the worst of the worst.
[1739.50 → 1744.32] Clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain.
[1745.28 → 1750.04] They also said they're doing more to eliminate financial incentives behind fake news.
[1750.04 → 1758.18] So, we'll also prevent publishers that use spoof domains like buzzfeedfeed.com or abcnewscom.co
[1758.18 → 1761.12] from buying ads on the platform.
[1762.00 → 1767.64] So, honestly, I don't know how much of an effect this will have.
[1769.38 → 1770.48] You know, the...
[1770.48 → 1771.98] How do I put this?
[1771.98 → 1774.90] I'm trying to stay more apolitical on the show.
[1775.80 → 1781.98] So, certain people seem to be impervious to...
[1783.98 → 1785.28] Here, I'll put it in quotes.
[1785.64 → 1791.12] Facts presented by outlets that they have been convinced somehow
[1791.12 → 1796.06] are out to lie to them about everything.
[1796.06 → 1797.72] And you know what?
[1798.54 → 1801.68] Depending on which way your political leanings go,
[1801.80 → 1803.84] you could interpret that from either side.
[1803.94 → 1805.60] So, I think I've stayed fairly safe here.
[1806.24 → 1813.88] But, basically, it's a well-established phenomenon that's going on right now.
[1814.18 → 1814.78] Phenomenon?
[1814.88 → 1815.66] Yeah, so just one.
[1816.38 → 1821.22] That there are these echo chambers on the right and the left,
[1821.22 → 1825.32] and that no one seems to, even if,
[1825.92 → 1830.02] sort of untrustworthy news source on one side or the other,
[1830.34 → 1832.60] were to say something that was factual,
[1833.14 → 1836.06] there's this inherent distrust that exists.
[1836.50 → 1842.82] So, I sincerely doubt that any kind of warning
[1842.82 → 1846.44] under an article in a newsfeed
[1846.44 → 1849.06] would really do much of anything
[1849.06 → 1853.42] to cause the reader to not believe it.
[1853.92 → 1854.60] And, if anything,
[1854.90 → 1858.74] I think this is just going to create anger towards Facebook
[1858.74 → 1864.52] for being part of the left-wing, liberal, media, dishonest, whatever.
[1865.58 → 1868.12] Or, the other side, as it were,
[1868.30 → 1870.44] if there are fake stories that...
[1871.00 → 1873.10] You know if someone's feed is just full of a bunch of stuff
[1873.10 → 1875.94] that Facebook's flagging as news, or as fake,
[1876.42 → 1878.62] and they trust all these news sources,
[1878.96 → 1882.42] I think it's going to create distrust towards Facebook,
[1882.66 → 1885.66] as opposed to the other way around.
[1885.80 → 1889.58] But, I would love to be wrong about this.
[1891.02 → 1893.26] So, yeah.
[1895.58 → 1896.92] Yeah, got a lot.
[1897.00 → 1897.60] Twitch chat.
[1897.78 → 1899.10] Twitch chat is...
[1899.10 → 1902.96] Wow, Twitch chat is not encouraging me.
[1903.62 → 1905.02] They are basically...
[1905.02 → 1908.24] They're basically going,
[1908.36 → 1910.14] Yep, sounds about right.
[1910.30 → 1912.08] People are going to believe what they want to believe.
[1912.52 → 1913.78] So, there's that.
[1916.00 → 1917.52] Yeah, we've got people saying,
[1917.64 → 1921.58] Hey, if it's worthy of being flagged as clearly fake,
[1921.66 → 1922.74] it should be removed.
[1922.74 → 1925.00] But then, you're going to have,
[1925.14 → 1927.30] you know, the free speech...
[1927.30 → 1929.88] The people who don't quite understand
[1929.88 → 1934.40] the difference between
[1934.40 → 1936.76] the right to free speech
[1936.76 → 1939.20] and the right to say whatever you want
[1939.20 → 1940.78] in a private forum.
[1940.78 → 1942.66] You're going to have those people raising
[1942.66 → 1945.04] heck and all that stuff.
[1945.40 → 1946.84] So, this is a great question.
[1946.92 → 1947.66] What about the onion?
[1947.66 → 1951.34] You know,
[1951.94 → 1953.06] Wow, it's a great question.
[1953.24 → 1954.22] Like, I personally
[1954.22 → 1956.94] probably wouldn't click
[1956.94 → 1959.88] on a satirical news story
[1959.88 → 1962.78] like something that the onion would produce
[1962.78 → 1965.16] if it was flagged as fake news.
[1965.88 → 1968.14] Do they classify satire separately?
[1969.26 → 1971.38] Could fake news outlets
[1971.38 → 1973.48] hide behind satire?
[1974.04 → 1975.46] These are all great questions
[1975.46 → 1976.96] and this is a very...
[1976.96 → 1978.04] This is a very...
[1978.04 → 1979.48] This is very challenging water
[1979.48 → 1980.70] that Facebook is heading into.
[1980.82 → 1982.10] I'm glad they're doing something.
[1983.12 → 1983.52] But,
[1983.66 → 1985.42] I really think
[1985.42 → 1987.50] they're going to have a hard time
[1987.50 → 1988.52] finding a middle ground
[1988.52 → 1989.82] that doesn't irk
[1989.82 → 1991.04] many, many of their users.
[1991.36 → 1992.66] I mean, the good news for Facebook
[1992.66 → 1994.02] is they're in a position of power
[1994.02 → 1995.12] to do something like this.
[1995.48 → 1996.36] Where...
[1996.36 → 1997.46] What else is there?
[1998.08 → 1998.84] They're basically
[1998.84 → 2000.92] a social network monopoly.
[2002.26 → 2002.70] It's like,
[2002.84 → 2004.44] out of a hundred friends,
[2004.44 → 2005.40] you know,
[2005.90 → 2007.32] ten of them might have WhatsApp.
[2007.94 → 2009.96] Three of them might have Google Hangouts.
[2010.92 → 2012.40] Fifteen of them might have Twitter.
[2012.50 → 2013.62] And I'm making up these numbers.
[2013.72 → 2014.86] Don't quote me on these numbers.
[2015.32 → 2015.82] But like,
[2016.22 → 2017.42] 95 of them
[2017.42 → 2019.40] probably have Facebook.
[2019.94 → 2021.90] Even if they don't use it super regularly.
[2022.84 → 2023.58] So there you go.
[2023.62 → 2023.90] It's like,
[2024.08 → 2025.92] it's like the modern white pages.
[2026.84 → 2027.22] It's like,
[2027.42 → 2029.10] you probably are listed on Facebook
[2029.10 → 2030.26] unless you like,
[2030.26 → 2032.10] specifically went out of your way
[2032.10 → 2034.68] to contact the white pages
[2034.68 → 2035.08] and,
[2035.28 → 2036.36] you know,
[2036.48 → 2038.78] get your number removed.
[2039.72 → 2040.84] Basically like that.
[2042.64 → 2043.40] People are like,
[2043.44 → 2044.18] we want Luke.
[2045.54 → 2046.68] They want you, Luke.
[2046.68 → 2048.16] So that's one thing
[2048.16 → 2049.36] I have in common with our viewers.
[2051.00 → 2052.20] You're just going to step in
[2052.20 → 2053.90] and contribute something
[2053.90 → 2055.10] completely worthless
[2055.10 → 2056.46] to my topic once again.
[2056.64 → 2056.82] Yeah.
[2056.96 → 2057.90] What are you talking about right now?
[2057.90 → 2058.44] Is that what you're up to?
[2058.48 → 2059.54] No, I'm not talking about anything.
[2059.54 → 2060.08] What are you talking about right now?
[2060.10 → 2061.14] I'm not talking about anything.
[2061.18 → 2061.70] What is this?
[2061.72 → 2062.14] No, forget it.
[2062.26 → 2062.56] What is this?
[2062.70 → 2063.66] I'm talking about nothing.
[2064.12 → 2065.20] No, I'm not anymore.
[2065.20 → 2066.10] Facebook is the best website.
[2066.10 → 2067.34] Can you not bump the table
[2067.34 → 2068.50] and knock everything over?
[2068.70 → 2070.50] Other than LinusTechTips.com
[2070.50 → 2072.00] that has ever been created.
[2072.88 → 2073.46] The best.
[2073.60 → 2074.14] The best.
[2074.14 → 2075.42] They have the best bites.
[2075.64 → 2076.38] Also, I heard that
[2076.38 → 2078.24] Colonel Morris made Facebook.
[2079.96 → 2080.98] He's the CEO.
[2081.56 → 2082.80] That's why LinusTechTips
[2082.80 → 2083.72] is the only website
[2083.72 → 2084.42] that's better
[2084.42 → 2087.14] because he also basically
[2087.14 → 2087.76] runs LinusTechTips.
[2087.90 → 2088.28] All right.
[2089.00 → 2089.44] Okay.
[2089.88 → 2091.12] So speaking of
[2091.12 → 2092.36] the LinusTechTips website
[2092.36 → 2093.52] being awesome,
[2096.72 → 2097.64] oh, well,
[2097.70 → 2098.20] there's a post
[2098.20 → 2099.14] that I had meant to make
[2099.14 → 2100.62] on LinusTechTips.com
[2100.62 → 2101.14] last night
[2101.14 → 2102.46] and never did.
[2102.46 → 2104.06] So speaking of
[2104.06 → 2104.80] LinusTechTips
[2104.80 → 2105.64] being awesome,
[2106.58 → 2108.04] this is a
[2108.16 → 2110.38] is a
[2110.48 → 2111.70] what's it called?
[2111.82 → 2112.58] Shameless, yes.
[2113.54 → 2115.44] Entirely shameless plug
[2115.44 → 2116.42] for the forum.
[2116.92 → 2117.56] Actually, Luke,
[2117.60 → 2118.18] I do need your help
[2118.18 → 2118.56] for a minute.
[2119.30 → 2120.06] I'm logged into
[2120.06 → 2120.80] my admin account.
[2120.94 → 2121.70] Is there anything
[2121.70 → 2123.22] that I'm looking at
[2123.22 → 2123.76] right now
[2123.76 → 2124.42] that is incriminating?
[2124.42 → 2125.22] Not right now.
[2125.24 → 2125.70] Okay, cool.
[2125.76 → 2126.72] I won't change the page.
[2127.38 → 2128.26] I will not do that.
[2128.34 → 2128.52] Okay.
[2128.66 → 2129.84] Yeah, I'm good.
[2129.90 → 2130.36] I'll be good.
[2130.36 → 2134.14] At some point,
[2134.32 → 2135.10] Luke is just going
[2135.10 → 2135.84] to take away
[2135.84 → 2136.64] my admin account
[2136.64 → 2137.26] on the forum.
[2137.72 → 2139.08] I'm sure that it will happen
[2139.08 → 2140.04] and I'm sure
[2140.04 → 2141.14] that I will deserve
[2141.14 → 2142.74] it to have happened.
[2143.16 → 2144.04] But basically,
[2144.66 → 2145.82] right now,
[2147.26 → 2147.86] exclusively
[2147.86 → 2149.30] for float playing
[2149.30 → 2150.28] club members,
[2151.22 → 2152.28] Nerd Sports
[2152.28 → 2153.82] in its entirety,
[2154.02 → 2154.64] we bought back
[2154.64 → 2155.08] the rights
[2155.08 → 2155.74] when Vessel
[2155.74 → 2156.48] went kaput,
[2157.08 → 2157.84] is up.
[2157.84 → 2159.22] Episodes 1 to 5.
[2159.34 → 2159.88] Volleyball,
[2160.00 → 2160.46] lacrosse,
[2160.56 → 2160.98] dodgeball,
[2161.08 → 2161.32] hockey,
[2161.44 → 2161.90] and curling.
[2162.54 → 2163.54] Watch the Linus
[2163.54 → 2164.64] Media Group crew
[2164.64 → 2165.82] take on
[2165.82 → 2167.62] Hi, guys.
[2167.70 → 2168.36] Thank you for that.
[2168.48 → 2169.64] Actual athletes
[2169.64 → 2171.44] in all of those sports
[2171.44 → 2173.52] on the float playing club.
[2173.64 → 2174.26] So if you guys
[2174.26 → 2174.88] are wondering
[2174.88 → 2175.60] how to join
[2175.60 → 2176.46] the float playing club,
[2176.54 → 2177.64] it is pretty straightforward.
[2177.64 → 2179.02] All you do
[2179.02 → 2179.70] is head over
[2179.70 → 2180.22] to the Linus
[2180.22 → 2181.02] Tech Tips forum.
[2181.40 → 2181.94] We've got
[2181.94 → 2183.14] an item on there
[2183.14 → 2183.80] in the store.
[2184.28 → 2185.30] Ah, my nose is itchy.
[2185.96 → 2186.60] Item on there
[2186.60 → 2186.96] in the store,
[2187.08 → 2187.84] float playing club.
[2188.08 → 2188.66] There you go.
[2189.86 → 2190.50] So you go ahead,
[2190.56 → 2191.32] you buy that item,
[2191.40 → 2192.04] it's a subscription,
[2192.38 → 2193.46] and you get early access
[2193.46 → 2194.50] to LTT videos.
[2194.72 → 2195.26] We're building
[2195.26 → 2196.70] our own streaming platform,
[2196.92 → 2197.86] which Luke has been
[2197.86 → 2199.26] very hard at work on,
[2199.34 → 2199.96] and we've got it
[2199.96 → 2201.36] working up to 1080p streaming
[2201.36 → 2204.00] that users are reporting
[2204.00 → 2204.62] looks better
[2204.62 → 2205.86] than YouTube's 1080p.
[2205.86 → 2207.52] We've even had people
[2207.52 → 2208.16] telling us it looks
[2208.16 → 2209.02] better than their 4K,
[2209.10 → 2209.26] right?
[2209.90 → 2210.14] Yeah.
[2210.18 → 2211.22] And we're not done yet,
[2211.36 → 2211.96] by the way.
[2212.02 → 2212.86] Also, shout out to Eric
[2212.86 → 2214.08] and Cayman and Morris
[2214.08 → 2215.42] and everyone else.
[2215.50 → 2216.34] Shout out to Eric,
[2216.44 → 2217.80] Cat boiler, Morris.
[2217.92 → 2218.14] Cat boiler.
[2218.28 → 2219.42] Yep, that's fine.
[2219.62 → 2220.02] I got it.
[2220.04 → 2220.66] Do you want to take away
[2220.66 → 2221.12] the boiler?
[2221.62 → 2222.64] Yeah, we're trying to get him
[2222.64 → 2223.52] to change his name.
[2223.94 → 2224.76] Like, maybe we should get
[2224.76 → 2226.26] like a change.org thing going.
[2226.56 → 2227.68] Maybe everyone in chat
[2227.68 → 2228.68] suggest a new name
[2228.68 → 2229.10] for Cat boiler.
[2229.10 → 2229.78] Yeah, new names
[2229.78 → 2230.68] for Cat boiler.
[2230.88 → 2231.92] That would be amazing.
[2232.14 → 2233.38] I also try to go to Jake,
[2233.46 → 2234.16] even though he's been
[2234.16 → 2234.92] on the Slack
[2234.92 → 2236.42] in like a few weeks.
[2236.80 → 2237.06] Yeah.
[2237.44 → 2238.96] All right.
[2239.16 → 2239.70] All right.
[2239.76 → 2240.26] Thank you.
[2240.40 → 2240.88] Thank you.
[2240.90 → 2241.58] And everybody else.
[2241.98 → 2242.74] And all the pilots.
[2244.20 → 2244.68] Anyway,
[2245.72 → 2246.66] good news
[2246.66 → 2247.44] for everyone
[2247.44 → 2248.58] who doesn't want to join
[2248.58 → 2249.44] Float plane Club though.
[2249.52 → 2250.62] So while they're all up there
[2250.62 → 2251.66] so you can binge-watch,
[2252.06 → 2254.10] you can also check them out
[2254.10 → 2254.86] on YouTube
[2254.86 → 2255.58] on the channel
[2255.58 → 2256.66] Super Fun channel
[2256.66 → 2258.46] starting this weekend.
[2258.46 → 2259.96] So we're going to be releasing
[2259.96 → 2261.52] them one per weekend
[2261.52 → 2262.98] for the next five weeks
[2262.98 → 2265.48] and everyone will have access
[2265.48 → 2267.92] to Nerd Sports.
[2268.38 → 2269.82] So we're really excited
[2269.82 → 2271.82] to get that going.
[2272.40 → 2273.00] Wow.
[2273.12 → 2274.26] Most of these suggestions
[2274.26 → 2275.24] from Twitch chat
[2275.24 → 2276.02] are terrible.
[2277.02 → 2278.80] Like, beyond terrible.
[2279.80 → 2280.80] By the way,
[2280.84 → 2281.48] I need to do a thing.
[2281.48 → 2282.54] Cat Grille,
[2282.98 → 2283.80] Kitty Boiler,
[2284.26 → 2285.08] Dog Roaster,
[2285.32 → 2286.26] Cat Vagina,
[2286.54 → 2287.42] Dog Freezer,
[2287.56 → 2288.52] Cow Wanker.
[2288.92 → 2289.94] None of those are better.
[2290.02 → 2290.92] Yeah, none of those are
[2290.92 → 2291.76] Cat Diddler,
[2292.26 → 2293.92] Pussy Grabber,
[2293.92 → 2298.04] Yeah, Cat Broiler.
[2299.22 → 2300.06] Slightly different.
[2302.66 → 2303.48] Oh, okay.
[2303.62 → 2304.24] Oh, okay.
[2304.34 → 2304.76] Hold on.
[2305.08 → 2305.50] Hold on.
[2305.60 → 2306.12] We got to take
[2306.12 → 2307.54] a short break here
[2307.54 → 2308.58] while Luke records
[2308.58 → 2309.34] part of his video.
[2309.78 → 2310.60] And what I want you guys
[2310.60 → 2311.14] doing now,
[2311.24 → 2312.38] because all of your suggestions
[2312.38 → 2313.34] for Cat Boiler's name
[2313.34 → 2313.90] are awful,
[2314.10 → 2314.48] they're bad,
[2314.54 → 2315.32] you should feel bad,
[2315.78 → 2316.78] is I want you guys
[2316.78 → 2317.88] to try and figure out
[2317.88 → 2319.70] what video Luke is filming.
[2320.32 → 2321.82] So I'm just going to be quiet
[2321.82 → 2322.68] for a moment here.
[2323.92 → 2324.72] Ready?
[2337.28 → 2338.22] Restarting the computer
[2338.22 → 2339.42] took forever.
[2339.88 → 2341.32] Two minutes and 13 seconds
[2341.32 → 2341.98] to be exact.
[2342.14 → 2343.64] Go from clicking the restart button
[2343.64 → 2345.26] to having Firefox up
[2345.26 → 2347.04] on the Linus Peck Tips page.
[2347.34 → 2348.06] And it didn't really get
[2348.06 → 2348.96] much better from there.
[2349.26 → 2350.46] Loading Fox it
[2350.46 → 2352.08] took a very long time
[2352.08 → 2352.92] to the point where I was
[2352.92 → 2353.76] worried that it wasn't
[2353.76 → 2354.64] in the function at all.
[2355.00 → 2355.42] Steam,
[2355.50 → 2357.90] I was actually 100% convinced
[2357.90 → 2358.52] of the use of it.
[2359.62 → 2360.94] Failing all the Lashed list.
[2364.52 → 2365.42] Restarting the computer
[2365.42 → 2366.56] took forever.
[2366.90 → 2368.06] From pressing the restart button
[2368.06 → 2369.66] to having Firefox loaded
[2369.66 → 2370.42] with the Linus Peck
[2370.42 → 2371.58] homepage on it
[2371.58 → 2372.50] took two minutes
[2372.50 → 2373.48] and 13 seconds.
[2373.48 → 2375.52] I could also go all ASMR
[2375.52 → 2376.38] on this.
[2376.84 → 2378.14] Maybe we'll do the whole
[2378.14 → 2379.56] next topic like this.
[2379.56 → 2381.70] Okay.
[2383.32 → 2384.56] Creek is sinking.
[2385.36 → 2386.58] Wage is unpaid.
[2387.00 → 2388.12] Talent leaving.
[2389.54 → 2390.80] So the original poster
[2390.80 → 2391.64] for this was
[2391.64 → 2393.22] PatrickJP93
[2393.96 → 2394.82] on the forum.
[2395.64 → 2397.12] Now there have been rumours
[2397.12 → 2398.14] swirling around
[2398.14 → 2398.86] Creek,
[2399.26 → 2400.62] makers of Far Cry,
[2400.84 → 2401.38] Crisis,
[2401.72 → 2402.44] Crisis 2,
[2402.68 → 2403.42] Crisis 3,
[2403.76 → 2404.96] and Cry Engine.
[2404.96 → 2406.12] I'm pretty sure
[2406.12 → 2407.06] they did other things too
[2407.06 → 2408.06] but there's at least
[2408.06 → 2408.96] that going for them
[2408.96 → 2410.50] about there being
[2410.50 → 2411.32] all kinds of
[2411.32 → 2412.08] instability,
[2412.44 → 2413.32] wages unpaid
[2413.32 → 2414.36] but they've denied it
[2414.36 → 2415.08] and denied it
[2415.08 → 2415.92] and denied it
[2415.92 → 2418.58] and things had actually
[2418.58 → 2420.16] returned to stability
[2420.16 → 2421.12] until,
[2421.30 → 2422.08] I'm talking about
[2422.08 → 2422.64] something else.
[2422.70 → 2423.24] Get out of here.
[2423.62 → 2423.72] What?
[2423.90 → 2424.78] So things had been
[2424.78 → 2426.00] financially stable
[2426.00 → 2426.62] at Creek
[2426.62 → 2428.48] until June of this year.
[2429.12 → 2430.22] Around that time,
[2430.38 → 2431.62] Creek's Frankfurt office
[2431.62 → 2432.58] discovered that they
[2432.58 → 2433.40] weren't going to be
[2433.40 → 2434.40] paid on time.
[2434.52 → 2435.10] The upper management
[2435.10 → 2436.32] ensured employees
[2436.32 → 2437.38] that all financial
[2437.38 → 2438.08] problems would be
[2438.08 → 2440.16] worked out by August 2016
[2440.16 → 2440.84] and that there would
[2440.84 → 2441.54] be enough money
[2441.54 → 2442.38] to remain stable
[2442.38 → 2443.96] for at least 18 months.
[2444.60 → 2446.00] Payroll was two weeks
[2446.00 → 2447.36] late for July and August.
[2447.78 → 2448.48] September came
[2448.48 → 2449.38] and payroll was
[2449.38 → 2450.92] five weeks late.
[2451.66 → 2452.50] Wages for October
[2452.50 → 2453.04] and November
[2453.04 → 2454.22] have yet to be paid.
[2455.50 → 2456.60] December's pay is due
[2456.60 → 2458.30] in about three weeks time.
[2458.94 → 2459.90] Kit Guru reports
[2459.90 → 2461.04] that their source says
[2461.04 → 2461.68] there has been
[2461.68 → 2462.62] no indication
[2462.62 → 2463.94] of financial issues
[2463.94 → 2465.62] until June of this year,
[2466.62 → 2467.54] but those still
[2467.54 → 2468.40] at the Frankfurt office
[2468.40 → 2468.90] have submitted
[2468.90 → 2469.82] a legal letter
[2469.82 → 2470.68] to management
[2470.68 → 2471.62] informing them
[2471.62 → 2472.24] that if wages
[2472.24 → 2472.86] for October,
[2472.98 → 2473.26] November,
[2473.32 → 2473.70] and December
[2473.70 → 2474.72] aren't paid in full
[2474.72 → 2475.74] by the end of next week,
[2475.82 → 2477.14] they will stop working.
[2477.92 → 2479.50] Those at the Budapest studio
[2479.50 → 2480.16] have apparently
[2480.16 → 2481.12] already stopped
[2481.12 → 2482.04] turning up to work.
[2482.22 → 2483.02] The company has
[2483.02 → 2484.82] about 700 employees,
[2485.10 → 2486.28] though it's hard
[2486.28 → 2487.30] to say if they actually
[2487.30 → 2489.00] have those employees
[2489.00 → 2490.66] if they aren't paying them.
[2490.66 → 2492.18] If I stopped
[2492.18 → 2492.86] paying you guys,
[2492.90 → 2493.90] would I still, have you?
[2496.06 → 2497.60] You guys couldn't pay?
[2497.76 → 2497.98] I mean,
[2498.10 → 2500.06] you didn't make me late.
[2500.08 → 2500.58] Thanks for that,
[2500.64 → 2500.94] Burke.
[2502.38 → 2502.62] I mean,
[2502.66 → 2503.60] when I first worked for you,
[2503.68 → 2505.04] it was below minimum wage.
[2505.04 → 2509.48] That wasn't for Linus Media Group.
[2509.74 → 2510.76] Linus Media Group
[2510.76 → 2511.98] accepts no responsibility
[2511.98 → 2512.80] for any of that.
[2516.14 → 2516.98] All right.
[2517.38 → 2517.86] Oh,
[2518.24 → 2518.78] sponsors.
[2519.02 → 2519.94] I got to talk sponsors
[2519.94 → 2520.44] right now.
[2520.56 → 2521.00] Squarespace.
[2521.84 → 2524.00] Squarespace is the place to go
[2524.00 → 2525.42] if you think
[2525.42 → 2527.16] that websites are places.
[2528.22 → 2529.90] Can a website be a place?
[2530.14 → 2530.58] Sort of.
[2530.58 → 2530.92] Okay.
[2532.18 → 2532.26] So,
[2532.42 → 2532.84] webspace,
[2533.00 → 2533.62] webspace,
[2533.74 → 2534.32] webspace,
[2534.44 → 2534.86] Squarespace
[2534.86 → 2536.26] is the place to go
[2536.26 → 2536.86] on the internet
[2536.86 → 2538.42] if you want to build yourself
[2538.42 → 2540.28] a fantastic looking website
[2540.28 → 2542.30] and do it on the cheap,
[2542.48 → 2543.42] on the easy,
[2543.66 → 2545.48] and on the fast.
[2545.58 → 2545.76] Yes,
[2545.84 → 2546.36] my friends,
[2546.74 → 2547.10] cheap,
[2547.34 → 2547.66] fast,
[2547.76 → 2548.58] and easy.
[2548.90 → 2550.24] Those are definitely
[2550.24 → 2551.78] not the talking points
[2551.78 → 2554.16] that are in my document here,
[2554.28 → 2555.30] but that's okay.
[2555.52 → 2556.88] Sometimes I go off script
[2556.88 → 2557.96] and sometimes
[2557.96 → 2559.60] I don't get fired.
[2559.60 → 2561.40] Squarespace lets you pick
[2561.40 → 2562.36] from any one of their
[2562.36 → 2563.30] beautiful templates,
[2563.80 → 2565.54] basically plunk in some text
[2565.54 → 2566.38] and some images,
[2566.92 → 2567.94] rearrange some stuff.
[2568.02 → 2568.74] It's all done through
[2568.74 → 2570.14] like a cloud web interface.
[2570.78 → 2572.74] You can set up a store.
[2573.12 → 2573.70] You can set up
[2573.70 → 2575.64] like a one-page presence
[2575.64 → 2577.04] in like a matter of minutes.
[2577.20 → 2578.36] Which is your favourite way
[2578.36 → 2578.92] to do it.
[2578.94 → 2579.74] Logo designer?
[2579.84 → 2579.94] No,
[2579.98 → 2580.80] it's actually not.
[2580.88 → 2582.10] My point is that you can.
[2582.10 → 2582.78] You should tweet him.
[2582.78 → 2583.88] Not that you should.
[2584.04 → 2585.14] Atlantis G. Sebastian.
[2585.82 → 2587.00] So his personal account.
[2587.10 → 2587.66] You should flood
[2587.66 → 2588.78] his personal account.
[2588.78 → 2589.94] Why are you doing this to me?
[2589.94 → 2591.18] With one-page websites
[2591.18 → 2592.34] that you think
[2592.34 → 2593.38] are just the best.
[2594.26 → 2594.84] The greatest.
[2594.84 → 2595.16] It'll basically be
[2595.16 → 2595.86] like his birthday.
[2596.18 → 2596.72] The greatest.
[2597.30 → 2597.52] Yeah.
[2598.14 → 2599.00] The best websites.
[2599.20 → 2600.40] You have actually
[2600.40 → 2601.28] contributed
[2601.28 → 2602.72] like
[2602.72 → 2605.40] in a below zero manner
[2605.40 → 2608.40] to the quality of today's show.
[2608.52 → 2609.12] Speaking of which.
[2609.22 → 2610.06] And this is a show
[2610.06 → 2611.14] that had no audio
[2611.14 → 2611.84] in the intro
[2611.84 → 2613.92] and audio only
[2613.92 → 2614.72] in the left channel
[2614.72 → 2615.92] for the first four minutes.
[2616.50 → 2617.20] Speaking of which.
[2617.28 → 2618.68] That is where you're at today.
[2618.80 → 2619.42] I think you should do
[2619.42 → 2620.38] the rest of the sponsor spots
[2620.38 → 2620.76] ASMR.
[2621.34 → 2622.38] No, you can't
[2622.38 → 2623.06] because then that would
[2623.06 → 2623.98] bring up my audio tube
[2623.98 → 2624.60] and that would suck.
[2624.74 → 2624.92] Okay.
[2625.12 → 2625.56] I'm waiting.
[2625.70 → 2626.86] I have to do a pickup thing.
[2626.96 → 2627.46] But it's cool.
[2627.60 → 2627.78] Okay.
[2627.84 → 2628.54] I'm here now.
[2628.54 → 2629.56] So Squarespace
[2629.56 → 2630.42] You've got me.
[2631.10 → 2633.18] is available to anyone
[2633.18 → 2634.38] who wants to spend
[2634.38 → 2635.30] a few bucks a month
[2635.30 → 2635.56] Anybody.
[2635.88 → 2637.44] and have a great website
[2637.44 → 2639.56] and it's got responses designed
[2639.56 → 2641.18] so it works on your phone
[2641.18 → 2642.08] Your tablet.
[2642.24 → 2643.20] and on your laptop.
[2643.46 → 2643.90] Consoles.
[2644.08 → 2644.66] and on your
[2644.66 → 2645.30] yeah I guess
[2645.30 → 2646.04] PCs.
[2646.34 → 2647.20] There's no reason it wouldn't.
[2647.28 → 2648.64] Probably a Nintendo DS.
[2649.38 → 2650.40] So when you sign up
[2650.40 → 2651.04] for Squarespace
[2651.04 → 2651.90] make sure to use
[2651.90 → 2652.72] offer code WAN
[2652.72 → 2653.80] to get 10% off
[2653.80 → 2654.70] your first purchase
[2654.70 → 2656.86] and if all of you do it
[2656.86 → 2658.32] right now
[2658.32 → 2660.16] after watching
[2660.16 → 2661.68] this sponsorship spot
[2661.68 → 2662.90] then maybe
[2662.90 → 2664.32] you won't have to listen
[2664.32 → 2666.00] to these Squarespace spots
[2666.00 → 2666.78] ever again
[2666.78 → 2667.92] because
[2667.92 → 2669.26] whenever we do them
[2669.26 → 2669.84] in the future
[2669.84 → 2671.14] no new people
[2671.14 → 2671.84] will sign up
[2671.84 → 2673.04] because everyone
[2673.04 → 2673.76] in our audience
[2673.76 → 2674.68] will already have
[2674.68 → 2675.60] a Squarespace website.
[2676.16 → 2676.88] Think about that
[2676.88 → 2677.42] for a moment
[2677.42 → 2678.64] and go sign up
[2678.64 → 2679.82] for Squarespace today.
[2680.70 → 2681.62] It's a trick.
[2682.20 → 2682.74] I got you.
[2682.98 → 2683.52] I got you.
[2684.08 → 2684.86] That's actually
[2684.86 → 2685.72] how that would work though.
[2687.12 → 2688.02] It's like yeah
[2688.02 → 2688.54] Linus
[2688.54 → 2689.52] you know
[2689.52 → 2690.44] I mean it's great
[2690.44 → 2691.20] you had one
[2691.20 → 2692.64] perfect day
[2692.64 → 2693.70] and now we're just
[2693.70 → 2694.94] not going to pay you anymore
[2694.94 → 2696.48] because you're clearly done.
[2696.80 → 2698.12] Everyone on earth
[2698.12 → 2700.02] has a Squarespace website now
[2700.02 → 2701.54] so the gig's up.
[2701.70 → 2702.26] It's over.
[2702.26 → 2702.58] There's no more advertising
[2702.58 → 2703.08] to be done.
[2703.08 → 2704.14] All right.
[2704.58 → 2706.98] Let's move on to fixity.
[2707.10 → 2708.48] iFixit.com
[2708.48 → 2709.78] is the place to go
[2709.78 → 2711.36] if you want to repair
[2711.36 → 2712.56] your electronics.
[2713.02 → 2714.12] Phones, tablets,
[2714.38 → 2715.10] all-in-ones,
[2715.34 → 2716.16] monitors even.
[2716.26 → 2717.62] They've got all kinds
[2717.62 → 2718.86] of amazing
[2718.86 → 2720.64] quality guides
[2720.64 → 2722.56] for how to fix your stuff
[2722.56 → 2723.74] getting more life
[2723.74 → 2724.18] out of it
[2724.18 → 2725.06] instead of paying
[2725.06 → 2726.26] someone else to fix it
[2726.26 → 2728.04] or getting rid of it.
[2728.04 → 2730.16] And they've got the all-new
[2730.16 → 2732.72] fixity Essential Electronics Toolkit
[2732.72 → 2735.10] which my personal Anna over here
[2735.10 → 2736.48] is showing you guys.
[2736.64 → 2738.38] It doesn't have all the stuff
[2738.38 → 2740.16] that their Protect Toolkit does
[2740.16 → 2741.06] which I love.
[2741.12 → 2741.52] By the way,
[2741.56 → 2742.72] I love Protect Toolkit.
[2743.06 → 2744.54] It doesn't have as many bits.
[2744.74 → 2746.44] It doesn't have as many pry tools.
[2746.44 → 2747.82] It doesn't have as many,
[2748.32 → 2748.56] you know,
[2748.92 → 2751.26] it doesn't have the new screwdriver
[2751.26 → 2752.82] which really is a lot better
[2752.82 → 2753.80] than the old screwdriver
[2753.80 → 2754.72] though the old ones,
[2754.80 → 2755.64] like it's not terrible.
[2755.80 → 2756.46] It's just the new one
[2756.46 → 2757.28] really is a lot better.
[2757.76 → 2760.50] But it is a lot cheaper.
[2760.76 → 2762.82] It only costs 20 bucks
[2762.82 → 2765.26] and with offer code WINSLOW
[2765.26 → 2766.84] you can save five bucks
[2766.84 → 2768.58] off a purchase of $10 or more.
[2768.76 → 2770.22] So you can get this puppy
[2770.22 → 2772.42] for 15 bucks plus shipping
[2772.42 → 2774.96] and you can start saving money
[2774.96 → 2777.30] and repairing your old stuff today.
[2777.54 → 2779.84] It's got really most of the basics
[2779.84 → 2780.62] that you'll need.
[2780.74 → 2781.46] So your slot,
[2781.86 → 2784.20] your Torres
[2784.20 → 2785.52] and your security Torres.
[2785.96 → 2787.60] It's got your stars.
[2788.14 → 2789.28] So those can come in handy.
[2789.78 → 2790.16] It's got a
[2790.26 → 2790.42] yeah,
[2790.50 → 2791.16] it's got one of the
[2791.24 → 2791.76] they're prying,
[2791.86 → 2792.54] actually a handful
[2792.54 → 2793.64] of their prying guitar picks.
[2793.74 → 2795.10] It's got their suction cup.
[2795.42 → 2797.18] That's great for removing displays
[2797.18 → 2800.04] from some more stubborn modern phones.
[2800.58 → 2800.82] Really,
[2801.06 → 2802.96] oh and it's got their ESD safe tweezers.
[2803.24 → 2804.60] The only one that I ever use.
[2804.96 → 2805.86] Really like that one.
[2806.24 → 2807.32] So pick one up.
[2807.50 → 2808.42] You won't regret it.
[2808.62 → 2810.00] It actually costs less
[2810.00 → 2811.40] than dropping your phone off
[2811.40 → 2811.92] in a shop
[2811.92 → 2812.68] and having someone
[2812.68 → 2814.02] replace your battery for you
[2814.02 → 2815.68] to just get your own set of tools.
[2815.84 → 2816.56] And pro tip,
[2816.82 → 2818.10] with our offer code,
[2818.40 → 2819.28] which works if you spend
[2819.28 → 2819.96] at least $10.
[2820.92 → 2821.62] 20 I think.
[2821.84 → 2822.22] $20?
[2822.44 → 2822.62] 10?
[2822.70 → 2822.86] No,
[2822.90 → 2823.08] 10,
[2823.16 → 2823.26] yeah.
[2823.34 → 2824.02] This is $20.
[2824.46 → 2825.74] If you spend at least $10,
[2826.22 → 2827.18] you get $5 off.
[2827.42 → 2828.90] So this is essentially $15.
[2829.22 → 2829.90] Are you being useless
[2829.90 → 2830.70] on purpose today?
[2831.16 → 2831.94] How is that useless?
[2831.94 → 2833.26] I just said that.
[2834.54 → 2835.66] You didn't realize,
[2835.76 → 2836.08] did you?
[2838.40 → 2843.48] I fix the kits.
[2845.04 → 2846.34] Discounted with our offer code.
[2846.34 → 2846.94] No way.
[2848.72 → 2850.28] I can do this better myself.
[2850.52 → 2851.68] Is there another sponsored spot?
[2851.84 → 2852.26] No.
[2852.46 → 2852.74] Okay,
[2852.98 → 2854.34] I need you to ASMR.
[2854.48 → 2854.84] Fine.
[2855.56 → 2856.56] You have to get real close up.
[2856.76 → 2857.08] Hey,
[2857.16 → 2858.52] I found a guitar pick.
[2858.58 → 2858.98] Here's a present.
[2859.50 → 2860.12] Thank you.
[2860.18 → 2860.58] No problem.
[2861.22 → 2862.06] I'm here for you.
[2863.22 → 2864.94] Western Digital is announcing
[2864.94 → 2867.76] high capacity 12 terabyte
[2867.76 → 2871.50] and 14 terabytes helium-filled hard drives.
[2871.66 → 2873.20] The original article here
[2873.20 → 2875.24] is extremetech.com.
[2876.50 → 2876.86] And,
[2877.06 → 2877.28] oh,
[2877.42 → 2879.20] I am not in the corner of that anymore,
[2879.38 → 2881.08] but don't worry about it.
[2881.22 → 2882.44] This ad's going to go away.
[2882.88 → 2884.66] Pretty freaking fantastic.
[2884.84 → 2885.52] So,
[2885.64 → 2886.54] the 12 terabyte
[2886.54 → 2887.20] is an
[2887.20 → 2888.74] eight freaking
[2888.74 → 2889.96] platter design.
[2890.36 → 2891.98] Eight platters in there.
[2892.24 → 2893.92] And the 14 terabyte
[2893.92 → 2895.20] is a
[2895.20 → 2896.10] shingled magnetic
[2896.10 → 2897.22] recording design.
[2897.58 → 2897.94] So,
[2898.02 → 2898.86] the 12 terabyte
[2898.86 → 2899.70] is gonna actually
[2899.70 → 2901.38] perform significantly better.
[2902.32 → 2903.00] But,
[2903.12 → 2903.30] like,
[2903.66 → 2904.76] holy crap.
[2905.16 → 2906.46] I have spent some time
[2906.46 → 2907.28] with Seagate's
[2907.28 → 2908.12] archive drives,
[2908.32 → 2909.22] which are also
[2909.22 → 2910.00] shingled magnetic
[2910.00 → 2910.92] recording drives,
[2911.12 → 2911.94] and they're,
[2912.06 → 2912.26] like,
[2912.26 → 2914.52] actually not that bad
[2914.52 → 2915.84] for archival use.
[2916.58 → 2916.94] And,
[2917.16 → 2919.18] 14 terabytes
[2919.18 → 2920.04] per disc
[2920.04 → 2921.36] would mean that
[2921.36 → 2922.40] in something like,
[2922.46 → 2922.84] um,
[2923.58 → 2923.80] a
[2923.80 → 2925.00] Coordinator 60,
[2925.00 → 2925.80] I mean,
[2925.84 → 2926.32] what does that
[2926.32 → 2927.06] freaking math
[2927.06 → 2927.74] work out to?
[2928.24 → 2929.36] You'd be able to put,
[2929.46 → 2929.62] so,
[2929.74 → 2930.66] 60 drives,
[2930.86 → 2931.70] 60 drives,
[2931.78 → 2932.30] you'd be able to put
[2932.30 → 2933.28] 60 terabytes
[2933.28 → 2934.08] plus another
[2934.08 → 2935.98] 40% of that.
[2936.46 → 2936.92] So,
[2937.02 → 2937.70] that would be another
[2937.70 → 2938.26] 12.
[2938.26 → 2939.06] so you'd be able to put
[2939.06 → 2940.96] 72 freaking terabytes
[2940.96 → 2942.54] in a single
[2942.54 → 2943.20] Coordinator
[2943.20 → 2944.48] XL60.
[2946.20 → 2946.56] Was!
[2947.24 → 2947.76] Unreal.
[2949.44 → 2950.14] I mean,
[2950.26 → 2951.50] never mind it being
[2951.50 → 2953.10] absolutely terrifying
[2953.10 → 2954.48] that if one of your
[2954.48 → 2955.52] drives dies,
[2955.62 → 2955.80] like,
[2955.86 → 2956.50] if you were actually
[2956.50 → 2957.34] using these in a
[2957.34 → 2957.66] desktop,
[2958.26 → 2959.12] that you could lose
[2959.12 → 2960.12] anywhere from 12
[2960.12 → 2961.34] to 14 terabytes
[2961.34 → 2961.78] of data,
[2961.88 → 2962.10] but,
[2962.18 → 2962.42] uh,
[2963.02 → 2963.58] of course,
[2963.64 → 2964.68] that's just the usual
[2964.68 → 2965.96] very strong argument
[2965.96 → 2967.40] for not just
[2967.40 → 2968.16] redundancy,
[2968.62 → 2969.80] but backups.
[2970.40 → 2970.80] So,
[2971.00 → 2971.96] there you go.
[2973.08 → 2973.76] Um,
[2975.20 → 2975.56] yeah,
[2975.62 → 2976.28] I guess that's
[2976.28 → 2976.96] pretty much all
[2976.96 → 2977.52] there is to say
[2977.52 → 2978.10] about that.
[2979.46 → 2980.50] Amazon's first
[2980.50 → 2981.48] prime air,
[2981.54 → 2982.30] can I talk louder?
[2983.94 → 2984.90] Amazon's first
[2984.90 → 2986.76] prime air delivery
[2986.76 → 2988.58] has happened.
[2989.00 → 2989.72] It's official.
[2989.84 → 2990.62] It was posted by
[2990.62 → 2991.48] Pig Hammer
[2991.48 → 2992.20] on the forum.
[2992.60 → 2993.38] The original article
[2993.38 → 2994.08] here is from
[2994.08 → 2995.56] kitguru.net,
[2996.08 → 2997.26] and here,
[2997.40 → 2998.30] it is.
[2998.64 → 2999.38] It happened
[2999.38 → 3001.06] December 7th,
[3001.12 → 3001.82] 2016.
[3002.78 → 3003.64] Fully autonomous.
[3003.84 → 3004.08] Hold on,
[3004.12 → 3004.66] let me mute that
[3004.66 → 3005.22] volume there.
[3005.28 → 3005.76] It's a two-minute
[3005.76 → 3006.06] video,
[3006.14 → 3006.56] so we're not gonna
[3006.56 → 3007.08] watch the whole
[3007.08 → 3007.42] thing,
[3007.54 → 3007.70] but,
[3007.78 → 3008.14] like,
[3008.98 → 3009.28] blah,
[3009.34 → 3009.46] blah,
[3009.52 → 3009.74] blah,
[3009.86 → 3010.28] there's some
[3010.28 → 3010.78] footage,
[3011.12 → 3011.30] blah,
[3011.36 → 3011.48] blah,
[3011.54 → 3011.80] blah,
[3011.80 → 3011.94] blah,
[3012.04 → 3012.30] something,
[3012.44 → 3012.78] something,
[3012.92 → 3013.52] fire TV.
[3013.66 → 3014.00] Of course,
[3014.08 → 3014.56] they ordered a
[3014.56 → 3015.22] fire TV,
[3016.10 → 3016.72] because they
[3016.72 → 3017.22] wanted one of
[3017.22 → 3017.60] those,
[3017.80 → 3018.36] and there's a
[3018.36 → 3018.74] drone,
[3019.14 → 3019.48] and there's
[3019.48 → 3019.90] presumably
[3019.90 → 3020.62] another drone
[3020.62 → 3021.50] taking videos
[3021.50 → 3022.02] of the drone,
[3022.12 → 3022.50] the drone
[3022.50 → 3023.18] while you drone,
[3023.36 → 3023.96] so you can drone
[3023.96 → 3024.58] while you drone.
[3025.22 → 3025.70] Fulfilled.
[3025.70 → 3026.54] There it is in the
[3026.54 → 3026.68] yard.
[3026.80 → 3027.10] Wow.
[3029.24 → 3030.12] Freaking future,
[3030.26 → 3030.58] man.
[3031.40 → 3032.24] Freaking future.
[3033.12 → 3033.64] I am,
[3033.72 → 3033.96] like,
[3035.16 → 3036.10] super excited
[3036.10 → 3036.76] about this.
[3038.02 → 3038.50] Like,
[3038.60 → 3039.28] super excited.
[3039.38 → 3040.60] Anyone outside a
[3040.60 → 3041.56] fairly dense urban
[3041.56 → 3041.96] centre,
[3042.10 → 3042.78] I'd imagine this
[3042.78 → 3043.46] isn't gonna benefit
[3043.46 → 3044.26] them for quite some
[3044.26 → 3044.64] time,
[3045.16 → 3045.56] but,
[3045.66 → 3045.98] uh,
[3046.78 → 3047.12] man,
[3047.24 → 3048.52] the idea of,
[3048.62 → 3049.92] not just from,
[3050.04 → 3050.20] like,
[3050.26 → 3051.44] a consumer standpoint
[3051.44 → 3051.96] point of,
[3052.28 → 3052.98] it would sure
[3052.98 → 3053.58] be cool
[3053.58 → 3054.36] if I could
[3054.36 → 3055.22] order crap
[3055.22 → 3056.08] under two
[3056.08 → 3056.68] kilograms,
[3057.04 → 3057.50] crap under
[3057.50 → 3058.22] two kilograms,
[3058.96 → 3059.42] and,
[3059.50 → 3059.98] uh,
[3060.60 → 3061.30] so there's two
[3061.30 → 3062.62] customers taking
[3062.62 → 3063.16] place in the
[3063.16 → 3063.82] trial right now
[3063.82 → 3064.36] due to the fact
[3064.36 → 3064.78] that they live
[3064.78 → 3065.40] close enough to
[3065.40 → 3065.78] the fulfillment
[3065.78 → 3066.16] centre.
[3066.42 → 3067.28] So as long as
[3067.28 → 3067.78] you live close
[3067.78 → 3068.18] enough to a
[3068.18 → 3068.74] fulfillment centre
[3068.74 → 3069.16] and your order
[3069.16 → 3069.68] is under two
[3069.68 → 3070.02] kilograms,
[3070.28 → 3071.28] I am super
[3071.28 → 3073.08] excited to be
[3073.08 → 3074.18] able to receive
[3074.18 → 3074.98] stuff within,
[3074.98 → 3075.30] like,
[3075.62 → 3077.14] potentially hours
[3077.14 → 3078.12] or even minutes
[3078.12 → 3079.50] of ordering it,
[3079.56 → 3080.24] because that's,
[3080.32 → 3080.42] like,
[3080.42 → 3081.10] super amazing
[3081.10 → 3081.98] as a consumer,
[3082.28 → 3083.92] but I am also
[3083.92 → 3085.72] excited from just
[3085.72 → 3086.12] a
[3086.46 → 3086.82] like,
[3087.06 → 3087.88] an efficiency
[3087.88 → 3088.56] standpoint.
[3089.10 → 3089.72] I mean,
[3089.88 → 3091.26] compared to
[3091.26 → 3092.60] sending a truck
[3092.60 → 3093.66] to your house
[3093.66 → 3094.70] to deliver,
[3094.88 → 3095.12] like,
[3095.50 → 3096.28] a pack of
[3096.28 → 3096.84] batteries,
[3097.18 → 3097.42] like,
[3097.72 → 3098.72] think about
[3098.72 → 3101.48] the efficiency
[3101.48 → 3102.96] of being able
[3102.96 → 3104.08] to use a
[3104.08 → 3105.20] little electrically
[3105.20 → 3106.26] powered device
[3106.26 → 3107.42] to do the
[3107.42 → 3107.82] last,
[3107.82 → 3108.86] the last mile,
[3109.12 → 3109.80] because there's
[3109.80 → 3111.06] a huge variety
[3111.06 → 3111.56] of ways that
[3111.56 → 3111.82] they could
[3111.82 → 3112.44] deploy this,
[3112.56 → 3112.70] like,
[3112.76 → 3113.36] Amazon could
[3113.36 → 3113.92] just have a
[3113.92 → 3114.92] truck kind
[3114.92 → 3115.70] of drive out
[3115.70 → 3116.86] to some,
[3117.00 → 3117.50] you know,
[3118.00 → 3118.90] intelligently,
[3119.26 → 3120.18] you know,
[3120.34 → 3120.84] determined,
[3121.10 → 3122.28] optimized point,
[3122.82 → 3123.22] and,
[3123.36 → 3123.52] you know,
[3123.58 → 3124.12] kind of like
[3124.12 → 3125.50] in Phantom Menace,
[3126.06 → 3126.32] sorry,
[3126.38 → 3126.76] I shouldn't be
[3126.76 → 3127.18] talking about
[3127.18 → 3127.90] Phantom Menace,
[3128.32 → 3129.70] we all agreed
[3129.70 → 3130.40] not to talk
[3130.40 → 3131.16] about that movie,
[3131.38 → 3131.80] I'm sorry,
[3131.96 → 3132.26] anyway,
[3132.98 → 3133.52] like in
[3133.52 → 3134.74] that movie,
[3134.74 → 3135.92] where the
[3135.92 → 3136.48] droids,
[3136.54 → 3136.76] like,
[3136.86 → 3137.46] slide out of
[3137.46 → 3137.84] the back
[3137.84 → 3138.36] of the tank
[3138.36 → 3138.62] thing,
[3138.68 → 3138.88] and they,
[3138.94 → 3139.10] like,
[3139.22 → 3139.50] deploy,
[3139.82 → 3140.12] and then
[3140.12 → 3140.78] they don't
[3140.78 → 3141.16] deploy in
[3141.16 → 3141.38] the air
[3141.38 → 3142.02] because they're
[3142.02 → 3142.84] walking droids
[3142.84 → 3143.28] because,
[3143.94 → 3144.18] you know,
[3144.24 → 3144.94] for some reason
[3144.94 → 3145.48] they thought
[3145.48 → 3145.86] that would be
[3145.86 → 3146.40] a good idea
[3146.40 → 3146.72] anyway.
[3148.72 → 3149.60] There's a hundred
[3149.60 → 3150.28] different ways
[3150.28 → 3150.84] that they could
[3150.84 → 3151.86] make it so that
[3151.86 → 3152.64] delivery to
[3152.64 → 3153.32] people's homes
[3153.32 → 3154.34] could be less
[3154.34 → 3154.98] environmentally
[3154.98 → 3156.00] impactful and
[3156.00 → 3156.72] just generally
[3156.72 → 3157.74] more efficient
[3157.74 → 3158.84] than it is
[3158.84 → 3160.08] today using
[3160.08 → 3160.84] this kind of
[3160.84 → 3161.44] technology.
[3161.44 → 3162.72] So that is
[3162.72 → 3163.96] super-duper
[3163.96 → 3164.56] exciting.
[3166.92 → 3167.76] I mean,
[3167.90 → 3168.06] yeah,
[3168.12 → 3168.64] you look at
[3168.64 → 3169.08] the more
[3169.08 → 3169.96] traditional way
[3169.96 → 3170.34] of getting
[3170.34 → 3170.78] goods,
[3171.04 → 3171.92] and it is
[3171.92 → 3172.68] inherently more
[3172.68 → 3173.62] efficient than
[3173.62 → 3174.04] having a
[3174.04 → 3174.94] distribution hub
[3174.94 → 3175.78] and then
[3175.78 → 3177.24] vehicles driving
[3177.24 → 3178.16] out like a
[3178.16 → 3179.36] spoken wheel
[3179.36 → 3180.00] type system
[3180.00 → 3181.04] out from there
[3181.04 → 3181.72] to drop off
[3181.72 → 3182.28] to individual
[3182.28 → 3183.10] customers because
[3183.10 → 3183.92] you would carry,
[3184.10 → 3184.56] you know,
[3184.92 → 3185.72] pallets at a
[3185.72 → 3187.10] time of stuff
[3187.10 → 3188.08] like milk,
[3188.18 → 3188.76] for example.
[3189.24 → 3189.76] So while,
[3189.96 → 3190.20] yes,
[3190.28 → 3190.90] the consumer
[3190.90 → 3192.04] is effectively
[3192.04 → 3192.76] doing the same
[3192.76 → 3193.58] thing where
[3193.58 → 3194.26] they are driving
[3194.26 → 3194.96] their individual
[3194.96 → 3195.74] car to and
[3195.74 → 3196.66] from like
[3196.66 → 3197.16] some kind
[3197.16 → 3198.12] of a hub,
[3198.68 → 3199.28] they are picking
[3199.28 → 3199.82] up more than
[3199.82 → 3200.56] one thing at
[3200.56 → 3201.00] a time.
[3201.46 → 3201.94] And they're
[3201.94 → 3202.74] usually,
[3202.98 → 3203.70] like if they're
[3203.70 → 3205.02] clever consumers,
[3205.16 → 3205.98] they're consolidating
[3205.98 → 3206.46] their trips.
[3206.80 → 3207.46] So the grocery
[3207.46 → 3208.18] store gets a
[3208.18 → 3209.26] consolidated large
[3209.26 → 3210.60] shipment of eggs
[3210.60 → 3211.20] or milk or
[3211.20 → 3211.90] whatever the case
[3211.90 → 3212.38] may be,
[3212.52 → 3213.18] and then the
[3213.18 → 3213.82] consumer comes
[3213.82 → 3214.52] and buys eggs
[3214.52 → 3215.50] and milk and,
[3215.74 → 3215.92] you know,
[3215.98 → 3216.76] this weird little
[3216.76 → 3217.56] container in the
[3217.56 → 3217.96] shape of a
[3217.96 → 3218.82] goldfish cracker
[3218.82 → 3219.64] that fits goldfish
[3219.64 → 3220.20] crackers in it
[3220.20 → 3221.04] because his
[3221.04 → 3221.56] kids wouldn't
[3221.56 → 3222.28] shut up about
[3222.28 → 3222.64] it and they
[3222.64 → 3223.30] wanted it so
[3223.30 → 3223.94] badly and it
[3223.94 → 3224.40] was only like
[3224.40 → 3225.00] three dollars.
[3227.60 → 3228.34] Not that I'm
[3228.34 → 3228.98] speaking about
[3228.98 → 3229.70] from personal
[3229.70 → 3230.32] experience on
[3230.32 → 3230.86] that last one.
[3232.06 → 3232.98] All right.
[3234.66 → 3236.14] Twitch introduces
[3236.14 → 3238.02] AutoMod,
[3238.40 → 3239.66] a self-learning
[3239.66 → 3241.28] moderation tool.
[3241.76 → 3242.42] So this was
[3242.42 → 3243.12] posted on the
[3243.12 → 3243.98] forum by
[3243.98 → 3245.66] Nous BAL,
[3245.66 → 3246.32] and the original
[3246.32 → 3247.16] article is from
[3247.16 → 3248.62] kitguru.com,
[3249.12 → 3249.82] and they are
[3249.82 → 3250.68] going to be using
[3250.68 → 3251.54] machine learning
[3251.54 → 3252.58] to help police
[3252.58 → 3253.10] chat.
[3253.62 → 3254.98] This has got to
[3254.98 → 3255.88] be one of the
[3255.88 → 3256.68] the best things that
[3256.68 → 3257.68] I've seen come out
[3257.68 → 3258.50] of the Amazon
[3258.50 → 3259.42] acquisition of
[3259.42 → 3261.32] Twitch so far.
[3261.58 → 3262.74] We have actually
[3262.74 → 3264.18] put a fair bit
[3264.18 → 3265.28] of work into
[3265.28 → 3266.52] our own
[3266.52 → 3267.70] moderation bot,
[3268.14 → 3269.14] and it is
[3269.14 → 3270.36] baffling to me
[3270.36 → 3271.30] that Twitch had
[3271.30 → 3272.40] not invested in
[3272.40 → 3273.32] this kind of thing
[3273.32 → 3273.86] before.
[3274.58 → 3275.54] So AutoMod
[3275.54 → 3276.20] will be a chat
[3276.20 → 3276.90] bot that uses
[3276.90 → 3277.64] machine learning
[3277.64 → 3278.24] and natural
[3278.24 → 3279.42] language processing
[3279.42 → 3280.36] to police chat
[3280.36 → 3280.64] rooms.
[3280.90 → 3281.78] It is not
[3281.78 → 3283.04] entirely intended
[3283.04 → 3283.86] to replace human
[3283.86 → 3284.56] moderators,
[3284.80 → 3285.92] and Twitch line's
[3285.92 → 3286.66] tagline for the
[3286.66 → 3287.34] announcement is
[3287.34 → 3288.46] moderators are
[3288.46 → 3289.12] the sword,
[3289.54 → 3290.62] AutoMod is the
[3290.62 → 3291.02] shield,
[3291.54 → 3292.68] which is super
[3292.68 → 3293.06] lame.
[3293.72 → 3294.48] I think that's
[3294.48 → 3295.16] pretty cool.
[3295.84 → 3296.66] It is lame.
[3296.72 → 3297.12] You know how it
[3297.12 → 3297.48] works?
[3300.28 → 3300.70] You know how
[3300.70 → 3301.12] AutoMod works?
[3301.14 → 3302.16] So Twitch notes
[3302.16 → 3303.24] that streamers can
[3303.24 → 3304.50] configure AutoMod
[3304.50 → 3305.30] by selecting one
[3305.30 → 3306.08] of four different
[3306.08 → 3306.46] levels.
[3307.00 → 3307.62] So these levels
[3307.62 → 3308.32] affect how
[3308.32 → 3309.90] aggressively AutoMod
[3309.90 → 3310.90] holds back messages
[3310.90 → 3312.04] under four categories.
[3312.66 → 3313.30] Identity,
[3313.68 → 3314.62] sexual language,
[3315.04 → 3315.88] aggressive speech,
[3316.14 → 3317.26] and profanity.
[3317.72 → 3318.84] When AutoMod flags
[3318.84 → 3319.26] a message,
[3319.42 → 3319.88] it lets the
[3319.88 → 3320.54] original sender
[3320.54 → 3321.52] know that moderators
[3321.52 → 3322.14] will review the
[3322.14 → 3322.98] message's contents
[3322.98 → 3323.82] before it's sent
[3323.82 → 3324.32] to chat.
[3324.92 → 3325.24] Meanwhile,
[3325.44 → 3326.02] the message is
[3326.02 → 3326.78] shown to mods
[3326.78 → 3327.48] for approval.
[3328.32 → 3328.88] So yes,
[3329.66 → 3330.58] their slogan
[3330.58 → 3331.38] makes sense.
[3331.38 → 3332.50] It's just
[3332.50 → 3333.04] lame.
[3333.54 → 3334.16] That's all.
[3335.04 → 3335.70] And we can agree
[3335.70 → 3336.38] to disagree on
[3336.38 → 3337.12] this if you
[3337.12 → 3337.32] want.
[3338.12 → 3338.36] Okay.
[3340.04 → 3341.04] Speaking of
[3341.04 → 3341.66] Twitch and
[3341.66 → 3342.10] streaming,
[3342.88 → 3344.08] this is kind
[3344.08 → 3344.72] of a big deal.
[3344.82 → 3344.98] I mean,
[3345.12 → 3345.80] League of Legends
[3345.80 → 3346.70] is getting reported
[3346.70 → 3347.50] on in the Wall
[3347.50 → 3348.00] Street Journal.
[3348.14 → 3348.80] League of Legends
[3348.80 → 3349.94] esports contests
[3349.94 → 3351.18] lure the newest fan.
[3351.82 → 3352.62] Major League
[3352.62 → 3353.56] Baseball.
[3354.56 → 3355.38] Tencent's Riot
[3355.38 → 3356.32] games in a
[3356.32 → 3357.90] $300 million
[3357.90 → 3359.58] deal with
[3359.58 → 3360.98] MLB unit
[3360.98 → 3362.02] to stream
[3362.02 → 3362.82] competitive
[3362.82 → 3363.78] video gaming.
[3363.92 → 3364.52] So now,
[3365.26 → 3365.70] Major League
[3365.70 → 3366.84] Baseball and
[3366.84 → 3367.46] the NBA
[3367.46 → 3368.50] are getting
[3368.50 → 3369.88] involved in
[3369.88 → 3370.82] big league
[3370.82 → 3371.42] gaming.
[3372.18 → 3373.12] So BATCH
[3373.12 → 3373.88] was spun into
[3373.88 → 3375.02] its own company
[3375.02 → 3375.82] from Major League
[3375.82 → 3376.84] Baseball and
[3376.84 → 3378.28] Disney as well
[3378.28 → 3378.88] as the National
[3378.88 → 3379.70] Hockey League.
[3379.88 → 3380.38] Oh, sorry.
[3380.52 → 3381.28] From Major League
[3381.28 → 3381.66] Baseball,
[3382.08 → 3382.70] Disney as well
[3382.70 → 3383.20] as the National
[3383.20 → 3383.94] Hockey League
[3383.94 → 3385.08] own a part of
[3385.08 → 3385.24] it.
[3385.70 → 3386.24] According to
[3386.24 → 3386.46] the Wall
[3386.46 → 3386.94] Street Journal,
[3387.26 → 3387.70] the agreement
[3387.70 → 3388.50] calls for
[3388.50 → 3389.32] BATCH to
[3389.32 → 3389.84] pay a minimum
[3389.84 → 3390.88] $300 million
[3390.88 → 3391.88] through 2023
[3391.88 → 3393.44] to Riot Games.
[3394.30 → 3395.42] In return,
[3395.94 → 3396.22] they'll get
[3396.22 → 3397.08] exclusive rights
[3397.08 → 3397.72] to stream and
[3397.72 → 3398.48] monetize the
[3398.48 → 3399.32] company's popular
[3399.32 → 3400.28] multiplayer online
[3400.28 → 3400.80] battle arena
[3400.80 → 3401.30] game.
[3402.46 → 3403.28] BATCH plans
[3403.28 → 3403.98] to launch a
[3403.98 → 3404.50] League of Legends
[3404.50 → 3405.26] streaming service
[3405.26 → 3405.94] with apps for
[3405.94 → 3406.80] smartphones, PCs,
[3406.96 → 3407.62] and other devices.
[3408.02 → 3408.64] They will also
[3408.64 → 3409.50] handle distribution
[3409.50 → 3410.18] on existing
[3410.18 → 3411.00] streaming portals
[3411.00 → 3412.48] like Twitch and
[3412.48 → 3413.54] YouTube Gaming.
[3414.22 → 3414.80] Wow.
[3416.06 → 3416.74] Unreal,
[3417.10 → 3418.24] holy,
[3418.34 → 3418.70] actual,
[3418.84 → 3419.48] freaking crap.
[3421.24 → 3422.12] Speaking of
[3422.12 → 3422.40] Unreal,
[3422.50 → 3422.66] holy,
[3422.76 → 3422.96] actual,
[3423.06 → 3423.50] freaking crap,
[3423.60 → 3424.20] Microsoft is
[3424.20 → 3424.92] bringing Cortana
[3424.92 → 3425.54] to fridges,
[3425.94 → 3426.34] toasters,
[3426.56 → 3427.66] and thermostats.
[3428.32 → 3429.18] So just in
[3429.18 → 3429.82] case you were
[3429.82 → 3431.04] thinking that
[3431.04 → 3433.66] you needed to
[3433.66 → 3434.88] be able to
[3434.88 → 3436.00] talk to your
[3436.00 → 3436.42] toaster,
[3436.94 → 3437.62] you will be
[3437.62 → 3438.12] able to do
[3438.12 → 3438.74] that soon,
[3439.20 → 3440.16] assuming you
[3440.16 → 3441.52] get some
[3441.52 → 3442.14] kind of
[3442.14 → 3443.14] supported device.
[3443.14 → 3444.38] though,
[3444.60 → 3445.18] to be
[3445.18 → 3445.60] perfectly
[3445.60 → 3446.12] honest,
[3446.52 → 3447.12] and I
[3447.12 → 3448.08] would love
[3448.08 → 3448.54] to hear from
[3448.54 → 3449.02] you guys in
[3449.02 → 3449.62] the Twitch chat
[3449.62 → 3450.08] on this,
[3451.16 → 3452.34] I have
[3452.34 → 3453.64] never been
[3453.64 → 3455.04] compelled to
[3455.04 → 3455.92] replace an
[3455.92 → 3457.20] appliance for
[3457.20 → 3458.10] any reason
[3458.10 → 3458.80] other than
[3458.80 → 3459.58] my old one
[3459.58 → 3459.98] broke.
[3460.84 → 3461.82] Are you guys on
[3461.82 → 3462.38] the same page
[3462.38 → 3462.88] with me here?
[3463.58 → 3463.74] Like,
[3463.92 → 3464.66] is anyone going
[3464.66 → 3465.00] like,
[3465.96 → 3466.26] yeah,
[3466.40 → 3466.84] I like,
[3467.08 → 3467.82] super-duper
[3467.82 → 3468.34] need,
[3468.34 → 3470.92] what could I
[3470.92 → 3471.92] possibly want
[3471.92 → 3473.28] my oven to
[3473.28 → 3473.98] do other than
[3473.98 → 3474.34] what it does
[3474.34 → 3474.64] already?
[3474.76 → 3474.90] Like,
[3476.06 → 3476.92] five years
[3476.92 → 3477.44] from now.
[3477.50 → 3478.04] What if you
[3478.04 → 3479.04] could leave
[3479.04 → 3480.06] a bag of
[3480.06 → 3481.52] popcorn in
[3481.52 → 3482.18] your microwave
[3482.18 → 3483.26] before you go
[3483.26 → 3483.54] to work,
[3484.18 → 3485.18] and then you
[3485.18 → 3486.06] walk into
[3486.06 → 3486.90] your door
[3486.90 → 3487.98] and just say,
[3488.18 → 3488.30] hey,
[3488.34 → 3488.72] microwave,
[3489.24 → 3490.16] make that
[3490.16 → 3490.60] popcorn,
[3491.50 → 3492.46] and it's just
[3492.46 → 3492.98] ready in
[3492.98 → 3494.34] two minutes.
[3494.34 → 3495.10] preheating
[3495.10 → 3495.54] your oven
[3495.54 → 3496.12] before you're
[3496.12 → 3496.38] home.
[3497.22 → 3497.62] Why would you
[3497.62 → 3497.96] want to
[3497.96 → 3498.52] preheat your
[3498.52 → 3499.02] oven before
[3499.02 → 3499.46] you're home?
[3499.50 → 3499.76] Because when
[3499.76 → 3500.46] you get home
[3500.46 → 3500.90] and you want
[3500.90 → 3501.16] to make
[3501.16 → 3501.46] something,
[3501.60 → 3502.02] your oven's
[3502.02 → 3502.28] already,
[3502.72 → 3502.96] it's,
[3503.02 → 3503.52] it's,
[3503.52 → 3503.84] you still have
[3503.84 → 3504.46] to preheat it.
[3504.52 → 3504.90] By the time
[3504.90 → 3505.28] you get home,
[3505.32 → 3505.54] it's already
[3505.54 → 3505.92] preheated.
[3505.94 → 3506.58] By the time
[3506.58 → 3507.02] you finish
[3507.02 → 3507.80] preparing the
[3507.80 → 3508.12] thing that
[3508.12 → 3508.66] goes in the
[3508.66 → 3508.90] oven,
[3509.02 → 3509.46] it's already
[3509.46 → 3510.06] preheated.
[3510.24 → 3510.64] Not,
[3510.78 → 3511.76] not if it's
[3511.76 → 3512.72] a frozen pizza.
[3513.76 → 3514.10] Yeah.
[3514.68 → 3515.12] Boom.
[3516.10 → 3516.94] That's kind
[3516.94 → 3517.68] of an example
[3517.68 → 3518.12] that I was
[3518.12 → 3518.52] going to hear.
[3518.56 → 3519.10] You guys are
[3519.10 → 3519.80] giving me so
[3519.80 → 3520.50] much cancer
[3520.50 → 3521.04] right now.
[3522.76 → 3523.20] So,
[3523.20 → 3524.34] so,
[3524.58 → 3524.96] okay,
[3525.16 → 3525.66] thermostat,
[3526.28 → 3526.80] fine.
[3526.96 → 3527.46] Intelligent
[3527.46 → 3528.02] thermostat,
[3528.94 → 3529.48] sure.
[3530.18 → 3531.30] But honestly,
[3531.86 → 3532.66] it's going to
[3532.66 → 3533.40] be the same
[3533.40 → 3534.44] problem as it
[3534.44 → 3535.40] always is.
[3535.88 → 3536.22] Where,
[3536.36 → 3536.60] like,
[3537.18 → 3537.64] you've got
[3537.64 → 3538.12] your Nest
[3538.12 → 3538.64] thermostat
[3538.64 → 3539.58] already because
[3539.58 → 3540.00] you're the
[3540.00 → 3540.72] kind of tech
[3540.72 → 3541.56] junkie that
[3541.56 → 3542.60] buys Internet
[3542.60 → 3543.12] of Things
[3543.12 → 3543.68] devices.
[3544.20 → 3544.86] You've got
[3544.86 → 3546.08] your Linus
[3546.08 → 3546.58] lock,
[3546.86 → 3547.30] which is a
[3547.30 → 3547.48] thing,
[3547.56 → 3548.00] by the way.
[3548.32 → 3548.94] You've got
[3548.94 → 3549.42] your,
[3549.58 → 3550.06] you know,
[3550.28 → 3551.16] Samsung
[3551.16 → 3553.06] smart fridge,
[3553.20 → 3554.50] that you
[3554.50 → 3555.36] can bet
[3555.36 → 3555.96] your bottom
[3555.96 → 3556.46] dollar,
[3556.94 → 3557.34] they're not
[3557.34 → 3557.78] going to care
[3557.78 → 3558.34] about putting
[3558.34 → 3559.24] Cortana on,
[3559.40 → 3560.04] and then you've
[3560.04 → 3560.38] got your
[3560.38 → 3561.60] Cortana toaster,
[3561.96 → 3562.84] and none of
[3562.84 → 3563.28] it is going to
[3563.28 → 3563.90] work together
[3563.90 → 3564.60] at all.
[3565.34 → 3565.98] So,
[3566.34 → 3567.40] it's just
[3567.40 → 3568.92] stupid and
[3568.92 → 3569.30] pointless.
[3570.00 → 3570.34] So,
[3570.54 → 3571.16] five,
[3571.36 → 3572.12] ten years from
[3572.12 → 3572.32] now,
[3572.38 → 3572.82] when everyone
[3572.82 → 3573.50] gets over
[3573.50 → 3574.18] their egos,
[3574.56 → 3575.28] and there's
[3575.28 → 3576.36] actually some
[3576.36 → 3577.22] kind of cohesive
[3577.22 → 3577.86] ecosystem,
[3578.34 → 3579.02] I'm still
[3579.02 → 3579.66] calling it
[3579.66 → 3580.52] the i-home,
[3580.52 → 3580.58] home,
[3580.92 → 3581.22] okay,
[3581.52 → 3582.04] where Apple
[3582.04 → 3582.90] just does the
[3582.90 → 3583.22] whole thing
[3583.22 → 3583.72] themselves,
[3584.48 → 3585.48] then you'll
[3585.48 → 3585.90] have my
[3585.90 → 3586.30] attention.
[3586.48 → 3586.74] But for
[3586.74 → 3587.18] now,
[3587.56 → 3587.90] and like,
[3588.06 → 3588.30] okay,
[3588.44 → 3588.80] and like,
[3588.84 → 3589.30] when a smart
[3589.30 → 3589.86] fridge comes
[3589.86 → 3590.52] out that
[3590.52 → 3591.10] actually has
[3591.10 → 3591.70] like cameras
[3591.70 → 3592.46] all over the
[3592.46 → 3593.46] inside that
[3593.46 → 3594.50] keeps track
[3594.50 → 3595.28] of like,
[3595.64 → 3595.84] like,
[3595.92 → 3596.30] not just
[3596.30 → 3596.78] cameras,
[3597.08 → 3597.36] like it
[3597.36 → 3597.94] needs to be
[3597.94 → 3598.42] able to
[3598.42 → 3599.34] like scan
[3599.34 → 3599.92] my milk,
[3600.00 → 3600.72] my milk
[3600.72 → 3601.42] carton and
[3601.42 → 3601.86] know how
[3601.86 → 3602.40] full it is
[3602.40 → 3602.84] and stuff.
[3603.02 → 3603.42] Like,
[3603.60 → 3604.12] when that
[3604.12 → 3604.98] fridge exists,
[3605.72 → 3606.44] I'm down.
[3606.82 → 3607.34] But until
[3607.34 → 3607.68] then,
[3607.90 → 3608.44] I super
[3608.44 → 3609.00] don't care,
[3609.12 → 3609.66] and neither do
[3609.66 → 3610.02] a lot of
[3610.02 → 3610.26] people.
[3613.98 → 3614.46] Alright.
[3616.60 → 3617.18] This is
[3617.18 → 3617.50] great.
[3618.14 → 3618.62] So this
[3618.62 → 3619.20] was originally
[3619.20 → 3620.02] posted by,
[3620.08 → 3620.22] oh,
[3620.28 → 3620.70] no one on
[3620.70 → 3621.04] the forum.
[3621.12 → 3621.44] The original
[3621.44 → 3622.04] article here is
[3622.04 → 3622.42] from Mac
[3622.42 → 3622.90] Rumours.
[3623.98 → 3624.66] Apple will
[3624.66 → 3625.08] apparently
[3625.08 → 3626.56] charge $69
[3626.56 → 3628.76] to replace,
[3629.52 → 3631.54] hold on a
[3631.54 → 3631.74] second,
[3631.96 → 3632.14] blah,
[3632.18 → 3632.30] blah,
[3632.34 → 3632.60] blah,
[3632.82 → 3632.98] blah,
[3632.98 → 3633.36] blah,
[3633.36 → 3633.52] blah,
[3633.52 → 3633.78] blah,
[3633.78 → 3633.94] blah,
[3633.94 → 3634.54] here we go.
[3634.68 → 3635.14] So battery
[3635.14 → 3635.74] service will
[3635.74 → 3636.34] be $49
[3636.34 → 3638.04] each on
[3638.04 → 3638.92] AirPods out
[3638.92 → 3639.48] of warranty,
[3639.76 → 3640.30] $69
[3640.30 → 3640.86] each,
[3640.90 → 3641.20] and if you
[3641.20 → 3641.52] lose an
[3641.52 → 3641.94] AirPods,
[3642.24 → 3642.54] they will
[3642.54 → 3643.80] charge $69,
[3644.24 → 3644.60] which is
[3644.60 → 3646.48] only slightly
[3646.48 → 3648.10] less than
[3648.10 → 3648.70] half of the
[3648.70 → 3649.08] price of
[3649.08 → 3649.60] AirPods in
[3649.60 → 3649.96] the first
[3649.96 → 3650.34] place,
[3650.48 → 3651.32] if I recall
[3651.32 → 3651.76] correctly.
[3651.84 → 3652.02] Though I
[3652.02 → 3652.54] haven't actually
[3652.54 → 3653.04] gone and
[3653.04 → 3653.46] bought them
[3653.46 → 3653.72] yet,
[3653.80 → 3654.08] and I
[3654.08 → 3654.62] don't remember
[3654.62 → 3655.96] because I
[3655.96 → 3656.52] am an
[3656.52 → 3656.72] idiot.
[3657.20 → 3657.88] So let's
[3657.88 → 3658.38] go ahead.
[3658.54 → 3658.98] No,
[3659.08 → 3659.78] I don't want
[3659.78 → 3660.64] Apple.ca.
[3661.00 → 3661.82] No one
[3661.82 → 3662.66] knows
[3662.66 → 3663.68] Canadian
[3663.68 → 3664.12] dollars.
[3664.46 → 3665.08] So if I
[3665.08 → 3665.50] talk about
[3665.50 → 3665.96] things in
[3665.96 → 3666.34] terms of
[3666.34 → 3666.66] Canadian
[3666.66 → 3667.02] dollars,
[3667.02 → 3667.52] I'm just
[3667.52 → 3668.26] shooting myself
[3668.26 → 3668.54] in the
[3668.54 → 3668.80] foot.
[3669.20 → 3669.58] I thought
[3669.58 → 3669.86] they were
[3669.86 → 3671.18] $159,
[3671.24 → 3671.74] so it's
[3671.74 → 3672.32] still only
[3672.32 → 3672.64] a little
[3672.64 → 3673.62] less than
[3673.62 → 3674.06] half of
[3674.06 → 3674.28] one.
[3677.04 → 3677.48] Yeah,
[3677.52 → 3677.90] what is there
[3677.90 → 3678.42] to say about
[3678.42 → 3678.92] it other than
[3678.92 → 3679.22] that?
[3679.38 → 3680.10] I guess I
[3680.10 → 3680.50] will be
[3680.50 → 3681.06] reviewing the
[3681.06 → 3681.32] AirPods.
[3682.10 → 3682.80] So they
[3682.80 → 3683.88] went on
[3683.88 → 3684.56] sale Tuesday
[3684.56 → 3685.12] morning.
[3685.48 → 3686.30] The earliest
[3686.30 → 3687.10] I'm able to
[3687.10 → 3688.18] get them is
[3688.18 → 3688.94] Sunday.
[3689.38 → 3689.90] Apple stores
[3689.90 → 3690.60] in Canada are
[3690.60 → 3690.90] going to get
[3690.90 → 3691.04] them.
[3691.14 → 3691.32] So I'm
[3691.32 → 3691.72] actually,
[3691.94 → 3692.46] I'm coming
[3692.46 → 3692.74] in on
[3692.74 → 3693.12] Sunday.
[3693.66 → 3694.00] Burke's
[3694.00 → 3694.56] coming in on
[3694.56 → 3694.88] Sunday.
[3695.00 → 3695.48] Tyler's going
[3695.48 → 3695.90] to be helping
[3695.90 → 3696.46] us out.
[3696.92 → 3697.24] And we
[3697.24 → 3697.60] are going
[3697.60 → 3698.24] to be
[3698.24 → 3699.18] slamming
[3699.18 → 3699.56] together.
[3699.80 → 3700.06] So I've
[3700.06 → 3700.64] already got
[3700.64 → 3701.14] all of my
[3701.14 → 3701.84] other wireless
[3701.84 → 3702.92] headphones charged
[3702.92 → 3703.58] up, firmware
[3703.58 → 3704.40] updated, ready
[3704.40 → 3704.92] to rock.
[3704.98 → 3705.56] I've got the
[3705.56 → 3706.50] Braggy Dash,
[3706.92 → 3707.78] I've got the
[3707.78 → 3709.24] Jaybird Freedoms,
[3709.30 → 3709.74] and then I've
[3709.74 → 3710.72] got some regular
[3710.72 → 3711.80] ear pods with the
[3711.80 → 3712.50] lightning connector.
[3713.12 → 3713.58] And I'm going
[3713.58 → 3714.22] to be whipping
[3714.22 → 3715.46] together a video
[3715.46 → 3716.18] for you guys
[3716.18 → 3716.54] that's going to
[3716.54 → 3717.00] be coming out
[3717.00 → 3717.54] on Sunday.
[3719.02 → 3719.66] I've never
[3719.66 → 3720.04] heard them
[3720.04 → 3721.16] before, but I'm
[3721.16 → 3721.86] pretty sure I can
[3721.86 → 3722.62] already tell you
[3722.62 → 3723.60] how it goes.
[3723.60 → 3725.38] They're expensive,
[3726.22 → 3726.98] they sound like
[3726.98 → 3727.98] okay, I guess.
[3728.52 → 3729.20] They don't stay
[3729.20 → 3729.90] in your ears as
[3729.90 → 3730.72] well as some
[3730.72 → 3731.38] other solutions,
[3731.60 → 3731.92] and I don't
[3731.92 → 3732.58] personally feel
[3732.58 → 3734.18] like the absence
[3734.18 → 3735.10] of a cable in
[3735.10 → 3735.56] between them
[3735.56 → 3736.34] contributes much
[3736.34 → 3737.22] to the experience.
[3737.86 → 3738.54] But if you want
[3738.54 → 3739.52] to watch that
[3739.52 → 3740.52] again, but longer
[3740.52 → 3741.46] with glam footage,
[3741.64 → 3742.10] then Sunday
[3742.10 → 3742.52] will be the
[3742.52 → 3742.76] time.
[3745.94 → 3746.78] Yes, sir?
[3746.78 → 3750.10] A video on
[3750.10 → 3750.86] installing Windows?
[3750.86 → 3751.74] A specific one.
[3751.82 → 3752.32] Like, is there a
[3752.32 → 3753.12] tech cookie, or is
[3753.12 → 3753.50] there a lot of
[3753.50 → 3753.82] tech tips?
[3754.56 → 3755.82] There's an NCI
[3755.82 → 3756.42] tech tips.
[3758.14 → 3759.06] So you could do
[3759.06 → 3759.44] that.
[3759.82 → 3760.28] Okay.
[3762.64 → 3763.48] All right.
[3763.56 → 3764.18] Oh, this is
[3764.18 → 3764.56] exciting.
[3764.70 → 3765.22] Posted on the
[3765.22 → 3766.56] forum by Speed,
[3767.34 → 3768.74] LG is taking a
[3768.74 → 3770.86] 4K HDR monitor
[3770.86 → 3772.92] with USB-C to
[3772.92 → 3773.66] CES.
[3773.66 → 3776.46] HDR is coming.
[3777.38 → 3777.86] Finally.
[3778.34 → 3779.46] So AMD has got
[3779.46 → 3780.56] support for HDR.
[3780.96 → 3781.82] I actually don't
[3781.82 → 3782.96] know about
[3782.96 → 3784.10] NVIDIA's HDR
[3784.10 → 3784.72] status.
[3785.24 → 3785.78] There's no
[3785.78 → 3787.00] content.
[3787.32 → 3787.56] You want to
[3787.56 → 3788.24] ASMR about
[3788.24 → 3788.38] HDR?
[3788.38 → 3788.88] Yeah, I'm
[3788.88 → 3789.24] doing it.
[3789.32 → 3789.56] All right.
[3790.04 → 3791.18] There's like no
[3791.18 → 3791.72] content.
[3792.76 → 3794.16] Actually, my 4K
[3794.16 → 3795.46] Blu-ray, is it
[3795.46 → 3796.40] worth it video is
[3796.40 → 3797.10] coming to YouTube
[3797.10 → 3797.86] very soon as
[3797.86 → 3798.14] well.
[3798.64 → 3799.28] Should be a
[3799.28 → 3800.08] perfect video
[3800.08 → 3801.16] if you're interested
[3801.16 → 3801.80] in HDR.
[3802.42 → 3803.60] But in and out
[3803.60 → 3805.46] shell, 4K
[3805.46 → 3806.04] Blu-ray does
[3806.04 → 3806.68] not run on a
[3806.68 → 3806.96] PC.
[3807.24 → 3807.74] So there's
[3807.74 → 3809.60] really, other
[3809.60 → 3810.26] than content
[3810.26 → 3811.18] creation, I
[3811.18 → 3812.08] guess, there's
[3812.08 → 3812.78] really not much
[3812.78 → 3813.46] reason to care
[3813.46 → 3814.76] about HDR on
[3814.76 → 3815.22] the PC.
[3815.38 → 3815.88] But damn it,
[3816.46 → 3817.06] it's coming.
[3817.46 → 3818.06] And I'm going
[3818.06 → 3818.50] to be trying to
[3818.50 → 3818.90] get one of
[3818.90 → 3819.58] these from LG
[3819.58 → 3821.06] like ASAP
[3821.06 → 3822.10] because I think
[3822.10 → 3822.58] it would be
[3822.58 → 3824.10] flipping bananas
[3824.10 → 3825.56] to have like
[3825.56 → 3826.94] float plane club
[3826.94 → 3828.32] now with better
[3828.32 → 3829.22] streaming quality
[3829.22 → 3829.96] than YouTube
[3829.96 → 3831.86] and with HDR,
[3831.86 → 3834.24] which nobody
[3834.24 → 3834.96] will be using.
[3836.00 → 3838.56] Also, actually,
[3838.76 → 3840.40] oh, this is
[3840.40 → 3841.00] another very
[3841.00 → 3841.78] important announcement
[3841.78 → 3842.56] for you guys.
[3843.38 → 3844.48] It's official.
[3844.72 → 3845.90] As of today,
[3846.36 → 3847.56] we are going red.
[3848.54 → 3849.50] We were looking
[3849.50 → 3851.30] at our accounting
[3851.30 → 3851.74] books.
[3852.22 → 3853.08] It's almost year
[3853.08 → 3853.36] end.
[3853.84 → 3854.96] So this is the
[3854.96 → 3855.96] time for us to
[3855.96 → 3856.72] make any kinds
[3856.72 → 3858.84] of key investments.
[3858.84 → 3860.66] but we had an
[3860.66 → 3861.30] internal meeting
[3861.30 → 3861.82] and we kind of
[3861.82 → 3862.42] went, okay,
[3862.66 → 3864.52] we've got some
[3864.52 → 3865.22] equipment budget
[3865.22 → 3866.00] left over this
[3866.00 → 3866.24] year.
[3866.68 → 3867.74] Let's talk about
[3867.74 → 3868.42] some stuff we
[3868.42 → 3868.92] need to do.
[3869.14 → 3869.52] So we're going
[3869.52 → 3870.00] to be changing
[3870.00 → 3871.10] up the LTT set
[3871.10 → 3872.74] and we are,
[3873.42 → 3874.24] it came up
[3874.24 → 3875.42] that a big
[3875.42 → 3876.36] mission for us
[3876.36 → 3877.42] is to have
[3877.42 → 3878.34] float plane club
[3878.34 → 3879.28] streaming quality
[3879.28 → 3881.42] be better than
[3881.42 → 3882.10] any other
[3882.10 → 3882.90] streaming video
[3882.90 → 3884.08] quality on the
[3884.08 → 3884.32] web.
[3884.32 → 3885.34] and we kind
[3885.34 → 3885.58] of went,
[3885.72 → 3885.94] okay,
[3886.58 → 3888.36] how are we
[3888.36 → 3888.96] going to achieve
[3888.96 → 3889.28] that,
[3889.50 → 3890.06] shooting on a
[3890.06 → 3891.00] Sony FS5?
[3892.08 → 3892.56] So,
[3892.96 → 3893.72] sometime in
[3893.72 → 3894.50] mid-January,
[3894.62 → 3895.82] our order will
[3895.82 → 3896.28] arrive.
[3896.74 → 3897.54] We will be
[3897.54 → 3899.18] getting two
[3899.18 → 3899.98] red cameras,
[3900.80 → 3901.62] a red weapon
[3901.62 → 3902.62] with 8K sensor
[3902.62 → 3904.02] and a red
[3904.02 → 3904.60] Epic W.
[3905.48 → 3906.18] We are going
[3906.18 → 3906.56] to be getting
[3906.56 → 3907.10] new lenses
[3907.10 → 3908.30] and we are
[3908.30 → 3908.84] going to be
[3908.84 → 3910.40] going full-on
[3910.40 → 3911.56] sharpest
[3911.56 → 3913.40] possible image
[3913.40 → 3913.86] quality.
[3914.32 → 3914.84] So,
[3914.94 → 3915.92] get excited
[3915.92 → 3916.42] guys.
[3916.64 → 3917.50] We've got,
[3918.02 → 3919.44] we used to
[3919.44 → 3920.18] kind of keep
[3920.18 → 3920.98] up with the
[3920.98 → 3922.26] rat race
[3922.26 → 3923.26] that is the
[3923.26 → 3923.98] whole like,
[3925.02 → 3925.40] you know,
[3925.60 → 3926.46] let's be the
[3926.46 → 3927.10] first ones to
[3927.10 → 3928.14] 4K and let's
[3928.14 → 3928.82] get an external
[3928.82 → 3929.54] recorder and
[3929.54 → 3930.12] let's do this
[3930.12 → 3930.52] and let's do
[3930.52 → 3930.74] that.
[3930.80 → 3931.82] But we'd
[3931.82 → 3932.40] allowed ourselves
[3932.40 → 3933.30] to fall behind
[3933.30 → 3934.12] a little bit
[3934.12 → 3935.08] and we are
[3935.08 → 3935.48] not going to
[3935.48 → 3936.16] let that happen
[3936.16 → 3936.80] anymore.
[3937.12 → 3938.14] We are moving
[3938.14 → 3940.66] into a red
[3940.66 → 3941.24] ecosystem.
[3941.68 → 3941.88] So,
[3942.00 → 3943.94] stay tuned
[3943.94 → 3944.62] for that guys.
[3944.72 → 3945.14] It is going
[3945.14 → 3945.62] to be a bit
[3945.62 → 3946.04] of a learning
[3946.04 → 3946.74] curve for us
[3946.74 → 3947.22] but it is
[3947.22 → 3947.90] going to result
[3947.90 → 3948.42] in some
[3948.42 → 3949.26] seriously
[3949.26 → 3950.64] sharp looking
[3950.64 → 3951.42] videos.
[3953.46 → 3954.34] All right.
[3955.76 → 3956.60] Is there much
[3956.60 → 3957.00] else that's
[3957.00 → 3957.62] important here?
[3957.62 → 3960.58] Oh, he's
[3960.58 → 3961.00] still going.
[3962.08 → 3962.52] Oops.
[3963.26 → 3963.62] So, the
[3963.62 → 3964.46] Microsoft Surface
[3964.46 → 3964.98] Hub was
[3964.98 → 3965.84] originally posted
[3965.84 → 3967.14] by Alize
[3967.14 → 3968.68] D2000 on the
[3968.68 → 3968.94] forum.
[3969.04 → 3969.40] The original
[3969.40 → 3970.20] article here is
[3970.20 → 3971.32] from Ars Technica.
[3971.42 → 3971.88] Let's go ahead
[3971.88 → 3972.42] and pop that
[3972.42 → 3972.64] up.
[3973.72 → 3974.44] But the
[3974.44 → 3975.94] surprise hardware
[3975.94 → 3976.38] hit.
[3977.00 → 3977.72] The Surface
[3977.72 → 3978.00] Hub.
[3978.72 → 3979.24] Apparently,
[3979.68 → 3980.52] the conference
[3980.52 → 3981.40] room computer
[3981.40 → 3984.46] is now a
[3984.46 → 3985.32] billion dollar
[3985.32 → 3985.80] business.
[3985.80 → 3986.24] Are you
[3986.24 → 3986.88] freaking kidding
[3986.88 → 3987.12] me?
[3987.66 → 3988.52] I saw this
[3988.52 → 3988.90] thing and I
[3988.90 → 3989.44] went, wow,
[3989.52 → 3990.06] that's a really
[3990.06 → 3990.86] cool proof of
[3990.86 → 3991.24] concept.
[3991.62 → 3992.32] That's pretty
[3992.32 → 3992.72] neat.
[3993.50 → 3994.22] I didn't think
[3994.22 → 3994.94] they'd actually
[3994.94 → 3996.00] sell that many
[3996.00 → 3996.32] of them.
[3996.74 → 3997.60] It went on sale
[3997.60 → 3998.36] earlier this
[3998.36 → 3998.64] year.
[3999.24 → 3999.50] So, the
[3999.50 → 4000.40] conference room
[4000.40 → 4002.28] computer, so the
[4002.28 → 4002.96] Surface range of
[4002.96 → 4003.84] touchscreen computers
[4003.84 → 4004.44] is getting a
[4004.44 → 4005.02] lot bigger.
[4005.12 → 4005.56] The Surface
[4005.56 → 4007.26] Hub is like an
[4007.26 → 4007.74] all-in-one
[4007.74 → 4008.08] system.
[4008.24 → 4008.66] So, it has
[4008.66 → 4009.74] OneNote, Skype
[4009.74 → 4010.36] for business,
[4011.14 → 4011.96] Office, and
[4011.96 → 4012.72] universal Windows
[4012.72 → 4012.98] apps.
[4012.98 → 4013.52] It puts it in
[4013.52 → 4013.94] the conference
[4013.94 → 4014.16] room.
[4014.26 → 4014.74] It's a single
[4014.74 → 4015.62] integrated device.
[4016.20 → 4016.60] They first
[4016.60 → 4017.06] showed it off
[4017.06 → 4017.72] in January.
[4019.94 → 4020.80] It includes
[4020.80 → 4021.60] dual 1080p
[4021.60 → 4022.16] cameras for
[4022.16 → 4022.98] video conferencing.
[4023.52 → 4023.90] They run a
[4023.90 → 4024.54] special version
[4024.54 → 4024.96] of Windows
[4024.96 → 4025.36] 10.
[4025.92 → 4026.52] The big one
[4026.52 → 4027.20] supports an
[4027.20 → 4027.96] 84-inch,
[4028.02 → 4028.70] 120Hz,
[4028.84 → 4030.46] 3840x2160
[4030.46 → 4031.26] screen, packs a
[4031.26 → 4031.92] fourth-generation
[4031.92 → 4032.50] Intel Core
[4032.50 → 4033.62] i7, paired
[4033.62 → 4033.92] with an
[4033.92 → 4034.90] NVIDIA Squadron
[4034.90 → 4036.14] K2200 graphics
[4036.14 → 4036.42] card.
[4036.52 → 4036.70] And the
[4036.70 → 4037.66] smaller one is
[4037.66 → 4038.40] 55-inch,
[4038.46 → 4039.14] 120Hz,
[4039.46 → 4040.12] 1080p,
[4040.20 → 4040.56] uses a
[4040.56 → 4041.22] Core i5.
[4041.22 → 4042.12] They've both
[4042.12 → 4043.16] got 128GB
[4043.16 → 4043.50] SSD,
[4043.70 → 4044.48] 8GB of RAM.
[4044.80 → 4045.30] They don't
[4045.30 → 4045.96] just replace a
[4045.96 → 4046.30] whiteboard,
[4046.38 → 4046.98] but a projector
[4046.98 → 4047.58] as well.
[4047.90 → 4048.60] And both of
[4048.60 → 4049.20] them work as
[4049.20 → 4050.20] Miracast receivers
[4050.20 → 4051.18] and have
[4051.18 → 4052.22] HDMI VGA
[4052.22 → 4052.98] inputs as
[4052.98 → 4053.34] well.
[4053.90 → 4054.78] So, tell me
[4054.78 → 4055.12] something.
[4055.68 → 4056.32] Do you guys
[4056.32 → 4056.98] want to see a
[4056.98 → 4057.72] review of a
[4057.72 → 4058.34] Surface Hub?
[4059.30 → 4060.24] Like, we
[4060.24 → 4060.72] looked at it,
[4060.76 → 4061.02] and we went,
[4061.14 → 4061.82] oh, sure,
[4061.90 → 4062.38] that's kind of
[4062.38 → 4063.16] neat, but like,
[4063.56 → 4064.40] we never even
[4064.40 → 4065.78] thought to
[4065.78 → 4066.40] request one.
[4066.64 → 4067.12] And we've
[4067.12 → 4067.86] actually got a
[4067.86 → 4068.52] Surface Studio,
[4068.64 → 4069.22] one of only,
[4069.28 → 4069.64] what is it,
[4069.96 → 4070.50] four in the
[4070.50 → 4070.82] country?
[4071.22 → 4071.92] Two, I think?
[4071.94 → 4072.36] Two in the
[4072.36 → 4072.74] country,
[4073.12 → 4074.08] and Luke's
[4074.08 → 4074.68] working on a
[4074.68 → 4075.34] review of that
[4075.34 → 4076.22] right now.
[4076.54 → 4076.80] Yes.
[4076.98 → 4077.84] And, uh,
[4077.96 → 4078.18] hey.
[4078.32 → 4078.90] Well, not like
[4078.90 → 4080.12] right now.
[4080.18 → 4080.90] Right now he's
[4080.90 → 4081.16] doing it.
[4081.16 → 4081.84] Right now I'm on
[4081.84 → 4083.08] WAN show.
[4083.32 → 4083.80] But soon.
[4084.30 → 4085.00] And maybe a
[4085.00 → 4085.66] great follow-up to
[4085.66 → 4085.96] that would be
[4085.96 → 4086.66] the Surface Hub.
[4087.20 → 4087.46] Yes.
[4087.62 → 4088.16] So thanks for
[4088.16 → 4088.72] tuning into the
[4088.72 → 4089.12] WAN show,
[4089.20 → 4089.66] you guys.
[4090.60 → 4091.60] We will see you
[4091.60 → 4092.18] again next week.
[4092.20 → 4092.94] One quick thing
[4092.94 → 4093.54] before we go.
[4093.68 → 4094.36] Did you see that?
[4094.36 → 4094.70] No, we're not
[4094.70 → 4095.18] talking about
[4095.18 → 4095.76] Nostalgics.
[4095.82 → 4096.32] It was in last
[4096.32 → 4096.96] week's WAN show.
[4097.22 → 4097.62] Oh, no, no,
[4097.64 → 4098.06] that's not until
[4098.06 → 4098.46] this weekend,
[4098.46 → 4098.86] so we'll talk
[4098.86 → 4099.28] about that next
[4099.28 → 4099.46] week.
[4099.68 → 4100.46] But, um,
[4100.50 → 4102.52] did you see the
[4102.52 → 4103.34] GIF thing?
[4103.76 → 4104.90] And the, and the,
[4104.90 → 4105.62] and the Tech
[4105.62 → 4106.36] Quickie episode
[4106.36 → 4106.80] thing?
[4107.00 → 4107.60] No, I didn't.
[4107.68 → 4108.32] Okay, it's, it's
[4108.32 → 4108.58] short.
[4108.84 → 4109.20] It's short.
[4109.20 → 4109.88] I don't know
[4109.88 → 4110.36] where it is.
[4110.60 → 4111.10] Just look for
[4111.10 → 4111.36] GIF.
[4112.72 → 4113.54] What is this?
[4114.06 → 4114.98] Yes, okay, yeah.
[4115.04 → 4115.68] So just watch
[4115.68 → 4116.04] the GIF.
[4116.22 → 4116.70] It's, it's
[4116.70 → 4117.18] wonderful.
[4117.18 → 4118.30] Watch it with
[4118.30 → 4119.02] the stream?
[4119.50 → 4119.98] Yes.
[4120.30 → 4120.62] Okay.
[4121.26 → 4121.62] Okay.
[4122.42 → 4123.20] So here you
[4123.20 → 4123.36] go.
[4123.50 → 4123.98] Let's go
[4123.98 → 4124.38] Linus'
[4124.52 → 4124.94] screen.
[4128.04 → 4128.44] ATM.
[4129.10 → 4129.36] Yeah?
[4130.12 → 4131.02] Yeah, okay.
[4132.22 → 4132.84] What is this?
[4133.12 → 4133.58] Do you see
[4133.58 → 4133.94] what just
[4133.94 → 4134.28] happened?
[4134.42 → 4134.80] What, wait,
[4134.84 → 4135.00] what?
[4137.64 → 4138.30] We'll let it
[4138.30 → 4138.64] play through
[4138.64 → 4138.94] again.
[4139.16 → 4139.66] I want to,
[4139.78 → 4141.16] like, GIF
[4141.16 → 4141.72] sometimes you
[4141.72 → 4142.06] need another
[4142.06 → 4142.36] take.
[4143.12 → 4143.90] So see this
[4143.90 → 4144.34] screen and
[4144.34 → 4144.60] everything?
[4144.74 → 4144.98] See how it
[4144.98 → 4145.48] goes up?
[4145.80 → 4146.14] Yeah.
[4146.36 → 4147.02] See it again?
[4148.04 → 4148.48] Yeah.
[4149.14 → 4149.70] So you know
[4149.70 → 4151.20] how, in this
[4151.20 → 4151.74] Tech Cookie
[4151.74 → 4152.48] that I linked
[4152.48 → 4153.42] here, we talk
[4153.42 → 4153.84] about chip
[4153.84 → 4154.50] cards and the
[4154.50 → 4155.08] security that
[4155.08 → 4155.84] comes with
[4155.84 → 4156.60] chip cards.
[4157.02 → 4157.76] And the idea
[4157.76 → 4158.32] that someone
[4158.32 → 4159.66] might put a
[4159.66 → 4160.78] cover on the
[4160.78 → 4161.52] card reader that
[4161.52 → 4162.40] skims your card
[4162.40 → 4162.88] when it goes
[4162.88 → 4163.20] through.
[4164.86 → 4166.12] I'm pretty sure
[4166.12 → 4166.82] I hosted that
[4166.82 → 4167.00] one.
[4167.00 → 4167.98] Who the hell
[4167.98 → 4169.14] installed that?
[4169.44 → 4170.48] And in this
[4170.48 → 4171.66] situation, they
[4171.66 → 4172.76] went even more
[4172.76 → 4174.12] hardcore and
[4174.12 → 4175.28] installed, like,
[4175.60 → 4178.58] essentially an
[4178.58 → 4180.14] entire ATM on
[4180.14 → 4180.98] top of the one
[4180.98 → 4181.54] that was there.
[4181.54 → 4182.54] thing.
[4182.54 → 4183.20] How would
[4183.20 → 4183.78] anybody not
[4183.78 → 4184.42] notice?
[4186.06 → 4186.84] I'm assuming
[4186.84 → 4187.50] that looks like
[4187.50 → 4188.98] some crazy, like,
[4189.22 → 4190.14] foam seal thing
[4190.14 → 4190.70] at the top.
[4191.60 → 4192.76] What the hell?
[4192.76 → 4193.24] So they must
[4193.24 → 4193.82] have just walked
[4193.82 → 4194.34] in and just
[4194.34 → 4198.14] unbelievable.
[4198.82 → 4199.22] Isn't that
[4199.22 → 4199.70] crazy?
[4199.70 → 4200.70] Yeah.
[4200.70 → 4200.84] Yeah.
[4204.22 → 4204.84] Alright, so
[4204.84 → 4205.18] thanks for
[4205.18 → 4205.80] watching, guys.
[4205.86 → 4206.20] We'll see you
[4206.20 → 4206.76] again next week.
[4206.84 → 4207.32] Same bat
[4207.32 → 4208.32] time, same
[4208.32 → 4209.58] bat channel.
[4210.72 → 4211.60] Brink, brink,
[4211.82 → 4212.56] brink, brink,
[4212.64 → 4212.78] brink.
[4212.84 → 4213.36] There's no music
[4213.36 → 4213.78] in this one.
[4214.04 → 4214.78] It's not playing
[4214.78 → 4216.34] back MP4s properly
[4216.34 → 4217.02] for some reason.
[4217.30 → 4218.14] So this is like
[4218.14 → 4218.90] an MOV.
[4219.54 → 4220.40] No, that's not
[4220.40 → 4220.86] the music.
[4220.98 → 4221.48] You're doing it
[4221.48 → 4221.80] wrong.
[4222.44 → 4223.04] No, no.
[4223.26 → 4224.10] Everything you do
[4224.10 → 4224.84] today is wrong.
[4224.84 → 4226.12] Book, book,
[4226.22 → 4226.28] book, book,
[4226.28 → 4229.26] everything.
[4230.52 → 4231.00] Everything.
[4231.40 → 4231.78] At least I
[4231.78 → 4232.12] finished that
[4232.12 → 4232.38] video.
[4232.56 → 4233.28] I fixed it.
[4233.42 → 4234.02] Only like
[4234.02 → 4234.92] super late,
[4235.06 → 4235.84] but I did it.
[4237.30 → 4238.08] Oh, boy.
