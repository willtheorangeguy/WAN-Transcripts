Mistake in the timestamps. 28:55 should be changed to 29:55 for the hyperloop.

What's with the video quality guys? looks like it was filmed in Europe in the 90's lol. The timestamps don't even match up. Who's uploading your vids? Does anyone review them before posting? Good news though.

+LinusTechTips The Timestamps are wrong! They're the ones of an old WAN Show(I think the one of last week or the week before). 
Just a remark: I obviously am less informed than you but the rumor about the SLI being restricted to two cards is wrong! Jay confirmed he'll be upgrade to 3 way SLI with the new 1080 and he spoke about it with nVidia. He can't tell how yet because of NDA but he's strongly remarked that few times. And also EVGA removed the note on the forum regarding that!
So it will be possible to do 3 way or quad SLI also with Pascal!
Aside from that great show! At one point in my life I'll try to see one live, bur it's hard for my time zone(Italy) xD
