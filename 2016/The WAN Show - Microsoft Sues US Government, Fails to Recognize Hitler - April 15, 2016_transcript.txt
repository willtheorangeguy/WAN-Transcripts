[0.00 --> 6.66]  because you know there's nothing quite like a good sneeze you know and then when you don't you
[6.66 --> 13.64]  just have kind of like that kind of itchy runny nose feeling it's not very pleasant
[13.64 --> 23.74]  not a fan but you know what i am a fan of the wan show and that my friends is what you're
[23.74 --> 29.54]  watching right now welcome to the wan show it's friday we're live for the whole nose thing yeah
[29.54 --> 35.44]  okay that's okay all right don't worry don't worry the the nose is live i almost sang me it's friday
[35.44 --> 40.48]  song and then i started to hate myself so much that i stopped wow that literally just happened
[40.48 --> 45.86]  i was like i was like gonna sing it and then i just had like a crushing personal defeat and i
[45.86 --> 56.98]  stopped probably a good thing yeah yeah that's fair um all right we have news today one of them is that
[56.98 --> 61.62]  in the philippines there was a massive leak of data and if you're from there you should probably
[61.62 --> 69.00]  care yeah pretty much also a thing that hosted azeroth was shut down and if you're from there
[69.00 --> 73.90]  do you care if you're from azeroth you care actually you could be from earth and you might care too
[73.90 --> 78.36]  that's true you have to spend a lot of time in your basement on earth that's also true that's a
[78.36 --> 85.92]  stereotype literally accurate for me stereotypes hurt ever hurt us all that's right though uh microsoft
[85.92 --> 93.76]  is suing the u.s government over their gag orders and uh and their requests to effectively invade
[93.76 --> 104.96]  microsoft's users privacy and the volocopter is the first certified manned multi-copter
[104.96 --> 112.40]  more on this at 11. now my understanding is the intro doesn't have music right now for some reason
[112.40 --> 116.96]  why i'm not sure why every once in a while it just does that but it's okay
[116.96 --> 120.08]  do do do do do no i don't feel like it today
[120.08 --> 123.90]  you don't even know what the song sounds like do you
[123.90 --> 127.76]  don't sing that we could get a copyright strike
[127.76 --> 137.12]  changing the song wait a minute go i don't want to get a copyright strike from where the heck
[137.12 --> 144.60]  mass drop okay mass drop drawed ups drawed ups slash you should there you go be fresh i heard
[144.60 --> 150.60]  they might be changing it again what really yeah it wasn't me a screenshot is it because of us
[150.60 --> 156.66]  maybe i don't know i saw an ad today that was you should like i saw a banner ad today that was you
[156.66 --> 164.64]  should um speaking of you should um you should be a jacktastic mofo that is to say if you were the
[164.64 --> 171.44]  one who posted this original article from tom's hardware on the forum what a segue microsoft says
[171.44 --> 179.98]  secret data requests are now the norm sues everyone in the country named norman a very
[179.98 --> 186.00]  unusual and unexpected response to such a thing no actually they sue the u.s government and if you
[186.00 --> 192.70]  can read you already knew that because it says it right on my screen over there basically in a
[192.70 --> 198.60]  nutshell microsoft oh no i was pointing to i know i went the wrong way i pointed this way then it's like
[198.60 --> 208.08]  oh wait oh dang i pointed at the screen the screen's there no no no no um all right so yeah
[208.08 --> 212.86]  so what do we got what do we got for our notes here let me bring them up so microsoft filed a lawsuit in
[212.86 --> 218.88]  federal court against the u.s government over its expanding use of gag orders for data requests which
[218.88 --> 228.02]  effectively means that microsoft sends a data request but then also often with no expiry date
[228.02 --> 234.54]  tells microsoft that they are not allowed to inform the person whose personal information they are
[234.54 --> 241.80]  disclosing to the government that any request was made which is which is ridiculous because i mean if
[241.80 --> 249.90]  the if the police want to enter your home unless they have a search warrant they have to knock on the
[249.90 --> 257.34]  door and be like yo are you in there you can be like yo i'm not and then they and then they leave
[257.34 --> 263.84]  in theory unless they do it illegally unless they do it illegally yeah but for some reason this has
[263.84 --> 270.56]  been going on for years now so basically microsoft believes that these orders violate the first
[270.56 --> 275.86]  amendment so the freedom of speech and of the press by disallowing the company to talk to its customers
[275.86 --> 280.74]  and they have requested that the department of justice immediately issue a new policy restricting the
[280.74 --> 287.58]  out of control gag orders from law enforcement if that doesn't happen they request congress to amend
[287.58 --> 294.98]  the electronic communications protection act to require government notice for warrants so um i think
[294.98 --> 301.02]  that should be a thing yeah i mean they're like basic rights this isn't the first time that microsoft
[301.02 --> 305.60]  has filed a lawsuit against the united states government to protect their customer privacy
[305.60 --> 311.46]  um but they have only done so when they considered the government's requests to be out of bounds
[311.46 --> 316.50]  and i think the out of bounds here is just the sheer fact that it's it's probably it's normal now
[316.50 --> 322.06]  and that being normal is kind of insane yeah because it's one thing for the government to be like
[322.06 --> 328.12]  yo there's like uh you know ongoing investigation who killed a lot of people and we can't unlock his phone
[328.12 --> 336.12]  say for example yeah just an example yeah um that's one thing but what microsoft is objecting to here
[336.12 --> 343.90]  is that they're basically just a a data collection service for the government when damn it that's
[343.90 --> 350.60]  their data to exploit yeah they need to sell ads yeah the fbi can't be selling ads how are they going
[350.60 --> 356.32]  to target us with the services and products that we so desperately need imagine the fbi decided to start
[356.32 --> 364.24]  funding themselves by starting an ad agency sometimes i just come up with the worst ideas
[364.24 --> 367.98]  and if people did them everything would just be really bad
[367.98 --> 377.34]  oh my it's like can can you be slightly less terrible it's like why do we give people these ideas
[377.34 --> 384.24]  it's not the first time it's happened on this show no the sony and microsoft uh drive bay things
[384.24 --> 390.00]  what was it i don't actually remember that one you get a module for xbox one or playstation 4
[390.00 --> 395.76]  that looks like an optical drive you install it in your computer it's an encrypted locked down system
[395.76 --> 399.66]  oh yeah and it makes it so you can play those games but powered by your computer's hardware
[399.66 --> 404.12]  right on your computer that's actually a really good idea though i do want that and the and the bay
[404.12 --> 409.18]  should just cost as much as a console so there's literally no drawback for them
[409.18 --> 414.50]  and you should like have to water cool it or something that'd be yeah that'd be cool the reason
[414.50 --> 422.30]  to water cool again yes uh on the subject of microsoft this was posted by trickstarry on the
[422.30 --> 430.02]  forum original article here is from cnn money trickstarry so it's probably microsoft builds new ai bot
[430.02 --> 437.90]  designed specifically to ignore hitler because we all know what a disaster it was last time uh they
[437.90 --> 445.82]  released an ai bot on twitter who became a sex fiend hitler lover within a matter of mere hours i
[445.82 --> 449.26]  actually thought that was a very interesting social experiment i thought it was very interesting too
[449.26 --> 455.42]  i think it super hardcore backed up uh musk and everyone else in that realm that is like we should
[455.42 --> 461.66]  probably be a little bit careful about ai stuff yeah yeah so this one is pretty different um it's
[461.66 --> 467.98]  actually called damn it i forget what it's called caption bot that's right so caption bot which sounds
[467.98 --> 473.90]  way more boring lets you upload an image it doesn't know what this is though you know it should just
[473.90 --> 479.90]  say cover of time magazine you know there's a workaround so caption bot allows you to upload an
[479.90 --> 485.58]  image and their examples work pretty well so oh okay well there you go and it will analyze the image and
[485.58 --> 490.78]  say what it is oh i think it's a young man jumping in the air on a skateboard let me see if i can
[490.78 --> 495.66]  get this so you guys can actually see the whole dang caption here yay touch screen okay so that's
[495.66 --> 502.30]  pretty good let's try another not not a canned one i created some examples oh so we'll start with a uh
[502.30 --> 508.22]  wanshow thumbnail oh my god analyzing image have you done this yet i'm not really confident but i think
[508.22 --> 515.02]  it's a stuffed animal and he seems he seems oh that's not too bad uh actually last time it said
[515.02 --> 520.46]  it was a man and a stuffed animal oh i wasn't sure which of us was the man and which was the uh cuddly
[520.46 --> 533.34]  bear oh my god let's try another shall we hmm a mouse is it i think it's a cell phone actually a fairly
[533.34 --> 538.22]  fair guess that would be okay based on that it does have a number pad on the side for some freaking
[538.22 --> 548.86]  reason yeah that's with that said i've never dialed a 12. okay good call try another upload no i don't
[548.86 --> 555.10]  want to use your photos shut up obviously your photos are going to work all right what else we got here
[555.10 --> 559.34]  okay okay so i picked up some picked out some thumbnails i'm trying to figure out how good our
[559.34 --> 566.46]  thumbnails are i think it's a picture of a car all right good job good job caption bot let's try it
[566.46 --> 574.94]  it needs to be more confident yeah it's a picture of a car i mean okay this really feels like you should
[574.94 --> 585.66]  get this right because it does literally say apple watch literally not a cell phone apple watch i see why
[585.66 --> 591.10]  it's grabbing cell phone i don't think it should also look at like dimensions like it's grabbing
[591.10 --> 598.86]  a cell phone because the screen and stuff yeah oh i see relative dimensions of the items on the screen
[599.42 --> 603.74]  and because there's not that many aspect ratio it could just be like samsung in easy mode
[604.30 --> 609.82]  like grandpa mode you know they have that right okay so i got one more for you guys i think this is my
[609.82 --> 614.94]  favorite one twitch plays pokemon is in the stream oh apparently twitch plays pokemon is in the stream
[614.94 --> 619.02]  hi oh it gave me a different answer last time but this is good too
[622.38 --> 630.38]  what a clock that's on a surfboard yeah okay okay caption bot uh last time it told me it was a sign
[630.38 --> 636.22]  attached to a lamp post try it again see what it does like in rapid succession
[636.22 --> 642.78]  so is it learning then is it trying to get better basically the answer is that ed's artwork is
[642.78 --> 648.78]  terrible can you tell it what it actually is can you can you do this what are you doing it's just
[648.78 --> 657.10]  like no what are you doing caption bot what what what caption bot what are you doing upload photo
[657.66 --> 664.94]  no this one open oh i broke it i officially broke caption bot it's done no linus couldn't it's over and it
[664.94 --> 670.46]  didn't even take the hitler pictures this time it was it was a picture that animated you and me
[670.46 --> 676.22]  that's kind of that's unfortunate we broke caption bot it was like no these people are far too evil
[676.94 --> 678.78]  htc announces
[681.50 --> 683.82]  the htc one billion
[685.58 --> 692.46]  because numbers have no meaning anymore first we had the one then we had the one
[692.46 --> 697.58]  followed by the one and now we've got the 10
[699.58 --> 705.98]  okay though but seriously the one m7 m8 and m9 were the predecessors so now we've done away with the m
[705.98 --> 710.94]  we've done away with the one and we're just the 10. so this was originally posted by doc swag on the
[710.94 --> 718.94]  forum the original article here is from anand tech posted by a monsieur joshua ho who has a hands-on with
[718.94 --> 728.22]  the htc 10 calling it a fresh start look at these pictures taken outside so pretty good job joshua joshua
[728.22 --> 733.82]  is like a photo dork so i suspect anything he did with respect to the exposure was done on purpose
[733.82 --> 739.42]  for art purposes i believe personally that nothing is good until brandon says that it is
[739.42 --> 748.54]  that is the kind of sheeple thinking that if batman versus superman is said to be bad by everyone
[749.50 --> 754.30]  if brandon did that's to say it was good i don't know but if brandon says that it's good brandon
[754.30 --> 760.30]  therefore it is good it was batman versus superman good he says therefore it is
[760.30 --> 767.90]  eh but it can't be bad it's just eh that is how motion picture and still photo works no because
[767.90 --> 773.98]  no because brandon's personal biases are very real and very existent i mean he would go into the
[773.98 --> 782.22]  revenant and say it's the most amazing thing ever because he loves the director even if the even if
[782.22 --> 790.70]  even if the premise well even if the entire movie was basically unwatchable for me for the same reason
[790.70 --> 798.62]  that the thomas covenant series of books just gets to the point where it's like what because when the
[798.62 --> 810.06]  writer can't do anything other than he was closer to the brink of death than he had been before but then
[810.06 --> 815.02]  he pulled through it didn't like happen and then he became even closer to the brink of death but like
[815.02 --> 820.46]  i think it like and then yeah but happened is relative i was watching a great documentary on
[820.46 --> 828.70]  curiosity stream um where the guy who finds the holy lance okay when they're like trapped in some
[828.70 --> 837.26]  city or some nonsense and inspires the the christian crusader army to fight back against the the hordes of
[837.26 --> 842.46]  enemies outside the wall who they did defeat that definitely did happen from accounts on both sides
[842.46 --> 850.86]  of the conflict says he's gonna prove that the lance is real with a trial by ordeal okay he says he's
[850.86 --> 860.22]  gonna walk through a bonfire and if he survives then you know god says the lance is real and no trial by
[860.22 --> 864.94]  ordeal is a thing just like trial by combat like if you won you were you were right i i wouldn't want
[864.94 --> 869.42]  a trial by combat against this guy it wouldn't matter if i was right anyway i think that's kind
[869.42 --> 875.74]  of how that stuff worked back then yeah pretty much so he volunteers to do a trial by ordeal where
[875.74 --> 883.42]  he walks through a bonfire there are eyewitness accounts that he walked through completely unscathed
[883.42 --> 891.18]  untouched by the flame and lived there are other eyewitness accounts that he was covered in burns and
[891.18 --> 901.18]  all the accounts agree he died shortly afterwards you can't have it both ways i mean he died from
[901.18 --> 908.06]  something completely unrelated is that is that how it happened so basically anything that's word of mouth
[908.70 --> 915.90]  i'm kind of looking at going you know what screw off because that didn't happen you weren't being carried on
[915.90 --> 927.42]  a board and like unable to move to save your son who is being i i don't know if is that is that a
[927.42 --> 932.06]  is that a spoiler it happens within like the first 10 minutes i mean i just ruined it so well yeah so
[932.06 --> 937.74]  basically i'm we made you the bad guy so you don't go from not able to move at all and like like full of
[937.74 --> 943.90]  infection you also said those things to no but that also happens like very early on to the things that
[943.90 --> 950.46]  happen later in that in that period of time that not is not a thing so especially wasn't a thing
[950.46 --> 955.10]  with medicine being what it was there so my suspension of disbelief only goes so far you have
[955.10 --> 961.26]  to you have to exist within whatever world it is okay i'm gonna derail this a little bit for a second
[961.26 --> 965.90]  fine because one thing we have to move on there are no trains in the movie we have a billion topics
[965.90 --> 972.06]  you can't derail it someone in the chat was like trial by twitch that would actually be amazing
[972.06 --> 978.70]  so you have you know how roasts were like a thing for a little while yeah they should just scratch
[978.70 --> 984.46]  that whole concept and then just start having celebrity roasts where someone just sits in front
[984.46 --> 994.06]  of a camera and just gets wrecked by twitch chat oh no one would survive it no that's not even a roast
[994.06 --> 1001.98]  that's just evil murder yeah yeah that's just mean well that's kind of like trial by ordeal all right
[1001.98 --> 1009.02]  so let's get back back on topic here back to the htc 10. they wanted to oh you know what i'm not going
[1009.02 --> 1013.74]  to talk about with the name because there is no logic i don't care what their reasoning was uh it's
[1013.74 --> 1022.14]  got a snapdragon 820 4 gigs of lpdd r4 memory 32 or 64 gigs of nan plus micro sd expansion oh nice um
[1022.14 --> 1029.98]  it is not an ssd or like mvme ssd based storage solution it is still using uh whatever it's called
[1029.98 --> 1034.70]  it's not in my notes i was reading an article about emmc but it's like gen whatever it's better
[1034.70 --> 1039.82]  it's faster up to 150 megabyte per second sequential rights which sequential doesn't necessarily tell us
[1039.82 --> 1043.66]  everything we need to know but that is significantly faster than emmc solutions from the past
[1044.22 --> 1051.18]  so htc claims that the storage is not going to significantly harm the uh the 10's performance
[1051.18 --> 1058.38]  it's got a 5.2 inch 1440p super lcd 5 display no amoled which should allow them to skirt the issues
[1058.38 --> 1063.34]  of burn-in but have to face head-on the issues of increased power consumption though they claim it
[1063.34 --> 1068.62]  is more power efficient than the galaxy s7 with the same 3000 milliamp hour non-replaceable battery
[1068.62 --> 1074.30]  it has a 12 megapixel rear-facing camera which optical image stabilization good job colton
[1076.78 --> 1080.54]  also have you noticed just to rank on colton for a second the last two weeks
[1080.54 --> 1085.98]  is just like the very beginning of both docs it's like microsoft and then we go into other things
[1086.54 --> 1091.90]  it's almost like he's trying to create a crappy one show doc because honestly i felt like he's letting
[1091.90 --> 1096.14]  the quality slip consistently over the last little while like this is the worst one we've seen in
[1096.14 --> 1101.98]  at least a month yep so basically horrible uh he did manage though i'll give him this to include that
[1101.98 --> 1107.50]  the five megapixel front-facing camera has optical image stabilization as well he bought you lunch and
[1107.50 --> 1112.22]  you still ragged on him you acquired you're a bad person i paid um it's got a capacitive fingerprint
[1112.22 --> 1118.38]  sensor that they claim responds in as little as 200 milliseconds features qualcomm quick charge 3.0 usb
[1118.38 --> 1123.18]  3.1 over usb type c which is pretty freaking cool because if you pull pictures off of your phone
[1123.18 --> 1130.94]  manually like i still do just because i don't know it helps me keep organized um then that's a really nice
[1130.94 --> 1137.26]  thing to have and they're claiming 92 ntsc color reproduction for the display which is about 96 of adobe rgb
[1137.74 --> 1146.38]  they have abandoned however the front-facing dual speaker setup no yes they have oh so it does still
[1146.38 --> 1152.14]  have two speakers one is a sort of highs and mids tuned front-facing speaker that also acts as your
[1152.14 --> 1155.98]  handset speaker when you have the phone against your head hello you know talking to people like this
[1155.98 --> 1160.78]  and the other one is a more bass tuned rear-facing one this reduces the bezel size but they claim
[1162.14 --> 1167.42]  that they have been able to retain the front-facing audio quality that htc users have come to expect
[1167.50 --> 1176.46]  so i guess we'll find out um yes uh in response to all of the bazillion of you asking in my galaxy
[1176.46 --> 1183.58]  s7 review which finally went live last night i will be doing a review of the htc 10 however you will
[1183.58 --> 1189.42]  have to wait because i just wrapped up my iphone se video which i'm going to film probably monday
[1189.42 --> 1194.78]  morning so i'm switching to the lgg5 i'll have to use that for a couple of weeks and then i will do
[1194.78 --> 1201.50]  the htc 10 i know it makes my phone videos much later than everyone else who is already posting
[1201.50 --> 1206.78]  they're like hands-on first impression unboxing and then probably a couple days from now we'll have
[1206.78 --> 1211.66]  their reviews up but i like to think that the difference between my phone reviews and everyone
[1211.66 --> 1216.94]  else's is that while i do not pretty much touch on like performance numbers at all there's a lot of
[1216.94 --> 1223.02]  things that i really don't do as well as anyone else um i like to think that i try to capture the
[1223.02 --> 1228.70]  experience of using it for an extended period of time which requires me to actually use it so there
[1228.70 --> 1234.78]  you have it i will be switching to it as my daily driver once i'm done with the g5 uh so we don't
[1234.78 --> 1241.50]  have an original poster from the forum on this one but the philippines data breach election hack thing
[1241.50 --> 1251.10]  this was posted by james temperton over at wire.co.uk is that i quote freaking huge he's from the uk i
[1251.10 --> 1257.66]  would have thought it would be like bloody massive yeah that's more something i would say yeah freaking
[1257.66 --> 1262.86]  huge is like literally about as american as it gets i basically wrote this time james maybe he is
[1262.86 --> 1270.94]  american look at this guy look at this guy he's a hipster dude i do appreciate his beard though
[1270.94 --> 1276.46]  the beard is pretty majestic it's pretty fantastic yeah and like the i like the hair too he's got
[1276.46 --> 1282.06]  good hair he's he's got good hair overall i mean he got me the shirt's on so i can't tell if it's like
[1282.06 --> 1289.58]  overall good hair but right you know yes maybe another maybe in another dentist like moaning i don't
[1289.58 --> 1302.30]  know maybe it hurts oh yeah purple these girth parks right oh can you not wow in front of the children
[1303.66 --> 1310.14]  brand is not a children that's true child um all right so multiple small people
[1312.70 --> 1321.82]  this is kind of a big deal um if you participated in the election in the philippines then um yeah
[1321.82 --> 1331.50]  your fingerprint records are basically leaked things are bad so 228 605 email addresses 1.3 million
[1331.50 --> 1337.66]  passport numbers and 15.8 fingerprint records i'm just gonna read off yours looking down my maybe i am
[1337.66 --> 1343.10]  maybe that's where i got all the information from he's got a tattoo of all of that information
[1343.82 --> 1349.42]  uh if you lose a passport you can change it you like things can be solved but one of the problems is
[1349.42 --> 1356.78]  that the passport numbers and expiry dates for overseas filipino workers have leaked as well which is like
[1357.50 --> 1363.42]  not great so it's probably not going to be 1.3 million passport numbers for overseas filipino workers
[1363.42 --> 1370.70]  which like to get this fixed i wouldn't be super surprised if you had to physically go back uh 15.8
[1370.70 --> 1377.42]  million fingerprint records um which is like this is this is this is great security expert troy hunt
[1377.42 --> 1385.74]  told wired um short of using a belt sander you can't change a fingerprint and even that doesn't work by the
[1385.74 --> 1397.82]  way uh so losing a password big deal losing fingerprint data huge deal uh apparently chris johnson said that
[1397.82 --> 1403.42]  it's the data not the image itself yeah so it's more like uh it's more like a mathematical representation
[1403.42 --> 1409.42]  of the fingerprint not the actual image of the fingerprint hashtag who cares helps a little bit you
[1409.42 --> 1413.98]  should be able to rebuild it in theory you should be able to rebuild the parts of matter in theory someone
[1413.98 --> 1419.90]  could potentially rebuild it but it would be more difficult to use that information for identity
[1419.90 --> 1426.22]  fraud or anything else like that although here comes an open source tool that maps a fingerprint to
[1426.22 --> 1432.22]  your mathematical data of a fingerprint the leaked database was a mess apparently file names suggesting
[1432.22 --> 1437.82]  hasty copy pasting of old versions and the attack took place on march 27th the group describing itself
[1437.82 --> 1443.10]  as anonymous which basically doesn't mean anything yeah i know a surprising number of people that think
[1443.10 --> 1452.22]  anonymous is a group which it kind of sorta has done sorta maybe for some things sometimes right except
[1452.22 --> 1457.50]  that also not really also not really because it's usually like small groups that all band together
[1457.50 --> 1465.02]  and then say that they are or don't or don't yeah yeah so like but no like like like i've talked to
[1465.02 --> 1471.42]  people who are who think that anonymous like has like a you know a leader and like and like everyone
[1471.42 --> 1480.62]  like knows each other and stuff but who is this for chan yeah exactly that's what i want to know back at 11.
[1480.62 --> 1491.18]  so the data has been since mirrored and widely shared um yeah so there you go correct
[1492.86 --> 1498.30]  on a more amusing note this was originally posted by duck dodgers that the uk government has set up an
[1498.30 --> 1508.46]  international olympics of esports the first two-day e-games competition set for rio alongside the actual
[1509.02 --> 1515.42]  olympics now i think instead of like instead of like carrying a torch through your country you carry
[1515.42 --> 1521.42]  like a minecraft torch you go like a really big minecraft map where is our minecraft run for like a
[1521.42 --> 1529.02]  week we had one it used to be i don't know where it is did you find it no it used to be right here
[1529.02 --> 1533.50]  like a week ago oh someone moved our minecraft torch i totally want it now
[1536.94 --> 1541.98]  okay that's that's a shame anyway um so we do have some more information about that
[1541.98 --> 1551.34]  not much mind you um it's a medal only competition any nation is welcome to field an e-team in the e-games
[1551.34 --> 1556.22]  four countries are confirmed so far as of last week or the week before whenever this was actually in the
[1556.22 --> 1563.50]  doc this is not a new article britain canada brazil and the usa and it is unknown exactly which games
[1563.50 --> 1574.78]  um will be featured so there you go the thing that offends me though about this headline offends me yeah
[1578.06 --> 1583.02]  excuse me why is the physical olympics the actual olympics
[1583.02 --> 1592.70]  is this not an equally valid olympics i'm just kidding um yeah no that's cool i mean i don't
[1592.70 --> 1598.62]  necessarily think that with all the issues there are around the structure of the olympics that we
[1598.62 --> 1606.30]  actually that esports needs an equivalent to the olympics um especially at the pace that esports moves
[1606.30 --> 1611.50]  i mean can you imagine only having having like a grand competition every four years yeah it would be
[1611.50 --> 1617.66]  completely different games being played completely different sets of athletes probably e-athletes
[1617.66 --> 1625.98]  excuse me sorry um completely different sets like it wouldn't even like you'd go from one where like
[1625.98 --> 1630.86]  everything is played on like controllers to one where everyone has clued in and uses a keyboard and
[1630.86 --> 1636.86]  mouse to one where everyone is using motion controllers and vr headsets and that could realistically
[1636.86 --> 1643.10]  happen in eight years yeah completely oh my goodness one thing okay just to talk about olympics for a
[1643.10 --> 1647.02]  very short period of time one thing i don't understand there's massive like financial problems with the
[1647.02 --> 1653.50]  olympics why don't they hold it in the same place twice in a row and then move on because that would be
[1653.50 --> 1662.14]  smart i've never understood that or just like you don't have to rebuild or revisit like past locations but
[1662.14 --> 1673.10]  very recently past locations well china's hosting it again but not in beijing so okay yeah cool
[1674.38 --> 1678.70]  why do we have to spend money on these buildings all the time china's crazy i've been watching a lot
[1678.70 --> 1684.46]  of documentaries lately i was watching one about china's economy and how it is basically made out of
[1684.46 --> 1693.82]  matchsticks and tinder and flamethrowers but it works not for long um yeah the like the the way
[1693.82 --> 1699.10]  they're building right now is completely unprecedented in history like there's one city that i think is
[1699.10 --> 1705.90]  spending something like 60 billion pounds over a span of eight years or something like that pretty much
[1705.90 --> 1713.50]  completely rebuilding like like the like the number of new bridges and skyscrapers and roadways going up is
[1713.50 --> 1721.26]  it's completely unfathomable and um meanwhile all the all the state run uh all the state-run suppliers
[1721.26 --> 1727.90]  of raw materials like steel are kind of just operating at a loss or just barely staying afloat and like
[1728.54 --> 1734.30]  it yeah it's basically very precarious over there which like i'm talking about it really casually but
[1734.30 --> 1738.38]  it's actually sort of a disaster waiting to happen to be fair a lot of places are currently sort of a
[1738.38 --> 1742.94]  disaster waiting to happen if you look at them at a documentary level yeah like a lot of countries are just
[1742.94 --> 1750.06]  like wow like look at camp what are we gonna do about what how are we gonna make money we just lost
[1750.06 --> 1758.62]  oil um like that was actually like a massive percentage of our income we we like man like
[1758.62 --> 1764.78]  we're actually in a lot of trouble so i was our economy based on wood and oil we have wood issues
[1764.78 --> 1769.34]  selling them to the states there's like sanctions there so we like can't really do it very well so the
[1769.34 --> 1775.42]  american like forestry economy can stay strong that's a thing and oil not really a thing anymore
[1775.42 --> 1785.42]  well we have water yeah which like actually the economy of water is an extremely interesting problem
[1785.42 --> 1790.54]  the problem with canada's canada's exportable resources is that they're the kind of thing
[1790.54 --> 1796.78]  that someone's more likely to conquer you for yeah because they're it's not that practical to like
[1797.74 --> 1802.86]  ship water and which isn't to say it isn't done yeah like you said the the economics of
[1802.86 --> 1807.50]  water are very very they actually really super are if you're if you're interested in a topic that
[1807.50 --> 1811.66]  sounds boring but it's actually quite quite interesting bottled water economy of water yeah
[1812.70 --> 1819.66]  speaking of things that sound boring and are interesting to him um paulie oh you know what we'll use the
[1819.66 --> 1826.62]  uh the bbc article yes yes yes um i will try to restrict my amount of time talking about this
[1826.62 --> 1832.46]  um so a server that i'm going to pronounce wrong because my last name is french but i'm not actually
[1832.46 --> 1837.98]  french called nostralious which just means nostalgia in french apparently someone told me that i could be
[1837.98 --> 1845.50]  wrong that doesn't sound like was shut i don't know man um was shut down sorry sorry i will let you
[1845.50 --> 1851.82]  continue but captions whenever you know you're on a mainstream site when you read a caption like this
[1852.78 --> 1861.58]  gamers can play as mythical characters in world of warcraft thank you bbc thank you okay with a
[1861.58 --> 1868.62]  cinematic screen carry on um so they've been doing this for about a year it got kind of insane you
[1868.62 --> 1874.14]  haven't said what they were doing right anyways i'm trying to condense it and i'm skipping over massive
[1874.14 --> 1879.18]  important things anyways this group called nostralious was running a private world of warcraft
[1879.18 --> 1885.10]  server so basically they took like cached versions of code and reprogrammed things on their own like
[1885.10 --> 1891.18]  re-scripting boss events and doing all this crazy stuff even working on code in order to attempt to
[1891.18 --> 1898.62]  cluster servers together and like it was pretty nuts to be clear yes it's game software piracy oh yeah
[1898.62 --> 1903.98]  yes it infringes blizzard's copyright definitely carry on blizzard definitely 100 has the right to
[1904.62 --> 1909.42]  completely crap all over them they definitely have the right to do that um let's pick up on they've
[1909.42 --> 1914.78]  been doing this for about a year they've been doing this for about a year yeah they have 800 000
[1914.78 --> 1923.74]  registered accounts and about 150 000 active players which is a huge amount of people and there's been
[1923.74 --> 1929.50]  tons of private wow servers over the years this one stood out the reason why this one stood out is for
[1929.50 --> 1934.22]  a few different reasons one of the main ones is that they are non-profit essentially they don't
[1934.22 --> 1939.50]  take any form of donations and there was no way to give them any money they were just doing it because
[1939.50 --> 1944.62]  they wanted the server to be up all of their game masters all of their admins all of their everything
[1944.62 --> 1950.30]  for everyone that worked on the server at all or helped anyone were not allowed to have like normal
[1950.30 --> 1954.30]  characters in the game like a game master was not allowed to have a character that was a raider
[1954.30 --> 1959.82]  because that could be seen as unfair because they could help themselves right so like it was it was
[1959.82 --> 1963.02]  very balanced in that way they were very aggressive at going after people that were
[1963.02 --> 1968.06]  hacking they were very aggressive at going against people that were botting or are selling gold or
[1968.06 --> 1974.14]  selling accounts or everything they bandwaved people all the time it was this kind of sanction and
[1974.14 --> 1978.94]  to be completely honest i played on it my brother played on it my dad played on it it was super cool
[1978.94 --> 1984.22]  because the current version of world of warcraft sucks in terms of social interaction everyone just
[1984.22 --> 1988.62]  sits in something called a garrison which is their own little private area does everything from there
[1988.62 --> 1992.94]  teleports everywhere that they need to go doesn't talk to anyone never needs to talk to anyone it's
[1992.94 --> 1998.14]  terrible that's why their subscriber numbers are tanking and they decided to stop reporting subscriber
[1998.14 --> 2004.06]  numbers you probably wouldn't i solo i sold everything when i played wow i didn't want to talk to anyone
[2004.06 --> 2012.22]  oh yeah i was one of those like jackass like mage solo everything people did you get to max level
[2012.22 --> 2020.30]  no i didn't because i like i had to did you enjoy the amount of difficulty in the game yeah it's
[2020.30 --> 2028.94]  excessively easy now oh oh okay like ridiculously yeah you basically couldn't skip an area if you wanted
[2028.94 --> 2033.10]  to solo yeah and you have to like grind through things and things are actually relatively hard actually
[2033.10 --> 2037.10]  for a mage they're usually a little bit easier but for other stuff is like kind of difficult and
[2037.10 --> 2041.98]  blah blah blah blah blah blah there's no like that's why mages have high intelligence ratings
[2041.98 --> 2049.02]  because they're smart enough to be a mage wow there was area of effect wow area of effect yeah that's
[2049.02 --> 2053.74]  what it's all about someone made a video about how stupid the current version of wow is
[2053.74 --> 2058.22]  by picking a healer going into an instance and refusing to ever heal and they made it through the
[2058.22 --> 2064.14]  entire thing without stopping oh it was a relatively low level instance but like still you should have
[2064.14 --> 2071.02]  to actively play your class and you just don't anyways um it started to actually become a threat
[2071.02 --> 2075.34]  because that server was getting bigger than actually hold on you didn't clarify that nostralius was
[2075.34 --> 2083.26]  running vanilla wow not the current wow that he doesn't like yeah from like 2004 2006 ish the like very
[2083.26 --> 2088.70]  oldest form of world of warcraft and they were going along a patch schedule that was very similar
[2088.70 --> 2092.94]  to blizzard's patch schedule so if you played from the start it was like the beginning of world of
[2092.94 --> 2098.70]  warcraft with like no raids and all this kind of stuff and then like mc gets added and zg gets added
[2098.70 --> 2103.58]  and like on courage was just about to come out and it was super cool and people were doing vwl and
[2103.58 --> 2111.98]  whatnot anyways it was great blizzard's like no closes everything down uh cease and desist ovh were
[2111.98 --> 2119.82]  the people that were hosting them sent the cease and desist to ovh so ovh was like okay well we have
[2119.82 --> 2124.06]  to shut your server off gave them a little bit of time i didn't even know that they didn't just send
[2124.06 --> 2127.10]  it to the guys that were running it directly it's not like they're hard to get in touch with i think
[2127.10 --> 2131.82]  they did both i'm not really sure i know i know they also sent it to ovh um so they gave them a little
[2131.82 --> 2136.94]  bit of time they had from like i think it was thursday to sunday or something so they had a few
[2136.94 --> 2142.86]  more days with the server up um i was there for the last like half an hour i recorded i can't
[2142.86 --> 2146.62]  send give it anywhere because if it goes anywhere they're just going to take it down but i recorded
[2146.62 --> 2150.22]  like the last few minutes just outside of orgrimmar where there's like thousands and thousands of
[2150.22 --> 2155.82]  people my computer usually gets over 200 fps in that game it was getting two wow there was like
[2155.82 --> 2160.14]  actually thousands of people all standing in one pile and people were just spamming spells and stuff it
[2160.14 --> 2167.90]  was kind of nuts um it was kind of cool but nuts uh there was like the gms were teleporting into
[2167.90 --> 2171.98]  cities and people were forming like giant circles around them and everyone was like thanking them
[2171.98 --> 2176.86]  and stuff it was super weird it was super weird anyways it sounds like the nerdiest yet like kind
[2176.86 --> 2182.62]  of coolest thing yes yeah server shutdowns are usually kind of like that um anyways there's a there's a
[2182.62 --> 2188.22]  change.org petition which i don't think i have the uh link for right now because i'll go find it
[2188.22 --> 2193.90]  go ahead and get it in the dock it has almost 100 000 signatures i think last time i looked it was
[2193.90 --> 2199.74]  above 90 000 it might have been above 80 000 i don't remember which one it was um but the petition
[2199.74 --> 2206.22]  isn't even necessarily like let's have our server back because honestly that's probably not what should
[2206.22 --> 2213.34]  happen because especially a server of this magnitude with this many people trying to play a single game
[2213.34 --> 2220.94]  it probably shouldn't be a private server run by people for no profit it should probably that's
[2220.94 --> 2225.50]  you're going the wrong direction captain yeah i can't i can't go to website
[2227.98 --> 2229.66]  it should be relatively easy to find there
[2233.26 --> 2237.34]  i don't know where it's going to be anyways um it should be ran by blizzard
[2237.34 --> 2242.94]  that's what should happen whether they hire all the guys that ran australius and
[2243.90 --> 2248.94]  get them to run an official version or whatever that's probably what should happen and the petition
[2248.94 --> 2256.62]  was largely just about like hey guys do something there's a massive community of people that want to
[2256.62 --> 2262.30]  play this game your current game is shit keep the current game going whatever no one cares
[2262.30 --> 2268.70]  also open well i'm sure some people care i don't care um also open vanilla or progressive servers or
[2268.70 --> 2273.50]  whatever one of the team leads i don't remember his name right now of the original world of warcraft
[2273.50 --> 2278.86]  the like one of the most infamous versions of the game has signed this petition and has
[2278.86 --> 2285.18]  set an a letter to mike morhaime blizzard ceo being like dude you guys are doing it wrong one of the
[2285.18 --> 2290.22]  biggest things that people are frustrated about right now is this this petition has a hundred and four
[2290.22 --> 2297.18]  thousand freaking signatures 105 almost more accurately um and blizzard has said nothing
[2297.18 --> 2306.30]  publicly about it at all what are you doing don't know don't want to i don't want to play basically
[2306.30 --> 2310.70]  everyone that i talked to in that game my entire guild my dad my brother everyone i talked to about
[2310.70 --> 2315.10]  it doesn't really want to play on a private server it's sketchy you don't know if it's going
[2315.10 --> 2320.14]  to continue to exist you kind of want your character to continue to be a thing i would love to
[2320.14 --> 2329.18]  pay for the freaking game let all of us give you money be greedy the ceo of activision is like
[2329.18 --> 2336.54]  one of the most notoriously greedy dudes ever be greedy open vanilla or progressive servers take
[2336.54 --> 2346.38]  our money millions you'll make tons just do it just do it one of their excuses one of their excuses is that they
[2346.38 --> 2355.58]  lost the source code for vanilla which is obscene for one and for two these guys are literally building
[2355.58 --> 2362.06]  it from the ground up and it 100 felt perfect there was glitches and stuff but like are you kidding me
[2362.06 --> 2368.46]  classic wow had glitches up the butt don't don't don't try to like rose tinted glasses that that game was
[2368.46 --> 2375.58]  broken it's okay like i almost think their version was better get these guys to script it they'll do
[2375.58 --> 2382.38]  it right there are people out there that have tons of videos on all of the fights there's there's exact
[2382.38 --> 2387.66]  data from databases that were ran back in the day like wowhead and a few other ones that i don't
[2387.66 --> 2394.78]  remember um that have exact drop percentages for different items like it can very easily be rebuilt and
[2394.78 --> 2402.06]  the source code is gone is a bullshit excuse there we go all right fine i will acknowledge it people
[2402.06 --> 2408.38]  are telling us the stream is breaking periodically we know i already replied in the chat we know we
[2408.38 --> 2414.86]  got to continue the show we are not dropping frames we can't make a show about how twitch's server is
[2414.86 --> 2419.50]  glitching out because i'm pretty sure it's on their side they're asking me to fix it there is nothing i can
[2419.50 --> 2427.02]  do because we are encoding frames we are transmitting frames there you go um all right so let's uh
[2427.02 --> 2434.30]  actually we should probably do our sponsors first up is mastra so you can head over to draw it up slash
[2434.30 --> 2441.90]  when dash k7 xx dash y and the reason you might want to do that aforementioned thing is actually
[2441.90 --> 2448.46]  because they've got a drop running on a pretty good product right now red edition the what now the red
[2448.46 --> 2454.94]  yeah it's the red edition of uh this this product right here that i actually reviewed very similar
[2454.94 --> 2461.98]  to the sennheiser hd 600s in terms of the sound signature uh very comfortable large very large ear
[2461.98 --> 2469.98]  cups um kind of a hard foam but it should mold to your head over time um very open very open design
[2469.98 --> 2476.62]  really nice headphones and they've got them over on mass drop for a pretty wicked price so all you got to
[2476.62 --> 2482.46]  do is head over to drawdops slash when dash k7 xx dash why we really got to clean up those vanity urls
[2483.42 --> 2489.02]  and you can check that out mass drop has all kinds of cool deals whether it's on knives did i tell you
[2489.02 --> 2496.78]  i lost my uh really yeah but that's really oh crap the black one yeah the um uh uh kershaw yeah it was a
[2496.78 --> 2501.26]  kershaw knife yeah anyway that was one that they had a while back they have like keyboards keycaps
[2501.26 --> 2507.10]  is it like gone oh it's like i accidentally tried to take it through airport security yeah so they
[2507.10 --> 2512.54]  did not want me to do that yeah yep um one of the airport security guys probably has a cool knife
[2512.54 --> 2519.98]  now no he throws it in the garbage they have to yeah yeah yeah until the end of the day yeah that's okay
[2519.98 --> 2527.02]  yeah i had i had flipped it like so many times but it kind of stuck a lot so you can okay yeah so if it's
[2527.02 --> 2533.42]  too loose you can tighten them up no it's like yeah even oiling it didn't help yeah like the spring
[2533.42 --> 2540.14]  we're out this is a spring assisted one yeah um all right we've also got squarespace
[2541.98 --> 2547.74]  so if you're not familiar with our talking points for squarespace you should you should watch the wands
[2547.74 --> 2556.62]  show more often yeah that's right squarespace allows you to build the website you want to build so whether
[2557.02 --> 2561.82]  you should find yourself wanting to make a website about an art project that you completed or uh
[2561.82 --> 2569.02]  you should sports to i failed or a or a sports team that you participate in or some uh oh i don't
[2569.02 --> 2576.70]  know like etsy type craft products that you want to sell online squarespace has got you covered you can
[2576.70 --> 2582.14]  pick from any one of their beautiful templates and oh no i'm not going to be able to say it while he's gone
[2582.14 --> 2593.42]  you should and if and you should i found a square what that takes up space what also known as a cube
[2598.38 --> 2600.54]  you should probably leave okay
[2602.54 --> 2608.46]  so squarespace has 24 7 tech support it starts at only eight dollars a month and you get a free domain if
[2608.46 --> 2616.14]  you buy squarespace for a year you can start a trial with no credit card required so go ahead and do it
[2616.14 --> 2622.54]  you should start building your website today and if you use offer code linus to get 10 off your first
[2622.54 --> 2631.50]  purchase then uh you will save some money squarespace you should build it beautiful yeah these are getting
[2631.50 --> 2638.38]  more and more awkward speaking of awkward you know what's awkward doing work and not getting paid for it
[2638.46 --> 2644.54]  not because people weren't willing to pay you but because you forgot to send the bill were you that
[2644.54 --> 2651.18]  kid in high school who got a zero on your assignments because you completed it and never handed it in
[2653.18 --> 2659.58]  i do that sometimes not that often but sometimes have you done it more than five times probably yeah
[2659.58 --> 2664.46]  so you gotta put your hand up yeah that's you get that hand up there get it right up in there
[2664.46 --> 2672.86]  oh uh sorry what are we talking about right uh fresh books fresh books is all about tracking the time
[2672.86 --> 2680.70]  spent the materials required the expenses incurred on projects for small business owners so whether you
[2680.70 --> 2689.18]  run a dance studio a plumbing operation uh you know small office it maintenance sort of business or uh
[2689.18 --> 2695.50]  uh um you know you uh no fires put out fires well no i think they're mostly city workers i don't
[2695.50 --> 2700.70]  think they have to use fresh books but no they weren't originally if you are self-employed fresh books
[2700.70 --> 2708.54]  let you lets you keep track of all that businessy accountingy nonsense that people don't necessarily
[2708.54 --> 2712.94]  want to deal with and puts it all in one place so that it is easy for you to do so you don't have to
[2712.94 --> 2717.18]  spend all of your time in front of your computer at the end of the day when you're tired doing accounting
[2717.18 --> 2724.06]  instead of working on making your business grow so if fresh books sounds good to you visit freshbooks.com
[2724.06 --> 2730.14]  slash when and enter when in the how did you hear about us section the link will be in the video
[2730.14 --> 2734.94]  description assuming of course that you're watching this on youtube and not on twitch tv
[2736.70 --> 2742.30]  so way back you used to pay the fire department and then the fire department would give you like a sign
[2742.30 --> 2746.22]  or a sticker or something that you put on your house and you did not get your fire put out if you didn't
[2746.22 --> 2750.30]  have one you didn't have it you're scared wow this is like way back and only in certain areas or
[2750.30 --> 2755.34]  whatever yeah like that was actually like a thing that's pretty cool yeah speaking of things that were
[2755.34 --> 2763.26]  a thing in the past texting while walking could be banned in new jersey under new rules being proposed
[2763.26 --> 2770.54]  by u.s officials the number of people dying while walking according to this independent.co.uk article
[2770.54 --> 2777.50]  is swiftly increasing and thousands of people are being injured while walking with their phone
[2778.94 --> 2785.10]  what that is hilarious i mean it's not funny when people get hurt but it's hilarious that it is a
[2785.10 --> 2792.30]  problem for people to walk while but some of this data is like a little weird like okay 11 of all
[2792.30 --> 2799.02]  fatalities in 2005 involved pedestrians 15 of all fatalities in 2014 involved pedestrians could that not be
[2799.02 --> 2808.14]  because of other things no is that is that only tied to this you know it'd be really interesting
[2808.14 --> 2815.02]  to see if you could find articles from the 80s proposing like banning no newspapers while walking
[2815.98 --> 2820.94]  no i was thinking more along the lines of walkmans like earphones since that was sort of a thing that
[2820.94 --> 2826.22]  happened in the 80s yeah that's probably a thing but newspapers is good too because you know what if you
[2826.22 --> 2831.10]  can think of something someone somewhere has probably tried to propose a law to ban it so
[2832.22 --> 2833.50]  anyway mr owies
[2836.14 --> 2839.26]  that law already existed and makes perfect sense it does actually
[2839.98 --> 2846.62]  they definitely have 100 of a right to do that um so the there's a bill pending in hawaii that will
[2846.62 --> 2851.02]  find someone 250 dollars if he or she crosses the street with an electronic device
[2851.02 --> 2856.30]  no states have enacted a law specifically targeting distracted cyclists or pedestrians
[2856.86 --> 2862.22]  but violators in new jersey would apparently face fines of up to 50 us dollars 15 days of
[2862.22 --> 2868.62]  imprisonment which is ridiculous or both which is the same penalty as jaywalking wow
[2869.82 --> 2875.66]  interesting i those guys that like ride the bikes and have the things behind it that like
[2875.66 --> 2883.66]  can tell you they'll get way more business now rickshaws sure oh no they run like a rickshaw bike
[2885.02 --> 2889.90]  like have you not seen those uh like just cyclists with like carriages behind yeah yeah yeah it would
[2889.90 --> 2894.62]  be like having a horse except a bike right yeah yeah okay i get it yeah i feel like they get way more
[2894.62 --> 2897.98]  work because there's there's actually points in time where like i have to walk for a little while and
[2897.98 --> 2903.42]  like i really need to do something on my phone and i don't have time to not do one of them
[2905.66 --> 2910.38]  like anytime at ces oh my god this thing's kind of cool this is the volocopter
[2911.58 --> 2919.26]  or as i'm going to call it from now on the yolocopter yeah because it has i don't 13 rotors
[2919.26 --> 2928.14]  i don't know how many it has it's not a 18 propeller spinning rotors 18 propeller spinning rotors
[2928.78 --> 2936.38]  it holds a person and a joystick and not a whole oh yeah and a massive battery and not a whole lot
[2936.38 --> 2942.14]  else and it is the world's first certified multi-copter that lifts off in i'm not even
[2942.14 --> 2951.58]  going to try germany marking a new era for aerial transportation it is electrically powered which is
[2951.58 --> 2959.26]  pretty cool it's apparently super easy to fly with three redundant autopilots that will basically hover
[2959.26 --> 2966.94]  as soon as the pilot lets go of the joystick and um can reach a speed this is the v200 we're looking at
[2966.94 --> 2973.18]  by the way can reach a speed of 15 miles per hour with the team determined to increase the speed to
[2973.18 --> 2981.42]  60 miles per hour on follow-up flights much like your dji phantom copter computer on a stick
[2981.42 --> 2987.58]  uh that you fly with a little you know a couple of sticks in your chest mounted neck hangy strappy thing
[2988.86 --> 2996.86]  multi multi-rotor or drone yeah um much like that the volocopter sorry excuse me the yolocopter
[2997.26 --> 3005.02]  is directed by increasing or decreasing the speed of its propellers rather than by altering the pitch
[3005.02 --> 3011.42]  so uh i actually don't know if pitch is technically the correct term so the aircraft this is pitch
[3011.42 --> 3013.82]  this is yaw strafe
[3016.70 --> 3025.82]  um so but okay so but but basically yeah so the but but but so unlike a helicopter you don't actually
[3025.82 --> 3031.34]  move the spinning rotors they they just the the speed at which they're spinning changes um the
[3031.34 --> 3036.30]  propeller system is designed to fold up and fit on a towable trailer for easy transport and they're
[3036.30 --> 3040.62]  working on certification to produce the yolocopter in large quantities
[3040.62 --> 3052.54]  and 60 miles an hour like as birds as the crow flies yeah is really fast yeah that would be pretty darn
[3052.54 --> 3063.10]  freaking cool pitch yaw rotation what no no this is yaw yaw is the same as rotation
[3063.10 --> 3069.34]  or is this yeah roll's a different thing because remember
[3070.54 --> 3076.94]  pitch yaw isn't isn't this yaw no i don't think so and then this is rotation i could be wrong that's
[3076.94 --> 3082.86]  possible pitch yaw and raffle love it that's the kind of copter i want to ride in all right
[3083.74 --> 3091.58]  canadian police it's wall and ruffle okay according to this uh according to this article
[3091.58 --> 3097.02]  posted by s girly on the forum original article here is from the verge have apparently had a master
[3097.02 --> 3102.30]  key to blackberry's encryption since 2010 and it was used to intercept and read messages
[3102.30 --> 3111.90]  well okay then canada has something called a spy palace we can pretty much just like stop this whole
[3111.90 --> 3121.10]  topic there spying in canada is brutal so a high level surveillance probe shows that canada's federal
[3121.10 --> 3126.22]  policing agency has had a global encryption key for blackberry since 2010 according to documents
[3126.22 --> 3131.98]  by the rcmp filed in court law enforcement decrypted roughly one million pin-to-pin blackberry
[3131.98 --> 3138.38]  messages in connection with the probe from 2010 to 2012. it doesn't show where this key came from
[3138.38 --> 3142.62]  and government lawyers spent two years fighting in a montreal courtroom to keep the information
[3142.62 --> 3149.18]  out of the public record neither the rcmp nor blackberry confirmed if this is true but crown
[3149.18 --> 3154.62]  prosecutors confirmed the federal police had access to the key just in case people were wondering
[3154.62 --> 3161.90]  about the canadian spy palace i posted it in the twitch chat um there's new rumors about the nintendo
[3161.90 --> 3167.42]  nx uh this was posted by master disaster on the forum the original article here is from screen
[3167.42 --> 3174.86]  rent and to be clear a lot of the rumors lately about the nx have been uh have been seeming to be
[3174.86 --> 3179.34]  coming from like some subreddit where people have been posting complete nonsense
[3179.34 --> 3190.30]  but this round of rumors is according to john castile more believable than some so take it for what it is
[3190.30 --> 3197.42]  more believable than rumors that john castile says are more believable than some this is a more
[3197.42 --> 3203.82]  believable torch than some of them yeah and some than the actual digital representations yeah um
[3203.82 --> 3212.06]  um so do do the nx will apparently feature an x86 architecture it will apparently backup data to
[3212.06 --> 3217.10]  nintendo servers which is huge because the current ones don't and if your wii u dies you lose all of
[3217.10 --> 3226.70]  your digital purposes uh purchases which is bullshit isn't that terrible it's so bad oh my gosh it's like
[3226.70 --> 3234.94]  like it's like actually worse than the super nintendo which at least stored your data on the game yeah
[3234.94 --> 3242.62]  yeah yeah yeah you know that should even be a feature like we'll feature it's like we'll have fixed you
[3242.62 --> 3248.62]  know what surprises me that no one ever created i you know it probably existed at some point but that
[3248.62 --> 3257.42]  no one ever mainstreamized semi-rewritable discs so if you could have a game that had a mostly read-only
[3257.42 --> 3265.90]  media layer on the outside but had just a very very small rewritable layer on the inside don't do super
[3265.90 --> 3271.90]  great with mass rewrites though um there are discs that could handle a lot and it wouldn't be the kind
[3271.90 --> 3275.66]  of thing that you would save every time you hit a save point it would be the kind of thing that you
[3275.66 --> 3281.50]  save every time you eject that could actually make a ton of sense don't you think i think so
[3282.06 --> 3285.34]  i think that would be that would be a really cool way to handle it i mean obviously that's like
[3285.34 --> 3292.86]  that's like a ps2 era like technology proposal but um yeah i just think that would have been kind
[3292.86 --> 3296.06]  of a neat way to do i'm sure twitch chat is full of people telling me all the reasons it couldn't
[3296.06 --> 3300.62]  happen this won't work because xyz yeah or someone tried it and you know what this is my show
[3300.62 --> 3308.06]  so um it'll apparently have support for an additional screen which is going to lead to um
[3308.06 --> 3314.86]  companies like say for example rocket fish producing the most fabulous tv wall mounts the
[3314.86 --> 3320.14]  world has ever seen i'm sure if the configuration is expected to be anything like the ds's dual screen
[3321.74 --> 3328.06]  i mean can you imagine i mean two tvs on your wall it's like why do you have two tvs on your wall oh yeah
[3328.06 --> 3333.82]  i gotta play games on my nx so yeah you got my mini map the bottom one's touch screen
[3333.82 --> 3339.58]  everyone's all you have to like get up and run over to it be like yeah got my 52 inch uh got my 52 inch
[3339.58 --> 3346.46]  uh touch screen uh you know stereoscopic stereoscopic mini map you know no big deal whatever
[3347.02 --> 3355.58]  awesome um can handle ports of current gen games i should certainly hope so um well it's x86 they are being
[3355.58 --> 3364.46]  such jerks about retro games um and everyone is blizzard um that's a completely different issue i
[3364.46 --> 3372.14]  don't care i'm talking about how the latest 3ds how the latest 3ds is getting i i can't remember
[3372.14 --> 3379.74]  it's either game boy advance or super nintendo games when like you could literally with an emulator on like
[3379.74 --> 3385.90]  like the vanilla ds emulate snes games and they're claiming the previous generation 3ds wasn't
[3385.90 --> 3394.06]  powerful enough it's like you know what lose the attitude nintendo it almost makes me feel not bad
[3394.06 --> 3399.26]  about emulating their games which i've never done of course of course you didn't of course i haven't
[3400.46 --> 3407.50]  speaking of which i am i'm kind of torn right now i am not sure if i'm going to buy a crt anymore
[3407.50 --> 3416.14]  because i was playing games on um the 65 inch oled tv and it was like super mario world's
[3416.14 --> 3420.54]  unplayable just completely unplayable like the delay was ridiculous i posted a video
[3420.54 --> 3424.94]  that i recorded at 240 fps of like pressing a button and then it's like
[3428.78 --> 3435.26]  mario jones like come on like the pixel response time is good but the processing delay on that tv is
[3435.26 --> 3445.58]  horrendous um but i was using a computer monitor like a gaming grade computer monitor predator monitor
[3445.58 --> 3450.94]  and like it was fine like lcd is good enough as long as you've got one with low input lag so as much
[3450.94 --> 3456.78]  as like and i had actually i had i was die hard zs and es for a long time just because i knew how to use
[3456.78 --> 3461.98]  it it's like yeah it's sds works and he was emulating games not that i not that i've ever
[3461.98 --> 3467.26]  emulated he just wanted to emulate the console to be clear i do own a copy of super mario world
[3467.26 --> 3471.66]  does that make it okay no technically no but i don't care okay it's it's one of those things where
[3471.66 --> 3479.18]  like technically i cannot copy my self-park dvds to my server and stream them to my phone but i don't
[3479.18 --> 3484.78]  care that i'm gonna do that anyway um and you can put me in jail if you really think that that makes a
[3484.78 --> 3491.58]  ton of sense but that is like looks bad on you um be fair it's nintendo and they probably don't care
[3491.58 --> 3497.74]  yeah they probably don't it's like the the letter is literally in the mail right now yeah
[3499.02 --> 3503.90]  um so yeah i'm kind of torn right now i might just i might just because the other thing too is
[3503.90 --> 3511.26]  like i had kind of forgotten how small crts were and and if they're big how ridiculous they are yeah
[3511.26 --> 3516.46]  like there's a there's actually a 40 incher for free on craigslist a 40 inch 4x3 apparently one of
[3516.46 --> 3521.90]  the best ones out there um even though the larger ones tended to have geometry issues around the
[3521.90 --> 3526.30]  corners i'm actually even if whether i buy one or not with all the research i've done over the last
[3526.30 --> 3532.06]  little bit i may do a video like so you want to buy or you want to pick up a used crt for retro that
[3532.06 --> 3540.70]  is that bad badass we should get it and replace mine it's like 300 pounds my brother right he could
[3540.70 --> 3547.58]  probably lift it on his own yes and he has a truck that can move it uh i can i can i can link you the
[3547.58 --> 3551.82]  post that would actually be sick i we will go get it but the other and i can get it so the ones that
[3551.82 --> 3557.18]  i was looking at were closer to the like 32 inch to 34 inch range but the thing to remember about
[3557.18 --> 3564.86]  that is that a 32 inch crt is basically equivalent to like a 30 or excuse me yeah 30 or 29 inch lcd
[3564.86 --> 3569.26]  because of the way they were measured they were actually measured differently you could factor out
[3569.26 --> 3575.10]  about two inches of size on a crt at least for computer monitors wow i want to see this video
[3575.10 --> 3581.58]  nope don't tell me make the video yeah um so so that's that that was the general rule for pc monitors
[3581.58 --> 3587.42]  it may not be true for tvs so you know please avoid correcting me because i will do the research
[3587.42 --> 3591.82]  before i make the video um so anyway i'm yeah i'm kind of torn because like i want to make like a
[3591.82 --> 3597.82]  little gaming room in the one side oh oh this is a great upcoming video um some people had asked me
[3597.82 --> 3603.50]  when i went and put all my computers in the closet next to my um next to the room in my house like
[3603.50 --> 3608.62]  what i was going to do for ventilation oh yeah that room got upgraded this week so there's a video
[3608.62 --> 3613.34]  coming but there's one on the other side so i had kind of wanted to drywall that in and like put like
[3613.34 --> 3617.10]  a beanbag chair like wire up some electrical outlets because it sits right above the breaker
[3617.10 --> 3624.46]  box down in my garage and like make like a cool little gaming nook um but you can use a gaming
[3624.46 --> 3629.02]  one maybe i'll just use an lcd yeah maybe i'll just throw a gaming monitor in there because s right
[3629.02 --> 3634.54]  snex 9x coming back to you know being as at snex die hard but having issues with windows 10.
[3634.54 --> 3639.18]  snex 9x is like really good and there's a lot of really cool filters that you can put on that
[3639.18 --> 3644.94]  make it look pretty good you can yeah you can kind of do a lot yeah it's actually up sampling on old
[3644.94 --> 3651.02]  school games is yeah hey yeah whoa like certain like playstation 1 games have you seen that stuff
[3651.02 --> 3658.14]  i have not i actually haven't played around with playstation 1 emulation since epsxe and like bleem
[3658.14 --> 3665.26]  were cool like does bleem even exist i don't i don't do this stuff i have no idea what the words
[3665.26 --> 3671.74]  are that you're saying do you know what bleem is though for serious no okay bleem exclamation mark
[3671.74 --> 3682.38]  uh commercial was a commercial playstation emulator what um for i know waz for ibm compatible pcs and
[3682.38 --> 3693.90]  dreamcast in 1999 dreamcast um yeah apparently ran on dreamcast what the shit it was released in
[3693.90 --> 3698.06]  three other versions called bleem cast to play popular playstation games gran turismo 2 metal
[3698.06 --> 3705.26]  gear solid and tekken 3 on the dreamcast what legacy although sony's litigation against bleem
[3705.26 --> 3711.74]  led the company to bankruptcy sony did not manage to win a decisive victory against blame and to have
[3711.74 --> 3715.82]  the product removed from shelves after their demise which is a legal precedent for the commercial
[3715.82 --> 3724.14]  viability of emulators what the hell very interesting huh as of 2005 two members of the team were working
[3724.14 --> 3735.02]  for sony okay well anyway so 1999 to like 2001 like yeah i was never in the emulator game i always had real
[3735.02 --> 3740.46]  copies like even fairly recently i bought fable one because a bunch of people said it was great i bought
[3740.46 --> 3746.46]  fable one for xbox have you played people original no i haven't what yeah we were i think it was you
[3746.46 --> 3750.62]  and me talking about it wasn't it maybe because fable one's awesome i think we're talking about it on
[3750.62 --> 3756.30]  the show so i went and picked it up okay one for xbox original or whatever we want to call it oh okay
[3756.30 --> 3765.74]  i don't know um yeah xbox black edition i got gta three oh no black 360s yeah black xbox ones yeah crap i
[3765.74 --> 3771.82]  failed yeah i got gta three for like three bucks so i was like screw it whatever and then i got uh
[3771.82 --> 3777.02]  need for speed most wanted black edition speaking of black edition nice like the old like super sick
[3777.02 --> 3782.70]  most wanted with that blue and silver bmw at the start it's a great game and it was the whole thing
[3782.70 --> 3789.50]  was like nine dollars nice it's like okay sure yeah fable is really good you'll enjoy it um i probably
[3789.50 --> 3794.06]  will back to the nintendo nx rumors which we will make our way through eventually in fact we're almost at
[3794.06 --> 3799.82]  the end of the show here it's already after six um according to nintendo life a number of wii u ports
[3799.82 --> 3806.86]  are in development i mean can nintendo at least remake properties that are actually old
[3809.66 --> 3818.70]  oh no ports ports ports not really i see what you're saying yeah they're wii u remasters apparently
[3818.70 --> 3824.46]  remasters actually yeah we knew remasters so the new console will apparently be as allegedly more
[3824.46 --> 3830.06]  powerful than the current ps4 uh which i guess is good because you'll be able to play in full hd
[3830.62 --> 3836.06]  uh wii u games or something no because they already run at 1080p so i don't i don't actually
[3836.06 --> 3845.26]  know it's good yeah it's not a bad thing so cool um moving on the op here was convicted pillowcase and
[3845.26 --> 3851.50]  the original article is from the verge logitech buys audio device maker jaybird for 50 million in cash
[3852.38 --> 3858.22]  um continuing their their trend of buying up companies like oh i don't know this is a good
[3858.22 --> 3867.02]  example ultimate ears to uh to own more audio brands very interesting yeah um apparently if they
[3867.02 --> 3873.74]  hit some some growth projections and targets over the next couple of years they can earn an additional 45
[3873.74 --> 3882.22]  million uh logitech does not expect the acquisition to impact its fiscal year 2017 guidance wow good
[3882.22 --> 3888.22]  job i guess logitech yeah good for you you made a cool mouse yeah although i realize that the market
[3888.22 --> 3894.06]  probably doesn't want this and you probably shouldn't do it but if you guys made a g900
[3894.06 --> 3899.50]  that instead of having a plug-in cable on the front and instead of having like a properly placed really
[3899.50 --> 3905.50]  good battery in the back had replaceable batteries like the g7 that was a pretty cool hot swap system
[3905.50 --> 3910.62]  there that was so good yeah it was pretty cool i saw it again in the my mineral video when i was doing
[3910.62 --> 3914.78]  research for the other video that i just shot and i saw the battery sitting there and i was like oh that
[3914.78 --> 3919.98]  was sick they also need to bring back the g9 v9x shell yeah um like because they sell for like a
[3919.98 --> 3926.22]  lot look go on amazon look up g9 whoa sometimes those are just broken listings but he brought up that
[3926.22 --> 3931.42]  there was also a g9 on ebay for like 150 bucks or something yeah and there's like multiple ones
[3931.42 --> 3937.66]  on amazon for like huge amounts of money so developers are adapting oculus rift exclusives
[3937.66 --> 3942.30]  to work on the htc vibe which is great news for people like me who plan to buy a vive and do not plan
[3942.30 --> 3949.50]  to buy a rift to be clear i have bought a vive but that belongs to minus media group it's complicated
[3949.50 --> 3955.66]  like you have bought a rift uh five and a five and a rift yeah yeah but linus media group bought
[3955.66 --> 3962.22]  those they actually don't belong to me like people who don't run their own businesses might not know
[3962.22 --> 3967.98]  this but like linus media group is its own legal entity and i am my own legal entity and we are not
[3967.98 --> 3976.62]  the same thing and this is important for tax purposes um so yeah in the past month the consumer versions have
[3976.62 --> 3985.02]  been released i think released is a strong word for what the rift has done well hold up 219gaming.com
[3985.02 --> 3989.66]  said in the twitch chat well i want to support you guys but i can't seem to get an answer so thanks
[3989.66 --> 3998.54]  anyways twitch chat is not the right place to try to contact us just for your information and for the
[3998.54 --> 4005.66]  information of anyone else watching yeah don't go to twitch chat yeah and a lot of people try to tweet me
[4005.66 --> 4012.46]  during wanshow don't do that bad idea i'm here you can actually see that i'm not looking at my phone
[4013.34 --> 4019.50]  just yeah uh so there's that i didn't see any of the other stuff you said but i saw that
[4019.50 --> 4024.22]  i always see the useless i know you know i it's like the worst thing ever when i'm like when i have
[4024.22 --> 4028.78]  some time like i'm sitting on the can right and i'm scrolling through like twitter mentions and
[4028.78 --> 4034.62]  someone's like hey can i ask you a question yeah it's like and i'm like if you had asked the question
[4034.62 --> 4038.06]  you would have been able to ask me a question now the odds of me seeing your because the odds of
[4038.06 --> 4043.26]  me seeing the follow-up very slim yeah because when your feed gets like so full and the problem
[4043.26 --> 4048.86]  is that the twitter app it doesn't allow you to filter so mine's just full of whoever liked
[4048.86 --> 4055.34]  this video retweeted did whatever no not that liked videos even if i filter down to just mentions
[4055.34 --> 4060.94]  it's just full of people liking the videos which is not bad thank you for liking the videos i appreciate
[4060.94 --> 4065.66]  that i get it but it makes it really really difficult to use anyway so there's a program
[4065.66 --> 4071.42]  called librevr slash review that allows rift exclusive like lucky's tale and oculus dream deck
[4071.42 --> 4077.34]  to play on the vibe the code was posted to redder by reddit by user cross vr and it could be used to
[4077.34 --> 4087.26]  port other titles dun dun dun boom that's huge because honestly right now the main thing rift kind of had
[4087.26 --> 4093.34]  going for it was its games library because the experience on vive currently is just better the
[4093.34 --> 4099.66]  touch controllers are extremely interesting and currently non-existent at least for consumers so
[4101.90 --> 4110.46]  pictures leaked of nvidia's pascal based gp 104 and 106 gpus this was originally posted on the forum by mr
[4110.46 --> 4122.54]  underscore troll and uh basically yeah so it looks like nvidia has hardware if this rumor is to be
[4122.54 --> 4131.18]  believed um for their next generation probably gaming gpus because while big pascal so gp 100 has only
[4131.18 --> 4139.58]  surfaced as the tesla p100 um smaller pascal is likely to emerge as according to the rumor
[4140.46 --> 4148.30]  a gtx 1080 and 1070 using the gp 104 gpu with something like a 1060 likely to use the 106
[4148.30 --> 4152.62]  if they stick with the naming conventions that they have been using for the last couple of generations
[4152.62 --> 4156.94]  and this is something that kind of drives me crazy nvidia what's with all the cloak and dagger nonsense
[4157.58 --> 4163.10]  if you're gonna be cloak and dagger why don't you use code names that like anyone who's been
[4163.10 --> 4169.66]  following you for more than you know 18 months won't understand like if you're actually gonna keep
[4169.66 --> 4175.34]  like they won't tell me anything because obviously they have pascal hardware if they have the tesla
[4175.34 --> 4182.54]  so yo hey what's going on they won't tell me anything but they use code names that i understand
[4182.54 --> 4188.38]  as soon as a rumor leaks somewhere which it always does i don't know just make up your mind that's all
[4188.38 --> 4195.90]  um i actually don't understand how like i will be in team speak with someone who's a viewer like a
[4195.90 --> 4202.30]  friend on the forum or something like that and they will tell me things about hardware tech because
[4202.30 --> 4207.58]  of rumors that end up being completely accurate that i haven't heard of yet even though i'm in
[4207.58 --> 4211.74]  communication with those companies and they're actively telling me that there's nothing going on
[4211.74 --> 4219.10]  and i'm like what how do you guys suck this much like apple doesn't really leak things i know they just
[4219.10 --> 4226.46]  leaked their renaming of mac mac os and that's probably because no one cared like other important
[4226.46 --> 4231.34]  things they just don't knowing apple they probably treated it like it was important to be fair but
[4231.34 --> 4236.78]  someone probably couldn't fathom how we could care yes and accidentally yeah yeah um so we've got some
[4236.78 --> 4242.86]  rumored specs the gtx 1080 is rumored to have eight billion transistors so about equivalent to the 980ti
[4242.86 --> 4249.26]  2560 cuda course eight gigs of gddr5 memory on a probably 256 bit bus that's a question mark but
[4249.26 --> 4254.70]  that's been a pattern for the last little while um question mark single eight pin power connector
[4254.70 --> 4260.54]  question mark two display port that would be a shame uh with a question mark no they're apparently
[4260.54 --> 4268.54]  pretty confident about the june 2016 uh release time that would make sense right near computex yep so
[4269.18 --> 4276.94]  much like last time around where we got a 980 that was pretty similar to the 780ti which was based on
[4276.94 --> 4285.42]  big uh crap i'm losing track of my uh losing track of my code names big kepler um so about about equivalent
[4285.42 --> 4291.74]  in terms of performance so it looks like we're going to see a mid-tier chip that's probably about similar
[4291.74 --> 4298.14]  to performance to the last gen big chip um and then we will actually have to wait another product refresh
[4298.54 --> 4307.18]  to get big um big pascal on the consumer side in the form of probably a titan booyah edition or whatever
[4307.18 --> 4318.54]  the case may be so i guess that's pretty much it for important things uh purple dio posted on the forum
[4318.54 --> 4324.62]  that the first 10 core smartphone has arrived from meizu oh my god
[4324.62 --> 4331.42]  and thank you for watching the wancho have you ever had a performance problem with your phone
[4331.42 --> 4338.38]  in terms of compute in the last two years um that's a good question and not one that more cores would
[4338.38 --> 4349.42]  solve roll the outro yeah see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[4349.42 --> 4355.98]  no one's like titan triple x no they will not do that although knowing nvidia they did introduce
[4355.98 --> 4363.90]  mf anti-aliasing so i mean they apparently just don't give any cares
[4365.90 --> 4372.62]  so there's that let's be fair mass drop k7xx drop go check it out squarespace you should
[4372.62 --> 4379.10]  fresh books we should do an entire wancho books that are fresh through like a text to speech thing
[4379.10 --> 4385.02]  no we shouldn't that's a terrible idea for like april fools that was like literally two weeks ago
[4385.58 --> 4388.46]  in the future i said we should do like not now
[4392.14 --> 4398.30]  it's like a twitch thing it's a bad idea because donators donators like on some twitch channels
[4398.30 --> 4403.98]  donators that donate enough money get their message sent text to speech to everyone watching
[4403.98 --> 4409.90]  the stream because apparently those massive disruptions are just totally okay if enough
[4409.90 --> 4415.66]  people watch you it reminds me of uh like billy billy that chinese site that we upload our videos to
[4415.66 --> 4420.94]  have you ever watched our videos on there uh i did when we were deciding if it was a good idea or not
[4420.94 --> 4427.82]  that comments stream across the video yeah and i think it's at the point in the video that the
[4427.82 --> 4432.62]  person was watching when they made that comment and it's like all over the video it's like how do you
[4432.62 --> 4440.78]  watch this it's awful cultural differences i guess all right bye guys bye
