[0.00 --> 0.86]  Day one patch is more.
[3.06 --> 4.32]  Day zero patch.
[5.16 --> 7.00]  Like day negative one patch.
[7.42 --> 8.10]  That's possible.
[8.36 --> 8.60]  Yeah.
[8.82 --> 9.14]  They could.
[9.42 --> 10.28]  Yeah, that's right.
[10.30 --> 11.30]  They patch the preload.
[11.60 --> 14.54]  So you preload it and then you have to patch the preload that you preloaded.
[14.60 --> 16.64]  Before you can actually play it.
[16.64 --> 20.42]  Yeah, but that's better than having you patch it after the game is out.
[20.60 --> 21.26]  That's true.
[21.64 --> 23.64]  Because then you have time to download it.
[23.64 --> 25.28]  We should promote negative day patches.
[25.40 --> 29.56]  Negative day patches are the way forward in the gaming industry.
[30.54 --> 34.78]  Maybe that's how these games that always stay in beta work.
[35.42 --> 39.28]  They're just like, we don't want to make a day zero patch or a month in patch.
[39.40 --> 40.48]  So it's the Google philosophy.
[40.84 --> 41.06]  Yeah.
[41.48 --> 41.72]  Yeah.
[42.52 --> 43.78]  Negative day patches.
[44.10 --> 44.40]  Yep.
[44.70 --> 47.94]  We are extremely happy with this idea.
[48.92 --> 51.90]  So welcome to the WAN show.
[51.90 --> 56.72]  It's Friday, which means you guys have got all kinds of important plans.
[57.58 --> 60.02]  I don't know who was being more annoying just then, you or me.
[60.16 --> 63.36]  I'm implying they have no lives and you're singing that terrible Rebecca Black song.
[63.50 --> 64.40]  I was going to vote for me.
[64.90 --> 65.96]  You were going to vote for you?
[66.54 --> 70.94]  I think even having someone tell you that your life is terrible is probably more bearable.
[71.00 --> 71.98]  I didn't say terrible.
[71.98 --> 74.42]  I just said that you're watching us on a Friday night.
[75.44 --> 76.92]  Honestly, I think that's pretty all right.
[77.20 --> 77.48]  Yeah.
[77.58 --> 78.44]  We're not that bad.
[78.54 --> 79.32]  I'm not that bad.
[79.42 --> 80.64]  What would you do on a Friday night?
[80.80 --> 82.16]  Apparently the mic's a little low.
[82.26 --> 82.92]  I don't know.
[83.00 --> 83.38]  You know what?
[83.42 --> 85.46]  I did a pre-recording and I think it's fine.
[85.54 --> 86.68]  What would you do on a Friday night?
[88.34 --> 90.44]  Well, on Friday nights, I play badminton.
[92.20 --> 93.26]  I play video games.
[94.44 --> 95.60]  So, yep.
[95.76 --> 98.50]  So it's probably fine that you're watching this show.
[98.54 --> 99.22]  Are you going to change it?
[99.22 --> 101.98]  Okay, people are insisting that I turn it up a little bit.
[102.12 --> 103.76]  Are you watching the stream?
[103.88 --> 104.52]  I'm watching, yeah.
[104.60 --> 105.86]  You don't have headphones, do you?
[106.20 --> 107.16]  No, I don't.
[108.36 --> 109.84]  Okay, fine.
[110.00 --> 110.84]  I guess I'll do it.
[110.88 --> 112.42]  I even did a pre-recording, though.
[112.48 --> 113.58]  This is the thing I don't understand.
[113.80 --> 114.68]  What is the problem with everyone?
[115.74 --> 116.58]  Hello, testing.
[116.74 --> 117.58]  One, two, three, four.
[117.70 --> 119.54]  I don't know if Linus is listening to this or not.
[119.80 --> 120.76]  We're going to talk about some things.
[120.76 --> 120.80]  No, no, no, no.
[120.80 --> 120.98]  It's fine.
[121.04 --> 121.64]  I have this show.
[122.72 --> 123.36]  It's fine.
[123.76 --> 126.52]  I know, but I have to talk so you can hear us talk in the thing.
[126.52 --> 127.02]  Oh, well, no.
[127.02 --> 129.88]  I was just going to carry on with the show and make adjustments as we go.
[130.12 --> 130.24]  Oh.
[133.78 --> 135.40]  Someone's like, this isn't free geek.
[135.50 --> 136.48]  That was last week.
[137.24 --> 140.72]  Rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme.
[142.94 --> 147.06]  Most people are saying that it's good, but one person said that it's too loud, so I'm
[147.06 --> 148.36]  pretty sure we should adjust it.
[149.20 --> 150.06]  Okay, cool.
[150.42 --> 150.82]  All right.
[150.82 --> 153.36]  So let's go ahead and kick things off here.
[153.50 --> 163.70]  So YouTube's Fine Brothers Entertainment will allow fans to create their own React videos.
[164.48 --> 170.88]  So I guess the thing that confused a lot of people about this news is that they weren't
[170.88 --> 177.94]  aware that at any point they were not allowed to make their own React videos.
[177.94 --> 181.66]  So I'm going to go ahead and post this puppy in the chat here.
[181.72 --> 183.30]  I'm going to go ahead and screen share with y'all.
[184.34 --> 191.26]  So basically, the reason that we're talking about this is just to kind of help clarify exactly
[191.26 --> 192.48]  what went down here.
[192.56 --> 199.14]  So everyone probably who has been on the internet at some point is somewhat familiar with the
[199.14 --> 202.08]  Fine Brothers series React series.
[202.08 --> 209.10]  So kids react, old people react, pets react, whatever, anything that can react to lithium
[209.10 --> 209.60]  reacts.
[209.70 --> 210.04]  I don't know.
[210.08 --> 211.36]  Anything that can react to anything.
[211.76 --> 212.16]  Lithium reacts.
[212.42 --> 213.60]  I don't think they've done a video on that.
[213.60 --> 214.98]  I suspect they haven't.
[215.04 --> 216.28]  I'd actually, I'd watch that.
[216.54 --> 221.04]  Lithium reacts to, that would actually be kind of a funny parody where you just, you
[221.04 --> 223.18]  could have like lithium reacts to dog poo.
[223.50 --> 227.66]  And so you just cut back and forth between just like a static shot of dog poo and then like
[227.66 --> 229.88]  lithium, like fizzing out in water.
[233.88 --> 240.68]  So basically what they're doing is they are licensing their intellectual property.
[241.10 --> 250.74]  To be clear, that is not, and they do not believe that that is the React classification
[250.74 --> 252.10]  of videos.
[252.28 --> 254.58]  That is not what they are licensing.
[254.88 --> 256.96]  Anyone, and they've released a statement.
[256.96 --> 263.20]  Even to quote, we do not own the idea or copyright for reaction videos overall, nor
[263.20 --> 265.30]  do we, nor did we ever say that we did.
[265.62 --> 269.20]  You don't need anyone's permission to make these kinds of videos and we're not coming
[269.20 --> 269.84]  after anyone.
[269.98 --> 270.20]  Yes.
[270.48 --> 276.40]  So what they are licensing is actually the, the format of the show, something that you
[276.40 --> 278.42]  can somewhat protect.
[278.68 --> 279.54]  That's a little funky.
[279.68 --> 282.08]  It's a little fuzzy, but they're licensing the format of the show.
[282.08 --> 286.54]  So they're actually licensing like the, the assets that are used in the creation of the
[286.54 --> 286.82]  show.
[286.82 --> 293.86]  So they will actually give you like a kit of materials to basically reproduce exactly the
[293.86 --> 294.40]  same bloody thing.
[294.46 --> 298.00]  They were, they're going to give you the formula and all the tools that you need.
[298.00 --> 305.38]  And the idea behind it is localization, not just like, you know, putting, not just like
[305.38 --> 308.56]  asking anyone who's making a reaction video for money.
[308.90 --> 312.48]  So that is, yeah, yeah, I saw that.
[312.56 --> 315.08]  I was going to get through this topic first and then I was going to deal with it.
[315.24 --> 315.44]  Sounds good.
[315.78 --> 315.98]  Yeah.
[316.06 --> 317.26]  We will roll the intro.
[317.38 --> 318.96]  Everyone just calm your jets.
[319.62 --> 320.76]  Cool your, cool your jets.
[320.92 --> 323.02]  Calm your thighs.
[323.02 --> 327.54]  So basically react and then react world.
[327.54 --> 329.76]  This is another channel that they're planning to launch.
[329.76 --> 336.76]  We'll aggregate videos in one place that are created by this wider community of licensees.
[337.36 --> 342.20]  And so fine brothers entertainment wants to monetize the react style videos through its
[342.20 --> 347.12]  own channels there rather than having the content appear on unaffiliated outlets.
[347.30 --> 350.06]  So yeah, there you go.
[350.06 --> 355.28]  So licensing to creators worldwide, 11 of their shows and trademarks in the franchise.
[355.94 --> 363.18]  And yeah, I guess there's not really much else to say about it.
[363.62 --> 367.90]  Intellectual protection law is very, very complicated.
[368.04 --> 370.14]  We're still going to have to see how aggressive they're going to be about things.
[370.24 --> 371.18]  And they've said they're not.
[371.26 --> 373.04]  They've said they're not issuing strikes.
[373.18 --> 377.02]  They're not stealing people's monetization or anything like that.
[377.52 --> 377.84]  And I think.
[378.40 --> 379.60]  It's probably going to be fine.
[379.60 --> 381.24]  Well, I think they probably can't.
[381.24 --> 387.60]  Quite frankly, I mean, for me to issue a copyright strike on someone, they have to rip content
[387.60 --> 388.92]  directly out of my video.
[389.66 --> 395.14]  They can't just like have a sound effect that sounds kind of similar and a flow to the episode
[395.14 --> 395.86]  that's kind of similar.
[395.98 --> 403.36]  I mean, if you could, if you could like trademark, you know, beautiful B roll of phones, then
[403.36 --> 405.44]  none of us would be allowed to compete with Marcus.
[405.44 --> 410.84]  Like before I knew enough, I almost tweeted a thing being like, hey, we're not the fine
[410.84 --> 411.12]  brothers.
[411.12 --> 412.44]  Make some build log videos.
[412.52 --> 413.10]  It'll be funny.
[413.18 --> 415.66]  And then I was like, I should probably read more about this.
[416.12 --> 416.60]  Yeah.
[416.60 --> 418.44]  And yeah, it ended up being fine.
[418.76 --> 423.30]  Someone's asking what the heck happened to Linus between the Intel thing and now I did
[423.30 --> 423.72]  my hair.
[424.16 --> 425.80]  I did a very poor job of it.
[425.92 --> 428.08]  I think you almost went for a faux hawk.
[428.24 --> 429.44]  But like I failed.
[429.58 --> 433.20]  So it ends up just looking like I'm balding more than I am.
[433.40 --> 435.58]  See, you got kind of the like kind of.
[435.58 --> 436.16]  Are you balding?
[436.50 --> 436.82]  A little.
[436.96 --> 437.12]  Yeah.
[437.20 --> 438.98]  I mean, you get older and your hairline recedes.
[439.10 --> 439.58]  Sorry, bro.
[440.52 --> 441.14]  Mine's fine.
[441.30 --> 441.78]  It'll come for you too.
[441.82 --> 442.64]  You're younger than me.
[442.78 --> 445.86]  My grandpa on my mom's side has wonderful hair.
[445.96 --> 446.40]  That's nice.
[446.58 --> 446.86]  So I'm probably okay.
[446.98 --> 449.72]  My grandpa on my mom's side was bald by the time he was out of high school.
[449.82 --> 450.78]  So you're probably screwed.
[450.98 --> 452.72]  Well, I'm not screwed yet.
[453.20 --> 455.30]  So I'm saying it's not necessarily an indication.
[456.08 --> 457.20]  Not necessarily an indication.
[457.70 --> 458.44]  He's old.
[458.44 --> 460.30]  I'm 29.
[461.06 --> 465.34]  Which is old enough that you're allowed to have your hairline recede a little bit.
[465.70 --> 471.72]  But also, also old enough that if you were like really going to get hit really hard and
[471.72 --> 474.24]  you haven't yet, then it's probably going to happen slowly.
[474.42 --> 478.36]  One of my really good buddies from high school had his hairline just whoosh.
[478.96 --> 481.10]  But he went with the like, all right, whatever.
[481.24 --> 482.20]  I'll build a full beard.
[482.38 --> 483.98]  And went bald with a full beard.
[484.10 --> 485.20]  Ashley looks way better.
[485.50 --> 486.62]  I do not have that option.
[486.84 --> 486.86]  100%.
[486.86 --> 487.12]  Nope.
[487.12 --> 493.06]  So if I end up going like bald bald, I'm just going to be Bic on top, Bic on bottom,
[493.26 --> 494.42]  and Bic on the other bottom.
[495.12 --> 496.22]  Let's roll the intro.
[517.12 --> 518.20]  Sorry, sorry.
[518.28 --> 519.42]  I'll move those things in a second.
[520.50 --> 522.26]  We only have one sponsor today.
[523.68 --> 524.92]  Linda.com.
[525.22 --> 526.34]  Linda.com.
[527.70 --> 529.04]  Wow, we have only one sponsor today.
[529.04 --> 534.26]  They can teach you how to film things and how to take photos and how to edit them.
[534.26 --> 540.80]  Lightroom and After Effects and Photoshop and Premiere.
[540.80 --> 542.06]  What is taking...
[542.06 --> 543.18]  What is taking...
[543.18 --> 544.96]  Why is this taking so long?
[545.74 --> 549.90]  YouTube's like, oh my god, everyone's uploading React to the Fine Bros videos.
[549.90 --> 552.38]  We can't process everything at once.
[553.74 --> 555.14]  That's what's happening right now.
[555.44 --> 558.80]  The amount of React to the Fine Bros videos that are out there is insane.
[558.80 --> 563.44]  I am blown away by how slow YouTube's processing has been.
[563.74 --> 568.10]  Between YouTube and Vessel, like, they just...
[568.10 --> 570.24]  They need to put their heads together.
[571.00 --> 571.30]  Okay?
[571.52 --> 575.02]  YouTube needs to figure out Vessel's processing because it's fast.
[575.02 --> 580.84]  And Vessel needs to figure out YouTube's downlink because it is fast.
[580.94 --> 583.72]  Like, we can upload, like, one gig videos like...
[583.72 --> 586.82]  Like, they're up in, like, 20 seconds.
[587.20 --> 588.02]  And then it's like...
[589.24 --> 595.50]  Like, I'm uploading a one minute video.
[595.60 --> 597.18]  It's going to take nine minutes to process.
[597.30 --> 598.84]  You have to be freaking kidding me.
[598.96 --> 599.72]  That's crazy.
[600.78 --> 604.72]  And the worst part is I think I interrupted the one that I tried before.
[604.72 --> 605.14]  We did.
[605.26 --> 608.70]  Thinking that it had completely locked up at 69%.
[608.70 --> 609.72]  And...
[610.54 --> 614.80]  Oh, apparently it's still processing.
[614.96 --> 615.84]  It wants another two minutes.
[616.16 --> 617.16]  What did I upload?
[617.28 --> 618.84]  Maybe I uploaded the wrong video.
[619.24 --> 621.00]  Maybe it's, like, last week's LAN show.
[621.00 --> 621.62]  Maybe it's a full LAN show.
[621.70 --> 623.62]  And we're just going to have two LANs.
[623.62 --> 624.24]  We're live!
[624.32 --> 626.26]  And then it's just a whole LAN show.
[627.32 --> 628.18]  From Fiki.
[628.44 --> 630.02]  We're live in the past!
[630.92 --> 631.68]  Make me fun.
[632.20 --> 632.92]  That could work.
[633.34 --> 633.72]  All right.
[633.72 --> 635.00]  So, let's move on to...
[635.00 --> 638.04]  Instead of a time machine that goes forward, we made one where you...
[638.04 --> 639.06]  No, we didn't.
[639.08 --> 640.74]  I could make a time machine that goes forward.
[640.88 --> 641.88]  It's called a cardboard box.
[645.94 --> 648.40]  You just fall asleep in the cardboard box and open it up.
[648.44 --> 649.26]  You're like, wow!
[650.36 --> 651.62]  We're in the future!
[651.62 --> 656.40]  Yeah, it's a cardboard box with, like, lots of, like, crazy syringes full of, like, all kinds of fluids.
[656.40 --> 661.30]  What happened to the last 20 years of my life?
[663.38 --> 663.94]  Sorry, dude.
[664.00 --> 665.14]  You spent them in this cardboard box.
[665.20 --> 665.50]  All right.
[665.86 --> 670.26]  This was posted by C.P. Yarger on the forum.
[670.52 --> 671.32]  Colton Potter Yarger?
[671.32 --> 672.34]  Uh, no.
[672.48 --> 674.42]  I don't think it was Colton Potter Yarger.
[674.50 --> 676.20]  He would have to learn how to use copy-paste.
[676.52 --> 676.68]  Whoa!
[678.60 --> 679.22]  Just kidding.
[679.26 --> 680.36]  He knows how to use copy-paste.
[680.48 --> 695.10]  So many people jumped to Colton's defense last week when I was really trying to pay a positive statement forward to him about the unexpectedly high quality of the WAN show document.
[695.10 --> 698.90]  Um, and people were all like, yo, Linus was mean.
[699.08 --> 702.68]  He was all like, you know, if it was meant to be a compliment, you'd know.
[703.12 --> 705.62]  And didn't you guys know that it was a compliment?
[705.84 --> 706.56]  Apparently not.
[708.10 --> 709.10]  I mean, like...
[709.72 --> 715.68]  So he's getting, like, inundated with tweets about how, you know, I'm mean and a bad person.
[715.68 --> 716.88]  Maybe that was your whole idea.
[717.52 --> 717.90]  Yeah.
[718.16 --> 719.44]  You were trying to blow up his Twitter.
[719.88 --> 722.06]  You are so astute sometimes.
[722.22 --> 722.92]  I try.
[722.92 --> 723.28]  It's surprising.
[723.28 --> 726.40]  My dick.
[730.90 --> 731.70]  Oh, wow.
[731.86 --> 733.60]  That just, that just, oh, man.
[733.70 --> 735.28]  That just lined up so beautifully.
[735.44 --> 736.68]  No, but it was a compliment, wasn't it?
[736.78 --> 737.50]  Yeah, definitely.
[738.74 --> 742.90]  That's like, that's like you're holding, you're like, you know, you're holding a pool noodle.
[743.30 --> 745.28]  And someone just kind of walks up and is like...
[745.92 --> 751.54]  And you just have to, you have to give me a little, like, slap on the, slap on the cheeks.
[751.54 --> 754.10]  I don't know if that's okay on Twitch.
[754.32 --> 755.54]  I have no idea.
[755.72 --> 759.92]  Wait, no, it's okay, because there's that one freaking chick that does it for donations.
[760.70 --> 764.42]  She'll drop something on the ground behind her and pick it up for donations.
[764.70 --> 765.38]  For donations.
[765.46 --> 769.02]  Yeah, because it's, like, okay, because she's not, like, showing cleavage or whatever.
[769.38 --> 771.84]  So you can show your butt crack, but not cleavage?
[771.84 --> 773.42]  No, but she wears pants.
[773.72 --> 775.24]  Oh, but they're just really tight.
[775.28 --> 776.54]  But it's just like, look at the bum.
[777.08 --> 778.00]  I see.
[778.52 --> 778.92]  Ridiculous.
[779.30 --> 781.46]  I wonder if I could get donations for that.
[781.78 --> 782.12]  Maybe.
[784.04 --> 784.92]  Butt donations.
[785.56 --> 786.42]  Butt donat...
[786.42 --> 788.10]  I don't want your butt donations.
[792.02 --> 793.20]  Okay, what's the next topic?
[793.26 --> 795.28]  I am trying to load the page.
[795.34 --> 796.08]  It is not doing a thing.
[796.08 --> 800.66]  The next topic is that the U.S. Supreme Court may rule cosplay illegal.
[800.88 --> 803.04]  Now, to be clear...
[803.04 --> 805.28]  Here, I'm just going to post the original link here.
[805.52 --> 811.34]  To be clear, the Supreme Court has bigger fish to fry than cosplayers.
[811.34 --> 816.60]  This would be an unintended side effect of a larger legal battle
[816.60 --> 820.54]  that is going on between a cheerleading outfit maker...
[820.54 --> 820.98]  Here we go.
[821.06 --> 822.60]  The article has finally loaded here.
[822.60 --> 827.86]  Between a cheerleading outfit maker and, I believe, another cheerleading uniform maker.
[827.92 --> 828.26]  Here we go.
[828.32 --> 830.98]  So the parties to the case, Star Athletica and Varsity Brands,
[831.10 --> 833.22]  both design cheerleading uniforms.
[833.46 --> 837.40]  Varsity claims that major portions of their designs are entitled to copyright protection,
[837.80 --> 844.68]  while Star Athletica, presumably the one that is said to be infringing the aforementioned copyrights,
[844.68 --> 847.94]  points out, and is backed by a long line of case law,
[848.02 --> 850.66]  that clothing designs are explicitly exempt from copyright.
[850.66 --> 856.18]  Their arguments rest on different interpretation of a legal concept known as separability.
[856.38 --> 857.98]  So what does this have to do with cosplay?
[858.32 --> 859.30]  Okay, well, hold on.
[859.34 --> 859.88]  We're getting to that.
[860.26 --> 864.92]  Basically, the way that it works now is that clothing maker...
[864.92 --> 867.62]  Clothes store, actually, because this is where it comes up a lot.
[867.72 --> 876.52]  Clothes store X, Y, or Z can take some famous designer's design and pretty much clone it.
[876.52 --> 883.72]  Clothes store, actually, because the way that it is now, a functional piece cannot be subject to copyright,
[884.18 --> 888.38]  whereas a creative work can be subject to copyright.
[889.16 --> 895.28]  So that's why you cannot copyright a sheet of paper, but you can copyright the art that you draw on it.
[895.28 --> 895.64]  Okay, yeah.
[895.64 --> 896.44]  Okay.
[896.84 --> 905.64]  So the argument here, being made by Star Athletica, would be that a cheerleading uniform is functional.
[905.84 --> 910.60]  It covers up the cheerleader's tatas, or doesn't in some cases.
[910.94 --> 914.28]  Whereas Varsity Brands is making the argument that...
[914.28 --> 926.28]  Well, no, there is an artful aspect to a cheerleading uniform or to any other article of clothing, whether it be...
[926.28 --> 929.42]  So if you took that piece of paper and cut it in a certain way?
[930.40 --> 932.04]  Yes, pretty much.
[932.04 --> 944.78]  They're saying that this line that exists between utility and creativity is blurry, but that their uniforms are on the we've created art side.
[944.98 --> 953.30]  And actually, this article on publicknowledge.org is excellent, because it does a really good job of illustrating this with a lamp and a lamp.
[954.54 --> 957.36]  Obviously, they both have the same base function.
[957.50 --> 959.04]  That is to say...
[959.04 --> 960.58]  Illumination of things.
[960.58 --> 961.44]  Into the room, yes.
[962.08 --> 962.68]  Whereas...
[962.68 --> 963.22]  Or space.
[963.32 --> 968.72]  This one is clearly not subject to any copyright, because every part of it is pure function.
[968.84 --> 971.70]  It's made of a freaking dowel and a thicker dowel.
[972.66 --> 979.76]  Whereas this one is clearly more artistic, and then this one doesn't really have much function at all.
[979.84 --> 981.72]  I mean, we don't even know how bright this bulb is.
[981.78 --> 987.62]  It's clearly all about the artful statement of the lady wearing whatever these are.
[987.68 --> 988.60]  Are those pantyhose?
[988.76 --> 989.10]  Nylons?
[989.10 --> 989.90]  I don't...
[989.90 --> 992.98]  I can't tell the difference between leggings, pantyhose, and nylons.
[993.04 --> 993.96]  I don't know what they are.
[994.64 --> 997.04]  So, some kind of covering on the leg.
[997.16 --> 998.72]  Last people to ask.
[999.10 --> 999.34]  Yeah.
[999.84 --> 1001.16]  Totally not my department.
[1002.76 --> 1003.12]  So...
[1003.12 --> 1004.72]  Like, literally at the store we work at.
[1004.78 --> 1005.90]  Neither of us work in that section.
[1005.90 --> 1007.24]  So, the sort of...
[1007.24 --> 1007.46]  So, the...
[1007.46 --> 1007.90]  So, the sort of...
[1007.90 --> 1008.04]  The...
[1008.04 --> 1027.22]  How cosplayers get kind of stuck in the crossfire here is that they could potentially be burned by copyright laws that consider the recreation of another article of clothing, if it is deemed as art, for the sake of dressing up as their favorite characters.
[1027.22 --> 1036.58]  Now, to be very clear, I don't expect any but the most draconian of companies to enforce something like this.
[1036.64 --> 1037.08]  Like Nintendo.
[1037.08 --> 1037.54]  Like you, Disney.
[1038.54 --> 1039.62]  Like Nintendo.
[1039.62 --> 1040.62]  Yeah.
[1040.62 --> 1041.62]  Um...
[1041.62 --> 1042.24]  But, okay.
[1042.38 --> 1044.36]  And like, a thing is, Captain...
[1044.36 --> 1050.82]  The logo for some of these guys, like the star on the shield for Captain America, is probably under some form of...
[1050.82 --> 1051.56]  Yes, definitely.
[1051.82 --> 1053.40]  And people use that all the time.
[1053.42 --> 1054.26]  People use that all the time.
[1054.26 --> 1056.00]  So, they're already doing these things, you're probably okay.
[1056.10 --> 1062.26]  So, I'm not really expecting anyone to do it, but where the water gets really murky...
[1062.26 --> 1067.96]  And the article says cosplayers, but I think they kind of missed the boat on this last point that I'm going to make here.
[1068.34 --> 1077.80]  And that is that the odds of anyone enforcing this on someone who shows up to watch The Force Awakens in a Kylo Ren mask is zero.
[1078.32 --> 1080.34]  I don't think Disney's going after that guy.
[1080.34 --> 1094.22]  The odds of them going after someone whose entire profession is becoming an Instagram influencer who posts pictures of themselves wearing someone else's intellectual property.
[1094.72 --> 1102.02]  Where someone is turning it around and turning it into monetary gain for themselves personally without sharing any of the proceeds.
[1102.56 --> 1104.60]  That's where I see this turning into a big problem.
[1104.60 --> 1112.20]  And we ran into that at that PAX party that the guy tried to throw with the Nintendo themed, like Pokemon themed, I think it was?
[1112.38 --> 1112.84]  I think so.
[1112.88 --> 1114.32]  Party where he was charging admission.
[1114.44 --> 1123.34]  Now, the admission in that case was, and this is all according to the guy anyway, only to cover the cost of the venue and throwing the party itself.
[1123.46 --> 1130.32]  But that did not stop Nintendo from saying, yo, you cannot profit off of our intellectual property.
[1130.32 --> 1136.04]  So people who cosplay as a hobby out of passion are very unlikely to be affected.
[1136.22 --> 1136.74]  I mean...
[1136.74 --> 1147.58]  There's a huge difference between doing something because you want to get money for it and doing something because you enjoy it and find it kind of fun and want to go to The Force Awakens opening in a Kylo Ren mask.
[1147.58 --> 1161.28]  Whereas people who are professional cosplayers who show up at gaming events dressed up according to the requests of their followers or whatever else, where they're making a business out of it, this could be a huge deal.
[1163.80 --> 1164.36]  Interesting.
[1165.22 --> 1166.46]  I kind of get that.
[1166.60 --> 1167.40]  That's going to get interesting.
[1167.64 --> 1169.60]  And there's a lot of people that do that as well.
[1169.60 --> 1169.86]  Yep.
[1170.00 --> 1172.84]  Like that's turning into like a serious industry actually.
[1172.98 --> 1173.28]  Oh yeah.
[1173.58 --> 1174.90]  Like professional cosplaying.
[1174.90 --> 1177.44]  Not as much for guys I don't think.
[1178.22 --> 1179.00]  I mean this...
[1179.00 --> 1179.20]  Here.
[1179.34 --> 1179.54]  Okay.
[1179.68 --> 1179.80]  Yeah.
[1180.24 --> 1181.76]  I mean you walk down the strip in Vegas.
[1182.32 --> 1185.20]  How many Batman people do you encounter?
[1188.12 --> 1188.90]  Again, it's like...
[1190.00 --> 1190.34]  Yeah.
[1190.52 --> 1193.72]  I don't think it's as much of a thing for guys but it is still definitely a thing for guys.
[1193.72 --> 1195.30]  Oh, it's definitely a thing for guys.
[1195.30 --> 1197.30]  But I think that it's...
[1197.30 --> 1204.32]  In terms of like being an Instagram model who is predominantly a cosplayer, I haven't seen a ton of dudes doing it.
[1204.62 --> 1204.66]  No.
[1204.90 --> 1205.58]  They're...
[1205.58 --> 1208.88]  I have seen like at least one but...
[1208.88 --> 1210.26]  But compared to like...
[1210.26 --> 1210.52]  Yeah.
[1210.78 --> 1213.70]  The female ones that seem to be crawling out of the woodwork.
[1213.80 --> 1218.46]  It's like if you leave them in the fridge for too long they'll actually replicate on a petri dish.
[1219.02 --> 1219.50]  Like...
[1219.50 --> 1220.76]  Yeah, there's lots of them.
[1220.82 --> 1221.08]  Yeah.
[1223.40 --> 1224.36]  This is interesting.
[1224.36 --> 1224.80]  Yeah.
[1224.80 --> 1227.46]  So this was posted by Aluminum Tech on the forum.
[1229.14 --> 1229.78]  Aluminum Tech.
[1229.96 --> 1231.22]  So presumably an American.
[1231.52 --> 1231.72]  Yeah.
[1231.72 --> 1232.56]  Um...
[1232.56 --> 1237.64]  Cortana now scans your emails to make sure you're keeping promises.
[1237.64 --> 1242.30]  Did you know there's apparently scientific reasons as to why it should be aluminum?
[1243.50 --> 1243.78]  Yeah.
[1243.90 --> 1245.12]  It has to do with the EM at the end?
[1245.14 --> 1249.56]  It has to do with the relation to other metals that are also called inium.
[1249.78 --> 1249.96]  Yeah.
[1250.40 --> 1250.54]  Yeah.
[1251.24 --> 1251.72]  Anyways.
[1252.08 --> 1252.64]  YOLO!
[1253.08 --> 1254.02]  Continuing onwards.
[1255.08 --> 1256.58]  So this is fascinating.
[1256.76 --> 1261.76]  Now, to be clear, this is like, ah, this is about as clickbait as it gets.
[1262.56 --> 1263.56]  Um, because...
[1263.56 --> 1267.62]  The title, I don't know if you've said the title yet, but the title is Cortana now scans
[1267.62 --> 1269.78]  your emails to make sure you're keeping promises.
[1269.88 --> 1271.54]  I know, but some people listen to the audio version.
[1271.68 --> 1272.66]  Oh, that's right.
[1272.72 --> 1273.62]  This is a podcast.
[1274.02 --> 1274.26]  Yeah.
[1274.52 --> 1275.18]  Well, sometimes I forget that.
[1275.18 --> 1278.58]  Which we never tell people about and not enough people do it because so many people are like,
[1278.88 --> 1282.72]  oh, I would love it if you guys made audio versions of the WAN show.
[1282.82 --> 1284.30]  And I'm like...
[1284.30 --> 1288.02]  It's literally linked under every single YouTube version of the WAN show.
[1288.02 --> 1288.68]  They exist.
[1288.82 --> 1289.54]  They're down there.
[1289.84 --> 1291.84]  So, yeah, if you didn't know that, they're...
[1291.84 --> 1292.72]  We even...
[1292.72 --> 1297.94]  Speaking of copyright, we even allow it to be downloaded if you go on SoundCloud.
[1298.12 --> 1302.00]  So, like, normally on YouTube, if you wanted to download and watch offline, you would have
[1302.00 --> 1303.32]  to have YouTube read.
[1303.84 --> 1308.84]  Um, or you could obviously download it, um, using a third party...
[1308.84 --> 1309.84]  I don't know, like...
[1310.40 --> 1311.22]  I don't know the name of them.
[1311.26 --> 1311.96]  Yeah, they're not...
[1311.96 --> 1312.84]  Yeah, I don't...
[1312.84 --> 1313.84]  Um...
[1313.84 --> 1314.96]  I...
[1314.96 --> 1315.38]  Okay.
[1315.56 --> 1316.64]  Anyway, they're out there.
[1316.72 --> 1317.80]  So you could obviously do that.
[1317.80 --> 1321.12]  Or you could just go onto SoundCloud where we actually have downloads of the podcast...
[1321.12 --> 1321.68]  I'm like, download it officially.
[1321.92 --> 1322.92]  ...straight up enabled.
[1323.26 --> 1323.86]  Um...
[1323.86 --> 1327.14]  Pre-optimized with its own, you know, title.
[1327.30 --> 1327.54]  Stuff and things.
[1327.62 --> 1329.28]  And I think, like, if you're...
[1329.28 --> 1329.72]  Title...
[1329.72 --> 1331.12]  It's the same title.
[1331.56 --> 1332.68]  Just repackaged.
[1333.40 --> 1334.02]  If you're...
[1334.02 --> 1336.48]  The Radeon R9 390.
[1337.04 --> 1337.72]  Oh...
[1337.72 --> 1338.20]  Oh...
[1338.20 --> 1339.70]  Okay.
[1340.26 --> 1344.64]  Um, if you have, like, some podcast application that you like on your phone, it's probably
[1344.64 --> 1345.24]  there as well.
[1345.66 --> 1346.20]  So...
[1346.20 --> 1347.04]  Yeah.
[1347.04 --> 1347.18]  Really?
[1347.52 --> 1347.74]  Yeah.
[1347.94 --> 1349.10]  Oh, is it that thing Colton's doing?
[1349.36 --> 1349.58]  Yeah.
[1349.70 --> 1350.18]  Oh, cool.
[1350.18 --> 1352.14]  Where it, like, distributes it out to a bunch of things.
[1352.26 --> 1352.50]  Cool.
[1352.80 --> 1353.12]  Um...
[1353.12 --> 1354.52]  Yeah, so it, like, is a thing.
[1354.62 --> 1354.84]  Yeah.
[1354.84 --> 1356.20]  We do have an audio version of the podcast.
[1356.20 --> 1357.54]  So that's why I read things out.
[1357.54 --> 1361.86]  So this is a very clickbaity, um, clickbaity headline.
[1361.86 --> 1366.08]  And what it's actually doing is really cool and not creepy at all.
[1366.52 --> 1367.80]  Um, so...
[1367.80 --> 1368.00]  Yeah.
[1368.08 --> 1374.70]  On January 25th, 2016, which was four days ago, Windows Insiders got access to a new commitment
[1374.70 --> 1377.26]  option in Cortana for Windows 10.
[1377.70 --> 1381.32]  And the commitments are actually really similar to features...
[1381.32 --> 1384.32]  Cortana just wants to make sure that you're going to be with her later on in life.
[1385.46 --> 1386.18]  Thank you.
[1387.10 --> 1389.62]  Guys that don't commit these days are just...
[1389.62 --> 1390.10]  It's just...
[1390.10 --> 1391.74]  It's just annoying in the dating scene.
[1391.74 --> 1392.06]  Okay?
[1393.58 --> 1396.58]  She just wants to know that you're going to be there for her when she's not as pretty.
[1397.42 --> 1398.26]  She'll always be pretty.
[1398.36 --> 1399.46]  She's a computer program.
[1400.48 --> 1404.96]  Literally, in the lore and in real life, she is a computer program.
[1405.98 --> 1406.62]  Good call.
[1406.86 --> 1407.14]  All right.
[1407.80 --> 1408.16]  So...
[1408.16 --> 1409.92]  When she starts to degrade or whatever it's called.
[1410.58 --> 1411.84]  Because that's actually in the lore.
[1412.10 --> 1412.58]  Bit rot!
[1412.98 --> 1414.80]  That literally happens to AIs.
[1415.02 --> 1417.34]  They start to, like, it's bad and then they...
[1417.34 --> 1419.30]  That's part of the whole storyline of Halo 5.
[1419.42 --> 1419.74]  Anyways...
[1420.38 --> 1420.74]  I...
[1420.74 --> 1421.60]  Thank you for the spoiler.
[1421.60 --> 1422.14]  No worries.
[1422.30 --> 1424.04]  Because I've only played up to, like, Halo 2.
[1424.42 --> 1424.64]  Yeah.
[1424.84 --> 1426.22]  Is there a PC version of Halo 5?
[1426.32 --> 1426.52]  No.
[1426.60 --> 1427.42]  Okay, well then I'm not going to play.
[1427.42 --> 1427.74]  Exactly.
[1428.28 --> 1429.32]  Okay, so...
[1429.32 --> 1429.94]  Although they might.
[1430.08 --> 1430.30]  I don't know.
[1430.34 --> 1431.02]  It's a little old now.
[1431.20 --> 1435.74]  It's very similar to the flight and delivery tracking that already exists in Cortana.
[1435.74 --> 1439.80]  So she'll remind you, like, hey, yo, you know, you've got a delivery coming and stuff.
[1440.36 --> 1446.24]  So it's designed to read through your emails and pick up on commitments that you've made.
[1446.24 --> 1451.64]  So if you say something like, I'll get back to you next week, Cortana will actually create a reminder around that.
[1451.70 --> 1454.48]  Be like, yo, you said you'd get back to that person this week.
[1454.48 --> 1456.92]  Like, you can disable...
[1456.92 --> 1460.48]  But the reason it's not creepy is all of the scanning is completed locally.
[1460.90 --> 1464.86]  So this program is just installed on your computer, runs on your computer.
[1465.10 --> 1467.86]  You can disable it if you don't want it, which is fine.
[1467.86 --> 1469.28]  Isn't it not on by default?
[1469.82 --> 1470.68]  I'm not sure.
[1470.86 --> 1474.58]  I mean, right now it's not on for anyone because only Windows insiders are getting it.
[1475.22 --> 1476.86]  But basically, yeah, it's...
[1477.38 --> 1477.74]  I don't know.
[1477.80 --> 1479.00]  I think this is really cool.
[1479.10 --> 1484.42]  Like, finding more ways to make Windows smarter and more predictive is definitely good,
[1484.52 --> 1486.68]  especially if they're going to keep it out of the cloud.
[1486.76 --> 1490.40]  Now, obviously, if you confirm that you want that appointment made,
[1490.42 --> 1493.20]  it's going to add it to your calendar, which is cloud synced.
[1493.34 --> 1495.68]  So, you know, don't be dumb.
[1495.68 --> 1500.32]  Like, if, you know, you don't want something on your calendar about how you told your,
[1500.42 --> 1503.68]  you know, second girlfriend that you're going to meet up with her at Starbucks,
[1504.06 --> 1509.12]  then you should probably, A, not be such a sleazeball, and B...
[1509.12 --> 1510.18]  Hashtag no side chicks.
[1510.26 --> 1511.44]  Yeah, keep that out of your calendar.
[1511.86 --> 1515.44]  So, you know, you can take whichever of those tips you prefer.
[1515.62 --> 1518.14]  One thing that I found that was actually kind of interesting reading this article.
[1518.32 --> 1521.00]  I'm not saying that I support the idea or don't support the idea.
[1521.36 --> 1523.98]  But, SwiftKey...
[1523.98 --> 1524.56]  Oh, hold on.
[1524.64 --> 1524.94]  Hold on.
[1524.94 --> 1525.48]  Twitch chat.
[1525.90 --> 1527.04]  Apparently, it's really cool.
[1527.58 --> 1528.58]  Signed, Windows Insider.
[1529.08 --> 1529.64]  There you go.
[1529.96 --> 1530.16]  Cool.
[1530.22 --> 1530.56]  Good to know.
[1531.38 --> 1532.04]  SwiftKey, yes.
[1532.22 --> 1532.50]  SwiftKey.
[1532.86 --> 1537.36]  People freak out, understandably, when something new is going to read through all their email.
[1537.54 --> 1538.68]  People didn't like that about Gmail.
[1538.98 --> 1540.12]  People don't like that about this.
[1540.20 --> 1541.14]  People don't like that about whatever.
[1541.32 --> 1541.46]  Yep.
[1541.62 --> 1543.62]  And then they sign up for SwiftKey, and they're like,
[1543.76 --> 1548.36]  yes, please read all of my email to figure out my exact typing patterns.
[1548.90 --> 1550.16]  No one complains about that.
[1550.16 --> 1554.62]  My one complaint about that is that SwiftKey Cloud does not work on iOS.
[1555.62 --> 1555.94]  Correct.
[1556.14 --> 1556.38]  Yeah.
[1556.48 --> 1559.80]  So, it only uses its stock prediction.
[1560.12 --> 1564.48]  And then I think it can learn, but I don't think it can carry that to, like, a new iOS device.
[1564.62 --> 1566.18]  Like, it sucks.
[1566.18 --> 1566.56]  That's rough.
[1566.56 --> 1568.76]  It, like, SwiftKey on iOS is terrible.
[1568.94 --> 1570.24]  Which is weird, because usually it's the other way around.
[1570.24 --> 1573.56]  And iOS is constantly changing its own keyboard back in as the default.
[1575.48 --> 1575.92]  Right.
[1576.36 --> 1576.80]  Yeah.
[1577.12 --> 1578.48]  So, yeah.
[1579.20 --> 1579.50]  There.
[1579.68 --> 1580.08]  I guess I don't really.
[1580.08 --> 1580.78]  Not Swifty.
[1580.96 --> 1581.96]  SwiftKey.
[1582.22 --> 1583.40]  It's an application on your phone.
[1583.88 --> 1584.10]  Yep.
[1584.44 --> 1586.88]  Unless you have an iPhone, in which case you probably just shouldn't install it.
[1587.06 --> 1587.22]  Yeah.
[1587.22 --> 1587.94]  All right.
[1588.08 --> 1593.98]  Jim Keller moves to Tesla as the vice president of autopilot hardware engineering.
[1594.46 --> 1594.54]  Whoa.
[1594.90 --> 1596.78]  Freaking cool.
[1596.78 --> 1600.88]  So, the original article here is from electric.co.
[1601.04 --> 1606.04]  And this was originally posted on the forum by Venayad Gaming.
[1606.62 --> 1608.12]  So, let's go ahead and pull this baby up.
[1608.18 --> 1608.92]  Are you posting the link?
[1609.04 --> 1609.62]  I'm working on it.
[1609.62 --> 1609.98]  Awesome.
[1610.68 --> 1614.32]  So, the chip guru who built Apple's AX microprocessors.
[1615.38 --> 1615.72]  Really?
[1616.02 --> 1620.48]  They're not going to, like, call out that he also built the Athlonix 2?
[1620.56 --> 1620.72]  Really?
[1620.80 --> 1621.98]  Is the PC that dead?
[1622.08 --> 1623.20]  Electric.co?
[1625.16 --> 1625.56]  Wrecked.
[1626.08 --> 1626.54]  Kind of.
[1626.54 --> 1626.86]  Okay.
[1626.86 --> 1633.28]  So, who built Apple's AX microprocessors joins Tesla to lead the autopilot hardware engineering team.
[1633.38 --> 1640.62]  Now, to be clear, you should not expect anything to come out of this appointment in the next two years.
[1641.14 --> 1641.42]  No.
[1641.42 --> 1644.98]  To design, presumably, mostly from scratch.
[1644.98 --> 1654.62]  A new way of processing camera and sensor information for autopiloting cars is going to be a very large project.
[1655.02 --> 1660.00]  Probably just the sort that Mr. Keller would love to wrap his magnificent brain around.
[1660.00 --> 1666.44]  So, this explains, then, why he fell off the map and left AMD a couple of months back.
[1666.44 --> 1670.52]  Apparently, he got a much, much cooler gig.
[1670.52 --> 1677.88]  I mean, as excited as I am to see what AMD's Zen architecture, which he did work on, brings to the table.
[1677.88 --> 1687.94]  I am more excited these days about a car that, like, is legit awesome and revolutionary and drives itself than I am about my PC going a little bit faster.
[1687.94 --> 1693.60]  So, I am very excited to see one of the brightest minds in chip design focus his attention on that.
[1693.72 --> 1702.54]  Although, it would be super great if Zen and their new graphics cards were faster than Intel's stuff and NVIDIA's stuff.
[1702.54 --> 1712.20]  I would love to have, I would love to believe that, but I have been, as a former, like, straight up with you guys, I was an AMD fanboy.
[1713.00 --> 1714.04]  AMD fanboy, my friends.
[1714.04 --> 1715.26]  I was an ATI fanboy.
[1715.54 --> 1716.40]  And probably AMD.
[1716.78 --> 1717.60]  Yeah, I was both.
[1717.60 --> 1718.20]  At one point.
[1718.48 --> 1721.10]  Like, I was, like, rocking the, let me think, what was that?
[1721.10 --> 1732.92]  I had this, like, freaking, like, UV green vinyl decal on the inside of my P160W that was, like, a ripoff of the Intel logo, except it said AMD inside.
[1733.00 --> 1734.98]  And I had, like, UV lights and it glowed green.
[1735.04 --> 1736.74]  And I was, like, I was, like, hardcore.
[1737.16 --> 1737.44]  Wow.
[1737.44 --> 1744.50]  But they have disappointed me so many times that I'm just not going to, I'm just not going to get my hopes up.
[1744.66 --> 1746.06]  And then if Zen is amazing.
[1746.28 --> 1747.02]  I really hope it is.
[1747.06 --> 1748.46]  Then I get to be that much more excited.
[1748.86 --> 1749.44]  That's cool.
[1749.56 --> 1750.92]  Polaris, I have a lot of hope for.
[1750.92 --> 1754.82]  I mean, I don't know how it's necessarily going to compare to, what was Nvidia?
[1754.94 --> 1755.24]  Pascal?
[1755.84 --> 1756.06]  Yeah.
[1756.14 --> 1758.48]  I think Polaris and Pascal, that's the ones that are coming out.
[1759.68 --> 1766.06]  But they're both likely to knock our socks off in a way that a GPU release hasn't done in quite some time.
[1766.18 --> 1766.92]  Freaking better.
[1767.34 --> 1768.56]  Yay, die shrink.
[1769.44 --> 1769.64]  Yeah.
[1772.16 --> 1774.06]  Anyways, that's cool.
[1774.32 --> 1775.76]  And hopefully Tesla uses them well.
[1775.76 --> 1776.90]  Yeah.
[1776.90 --> 1776.98]  Yeah.
[1776.98 --> 1781.88]  I'm super, super excited to see whatever happens here.
[1781.96 --> 1789.30]  Barnacley has actually just messaged me and said that he had a chance to check out Tesla's autopilot on the P85D.
[1790.12 --> 1792.02]  He said it was scary but really cool.
[1792.48 --> 1793.44]  So there you go, guys.
[1793.56 --> 1794.68]  I'm not surprised it was scary.
[1794.68 --> 1797.38]  Yeah, that would trip me out so hard.
[1798.16 --> 1798.68]  Like, just...
[1800.20 --> 1807.24]  Like, I drive the most manually operated vehicle on the road, pretty much.
[1807.24 --> 1809.96]  Even my windows are not automatic.
[1810.84 --> 1816.80]  Like, the only thing that could make it more manual is if there was a crank to, like, turn the fan for my cooling and heat.
[1817.02 --> 1817.68]  Like, it's...
[1817.68 --> 1818.30]  Does your heat work?
[1818.76 --> 1820.58]  Yeah, my heat works, but I don't have air-con.
[1820.74 --> 1823.24]  So it's, like, pretty bare bones.
[1823.48 --> 1824.78]  Pretty bare bones, my friends.
[1824.88 --> 1835.36]  So going from, like, that level of connection with the machine to, like, hands-off is going to sketch me out hardcore, no matter how much I inherently trust it.
[1835.36 --> 1839.08]  I think I'm going to be one of the first people to be like, sure.
[1839.86 --> 1840.58]  Drive me to work.
[1841.86 --> 1842.26]  Cool.
[1842.72 --> 1844.36]  Oh, I'll be exciting about it.
[1844.96 --> 1845.52]  Are you going to be exciting?
[1845.94 --> 1846.88]  I'm always exciting.
[1847.24 --> 1848.24]  You know what's up.
[1848.60 --> 1851.62]  I'll be excited about it, but it's going to trip me out, too.
[1851.70 --> 1853.30]  I mean, yeah, like, other little things.
[1853.36 --> 1863.32]  Other little things, too, is, like, I am not an insignificant amount older than you and have been driving for not an insignificant amount longer than you.
[1863.32 --> 1870.58]  And on top of that, I guarantee you that the mileage that I have on the road is probably 5x.
[1871.00 --> 1875.22]  Like, I used to daily commute from Maple Ridge, almost Mission, to UBC.
[1875.34 --> 1877.96]  And I've, if at all possible, been a biker.
[1878.46 --> 1878.88]  Yes.
[1879.06 --> 1881.52]  So, like, yeah, maybe a little bit more.
[1881.52 --> 1882.92]  Probably, like, 10x.
[1882.92 --> 1883.10]  Yeah.
[1883.10 --> 1886.18]  Like, I have a lot of miles on the road.
[1886.18 --> 1893.50]  But then I come from the standpoint where I'm already, right now, frustrated that, like, my car can't just inch itself.
[1894.06 --> 1894.46]  Yeah.
[1894.66 --> 1895.38]  Within a lane.
[1895.48 --> 1903.92]  Like, when there's very clearly defined lines, I'm just like, okay, like, can you just do this car so I can, like, go on my phone or something?
[1904.46 --> 1907.02]  And then when the lanes are really sketchy, I'm like, all right, I get this.
[1907.08 --> 1907.28]  Yeah.
[1907.40 --> 1907.76]  All right.
[1907.78 --> 1908.44]  I'll control that.
[1908.44 --> 1915.20]  I'm like, I think the first level where it's, like, sometimes it's okay, like, highways and stuff, I would have zero problem with it all.
[1916.06 --> 1923.10]  When you're going through sketchy areas and it's going to try to figure that out, that's when I'm going to be like, I would probably really like to just be turning the wheel right now.
[1923.12 --> 1927.08]  When there's, like, all the, like, you know, people on the street.
[1927.12 --> 1927.96]  People everywhere.
[1927.96 --> 1928.30]  Like, everywhere.
[1928.30 --> 1929.48]  Potholes and stuff.
[1929.66 --> 1929.92]  Yeah.
[1929.92 --> 1930.18]  Yeah.
[1930.26 --> 1931.24]  That'll be a little scary.
[1932.26 --> 1932.66]  Yeah.
[1934.30 --> 1934.92]  I don't know.
[1935.00 --> 1936.78]  Old dogs, new tricks, man.
[1936.94 --> 1937.56]  I don't know.
[1937.56 --> 1941.32]  Even if the new trick is sit, do nothing.
[1942.58 --> 1943.26]  It's hard.
[1944.38 --> 1944.94]  All right.
[1944.96 --> 1947.00]  So the original poster here was Mr. Troll.
[1947.10 --> 1949.68]  The original article here is from Digitimes.com.
[1949.68 --> 1959.96]  And while this normally wouldn't necessarily qualify as, like, a super amazing, okay, the Digitimes article is only available to their paid subscribers.
[1960.26 --> 1962.78]  So I guess we'll head over to WCCF Tech.
[1963.74 --> 1964.22]  Sweet.
[1964.22 --> 1964.36]  Sweet.
[1964.36 --> 1970.48]  The reason that this is significant is that these guys came out of nowhere.
[1971.82 --> 1972.54]  Asus does that.
[1972.74 --> 1973.22]  Asus.
[1973.92 --> 1976.50]  And, like, I've talked about this on this show before.
[1977.50 --> 1981.18]  They release some crappy product that sucks.
[1981.18 --> 1984.74]  And then they're like, okay, what did we learn?
[1985.94 --> 1986.78]  And then they fix it.
[1986.86 --> 1987.22]  Everything.
[1987.74 --> 1987.96]  Yeah.
[1988.02 --> 1989.82]  Then they release one that's okay.
[1990.64 --> 1993.28]  And then they kind of go, okay, we learned a bit more.
[1993.72 --> 1998.18]  Then, over the next couple of iterations, they completely dominate the category.
[1998.18 --> 2001.40]  They hold 40% market share of gaming monitors.
[2001.86 --> 2002.78]  And you know what?
[2003.06 --> 2006.04]  The incumbents have themselves to blame for this.
[2006.04 --> 2007.32]  I was just, yeah.
[2007.32 --> 2014.64]  They let, they let freaking BenQ walk in and eat their lunch.
[2015.28 --> 2016.86]  They let Asus.
[2017.52 --> 2021.34]  What did Asus know about making a monitor five years ago?
[2021.74 --> 2025.90]  They let Asus walk in and eat their lunch.
[2025.90 --> 2029.14]  And they're still doing it.
[2029.44 --> 2032.20]  I mean, I love the guys at LG as much as anyone.
[2032.42 --> 2034.88]  Like, I've got my bros over there and all that stuff.
[2034.96 --> 2036.24]  We love working with those guys.
[2036.92 --> 2039.12]  But wake up and smell the coffee.
[2040.22 --> 2046.20]  Your 60 hertz, 34 inch, ultra wide this year is 60 hertz.
[2047.92 --> 2049.86]  I know that you made some changes.
[2050.04 --> 2051.48]  I think it has free sync.
[2051.56 --> 2052.42]  Don't quote me on that.
[2052.70 --> 2054.08]  I think it has free sync.
[2054.08 --> 2056.02]  Like, that is not enough.
[2056.58 --> 2061.52]  Acer's XR something, C, whatever, something.
[2063.64 --> 2065.48]  That's, that's a free sync model.
[2065.68 --> 2065.94]  Okay.
[2065.96 --> 2067.92]  That's been out for like months at this point.
[2068.54 --> 2071.04]  The G are the Predator.
[2071.28 --> 2071.68]  X34.
[2071.74 --> 2071.86]  Yeah.
[2071.96 --> 2072.24]  X34 Predator.
[2072.24 --> 2073.38]  This ad is super annoying.
[2073.80 --> 2074.10]  Yeah.
[2074.24 --> 2074.58]  I know.
[2075.04 --> 2075.92]  You can close it.
[2075.98 --> 2076.84]  I don't even know how to close it.
[2076.90 --> 2077.04]  Yeah.
[2077.60 --> 2078.34]  What the hell?
[2079.14 --> 2080.18]  So can I just not?
[2080.18 --> 2084.06]  Is it, is it okay for them to cover up Google ads with their own free sync?
[2084.08 --> 2086.36]  Freaking stupid ad that I don't think you can close?
[2086.64 --> 2087.10]  I don't know.
[2087.14 --> 2089.18]  Like that's real classy WCCF.
[2090.26 --> 2093.20]  I'm sure the people paying for those ads are super stoked right now.
[2093.20 --> 2093.24]  Anyway.
[2093.24 --> 2094.38]  X34 Predator.
[2094.92 --> 2095.94]  100 hertz.
[2096.38 --> 2097.52]  3440 by 1440.
[2097.52 --> 2098.64]  Even Samsung.
[2099.18 --> 2103.14]  Who's like last year at CES, not CES 2016, CES 2015.
[2103.14 --> 2105.56]  I think it was, they were showing off a curved ultra wide.
[2105.74 --> 2107.74]  And I was like, yo, what can you tell me about this?
[2108.00 --> 2109.64]  The guy's like, it's 34 inches.
[2110.40 --> 2111.10]  It's curved.
[2111.54 --> 2115.56]  And I'm like, refresh rate.
[2115.90 --> 2118.02]  He's like, sorry, we don't have that information.
[2118.02 --> 2121.08]  So like, that's the level of care at Samsung.
[2121.30 --> 2128.78]  And even Samsung is talking up their upcoming 34 inch ultra wide at 144 hertz.
[2129.42 --> 2134.18]  So the incumbents have ignored this for far too long.
[2134.18 --> 2138.36]  They've let someone like Asus who doesn't even make panels.
[2138.92 --> 2144.06]  And when you're AUO or you're LG or you're Samsung, there is really no excuse when you
[2144.06 --> 2149.80]  have the costing and engineering advantage of actually building the freaking panels.
[2150.20 --> 2156.08]  There is no excuse for letting someone like Asus walk in and take over a market like that.
[2156.14 --> 2159.04]  Someone said, please stop making game monitors that look like male chicken.
[2159.16 --> 2162.08]  If you're talking about turkeys and you're talking about red because of their things,
[2162.16 --> 2163.52]  you can turn off the lights, dude.
[2163.52 --> 2165.40]  Yeah, you can turn off the lights on the RG Swift.
[2165.54 --> 2168.70]  In fact, you can turn off the lights on the Predator as well.
[2169.06 --> 2172.50]  Like it has RGB underglow effects, which you can turn on or off.
[2172.90 --> 2173.70]  It's totally up to you.
[2173.76 --> 2174.74]  So turn off the lights, bro.
[2174.76 --> 2179.08]  Yeah, I actually think if anything, gaming monitors have gotten a lot more tasteful.
[2179.28 --> 2179.84]  The aesthetic looks so much better.
[2179.84 --> 2182.16]  Do you remember the Acer Predator?
[2183.28 --> 2185.34]  Do you remember when everyone put gloss on everything?
[2185.50 --> 2187.80]  Hold on, I'm going to see if I can find the old Predator.
[2188.58 --> 2190.02]  Because that thing was bananas.
[2190.22 --> 2190.70]  There it is.
[2190.88 --> 2191.40]  Not to, okay.
[2191.40 --> 2193.86]  Like that's what gaming monitors used to look like.
[2193.96 --> 2194.88]  Oh, God.
[2196.32 --> 2196.68]  Ew.
[2197.36 --> 2201.94]  Not to call out Gigabyte, I was there at their booth at CES and the guy was showing me one
[2201.94 --> 2202.70]  of their new bricks.
[2202.92 --> 2204.74]  And he was asking what I thought about it.
[2204.82 --> 2205.46]  The mini PCs.
[2205.84 --> 2206.06]  Yeah.
[2206.38 --> 2208.30]  It had a matte finish.
[2208.56 --> 2209.70]  And I was like, oh, cool.
[2209.96 --> 2211.62]  I'm happy you guys went with a matte finish.
[2211.96 --> 2213.06]  And he was like, what?
[2214.18 --> 2216.60]  I was like, yeah, I'm happy you guys didn't use glossy plastic.
[2216.60 --> 2218.80]  And he's like, because I was like, it's not aluminum.
[2218.96 --> 2222.30]  It's not like absolutely beautiful, but it's matte, which is great.
[2222.54 --> 2223.86]  I'm happy you didn't use glossy plastic.
[2223.96 --> 2224.96]  And he's like, why?
[2225.04 --> 2225.74]  Doesn't it look better?
[2226.00 --> 2228.92]  I was like, no.
[2229.36 --> 2232.78]  And he's like, oh, I was worried we did the wrong thing going with matte instead of glossy.
[2232.90 --> 2236.64]  I'm like, dude, you accidentally did the right thing.
[2236.82 --> 2239.48]  Like, don't put glossy on anything.
[2240.32 --> 2241.06]  Come on.
[2241.46 --> 2242.28]  He's like, oh, wow.
[2242.28 --> 2243.26]  I haven't heard of that before.
[2243.26 --> 2246.44]  I was like, how have you not heard of that before?
[2246.94 --> 2247.90]  Anyways, yeah.
[2248.44 --> 2252.40]  Do we just need to make like a manufacturer best practices video?
[2252.56 --> 2253.08]  I think so.
[2254.46 --> 2256.44]  It seems like just rules.
[2256.58 --> 2257.42]  Like, no gloss.
[2257.98 --> 2259.18]  Don't use gloss on things.
[2259.68 --> 2259.98]  Yeah.
[2260.30 --> 2262.18]  That seems like the kind of thing we should do.
[2262.42 --> 2263.34]  Because like everything.
[2263.34 --> 2267.54]  Unless the gloss is like for some reason under glass and not touchable by the user ever.
[2268.00 --> 2268.44]  Yes.
[2268.70 --> 2270.48]  So like it will always look the same.
[2270.48 --> 2277.40]  See, like the glass coated bezel on a monitor like this where it has an edge to edge sheet of glass.
[2277.66 --> 2280.02]  Even though the actual panel doesn't go right to the edge.
[2280.24 --> 2281.12]  And then, yeah.
[2281.34 --> 2282.26]  Totally fine.
[2282.34 --> 2282.58]  Cool.
[2282.66 --> 2288.54]  Or the, um, some phones have like, like the old, going all the way back to the iPhone 4.
[2289.02 --> 2290.00]  iPhone 4 has that.
[2290.06 --> 2292.74]  The back panel is glossy but covered in glass.
[2292.82 --> 2294.06]  Which is at least easy to clean.
[2294.62 --> 2296.82]  Honestly though, I think everything should have this finish.
[2297.52 --> 2298.30]  Oh God, yeah.
[2298.32 --> 2299.86]  That nice textured, like powder.
[2299.86 --> 2301.32]  It looks like the truck bed kind of finish.
[2301.32 --> 2302.32]  Powder coat black.
[2302.42 --> 2302.60]  Yeah.
[2302.72 --> 2305.94]  Powder coat like wrinkled black is the ultimate finish.
[2306.36 --> 2306.54]  Yeah.
[2306.54 --> 2311.94]  Um, apparently Asus has also a 34 inch 3440 by 1440 coming soon.
[2311.94 --> 2317.62]  With a refresh rate of up to 100 hertz and G-Sync speculated price above 1200 US dollars.
[2317.82 --> 2320.52]  So that would be a competitor for the Predator X34.
[2320.88 --> 2322.78]  2,000 Canadian dollars.
[2322.82 --> 2324.12]  Yeah, 2,000 Canadian dollars.
[2324.22 --> 2324.88]  Holy crap.
[2326.14 --> 2328.28]  Oh, yeah.
[2328.70 --> 2330.12]  And then we became poor.
[2330.48 --> 2330.94]  Yep.
[2331.56 --> 2332.02]  Anyways.
[2332.10 --> 2335.48]  Speaking of becoming poor, why don't we talk about our sponsor for the show today?
[2335.60 --> 2335.96]  Yay!
[2337.14 --> 2338.24]  So that doesn't happen.
[2338.40 --> 2345.26]  If you want to avoid becoming poor, one of the strategies that you could employ is learning
[2345.26 --> 2347.18]  new skills on lynda.com.
[2347.22 --> 2351.38]  Whether that's just like Excel or Word.
[2351.74 --> 2352.34]  You could do stuff like web development stuff.
[2352.34 --> 2353.94]  Or if you wanted to Excel it using Word.
[2354.10 --> 2354.76]  Oh, damn!
[2355.36 --> 2358.68]  I made a PowerPoint on that sponsor spot.
[2358.68 --> 2362.00]  And then he photoshopped the images that went into the PowerPoint.
[2362.00 --> 2367.34]  I only photoshopped at the dollar store because the frames are cheaper.
[2368.08 --> 2368.52]  Whoa.
[2369.64 --> 2371.86]  That was a little rough, but it made sense.
[2371.86 --> 2373.42]  So, yeah.
[2373.50 --> 2375.74]  Whether you have new financial goals.
[2375.84 --> 2378.04]  Whether you need to find a work-life balance.
[2378.32 --> 2381.56]  Or whether you just want to be able to find things easily in the tutorial.
[2381.70 --> 2383.96]  Because sometimes you get distracted a lot.
[2384.40 --> 2385.42]  Also known as constantly.
[2385.76 --> 2389.04]  And sometimes you have to go back to the same point in the video like six times.
[2389.24 --> 2390.88]  So you can actually remember what the guy said.
[2390.88 --> 2393.70]  It makes it easy because you can search the whole script.
[2393.84 --> 2394.44]  Which is searchable.
[2394.74 --> 2395.86]  And you can download the whole video.
[2396.02 --> 2396.88]  And you can have your own notes.
[2396.98 --> 2397.98]  And you can do all that kind of stuff.
[2398.38 --> 2398.96]  lynda.com.
[2399.06 --> 2400.20]  Plan started at $25 a month.
[2400.26 --> 2401.80]  Head over to lynda.com slash wanshow.
[2401.94 --> 2403.22]  And get a 10-day free trial.
[2403.56 --> 2403.72]  Yeah.
[2403.80 --> 2404.46]  10-day free trial.
[2404.56 --> 2405.28]  All you can eat.
[2406.02 --> 2406.28]  Yeah.
[2406.38 --> 2407.96]  Through your internet connection.
[2408.68 --> 2408.96]  So.
[2409.18 --> 2409.84]  Because that's food.
[2410.02 --> 2412.10]  All you can go until your data cap, I guess.
[2413.04 --> 2413.82]  Yeah, pretty much.
[2415.54 --> 2415.98]  Alright.
[2415.98 --> 2419.68]  So let's move on to our next topic here, my friends.
[2419.68 --> 2420.16]  Yes.
[2420.30 --> 2422.52]  Oh, I am excited about this.
[2422.58 --> 2424.14]  The timing for this is wonderful.
[2425.10 --> 2431.20]  NVIDIA launches the low-end GeForce GT 710 graphics card.
[2431.80 --> 2438.38]  It is based on the Kepler GK208 GPU and aimed at low-cost PCs.
[2439.72 --> 2445.14]  So it's apparently aimed at low-profile platforms such as HTPC and media boxes that don't have
[2445.14 --> 2447.04]  onboard graphics for some reason.
[2447.04 --> 2450.66]  I mean, seriously.
[2450.66 --> 2455.64]  Has there been an onboard graphics solution that hasn't handled at least DVD decoding?
[2455.84 --> 2459.72]  Like hardware accelerated H.264 decoding in like the last four years?
[2460.06 --> 2460.44]  I don't know.
[2460.66 --> 2461.14]  I don't think so.
[2461.14 --> 2461.34]  Five?
[2461.60 --> 2462.26]  I don't think so.
[2463.12 --> 2465.24]  I think it's been like a considerable amount of time.
[2466.50 --> 2467.88]  I loved that test.
[2468.02 --> 2468.88]  What computers are people upgrading with these?
[2468.88 --> 2472.44]  I loved that test, killing the 730 with just a CPU.
[2472.76 --> 2474.02]  That was actually so cool.
[2474.26 --> 2476.76]  And like not even the best iGPU there is.
[2476.90 --> 2477.48]  Just, yeah.
[2477.62 --> 2479.08]  The sub headline is fantastic.
[2479.80 --> 2482.78]  Faster than 80% of integrated GPUs.
[2482.78 --> 2490.86]  So we actually have a video that's out on Vessel already, but not, is it on YouTube already?
[2491.02 --> 2491.70]  I think it is.
[2491.96 --> 2492.58]  Yeah, yeah, it is.
[2492.62 --> 2493.10]  It's on YouTube.
[2493.16 --> 2494.36]  It's on YouTube already as well.
[2494.36 --> 2503.72]  So, as a follow-up to the first time that I did a video about low-end video cards being junk and that no one should buy them,
[2504.32 --> 2509.20]  where a surprising, shocking number of people argued this point with me.
[2509.74 --> 2517.70]  With people even going as far as to say that I am an NVIDIA fanboy and that's why I was hating on the AMD card that we happened to be testing.
[2517.92 --> 2520.42]  Your gamer mind has clouded your judgment.
[2520.42 --> 2527.94]  Yeah, my gamer mind cannot conceive of a use for a video output device that is not a video game, gaming card.
[2528.52 --> 2529.86]  Like, any number of things.
[2530.00 --> 2537.68]  And I think Luke basically took all of the top-rated comments that criticized my original video, none of which was wrong.
[2538.12 --> 2542.26]  There was absolutely no new point that we had to make about this.
[2542.48 --> 2549.16]  So Luke basically just took all those comments and teabagged them for like seven minutes.
[2549.16 --> 2551.14]  That's kind of what happened, yeah.
[2551.22 --> 2559.34]  And it was great because low-end video cards are super, super, super, super dumb.
[2559.42 --> 2564.20]  And the thing, okay, I think a lot of people get really angry because they're trying to defend their purchasing decisions.
[2564.20 --> 2564.46]  Yes.
[2564.50 --> 2568.98]  And the thing that we're trying to do here is help you to not make that mistake again in the future.
[2569.10 --> 2571.16]  We're not being like, you guys are idiots.
[2571.86 --> 2572.06]  Yeah.
[2572.06 --> 2577.94]  We're trying to be like, don't spend your money on this because there's more effective ways to spend your money.
[2578.06 --> 2579.70]  Because there's a lot of misinformation out there.
[2579.78 --> 2580.02]  Yeah.
[2580.16 --> 2588.56]  And to be clear, I am not down on the $19.99 after rebate, $54.50 or whatever on Newegg.
[2588.66 --> 2589.52]  That's not what we're trying.
[2589.52 --> 2591.44]  That's not what we have a problem with.
[2591.50 --> 2591.68]  No.
[2591.68 --> 2602.24]  We have a problem with stuff that is positioned as like a $99.99 or like $119.99 offering that is terrible.
[2602.68 --> 2609.32]  And one of our points is that like at that price point, if that is your budget for a graphics card, we're not being like, LOL, you're poor.
[2609.46 --> 2610.54]  Don't buy a graphics card.
[2610.54 --> 2616.68]  We're telling you to maybe consider other options like buying an older tier one or buying a used card.
[2616.80 --> 2619.16]  You can get a lot of value out of buying used cards.
[2619.60 --> 2621.90]  Graphics cards are actually usually pretty okay.
[2622.40 --> 2627.70]  So you can get really solid cards for that price instead of buying a new one, which is crap.
[2627.84 --> 2630.82]  That you'll need to upgrade in no time at all when you realize it.
[2630.90 --> 2631.52]  And you know what?
[2631.68 --> 2635.50]  To be clear, like I'm using strong language, like it's dumb.
[2636.18 --> 2639.26]  That doesn't mean that people can't make that mistake.
[2639.50 --> 2640.40]  I did it.
[2641.52 --> 2643.06]  Straight up, I did it.
[2643.36 --> 2644.84]  I bought a crappy video card.
[2646.46 --> 2649.20]  I just learned a lot longer ago.
[2649.54 --> 2654.24]  And we are trying to help people so they don't have to go through the expensive process of learning.
[2654.34 --> 2654.66]  Yeah, because.
[2654.66 --> 2655.92]  And they can just watch a YouTube video.
[2656.30 --> 2658.94]  Let's say, for example, you didn't have a lot of money.
[2659.70 --> 2665.62]  Then wouldn't it be that much more devastating to waste $100 on something that turns out to be a terrible solution?
[2665.62 --> 2665.90]  Yes.
[2666.08 --> 2670.12]  I would way rather help the dude who doesn't have that much money spend it more effectively.
[2670.12 --> 2675.48]  Than help the dude that's going to be like, I'll just ignore this one and buy a new one.
[2676.04 --> 2677.38]  I don't really care about that.
[2679.10 --> 2679.24]  Yeah.
[2679.78 --> 2680.16]  I don't know.
[2680.16 --> 2687.30]  I got someone saying GTX 750s are ideal for watching Blu-rays.
[2687.30 --> 2692.20]  I don't think you need a GTX 750 to watch a Blu-ray.
[2696.42 --> 2696.86]  Anyway.
[2698.00 --> 2699.50]  I don't know what his point is.
[2699.50 --> 2702.00]  You know what?
[2702.04 --> 2703.66]  I don't know what the point is.
[2705.26 --> 2707.50]  Damboni posted this originally on the forum.
[2708.16 --> 2708.36]  Oh.
[2709.76 --> 2710.24]  Okay.
[2711.04 --> 2712.66]  So that's not a thing.
[2713.12 --> 2713.76]  Just a second.
[2714.12 --> 2715.24]  Oh, that's so stupid.
[2715.24 --> 2720.44]  Here we go.
[2721.04 --> 2723.96]  We'll just have to settle for the artist's rendering of what's coming back.
[2724.10 --> 2727.48]  Circuit City is coming back.
[2727.54 --> 2729.28]  With revolutionary new stores.
[2729.48 --> 2731.94]  With revolutionary new ideas.
[2732.36 --> 2733.08]  For stores.
[2733.24 --> 2735.58]  They want to appeal to millennials.
[2736.36 --> 2736.70]  Whoa.
[2736.70 --> 2737.26]  Wow.
[2737.64 --> 2738.42]  What an innovation.
[2738.84 --> 2740.06]  Brandon's laughing up there.
[2740.60 --> 2741.00]  Brandon.
[2741.34 --> 2741.74]  Brandon.
[2741.98 --> 2742.36]  Hey.
[2742.80 --> 2742.94]  What?
[2743.34 --> 2745.52]  Can you come up with some new ideas for our videos?
[2745.72 --> 2745.96]  Okay.
[2746.08 --> 2748.04]  Can you make them appeal to millennials, please?
[2748.42 --> 2748.72]  Okay.
[2748.94 --> 2749.52]  Thank you.
[2749.72 --> 2750.44]  All right.
[2750.68 --> 2752.06]  We need more couches.
[2752.30 --> 2755.44]  I want our B-roll to appeal to millennials, okay?
[2755.76 --> 2757.14]  We're typically only them.
[2757.32 --> 2757.76]  Thank you.
[2757.82 --> 2758.56]  Just millennials.
[2759.56 --> 2759.94]  Okay.
[2760.28 --> 2762.04]  So anyone who's not allergic to work.
[2762.04 --> 2763.60]  We don't want them to watch our videos.
[2764.42 --> 2765.48]  I am a millennial.
[2765.56 --> 2766.22]  I'm allowed to do it.
[2766.22 --> 2766.70]  Okay.
[2767.06 --> 2767.24]  Yeah.
[2767.30 --> 2769.28]  I'm technically a millennial.
[2769.38 --> 2770.22]  What is millennial?
[2770.36 --> 2771.78]  What time frame is that?
[2771.96 --> 2775.10]  I think you have to be born in the...
[2775.10 --> 2775.56]  Hold on.
[2775.60 --> 2775.84]  Hold on.
[2775.90 --> 2776.16]  Hold on.
[2777.20 --> 2777.64]  Yeah.
[2777.72 --> 2778.14]  Here we go.
[2778.26 --> 2781.76]  Birth years ranging from the early 1980s to early 2000s.
[2781.80 --> 2782.08]  Okay.
[2782.32 --> 2784.36]  So I can make fun of millennials, too.
[2784.46 --> 2785.96]  I am comfortably millennial.
[2786.40 --> 2787.50]  We're all strawberries.
[2789.26 --> 2790.12]  What's a strawberry?
[2790.44 --> 2791.32]  It's a Chinese term.
[2792.26 --> 2792.66]  Oh.
[2792.66 --> 2793.56]  For millennials.
[2793.56 --> 2793.94]  Yeah.
[2793.94 --> 2800.20]  Well, for like young people who bruise easily, which is where the thing comes from.
[2800.40 --> 2800.70]  Oh.
[2800.70 --> 2804.54]  So it's like easily offended, don't work very hard.
[2804.54 --> 2805.28]  Afraid of hard work.
[2805.28 --> 2805.90]  Sure.
[2805.90 --> 2806.24]  All that kind of stuff.
[2806.24 --> 2806.54]  Yeah.
[2806.54 --> 2806.82]  Okay.
[2807.16 --> 2807.52]  All right.
[2807.58 --> 2808.06]  Fair enough.
[2809.00 --> 2810.22]  We are kind of strawberries.
[2810.78 --> 2812.30]  Our generation is not great for that.
[2812.92 --> 2813.52]  One's like...
[2813.52 --> 2813.66]  Wow.
[2813.66 --> 2815.60]  The entire Twitch chat's like exploding.
[2815.82 --> 2816.28]  Like gasp.
[2816.28 --> 2817.04]  I'm born in this year.
[2818.04 --> 2818.24]  Yeah.
[2818.34 --> 2818.56]  Okay.
[2819.30 --> 2819.66]  Okay.
[2819.82 --> 2820.42]  So let's...
[2820.42 --> 2820.74]  So yeah.
[2820.98 --> 2821.14]  Oh.
[2821.80 --> 2822.00]  Shoot.
[2822.20 --> 2822.96]  I should...
[2822.96 --> 2823.34]  There we go.
[2823.66 --> 2825.50]  So Circuit City's coming back.
[2825.58 --> 2827.46]  So anyway, so how are they going to target millennials?
[2827.58 --> 2828.14]  Great question.
[2828.22 --> 2828.90]  I'm glad you asked.
[2829.28 --> 2835.68]  They're looking to have an express section selling $10 to $30 products that are replenishable
[2835.68 --> 2842.46]  via a business-to-business portal looking to put products in C-stores, bookstores, hardware
[2842.46 --> 2843.32]  stores, etc.
[2844.72 --> 2845.10]  Okay.
[2845.38 --> 2845.56]  What?
[2845.78 --> 2852.86]  They are also planning to focus on categories like mobile, 3D printing, and drones.
[2853.08 --> 2854.98]  Things that millennials like.
[2855.94 --> 2857.40]  I'm sure that...
[2857.40 --> 2858.04]  What's their face?
[2858.12 --> 2860.92]  Best Buy never thought of trying to sell mobile devices.
[2861.24 --> 2861.32]  Yeah.
[2861.58 --> 2862.50]  Or 3D printers.
[2862.88 --> 2865.66]  Best Buy Mobile would be an interesting name for that if they ever decided to sell it.
[2865.68 --> 2866.48]  Yeah.
[2867.18 --> 2867.40]  Yeah.
[2867.52 --> 2869.68]  Or like the Apple...
[2870.38 --> 2874.50]  Like if they had like a separate Apple section within the Best Buy store where you could see
[2874.50 --> 2876.20]  all the latest mobile devices from Apple.
[2876.28 --> 2879.98]  That had like its own kind of table structure that looked more like an Apple store.
[2879.98 --> 2880.20]  Yeah.
[2880.36 --> 2885.06]  And like if it also had like kind of like a backboard on it so that while you were looking
[2885.06 --> 2888.48]  at the table, you really felt more like you were having like the Apple experience.
[2888.76 --> 2889.12]  Interesting.
[2889.38 --> 2890.96]  Someone at Best Buy should come up with that.
[2891.06 --> 2893.68]  And then like other vendors, like whether...
[2893.68 --> 2895.06]  Like say for example, Microsoft.
[2895.40 --> 2895.58]  Yeah.
[2895.68 --> 2898.68]  They could copy that idea and they could have...
[2898.68 --> 2899.02]  Have their own little section?
[2899.20 --> 2899.34]  Yeah.
[2899.40 --> 2900.06]  They could have their little section.
[2900.06 --> 2902.24]  People could wear slightly different uniforms.
[2902.42 --> 2902.76]  So they still...
[2902.76 --> 2903.78]  You still know their...
[2903.78 --> 2904.08]  Yeah.
[2904.20 --> 2904.94]  ...employee of the store.
[2905.10 --> 2905.92]  Oh my goodness.
[2906.06 --> 2906.32]  Okay.
[2906.44 --> 2906.66]  Okay.
[2906.86 --> 2911.80]  Eva Hot Q Jog says Best Buy Mobile exists.
[2912.26 --> 2912.66]  Whoa.
[2913.68 --> 2914.88]  I can't even believe that.
[2914.94 --> 2916.12]  How did we not pick up on this?
[2916.12 --> 2917.58]  I am blindsided by this.
[2917.64 --> 2918.06]  Me too.
[2918.22 --> 2920.76]  I mean the next thing they're going to tell us is that the Apple thing exists.
[2920.76 --> 2924.64]  Is that just because they react so quickly to the show that they just did it right now?
[2924.64 --> 2925.90]  Did they have to go look that up?
[2925.94 --> 2927.82]  Because I mean, do they even have that on their website?
[2929.68 --> 2933.88]  Oh, you guys.
[2933.96 --> 2934.60]  I love you guys.
[2934.68 --> 2934.86]  Okay.
[2934.86 --> 2937.32]  Let's move on to our next topic.
[2937.32 --> 2937.58]  Okay.
[2937.66 --> 2940.32]  In case you care, they're planning to...
[2941.32 --> 2942.12]  For whatever reason.
[2942.12 --> 2945.44]  They're projecting 5,000 to 10,000 locations over the next five years.
[2946.08 --> 2948.04]  I'm projecting all of them close.
[2948.06 --> 2951.64]  Looking towards private label products to resell elsewhere.
[2952.30 --> 2954.90]  I mean, what strategy is that?
[2955.20 --> 2960.38]  I mean, do you have any idea what the look on my face was when I was a product manager at NCIX
[2960.38 --> 2963.54]  and Rose Will approached us about carrying their products?
[2964.40 --> 2965.74]  I was just like, are you high?
[2965.74 --> 2969.86]  For people that don't know, Newegg...
[2969.86 --> 2970.42]  Are you high?
[2970.48 --> 2970.94]  Are you drunk?
[2971.26 --> 2972.64]  Newegg does the Rose Will stuff.
[2972.64 --> 2972.82]  Yeah.
[2973.52 --> 2975.50]  That's Newegg's Kirkland signature.
[2975.96 --> 2976.10]  Yeah.
[2976.68 --> 2979.86]  And Kirkland's signature is Costco's Western Family.
[2980.52 --> 2981.92]  And we'll get there eventually.
[2982.10 --> 2982.28]  Yeah.
[2982.40 --> 2983.96]  Western Family is...
[2983.96 --> 2984.38]  Shoot.
[2984.46 --> 2986.16]  I can't think of any more house brands right now.
[2986.42 --> 2986.68]  Dang.
[2987.36 --> 2988.34]  Does Home Depot have one?
[2988.44 --> 2989.18]  No, I don't think so.
[2989.22 --> 2990.22]  I don't think so.
[2990.22 --> 2991.06]  Best Buy's...
[2991.06 --> 2991.82]  They have one.
[2992.00 --> 2993.06]  B&H is Impact.
[2993.48 --> 2993.96]  There you go.
[2994.52 --> 2994.78]  Yeah.
[2994.78 --> 2995.90]  Oh, yeah.
[2995.96 --> 2996.64]  What is Best Buy?
[2996.76 --> 2997.98]  Best Buy has lots of...
[2997.98 --> 2998.62]  Rocketfish.
[2998.78 --> 2999.50]  Rocketfish is one of them.
[2999.62 --> 3001.38]  That's for, like, monitor stands and crap.
[3001.88 --> 3002.14]  Sorry?
[3002.70 --> 3003.14]  Dynex!
[3003.50 --> 3003.90]  Dynex.
[3003.94 --> 3004.66]  That's another one.
[3004.74 --> 3005.06]  Dynex.
[3005.06 --> 3005.64]  I think they have more.
[3005.94 --> 3006.10]  Yeah.
[3006.16 --> 3006.74]  Hey, hey, hey!
[3007.28 --> 3008.04]  Future Shop!
[3008.12 --> 3008.78]  What else they got?
[3009.30 --> 3009.70]  Insignia!
[3010.16 --> 3010.52]  Insignia.
[3010.84 --> 3011.86]  They made, like, TVs.
[3013.90 --> 3014.26]  Westinghouse.
[3014.46 --> 3015.88]  The Twitch chat is helping us now, too.
[3017.18 --> 3018.08]  Oh, my God.
[3018.08 --> 3019.30]  Um, so, yeah.
[3019.40 --> 3020.64]  Best of luck with that Circuit City.
[3020.64 --> 3021.68]  HP's Compact?
[3021.94 --> 3023.28]  Is that...
[3023.28 --> 3026.26]  No, I think that's just more of a, like, brand.
[3026.36 --> 3027.74]  They bought them out, and then we're like, okay.
[3027.96 --> 3028.26]  Yeah.
[3028.94 --> 3029.22]  Yeah.
[3029.40 --> 3030.40]  Oh, poor HP.
[3031.20 --> 3032.24]  Who bought Gateway?
[3033.36 --> 3034.00]  Acer, I think.
[3034.00 --> 3034.62]  Yeah, that's right.
[3035.56 --> 3036.18]  That sucks.
[3036.22 --> 3038.92]  It's like, yeah, we see this innovative business model.
[3038.92 --> 3042.82]  They've got, like, a cow on their, uh, on their box.
[3043.00 --> 3045.80]  So, if you open up the box, it's like, no.
[3046.82 --> 3048.38]  I don't think they ever actually did that.
[3048.40 --> 3048.74]  No, I don't think so.
[3048.78 --> 3049.46]  They should have.
[3049.54 --> 3049.78]  Yeah.
[3051.06 --> 3051.82]  All right.
[3051.96 --> 3055.24]  I love this next bit of news from Ars Technica.
[3055.60 --> 3058.60]  Thank you so much, FCC.
[3060.06 --> 3067.02]  Ignoring cable industry protests, the FCC says it will unlock the set-top box.
[3067.02 --> 3080.10]  This is all based on an investigation that they did into how the cable box has managed to increase in price at a rate that outpaces other electronics.
[3080.94 --> 3094.18]  And asking themselves the critical question, when the functionality hasn't changed, and the cost of electronics inherently goes down, how is this happening?
[3094.18 --> 3106.06]  So, the average user pays an annual $231.82 in rental fees.
[3106.12 --> 3108.58]  Which is more than it should cost to just buy the thing.
[3108.64 --> 3109.84]  For their set-top box.
[3109.98 --> 3114.46]  Thank you, Luke, because the hardware in there is not worth anything.
[3115.12 --> 3115.38]  Nope.
[3115.38 --> 3117.60]  I mean, we're talking you can buy...
[3117.60 --> 3119.86]  And you have to, like, return it when you're done.
[3119.98 --> 3131.24]  You can buy a Tegra-powered NVIDIA Shield console for less than what you would pay in rental fees on this piece of crap in, like, 20 months.
[3131.62 --> 3131.96]  Okay?
[3131.96 --> 3135.86]  And that thing is a legitimately powerful piece of hardware.
[3136.56 --> 3138.38]  There is nothing in this thing.
[3138.92 --> 3140.40]  Okay, some of them have a hard drive.
[3140.46 --> 3140.96]  I'll give you that.
[3141.02 --> 3142.84]  But have you seen the price of hard drives lately?
[3142.98 --> 3143.46]  Pretty cheap.
[3143.80 --> 3144.96]  I'm probably giving you a $500.
[3144.96 --> 3152.24]  So, the FCC is planning for a software-based cardless replacement for cable card without...
[3152.24 --> 3161.56]  So, without needing the card, consumers would be able to get the TV service that they already subscribe to on tablets, smart TVs, or set-top boxes.
[3161.56 --> 3176.06]  So, this is in opposition to the plan proposed by Comcast and other TV providers that wanted a framework that involved the cable companies building proprietary apps for things like smart TVs.
[3176.38 --> 3183.06]  Apps that you know would be garbage and would be intentionally garbage so they could push services like Watchable.
[3183.42 --> 3183.52]  Yeah.
[3187.46 --> 3188.06]  Brutal.
[3188.26 --> 3188.96]  Thank you, FCC.
[3188.96 --> 3190.02]  So, yeah.
[3190.14 --> 3199.94]  So, U.S. Senators found in a survey of TV providers last year that lack of competition has resulted in prices rising much faster than in other hardware markets, said an FCC official.
[3201.26 --> 3203.60]  This was originally posted on the forum by Cloaked, by the way.
[3203.74 --> 3204.26]  Thank goodness.
[3204.42 --> 3209.46]  I wish Canada would wake up in the same way that the FCC has over the last little bit.
[3209.52 --> 3214.04]  And I don't expect the changes to happen overnight in America, and I don't expect them to happen overnight anywhere.
[3214.28 --> 3216.24]  But it would be nice to see some progress.
[3216.64 --> 3216.96]  We still don't even...
[3216.96 --> 3222.38]  Well, luckily, if the states do it, usually Canada's like, oh, oh, okay, and then does it afterwards.
[3222.38 --> 3222.84]  Yes and no.
[3222.92 --> 3224.24]  We still don't even have cable card.
[3224.76 --> 3225.22]  That's true.
[3225.50 --> 3235.24]  Like, we straight up don't even have cards that we could plug into a TV tuner in, like, a computer so that we could PVR things on our computer instead of on the proprietary box.
[3236.14 --> 3237.36]  Like, it's actually worse.
[3238.90 --> 3239.62]  Yay, Canada.
[3240.74 --> 3241.42]  Go Canada.
[3241.42 --> 3243.90]  I mean, there's a lot of stuff I love about Canada, to be very clear.
[3244.00 --> 3245.30]  I'm not, like, down on my country.
[3245.40 --> 3247.94]  You love their floppy heads and their beady little eyes.
[3248.74 --> 3249.86]  And I love their accents, too.
[3250.04 --> 3250.44]  Hey, buddy.
[3250.44 --> 3250.48]  Okay.
[3252.86 --> 3254.42]  So this is kind of your topic.
[3254.96 --> 3257.10]  Originally posted by Commandman7.
[3257.28 --> 3260.38]  The original article here is from Fudzilla.
[3260.38 --> 3260.78]  Fudzilla.
[3261.10 --> 3264.86]  I would have loved if this was my topic, but I wasn't able to read the doc today.
[3265.06 --> 3265.40]  Oh.
[3265.40 --> 3273.28]  And then walked upstairs and tried to talk to Colton about it and read the notes that were on it and was like, do more of them.
[3273.52 --> 3274.72]  And then walked away.
[3274.72 --> 3282.44]  Because all that were really in the notes were that it is a near-eyed Lightfields VR headset.
[3283.90 --> 3284.38]  Okay.
[3284.50 --> 3290.90]  The long and short of it is that we are at least two to three years away from this being in a consumer product.
[3290.90 --> 3293.80]  It's something that NVIDIA is working on with Stanford University.
[3294.46 --> 3303.04]  And that it virtually, apparently, virtually eliminates motion sickness by being latency-free.
[3303.04 --> 3305.56]  Very, very cool stuff.
[3305.64 --> 3308.62]  I mean, VR is going to be advancing so friggin' fast.
[3308.64 --> 3308.94]  Oh, yeah.
[3309.20 --> 3310.30]  Over the next few years here.
[3310.36 --> 3324.88]  So it uses two layered displays with back-to-back LCD panels that are separated by five millimeters to also improve the ability to quickly refocus on objects that are nearer or further from the viewer.
[3324.88 --> 3330.68]  Using your eyes, which is interesting because today's VR headsets, the user's eyes are more focused on the display rather than the image,
[3330.68 --> 3336.04]  which is actually a huge problem for motion sickness and for developmental reasons.
[3336.30 --> 3343.92]  People have been bringing up concerns about kids using VR headsets because they're focusing on a display all the time.
[3344.08 --> 3347.72]  And it's not promoting eye development or whatever.
[3348.26 --> 3348.40]  Yeah.
[3348.46 --> 3351.70]  So this should make it much more natural to use.
[3352.34 --> 3352.78]  And...
[3352.78 --> 3354.38]  Whether or not that's actually a thing, who knows.
[3354.38 --> 3354.86]  Yeah.
[3355.04 --> 3364.38]  Now, what's unclear at this point in time is whether this will be an NVIDIA proprietary technology or whether AMD will even still exist for us to have that conversation.
[3365.08 --> 3371.16]  So the algorithm used to compute the light field images in real time utilizes CUDA parallel programming.
[3371.26 --> 3378.54]  Now, with that said, my understanding is that AMD can implement CUDA with the appropriate license, which I think they have now?
[3378.54 --> 3380.04]  They are going to or have.
[3380.04 --> 3396.60]  So as long as NVIDIA doesn't package this up into like a G-Sync type of proprietary closed door deal, then this could be fantastic for the VR industry as a whole,
[3396.70 --> 3400.14]  whether you're running green or red team hardware inside your game.
[3400.14 --> 3401.22]  You'll have to read a lot more about it later on.
[3401.22 --> 3403.22]  But yeah, I'm...
[3404.04 --> 3408.18]  So far, two-layer PCBs, back-to-back...
[3408.18 --> 3409.44]  Displays.
[3409.76 --> 3412.66]  Uh, LCDs is what I meant to say, not PCBs.
[3412.66 --> 3416.78]  Yeah, if you put just two PCBs in front of your eyes, there'd be no VR.
[3417.38 --> 3420.10]  It could look maybe kind of cool if they're cool PCBs.
[3420.10 --> 3433.10]  Speaking of PCBs, I, uh, I checked in with the Free Geek guys and I don't know if it will be feasible for me to buy the quantity of PCBs that I would want in order to use them as decorative items.
[3433.12 --> 3433.54]  Because they're too expensive?
[3433.84 --> 3435.26]  They are $3 a pound.
[3437.36 --> 3438.74]  $3 a pound!
[3439.30 --> 3440.36]  That's actually pretty expensive.
[3440.56 --> 3444.88]  That would actually cost a bloody fortune to like do up a wall with or something.
[3445.06 --> 3447.52]  I mean, I might still, I don't know, I might still do it or something.
[3447.52 --> 3452.32]  Like, but the thing is, is that I didn't really have a clear idea of where I wanted to put it anyway.
[3452.86 --> 3456.02]  Like, I was kind of thinking it'd be cool to do a wall in the benchmark room.
[3456.60 --> 3459.60]  Or it'd be like cool to do a wall in my office or something.
[3459.90 --> 3461.30]  It's probably inappropriate for my office.
[3461.40 --> 3465.80]  Like, I didn't really, like I hadn't, I wasn't like, oh yeah, we need a PCB wall there.
[3466.36 --> 3471.30]  But I just, I think this place just needs more, more decoration and more spice in general.
[3471.48 --> 3476.96]  Like, doing up Yvonne's office really made it clear to me that the more stuff we did like that,
[3476.96 --> 3478.88]  the more homey this place is going to feel.
[3479.54 --> 3482.60]  So I was just, I don't know, I was looking at the pile of them at Free Geek and I was like,
[3482.64 --> 3484.16]  oh yeah, that'd be cool, like a PCB wall.
[3484.24 --> 3484.98]  Because I've seen it done.
[3485.18 --> 3486.56]  And it looks really badass.
[3486.60 --> 3487.18]  It does, yeah.
[3489.60 --> 3489.92]  Yeah.
[3491.22 --> 3493.30]  People are asking what a pound is.
[3493.38 --> 3495.62]  Yes, it's about, a little under half a kilogram.
[3497.16 --> 3497.52]  Sorry.
[3497.78 --> 3499.72]  Sorry to my non-American friends.
[3499.96 --> 3500.72]  Floppy disk wall?
[3500.78 --> 3501.30]  That would be sick.
[3501.30 --> 3503.50]  You'd have to find enough colorful floppy disks though.
[3503.56 --> 3504.48]  Yeah, they're out there.
[3504.60 --> 3506.40]  Like yellow and pink floppy disks.
[3506.44 --> 3506.66]  Yeah.
[3506.66 --> 3506.96]  Yeah, man.
[3508.36 --> 3509.06]  All right.
[3509.26 --> 3510.82]  Original article here is from NGadget.
[3510.90 --> 3513.54]  This was posted by Alex P something or other.
[3513.76 --> 3517.60]  Sony creates a new company to run everything PlayStation.
[3519.68 --> 3525.00]  So, Sony Interactive Entertainment combines hardware and software with PlayStation branded services.
[3525.00 --> 3533.86]  And I guess the point of spinning this off would be that it will keep PlayStation clear of the rest of Sony's abominable balance sheet.
[3534.06 --> 3534.36]  Probably.
[3536.20 --> 3539.24]  That's a pretty boring news topic.
[3539.56 --> 3539.82]  But yeah.
[3539.86 --> 3540.06]  Yep.
[3540.42 --> 3543.78]  I think they're probably trying to dodge financial problems by moving them off to their own thing.
[3544.52 --> 3544.70]  Yep.
[3545.36 --> 3545.76]  Okay.
[3545.92 --> 3546.46]  So, there you go.
[3546.84 --> 3548.54]  This I already talked about very briefly.
[3548.54 --> 3557.90]  But the real news here is not necessarily that Samsung is readying their first 144 hertz 3440 by 1440 ultra wide monitor.
[3558.00 --> 3563.20]  But rather, the way that that technology is going to be enabled.
[3563.48 --> 3564.42]  Yes, my friends.
[3564.84 --> 3569.60]  DisplayPort 1.3 is coming to Polaris GPUs.
[3570.10 --> 3571.54]  And presumably Pascal.
[3571.74 --> 3573.50]  Although I don't know if that's actually confirmed.
[3573.50 --> 3577.44]  And is definitely coming to monitors near you.
[3577.66 --> 3580.28]  Presuming that you have enough money to afford one of those monitors.
[3580.42 --> 3581.26]  Because they aren't going to be cheap.
[3581.52 --> 3581.66]  No.
[3581.70 --> 3585.42]  So, the limitation with current 3440 by 1440 monitors.
[3585.54 --> 3588.64]  The reason that they're all 60 or maximum 100 hertz.
[3588.86 --> 3591.40]  Is that that's all DisplayPort 1.2 can handle.
[3591.86 --> 3595.18]  And that's all we have on our video cards and on our displays right now.
[3595.68 --> 3596.60]  DisplayPort 1.3.
[3597.04 --> 3597.38]  Coming.
[3597.88 --> 3599.52]  Blazing fast 144 hertz.
[3599.96 --> 3601.32]  3440 by 1440.
[3601.74 --> 3602.60]  VA panels.
[3602.60 --> 3604.76]  These are going to be pretty sick.
[3604.86 --> 3606.70]  It looks like these two models.
[3606.82 --> 3608.12]  A 30 and a 35 inch.
[3608.28 --> 3611.44]  Could also feature adaptive sync like AMD FreeSync.
[3611.54 --> 3614.78]  Although it is not clear exactly which it will be if any.
[3615.10 --> 3617.10]  So, that article was from TechPowerUp.
[3617.14 --> 3620.42]  And that was posted by Asim1999 on the forum.
[3620.80 --> 3621.36]  It's funny.
[3621.80 --> 3623.80]  When I read years like 1999.
[3624.58 --> 3626.66]  I'm like, oh, that was recent.
[3626.96 --> 3630.12]  Like, they must have created their user profile in 1999.
[3630.12 --> 3634.10]  And been one of those people that wasn't sort of farsighted enough.
[3634.34 --> 3635.26]  Not farsighted.
[3635.34 --> 3642.34]  But wasn't forward thinking enough to use a username that doesn't, like, sound stupid the year after they create it.
[3642.34 --> 3646.88]  But then I realize now that 1999 is actually, like, 17 years ago.
[3646.94 --> 3648.74]  And he was probably born in 1999.
[3654.44 --> 3657.60]  And then he felt old.
[3657.60 --> 3661.08]  And maybe the whole Twitch tat did as well.
[3661.08 --> 3664.40]  All right.
[3666.20 --> 3670.92]  Every time I reference anything like that on my stream, everyone's like, oh, my God, I'm so old.
[3672.82 --> 3674.74]  iPhone 7 Plus.
[3674.84 --> 3675.88]  Even 2009.
[3676.80 --> 3677.02]  Yeah.
[3677.02 --> 3677.92]  Sounds like yesterday.
[3678.24 --> 3679.04]  Yeah, it's not.
[3679.26 --> 3682.62]  There's, like, people from 2009 that are in, like, grade two.
[3683.34 --> 3684.32]  That's so weird.
[3684.32 --> 3684.50]  Yeah.
[3685.70 --> 3686.30]  Okay.
[3686.64 --> 3694.78]  So Apple's secret iPhone 7 Plus camera project revealed in the never-ending battle.
[3695.16 --> 3698.22]  This is verbatim from the Forbes article.
[3698.70 --> 3705.74]  For smartphone camera supremacy, Apple is understandably keen to maintain its position as the world's most popular camera.
[3705.74 --> 3723.78]  Now, according to a report from Apple Insider, famously accurate KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Kuo, Kuo, Kuo, Kuo, Kuo, Kuo, has released a note to investors containing some exciting details about the next-generation Apple supersized flagship handset, the iPhone 7 Plus.
[3723.94 --> 3725.38]  Hopefully it doesn't have a camera bump.
[3726.98 --> 3733.62]  So basically, last April, Apple purchased camera technology company Lynx Computational Imaging Limited for $20 million.
[3733.62 --> 3741.78]  They acquired their technologies that enable the use of multiple cameras, which can combine outputs into a single image with claimed DSLR-like quality.
[3742.68 --> 3746.96]  Are we ever going to get sick of calling smartphone cameras DSLR-like?
[3747.72 --> 3751.70]  I mean, didn't that start with the 5S or the 5 or something?
[3751.84 --> 3752.08]  Something.
[3752.34 --> 3754.62]  It's been around for a while, and it has never been that.
[3754.62 --> 3763.68]  Like, where there's been a slide that says DSLR-like, it's like a bokeh effect is not DSLR-like, necessarily.
[3763.94 --> 3765.50]  There's a lot more to, anyway.
[3765.50 --> 3774.36]  So Apple has allegedly been working on building a dual-camera solution for three years before eventually just purchasing Lynx to overcome technical barriers.
[3774.36 --> 3788.02]  So the report claims Apple will implement a pair of 12-megapixel sensors in the iPhone 7 Plus, which doesn't surprise me that much, because, honestly, the camera sensor is not a huge part of the bomb cost of a camera.
[3788.10 --> 3794.82]  So if anyone can find a benefit to putting two sensors on the camera, then I don't see that really affecting the cost much.
[3794.88 --> 3799.48]  It's the technology behind actually utilizing them that gets a little bit tricky.
[3799.48 --> 3806.46]  So one would apparently have an image-stabilized wide-angle lens, and the other would have a 2-3x telephoto lens.
[3807.82 --> 3810.74]  So they're not the first company to implement a dual-camera system.
[3811.04 --> 3815.86]  HTC, with the ever-so-famous 1M8, had a dual-camera system that was terrible.
[3816.92 --> 3826.80]  But, given that it's Apple, maybe it won't be garbage, or maybe it will be just a lot less garbage, which is really all that it comes down to sometimes.
[3826.98 --> 3827.14]  Yeah.
[3828.08 --> 3828.86]  That's very true.
[3830.16 --> 3830.60]  Yeah.
[3832.70 --> 3836.28]  Okay, so maybe not every iPhone 7 Plus will have this.
[3836.40 --> 3840.26]  Apparently there will be two models, one standard and one with dual-camera solutions.
[3840.86 --> 3841.26]  Maybe.
[3841.26 --> 3850.76]  Although, if you're buying an iPhone 7 Plus, I know a lot of users that like it because of the great camera, so I wouldn't be surprised if the dual-camera one sold more.
[3851.04 --> 3851.28]  Yep.
[3851.28 --> 3857.60]  So, this original article here is from WCCF Tech and was posted by Aluminum Tech on the forum.
[3857.80 --> 3859.56]  And apparently, more iPhone news.
[3859.56 --> 3867.94]  Apparently, the iPhone 5 SE has entered mass production, a device to target emerging markets.
[3867.94 --> 3874.70]  So, Apple's previous strategy was to just have super-duper lingering models.
[3874.70 --> 3879.58]  Like, they were still selling the iPhone 4S, like, super not that long ago.
[3879.58 --> 3887.08]  So, but now they are kind of going, okay, yeah, we did that 5C thing.
[3887.08 --> 3893.40]  That, like, kind of sucked, but maybe we were just going about it the wrong way.
[3893.40 --> 3893.44]  Okay.
[3895.60 --> 3900.82]  So, now they are doing a dedicated cheapo device for emerging markets.
[3901.06 --> 3905.80]  And, I mean, it's Apple, so cheapo is obviously used in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek fashion.
[3906.34 --> 3909.76]  We should expect to see the iPhone 5 SE in Q2 2016.
[3909.88 --> 3918.40]  You know, it feels like what Apple was good at, simplicity, is...
[3918.40 --> 3919.88]  Is being thrown away a little bit.
[3919.88 --> 3924.94]  It seems like what's happening is they are...
[3924.94 --> 3926.06]  They have reached with the phone.
[3926.14 --> 3931.24]  Because it's no secret that phone sales are not going to be able to continue to grow at the rate that they are now.
[3931.36 --> 3931.82]  There's only so many...
[3931.82 --> 3932.52]  They run out of people.
[3932.52 --> 3932.64]  Yeah.
[3932.88 --> 3935.38]  There's only so many people on the planet that need a phone.
[3935.78 --> 3939.60]  And there's the, like, amount of people being born thing,
[3939.68 --> 3942.74]  which is one of the reasons why YouTube channels seem to just consistently get bigger,
[3942.92 --> 3945.30]  is there's more people in that demographic and whatnot and whatnot and whatnot.
[3945.50 --> 3947.42]  But you will literally hit a wall eventually.
[3947.42 --> 3947.68]  Yeah.
[3947.76 --> 3951.30]  And you can't have explosive growth, like exponential growth forever.
[3951.30 --> 3953.42]  If you grow by two every year, you eventually...
[3953.98 --> 3957.56]  That just literally can't mathematically work at some point.
[3957.60 --> 3961.42]  So it seems like Apple is in...
[3962.00 --> 3964.48]  This feels like a desperation tactic, to be perfectly honest.
[3964.56 --> 3967.08]  They are abandoning what they were always so good at.
[3967.46 --> 3967.98]  Simplicity.
[3968.56 --> 3969.52]  Buy an iPhone.
[3969.94 --> 3971.60]  This is the experience you will have.
[3971.60 --> 3976.62]  Selling the experience versus selling a SKU and saying,
[3976.76 --> 3980.50]  okay, we need a product to target every different price point.
[3981.22 --> 3985.96]  Apple was always, well, I guess, elitist enough to kind of go,
[3986.10 --> 3988.12]  nope, we're just going to build the best thing we can build.
[3988.34 --> 3989.76]  And if you can afford it, you can afford it.
[3989.78 --> 3992.20]  And if you can't, then you can have what we built last year, two years ago.
[3992.20 --> 3996.06]  So, um, and it feels like...
[3996.06 --> 3999.52]  That might be really annoying to a lot of people, but they were good at it.
[3999.72 --> 4002.66]  That's the thing is that has never worked well.
[4002.90 --> 4003.86]  I mean, look at Samsung.
[4004.50 --> 4006.04]  Yes, they sell a lot of smartphones.
[4006.64 --> 4008.46]  Yes, it's a very profitable business for them.
[4008.70 --> 4011.48]  But it also brings with it a lot of challenges.
[4011.48 --> 4013.60]  Like their smartphones are really poorly supported.
[4013.72 --> 4016.14]  Like the things that Apple has done to differentiate itself,
[4016.58 --> 4018.36]  things like supporting the devices for longer,
[4018.36 --> 4023.16]  are going to be much more difficult if they broaden the product portfolio in this manner.
[4023.84 --> 4025.84]  It's expected to come with an A8 processor.
[4026.02 --> 4029.14]  It's expected to come with NFC off-board for Apple Pay.
[4029.60 --> 4034.02]  And it's apparently been dubbed an upgraded iPhone 5S in internal Apple references.
[4034.26 --> 4036.38]  So maybe it will have Touch ID.
[4039.08 --> 4042.38]  Based on the picture, it's going to be like plastic and stuff.
[4043.04 --> 4044.06]  So there you go.
[4044.26 --> 4044.64]  Here we go.
[4044.70 --> 4045.58]  Here's a better look at it.
[4048.36 --> 4053.20]  Yeah.
[4053.36 --> 4053.56]  Yeah.
[4054.34 --> 4055.30]  They've done it before.
[4055.44 --> 4056.26]  They're doing it again.
[4056.62 --> 4057.40]  Desperation tactics.
[4057.62 --> 4059.00]  It all happened after jobs.
[4059.64 --> 4059.94]  Yep.
[4060.78 --> 4063.08]  And even the naming scheme is getting confusing.
[4063.60 --> 4063.80]  Yeah.
[4063.90 --> 4066.22]  There's a 5S, a 5C, a 5SE.
[4067.90 --> 4069.58]  What does this all actually mean?
[4070.30 --> 4070.42]  Yeah.
[4070.50 --> 4072.16]  Oh, point of clarification.
[4072.38 --> 4073.36]  This is a 4-inch model.
[4073.52 --> 4074.08]  So it's small.
[4074.08 --> 4076.12]  So it's going back to the one-handed size.
[4078.98 --> 4081.42]  Which I mean, and if they were just going, okay.
[4081.78 --> 4081.94]  Yeah.
[4082.06 --> 4082.84]  Someone in chat.
[4083.28 --> 4083.48]  Okay.
[4083.52 --> 4084.36]  A bunch of people in chat.
[4084.88 --> 4085.78]  Unapologetically plastic.
[4086.24 --> 4087.10]  Unapologetically plastic.
[4087.26 --> 4087.94]  Thank you.
[4087.94 --> 4092.36]  Thank you very much for reminding me of that most hilarious.
[4092.50 --> 4095.30]  Like I remember sitting watching that video.
[4095.44 --> 4100.72]  I actually, I remember where I was when I watched that video.
[4101.02 --> 4106.62]  And I remember sitting there and I was like, I had to rewind it.
[4107.16 --> 4109.26]  I had to rewind it and watch it again.
[4109.72 --> 4111.84]  I was like, the poor guy.
[4111.92 --> 4113.42]  He looks like he has a gun to his head.
[4113.42 --> 4113.74]  Yeah.
[4114.10 --> 4114.40]  Like.
[4115.86 --> 4116.22]  Yeah.
[4117.68 --> 4118.50]  A little brutal.
[4121.32 --> 4122.64]  Oh, this is cool.
[4122.74 --> 4123.88]  This is not news at all.
[4123.94 --> 4128.40]  Unless you're just kind of into whatever crazy crap Linus is going to be up to in the next little bit.
[4129.10 --> 4131.78]  So I just confirmed that I'm getting one of these.
[4132.80 --> 4135.48]  And the first thing Luke's, yeah, that's actually exactly.
[4135.66 --> 4136.58]  He didn't really say anything.
[4136.68 --> 4137.20]  He did that.
[4137.56 --> 4139.50]  And then the second thing Luke said was.
[4139.86 --> 4140.24]  Why?
[4140.46 --> 4140.70]  Yeah.
[4140.72 --> 4141.88]  That was the second thing he said.
[4141.88 --> 4143.76]  Not really the point.
[4143.86 --> 4144.66]  I don't even remember.
[4144.80 --> 4146.14]  I was just like, that's probably what I did.
[4150.22 --> 4157.94]  So this is far and away the BA-est rig that I will have ever had my hands on.
[4158.36 --> 4158.50]  Yep.
[4159.16 --> 4163.02]  It can hold eight dual slot GPUs.
[4163.02 --> 4167.90]  It features 1600 watt redundant 80 plus platinum power supplies.
[4168.84 --> 4172.90]  It can support up to one and a half terabytes of ECC memory.
[4172.90 --> 4180.60]  It takes two LGA 2011 socket, or 2011-3 socket CPUs.
[4181.02 --> 4189.10]  And I believe should be, and this is mostly across the board, should be compatible with the upcoming rumored 22 core Broadwell CPUs.
[4189.10 --> 4197.62]  And in addition to the 8 PCIe, I believe they are full 16x, although don't quote me on that.
[4198.58 --> 4200.52]  It doesn't actually say what they are electrically.
[4200.62 --> 4202.40]  So they're either 16x or 8x each.
[4202.50 --> 4206.48]  In addition to, no, they couldn't be 16x each.
[4206.54 --> 4207.26]  They must be 8x each.
[4207.44 --> 4214.56]  In addition to those, it actually gets another three expansion slots for like raid cards or whatever else.
[4214.56 --> 4216.78]  So, or even just like HBAs.
[4216.94 --> 4218.54]  So I actually have a 24-point HBA.
[4218.64 --> 4219.62]  This is where it gets really bananas.
[4219.98 --> 4226.06]  The front supports 24 2.5-inch drives in addition to the 8 GPUs.
[4226.06 --> 4233.22]  So I am planning to actually combine the functionality of two of our mega servers into just this one.
[4235.56 --> 4235.96]  Yep.
[4236.98 --> 4238.16]  Actually, like 2.5.
[4238.34 --> 4243.38]  2.5 of our powerful machines will all be running off of just this one in an upcoming project.
[4243.38 --> 4250.84]  Also, I have a really cool plan to do kind of like a DIY like NVIDIA grid thing.
[4251.10 --> 4257.74]  Where I'm going to use this machine to support 8 concurrent like Steam in-home streaming or NVIDIA game stream streams.
[4258.02 --> 4259.08]  All on the network.
[4259.16 --> 4261.66]  Because it also features dual 10 gigabit LAN.
[4262.16 --> 4266.62]  So it'll be able to support that throughput with like, like without even breaking a sweat.
[4267.56 --> 4270.48]  Yeah, well Steam is rolling out 100 gigabit LAN.
[4270.48 --> 4274.36]  Don't make me come over there.
[4276.44 --> 4278.32]  That would actually be kind of neat.
[4278.46 --> 4281.52]  Just as like a, whoa, this is bananas video.
[4282.10 --> 4283.64]  Like set up a couple of RAM drives.
[4283.96 --> 4288.08]  And like just a point to point if we could get our hands on some 40 gigabit or 100 gigabit cards.
[4288.52 --> 4290.34]  And just be like, wow.
[4290.34 --> 4297.62]  Wow, this network card is as fast as your internal drive will be for the next 10 years.
[4299.62 --> 4300.26]  Yeah.
[4304.58 --> 4305.26]  Okay.
[4307.20 --> 4308.48]  Oh, this is an update.
[4308.74 --> 4312.16]  This was posted by C-Girl on the forum this week.
[4312.16 --> 4318.72]  Microsoft refunded the $8,000 worth of credit card charges for that dad.
[4318.88 --> 4319.30]  Oh.
[4319.48 --> 4320.18]  From FIFA.
[4320.76 --> 4324.10]  So they did say this is a once in a lifetime exception.
[4325.00 --> 4326.52]  Don't do it again.
[4327.80 --> 4328.06]  And.
[4328.76 --> 4330.28]  How much trouble is that kid in?
[4330.92 --> 4331.40]  Wow.
[4331.50 --> 4332.06]  A lot.
[4332.06 --> 4336.80]  And like how screwed is he going to be when he's like further in life?
[4337.24 --> 4338.88]  He's like, yeah, my dad's not going to notice.
[4339.08 --> 4340.36]  Like I'm not, it's fine.
[4340.88 --> 4341.62]  I don't know.
[4341.70 --> 4342.86]  Maybe he learned his lesson.
[4343.10 --> 4343.46]  Did he?
[4343.60 --> 4344.78]  People can learn things.
[4345.10 --> 4345.78]  Like, okay, here.
[4345.84 --> 4349.74]  I'm going to tell a super embarrassing story about when, when I was younger.
[4350.00 --> 4355.90]  So when I was in, when I was in high school, a guy came up to me on the street and asked
[4355.90 --> 4356.96]  me to cash a check for him.
[4356.96 --> 4361.48]  And he was like something, something, whatever the story was, you know where this is going.
[4361.64 --> 4364.24]  So whatever the story was, he, he couldn't do it.
[4364.30 --> 4365.14]  His bank was closed.
[4365.26 --> 4366.56]  Something, something, something here.
[4366.66 --> 4367.74]  I'll endorse the check.
[4367.80 --> 4368.84]  I'll let you cash it.
[4368.88 --> 4370.06]  And if you can give me the cash anyway.
[4370.36 --> 4375.22]  So long story short, being the naive, trusting individual that I am, I cashed it for him.
[4375.48 --> 4381.50]  And ultimately I was out like $200 or something like that, which for me at the time was a lot
[4381.50 --> 4384.40]  of money, like a lot of money today.
[4385.04 --> 4386.78]  $200 is a lot of money.
[4386.96 --> 4389.66]  But especially when I was like, $200 is just a lot of money.
[4389.76 --> 4393.76]  When I was like 16 or whatever, that was a lot of money for me.
[4393.88 --> 4396.36]  That's an excessively considerable amount of money when you're 16.
[4396.44 --> 4396.64]  Yeah.
[4396.86 --> 4398.16]  So at least it was for me.
[4398.48 --> 4402.56]  Basically my point here is I learned something.
[4403.12 --> 4408.60]  It was an expensive lesson, but I learned something very valuable about how the world works.
[4408.60 --> 4408.84]  Yeah.
[4409.04 --> 4413.78]  And sometimes you can have those experiences and they can turn you into a better person.
[4413.78 --> 4414.18]  Yeah.
[4414.18 --> 4414.58]  Yeah.
[4414.58 --> 4415.06]  Yeah.
[4415.06 --> 4420.38]  But that was someone tricking you and you unfortunately falling for it.
[4420.46 --> 4420.74]  Yes.
[4421.14 --> 4424.96]  This was him being like, well, I'll buy a whole bunch of things in FIFA.
[4425.26 --> 4427.06]  Well, dad won't figure it out.
[4427.06 --> 4428.54]  I think they're different.
[4429.86 --> 4430.30]  Maybe.
[4431.36 --> 4431.76]  Yes.
[4431.90 --> 4432.52]  They are different.
[4433.28 --> 4433.48]  But.
[4433.74 --> 4435.52]  You were unfortunately tricked.
[4435.94 --> 4436.52]  I was.
[4436.64 --> 4439.76]  He repeatedly and excessively purchased something.
[4440.32 --> 4440.70]  Right.
[4440.70 --> 4447.06]  You didn't go to the store and click buy like, I don't know how many times until you get to
[4447.06 --> 4447.36]  $8,000.
[4447.36 --> 4449.98]  I actually saw him on the street like a year later.
[4450.70 --> 4452.06]  I was driving by in my car.
[4452.40 --> 4455.90]  I actually had my girlfriend at the time who was with me when the whole thing happened.
[4456.36 --> 4458.32]  And I kind of went, yeah, no, just kidding.
[4460.84 --> 4461.82]  Oh, wow.
[4463.28 --> 4463.64]  Rough.
[4463.64 --> 4464.92]  Yeah.
[4465.88 --> 4469.62]  You know, the funny thing is, is we even had the foresight to like take a picture of
[4469.62 --> 4469.74]  him.
[4470.36 --> 4473.78]  We were like, yeah, we're taking a picture of you because like, you know, and he's like,
[4473.82 --> 4475.10]  oh, yeah, yeah, that's cool.
[4475.20 --> 4475.92]  You know, yeah, that's cool.
[4475.96 --> 4479.78]  Like, like he hesitated a little bit, but like he was like, I don't really seem to have a
[4479.78 --> 4480.58]  choice at this point.
[4480.90 --> 4482.90]  So we gave the picture to the cops and everything.
[4482.98 --> 4485.06]  I don't think anything ever came of it because they didn't care.
[4485.24 --> 4486.32]  But there you go.
[4486.84 --> 4489.46]  Because to them, $200 is not that much.
[4489.50 --> 4489.60]  Nope.
[4489.60 --> 4491.78]  Because they've got other massive cases going on.
[4491.78 --> 4494.24]  They've got other fish to fillet.
[4494.64 --> 4494.92]  Yeah.
[4495.62 --> 4495.96]  All right.
[4495.98 --> 4500.66]  Well, I think speaking of filleting, that's pretty much it for the fillet show today.
[4501.22 --> 4502.52]  The fillet show.
[4502.60 --> 4504.02]  The fillet show today.
[4504.88 --> 4506.62]  The fillet-io today.
[4507.00 --> 4508.96]  I wasn't sure.
[4509.18 --> 4509.40]  Yeah.
[4511.68 --> 4513.36]  And we'll see you again next week.
[4513.50 --> 4515.56]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4516.74 --> 4519.86]  Are you basically just saying that this show is a problem?
[4519.86 --> 4522.96]  I don't know.
[4523.04 --> 4524.08]  Is that why it's so good?
[4525.38 --> 4527.32]  That's why it's so good at the very end.
[4527.44 --> 4529.64]  But it's like so intense you can't get any more news.
[4529.72 --> 4530.32]  You're going to be over.
[4530.32 --> 4530.82]  No.
[4530.82 --> 4531.32]  No.
[4531.32 --> 4531.82]  Okay.
[4531.82 --> 4532.32]  Oh, no.
[4532.32 --> 4541.46]  Thanks again.
[4541.46 --> 4544.76]  You should learn things like that.
[4544.76 --> 4545.36]  Bye.
[4545.42 --> 4545.64]  Bye.
[4545.68 --> 4546.00]  Bye.
[4546.00 --> 4546.30]  Bye.
[4546.30 --> 4547.08]  Bye.
[4547.70 --> 4548.26]  Bye.
[4548.56 --> 4550.50]  Bye.
