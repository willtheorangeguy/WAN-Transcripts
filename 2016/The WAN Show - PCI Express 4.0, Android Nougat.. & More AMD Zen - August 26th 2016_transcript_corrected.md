[0.00 → 9.88] okay so uh we'll start the show with the traditional apology I'm sorry for being late
[9.88 → 19.52] yep however whoa we're really late yeah okay it's actually my fault this time I think it's
[19.52 → 23.82] mostly your fault I could have been more prepared but I've been working on a video that I'm like
[23.82 → 29.60] really, really excited about and i kind of got carried away doing a last minute processor swap
[29.60 → 35.98] so that I could like to see more numbers when I'm done the wan show and be all excited about how wrong
[35.98 → 41.36] that I was for my side of things people might be slightly excited people often complain about
[41.36 → 48.70] multipart content and wanting really long videos you're getting one it took them like half an hour
[48.70 → 55.28] to film one video I think it was more than one it was it really I started filming at about
[55.28 → 63.08] okay so I think it was half an hour for one video 15 minutes yeah so but that half an hour video
[63.08 → 70.96] wasn't like six takes of a five-minute video no that was like probably about a 17 minute 18-minute video
[70.96 → 78.94] so all like deep dive technical yep basically if you're upset that we haven't really talked much
[78.94 → 84.06] about Vulcan and direct x12 Luke took it upon himself to make up for lost time
[84.06 → 92.06] by spending a lot of time working on one ginormous thing that will hopefully cover us for like
[92.06 → 103.04] at least a while yes oh Geez um so the one that I'm working on is actually um about the most wrong
[103.04 → 113.58] that I have been about how to configure a computer in probably a decade like we're talking I spent you
[113.58 → 121.42] know three times as much on a component that performs 60 as well as something else that I could have bought
[121.42 → 130.18] wow like i I'm done goofed I'm done goofed and you guys are gonna you guys are going to find this
[130.18 → 134.96] super hilarious I'm sure people love that stuff yeah yeah you guys are going to find this like super
[134.96 → 143.20] hilarious for sure because the machine or machines in question were actually the subject of multipart
[143.20 → 150.62] videos previously on the channel and are a key component of our editing workflow here at Linus
[150.62 → 155.20] media group are you going to have a multipart video explaining why your previous multipart video was bad
[155.20 → 161.84] no I think I'm just gonna I think I'm just gonna no says yes no Taryn's wrong I think it's just
[161.84 → 170.36] going to be the one video and I'm gonna I'm going to quantify everything that's wrong um count in chat go
[170.36 → 179.48] whatever doritos is Illuminati I don't even I don't I think that there's a cultural gap
[179.48 → 189.60] between me and twitch chat okay not to like anyway uh my twitch chat after the wan show
[189.60 → 195.80] yeah is drastically different from the wan show twitch chat so it has far less cancer or more cancer
[195.80 → 200.90] far less it's like slow it's a slow check is like a fraction of the people are there
[200.90 → 206.54] but then like they're like talking about computer topics and like everyone's on point like when i
[206.54 → 209.90] screw up in the game there will be some guys like haha and then other people will be like you got
[209.90 → 216.02] it next times and like it's completely like everyone's really nice like you know you're jinxing it right
[216.02 → 220.28] now though right probably like you, you know what's going to happen in your afterpart are you
[220.28 → 225.68] doing an after party stream tonight yeah, but they'll forget by then, so the internet never forgets
[225.68 → 232.42] it's like an elephant okay it's a series of elephant tubes it depends the internet both forgets extremely
[232.42 → 237.48] quickly and never forgets because like oh yeah guys this game sucked let's never pre-order another
[237.48 → 246.46] game whoa this new game looks really cool is that a new call of duty yeah is it with old guns this time
[246.46 → 250.72] hey no one's told us anything really about no man's sky lets all pre-order
[250.72 → 263.10] um all right so we got a lot of great topics for you guys today I feel like I feel like okay, okay I feel
[263.10 → 274.06] like two things one I feel like the wan show is going to have as its first primary topic from now until early
[274.06 → 283.00] 2017 when it launches some kind of news about AMD zen and number two is I'm feeling the battered wife
[283.00 → 288.44] syndrome a little bit right now because this is how AMD behaved every other time they launched something
[288.44 → 299.50] that was unexceptional the hype train for zen is so strong between the leaks and the leaks like the actual
[299.50 → 307.08] leaks and the ones where AMD is just like you want to see you want to see one benchmark can I just see
[307.08 → 311.54] one benchmark you know between we almost just got banned off twitch I didn't show I didn't
[311.54 → 315.58] show the nip I didn't show the nip i just I was teasing the nip I wasn't showing the nip he
[315.58 → 319.66] actually even like covered it so that he couldn't screw up and I could not get kicked off of twitch
[319.66 → 325.66] for that unless twitch altered their rules to be like don't be weird on twitch, but they would ban
[325.66 → 330.96] everyone everybody gone everyone's gone everyone in the chat you're gone the entire creative section
[330.96 → 340.26] just like implodes immediately half the staff gone yeah yeah um so we've got some more news about zen
[340.26 → 348.96] uh we've also got what's inside Microsoft's HoloLens and how it works no this is not a video where
[348.96 → 355.86] uh you know my buddy cuts open the HoloLens I actually met the what's inside yeah I tell you
[355.86 → 359.32] that I was just going to say you I think buddy is a strong word but I met him once yeah i
[359.32 → 364.32] haven't met his son though you can now say that you are deep friends deep friend yes I can now say
[364.32 → 371.20] that I know an internet celebrity yeah what else we got for time I do too I've met day nine before
[371.20 → 379.64] dagger right through my heart that was actually a really cool moment anyway uh we also
[379.64 → 387.62] have PCI Express 4.0 uh which brings 16 or well okay the main part that I like is 300 watts at the
[387.62 → 393.76] slot or not like the main interesting part I don't know that I like that I'm doing my door I'm doing my
[393.76 → 401.14] PCI Express 4.0 excitement you like the 300 watts thing okay he just wants to dance I think at this
[401.14 → 402.26] point also
[402.26 → 418.16] which is actually really cool I don't know if that's like super directly related to what we normally talk
[418.16 → 419.02] about intro
[423.76 → 428.30] apparently the 300 watts
[428.30 → 445.98] I think
[445.98 → 453.14] cool and master for full info but what is this what does this even mean
[453.14 → 458.88] I guess you'll have to stay tuned to find out if you want to know about the company like who the
[458.88 → 464.48] CEO is what they're like the mission statement is and stuff go to coolermaster.com and click the
[464.48 → 468.42] hopefully exists about us button if they were smarter they would have just named the company
[468.42 → 472.64] after the CEO, and then you wouldn't even have to go to the website to know the CEO's name
[472.64 → 479.46] you would just have to know what the website is or the YouTube channel or the twitter handle
[479.46 → 484.10] but your last name or the Facebook page so what if it's Torvalds or what if it's media
[484.10 → 489.26] your last you should legally change your last name to Linus media
[489.26 → 492.36] change your middle name to tech
[492.36 → 496.28] Linus tech media group
[496.28 → 497.84] Sebastian
[497.84 → 499.02] ho
[499.02 → 501.84] there you go add them all in there
[501.84 → 508.80] all right um what are we talking about I don't even I don't even know I feel like this week
[509.36 → 517.92] has just been crazy like I filmed six videos this week um we're trying to we're trying to build up a
[517.92 → 524.56] buffer for when as some of you know I'm having another small human join my family very shortly
[524.56 → 529.52] you're insane you didn't know that oh I knew that oh I was just insane I was like how did you not know
[529.52 → 535.92] that you know that's why we're busting our butts right now right so I'll be taking hopefully a few
[535.92 → 542.64] weeks off when that happens uh close to the end of September um and the idea is that by that time
[542.64 → 548.72] Luke and I will have built up enough of a content buffer that they can get by without me just fine
[548.72 → 554.48] without missing any of our daily uploads and without Luke uh being at the office literally 16 hours a day
[554.48 → 558.64] like I'm pretty sure was the case last time I tried to go anywhere or do anything yeah
[560.32 → 562.80] pulled double shifts I mean I was two people that was
[566.88 → 572.00] I mean okay that was also a particularly horrible situation because that was right
[572.00 → 577.60] so aside from trying to create a buffer for me to be gone we were creating the buffer to launch vessel
[578.24 → 582.88] and during that while you were gone we launched vessel and I had to do like
[582.88 → 589.04] oh yeah tons of stuff for that yeah let's just say not everyone was happy about the vessel launch
[590.00 → 595.20] and someone had to do damage control and my internet we could go back and find the tweets
[595.20 → 601.76] of my internet it wasn't just me to be clear just like nick light was huge during that if anyone was on
[601.76 → 606.64] the forums really you're going to go after his weight when you're trying to be nice to him
[608.24 → 615.28] if anything he weighed less then he was wow he was servicing questions he's watching the show
[616.72 → 625.28] oh god he's been taking shots at me for being old okay, okay which is something I have less control over
[625.28 → 631.04] you know you didn't even call out that it was like your birthday really oh no not really yeah
[631.04 → 635.76] you had the cake there, but you didn't talk about it oh yeah I had cake I forgot to eat it, and it was
[635.76 → 639.92] like out in the hot warehouse the whole time we were on one show I was just like nope this is awful
[641.04 → 647.60] well it had that stuff yeah probably awful anyway fondant yeah fondant should be banned
[647.60 → 655.68] it shouldn't be called food yeah because it's awful I mean with that said plasticine material two of
[655.68 → 662.08] the most memorable cakes I've ever had were made out of fondant there was the Noctua fan from the uh
[662.08 → 670.16] from the forum guys and then there was the TV cake fan is that the one TV cake yeah it had a TV on top i
[670.16 → 675.04] don't know if you look that closely it was from LG you know those guys they're just like they're crazy if
[675.04 → 683.68] they can make a Linus from something they seem to just do it yeah socks like a box of cake i
[683.68 → 690.00] actually still have all those socks i I part of me wants to wear well they're it's funny because
[690.00 → 696.56] they're like thin they're like dress socks, but they're hideous oh so I'm kind of sitting here going
[696.56 → 708.56] what are you where did they find you what are you for yeah what do you do I pass butter oh
[709.28 → 714.96] you pass butter that's a don't it the conversation actually goes the other way it's like what do I do
[714.96 → 720.80] it says you pass butter yeah oh god it's from rick and Morty okay don't worry about it okay
[720.80 → 729.44] cool all right, so our original article here is from extreme it's like tech but extreme
[729.44 → 735.20] we should change it to like Linus extreme tech tips Linus tech tips extreme tech tip media extreme
[735.20 → 738.88] Linus Sebastian it's more Linus than you can handle
[738.88 → 750.08] um all right so basically in a nutshell uh AMD unveiled some information at hot chips
[751.44 → 759.68] um about the upcoming zen CPU core and architecture uh zen's design goals are to intelligently share
[759.68 → 765.92] resources between CPU cores while simultaneously hitting higher frequencies and higher execution
[765.92 → 772.08] efficiencies than AMD's previous CPU core k10 which is good because if they had been hoping to hit
[772.08 → 779.04] lower frequencies while not sharing resources between cores and being less efficient then that
[779.04 → 783.12] would be a terrible goal I'm glad AMD is clarifying these things a lot of this stuff is that way I mean
[783.12 → 789.92] I was wondering I have to confess I was wondering like when we went from uh what was that flagship six
[789.92 → 795.52] core that they actually they uh they replaced with the FX whatever you can stand can't remember what
[795.52 → 800.56] you don't have to not be in the camera it's fine shoot what was it when they introduced a new
[800.56 → 805.44] architecture that was actually clocked for clock worse than the previous one I can't remember
[805.44 → 815.20] any more it was the 10 10 90. I try to not remember oh yeah 10 90t had better IPC than the FX 8 core that
[815.20 → 822.08] followed it and I was just kind of like how did you pull that off um there 's's others like
[822.08 → 826.72] relatively like okay I hope that would happen considering you haven't released a processor in
[826.72 → 834.16] this long like faster l2 cache faster l3 cache larger everything yeah two threads per core which
[834.16 → 842.24] we already knew yeah so it'll have not hyper threading yeah it'll SMT yes um what else we got branch
[842.24 → 847.92] mis predict has been simultaneous multi-threading just in case you didn't uh larger retire eight ops like the
[847.92 → 854.96] brand ambiguous term quad issue full point unit better cache system lower power aggressive clock
[854.96 → 864.96] gating with multi-level regions um a lot of this is like stuff that too vague is my criticism because
[864.96 → 868.88] like obviously these things are going to be better I would really hope they would be considering you're
[868.88 → 873.12] saying that they're going to compete with modern intel processors so they would need to be better than what
[873.12 → 880.08] you had before, so there are a bunch of like slides and stuff if you want to see them so why don't you
[880.08 → 891.52] slide sorry oh slide sorry I'll stop singing that now um so there you go uh zen will be perfect
[892.08 → 897.12] we promise this time yay all right next up this was originally posted on the forum by
[897.12 → 904.80] op it's me is that their name or is Colton trying to say he would be original poster yeah okay it's
[904.80 → 910.40] probably the person who posted is the name all right, so the original article here is from Tom's
[910.40 → 920.08] hardware uh, uh mic cracking popping stuff um fix the mic audio is cracking there's like enough people
[920.08 → 928.40] spamming it that it might actually be true or maybe not um are we just leaning too close to it maybe
[929.20 → 929.60] okay
[932.00 → 940.48] because I can like sort of hear it somewhat in my ears okay um is it still popping if I'm back here nope
[940.48 → 945.44] I don't think so is it popping if I'm here not right now no okay
[949.44 → 950.16] Reiko
[952.72 → 957.36] I mean I didn't change anything but that doesn't mean it's completely impossible that someone came
[957.36 → 962.80] onto the set and moved dials around just because they hate me personally I mean there's enough people
[962.80 → 969.60] working here now that it is possible but even if only half of them hated me there's enough people that
[969.60 → 974.88] you know someone might that's I don't think any I don't think anyone who works here hates me Brandon
[975.68 → 982.16] you know yeah I'm not convinced Brandon can hate yeah goodbye unless it's like a really shitty SD card
[985.52 → 992.80] yeah Brandon is not a huge fan of uh bad SD cards yeah all right let's talk what's inside oops
[993.60 → 998.72] oh I don't know what I had on my screen that whole time well hopefully nothing incriminating
[998.72 → 1002.56] what's inside Microsoft's HoloLens and how it works
[1004.80 → 1011.28] kind of, so there's an OLED screen which is not astounding uh the components of the
[1012.24 → 1016.64] optical I've done way too many videos in the last little bit the components of the optical
[1016.64 → 1024.24] system break down into micro display imaging optics waveguide combiner cool and gratings that perform
[1024.24 → 1032.32] uh exit people expansion they're the like the compute inside of it contains a custom main
[1032.32 → 1040.00] board so we're not really going to know what is up with that 64 gigs of eMMC uh 2 gigs of LP ddr3 ram
[1040.00 → 1048.96] it's based on x86 and runs so surprisingly Windows 10 um it has a cherry trail SOC Wi-Fi Bluetooth
[1048.96 → 1055.84] connectivity and four microphones I'm not entirely sure why there's four microphones so with a VR head
[1055.84 → 1061.76] mounted display you've effectively got two tiny monitors that are millimetres from your face
[1062.72 → 1070.96] by contrast the HoloLens spits out a projected image which is then combined diffracted and layered
[1070.96 → 1078.08] to produce images that you can see within a space yeah you have to do that type of projection stuff at least
[1078.08 → 1085.84] right now in order to um create the hologram like effect so right now the hologram like effect can
[1085.84 → 1092.16] be created several meters away which is probably why they do all of these demos like in a house
[1092.16 → 1096.16] yeah you're not going to be you're not going to be projecting holograms you're not going to see
[1096.16 → 1102.64] Charizard on a mountain yeah, yeah sorry what on a mountain charizard okay it's like the
[1102.64 → 1107.68] Pokémon Go trailers I thought you said Joan of Arc and I was like I don't know what well so I had my
[1107.68 → 1113.04] headphones in because I was okay yeah I'm not going to see Joan of Arc on a mountain it's like it's
[1113.04 → 1120.40] like usually when I have a wet dream that's not how it goes I don't think Joan of Arc was a sex symbol
[1121.04 → 1128.56] no, no no I mean it's possible you know clone high okay yeah like if you're really into tunes or whatever
[1128.56 → 1132.88] yeah um sorry what are we talking about apparently okay sensors so
[1132.88 → 1138.72] there 's's a sensor bar you guys wait okay can we straw poll for a quick second do they know
[1138.72 → 1146.08] what clone high is i I don't know I'd sure I'll drop a straw poll actually you can do them now because
[1146.08 → 1153.84] we can screen share you, but it's okay I'm already doing it okay clone hi yes no turn it
[1153.84 → 1163.44] okay here we go let's see what we got i just because like i really I wonder now okay guys hit
[1163.44 → 1168.64] that straw poll hit that straw poll I've been wondering lately like how out of date some of
[1168.64 → 1175.20] our references may be i know i i I am out of date any reference to me feels inherently the
[1175.20 → 1180.72] majority says no wow there are more Trump voters in our audience today than you said trump
[1181.36 → 1188.56] I said include turn up no that definitely peaked a little by the way yeah okay so we have more trump
[1188.56 → 1192.08] voters and I thought we didn't have any Trump voters left I thought they all hated me
[1193.36 → 1201.76] either for being Canadian or for building a computer trump themed pc I am sort of surprised that didn't like
[1202.64 → 1209.44] get trending somewhere for political reason I am I'm a little surprised myself that video just
[1210.00 → 1214.40] largely seem to have been disliked by everyone trump supporters and non-trump supporters alike
[1215.52 → 1224.08] just like go back to Canadian politics talk about Justin Trudeau like okay he boxes and not that many
[1224.08 → 1232.80] things interesting happen in Canada well there was elbow gate which is your know I love it god I think i
[1232.80 → 1233.68] think I just got triggered
[1237.68 → 1244.08] all right back to HoloLens, so there's a sensor bar on the HoloLens that's comprised of four
[1244.08 → 1251.60] environment understanding cameras two on each side, so there's a depth camera an ambient light sensor
[1252.32 → 1258.32] and a two megapixel photo slash HD video camera some of these are off the shelf parts while Microsoft
[1258.32 → 1263.44] built the others so when you first said environment understanding cameras like I get it but I wasn't
[1263.44 → 1268.16] shifted back into talking about the HoloLens yet so I thought it was like they're not environmentally
[1268.16 → 1273.04] friendly, but they get that they're not environmentally friendly, and it's okay are you getting triggered
[1273.04 → 1283.04] some more like is this just no oh dear no, no that's fine um, so the environment sensing cameras provide
[1283.04 → 1288.56] the basis for head tracking because if you're going to project images out there they have to rotate and
[1288.56 → 1294.08] they have to change in size uh according to how you move your head around so that's why you need these
[1294.08 → 1299.20] cameras uh there's a time of flight, so the time of flight depth cameras serve two roles they help with
[1299.20 → 1305.44] hand tracking, and they perform surface reconstruction these sensors work with the optics module and the
[1305.44 → 1314.96] IMU so that's pretty cool I guess um the word on the street as because all of this is just like for
[1314.96 → 1320.24] us because we don't have a unit uh for us this is just kind of like cool that sounds like a lot of
[1320.24 → 1327.04] cool technology um, but the word on the street is Luke might get a chance to try it maybe which I'm
[1327.04 → 1333.84] really interested in because it's another computer on your head thing right which is, but it's like
[1334.40 → 1340.64] an excessively expensive one right maybe they'll do it right, and it's also not trying because well
[1340.64 → 1345.52] the head mounted computer it's not trying to do full VR yeah and the head mounted computer too
[1346.32 → 1353.28] is not about it not being expensive you could build the most expensive head mounted computer and it
[1353.28 → 1360.16] wouldn't overcome any of the problems you or I have with it yeah the weight the heat the size it
[1360.16 → 1365.84] it might help those things but not overcome them yeah wouldn't overcome them for sure whereas this
[1365.84 → 1373.04] isn't trying to be that the projections that it puts in front of you don't need to be rendered on dual
[1373.04 → 1378.56] GTX titan XPS in order for them to look good, and you don't have to render an entire field of vision
[1378.56 → 1383.60] scene yes you just have to render parts of it and stuff like it should this does make more sense
[1385.20 → 1390.56] but it also since the very beginning I don't know about you but to me has felt like this weird snake
[1390.56 → 1397.12] oil combination where it has like existed and not really existed and like they did this one like
[1397.12 → 1401.76] they showed it off, and then they didn't really talk about it for a long time, and then they don't
[1401.76 → 1407.28] talk about it for a long time it's just like what is this thing yeah I guess it feels kind of like
[1407.28 → 1412.88] um it feels kind of like you know one of those games that's in development forever where they
[1412.88 → 1419.12] kind of like they show off like a working demo at some point really early on yeah, and then it's like
[1419.12 → 1424.00] where did it go and then a year later it's a completely different game because yeah it's not
[1424.00 → 1428.56] a RTS any more it's like a's a first-person shooter now do you remember the presence demo I don't
[1428.56 → 1432.88] know if I showed it to you no the HoloLens presence demo they did this thing where they
[1432.88 → 1438.88] were in two very different rooms, but they put furniture and stuff in the same locations yeah i
[1438.88 → 1443.04] did see I did see the presence yeah I thought you were talking about a game demo no, no no I thought
[1443.04 → 1448.00] you meant oh that makes sense yeah did you see the presence demo yeah I know I got you no um but
[1448.00 → 1453.28] basically what they did star craft ghost they made it so that because the furniture was in the same
[1453.28 → 1457.60] positions and a lot of it was like dense furniture so it wouldn't squish when people sat in it um but
[1457.60 → 1461.76] people could sit around in this room and as long as they didn't sit on each other because that would
[1461.76 → 1467.68] be possible um or even if they did, i mean hey, but the future is uh future is exciting the future is
[1467.68 → 1474.48] accepting um so like you could sit in a room and have like what they were displaying was like a family
[1474.48 → 1481.92] gathering like with your with people all over the world and like that's super holy crap really cool but
[1481.92 → 1488.08] what they showed it was often like this incredibly expensive cameras all over the place custom room
[1488.08 → 1493.20] yes, and you had to have the exact same version of it in multiple places around the world and like this
[1493.20 → 1498.40] insanely expensive headset and all this kind of stuff, and it was like one little demo that like some
[1498.40 → 1505.84] engineers did in a back room, and then it's just gone I'm just like what's so cool where did
[1505.84 → 1512.80] it goes I don't oh I don't know so i would love to see your thoughts or see hear your thoughts
[1512.80 → 1517.68] on it um I could yeah it could be both we do make videos that is sort of a thing that we do yeah i really
[1517.68 → 1524.64] hope we get to check it out because I'm rather excited all right speaking of things that I am excited
[1524.64 → 1534.16] about the op is its me I'll show you the link and the original article is from Tom's hardware
[1536.48 → 1546.00] PCI Express 4.0 because I was really feeling like PCI Express 3.0 were you was just not web 2.0 enough
[1546.00 → 1554.00] were you from a consumer standpoint actually no yeah no I'm not feeling like that at all I feel like
[1554.00 → 1561.84] if anything this is going to be completely meaningless for the general consumer um
[1561.84 → 1570.88] um we're already at the point where unless you're running more than two graphics cards in SLI or
[1570.88 → 1578.24] crossfire there is almost nothing you could put in your computer that would give you any reason to
[1578.24 → 1584.40] need more than the PCI Express bandwidth that's already available on intel's mainstream platform
[1585.04 → 1594.64] let alone on the enthusiast LGA 2011 3 x99 platform so that's 20 PCIE slots of which four are handled
[1594.64 → 1600.72] through uh DMI I think it's called whatever the replacement for the self bridge is that
[1600.72 → 1613.52] uh that system whatever anyway um words fail me doesn't happen often um but for like enterprise
[1613.52 → 1619.60] customers where basically they they they can't have enough high speed connectivity to the CPU
[1620.32 → 1630.88] this I guess will be very cool uh I guess it'll also enable faster SSDs um so NVMe PCI Express SSDs
[1630.88 → 1638.16] because even with maybe it doesn't matter that you can have a PCIE gen 4 16x slot
[1638.16 → 1646.00] maybe it's more important that your 2x slot on your laptop can do like double the bandwidth to an
[1646.00 → 1652.00] name SSD that it used to be able to do maybe we'll see an impact there although quite frankly it's been
[1652.00 → 1657.76] a long time since I've really felt like a faster SSD makes a huge difference to the day-to-day use of my
[1657.76 → 1664.64] computer I think you were running an Oct octane until like six months ago yep which was like a SATA 2 SSD
[1664.64 → 1670.40] and now I literally don't even know the name of my SSD, and it's fine um like I was talking to uh
[1670.40 → 1677.28] Anthony from NCI the other day he's trying to upgrade his x79 system to x99 um because he wants
[1677.28 → 1678.72] to run NVMe and I was just like
[1682.48 → 1687.68] yeah I'm sure like it is faster yeah and if you put them beside each other you can tell you can tell
[1687.68 → 1696.88] but it's not like it's not like the moment that I had you know like like like moment that i
[1696.88 → 1702.08] had when I first installed a dual-core processor in my machine or the first time you ever installed an
[1702.08 → 1708.96] SSD or the first time I installed a SSD those were like wow this is a new generation of computing
[1708.96 → 1717.44] yeah um then when I put that Athlon 64 x2 4400 plus still the most expensive single component i
[1717.44 → 1725.52] have spent my own money on I paid like 800 plus dollars for a CPU, but it was relatively speaking
[1725.52 → 1730.48] worth it sort of um because it was very different from any other experience you have I just don't
[1730.48 → 1737.20] feel that way about NVMe SSDs yeah um anyway I guess we could tell you there is like the like
[1738.00 → 1745.44] glass kind of wow this is beautiful combination of getting a ridiculously good monitor that's like
[1745.44 → 1750.64] the say the 165 hertz Asus yep remember the first time you tried that, and you're like whoa yeah you
[1750.64 → 1757.36] combine that and like a NVMe drive and like that kind of tier high-end system you can feel it, and it's
[1757.36 → 1763.20] nice yeah because everything is just, but it's not the same yeah it's not quite like that, and you know
[1763.20 → 1768.96] what actually I would say that a high refresh rate ultra-wide monitor was probably a similar
[1768.96 → 1776.56] experience for me, I know you don't necessarily buy into the ultra-wide like I do but for productivity
[1777.04 → 1781.60] right I really like my ultra-wide for work here right I don't know if I'd want one at home if I did
[1781.60 → 1787.36] want one at home it would go over and tilt down above other monitors right and I would put like chats
[1787.36 → 1792.08] up there and web browser stuff because I like doing productivity stuff on them not a huge fan of gaming
[1792.08 → 1796.64] on ultra wides watching YouTube videos on ultra wides is sweet there's a new one coming would be
[1796.64 → 1805.68] sweet um LG has a 38-inch ultra-wide coming that is a 1600 vertical by whatever that works out to
[1805.68 → 1812.16] horizontally I'm actually going to be doing a review of it soon it looks pretty beastly I don't know if
[1812.16 → 1817.44] it's going to make I don't know what 38 inches is going to kind of feel like right in front of my face
[1817.44 → 1823.20] kind of you know that's a lot of inches in my face yeah um, but we'll see maybe I can handle it
[1824.08 → 1830.32] so we haven't actually said anything about pc express 4.0 so it's 16 gig transfers per second
[1831.04 → 1838.72] the through the slot power is still 75 watts same as always the final specification should come by the
[1838.72 → 1846.32] end of 2016. They are days away from releasing version 0.7 of the specification to the 730 paying
[1846.32 → 1853.04] members that provide input and a board of directors to help the process, and it will double the bandwidth
[1853.04 → 1860.80] per lane compared to what we've seen before so here's a screenshot showing once it loads um
[1861.84 → 1868.88] the bandwidth of the previous PCI Express generations I think poor oh yeah there it goes poor server
[1868.88 → 1875.60] it's just struggling a little bit there so there you go it didn't quite double from
[1877.12 → 1882.32] so gen 1 to 2 doubled gen 2 to gen 3 didn't quite double, but we are actually getting it looks like
[1882.32 → 1889.36] straight up doubling again this time so what that means is you could do 31.5 gigabytes per second
[1889.36 → 1895.84] through a PCI e16x slot uh which is great maybe we'll maybe we can do away with the external SLI
[1895.84 → 1901.04] bridge now maybe and did you cool maybe we could I mean they could even they could even they could
[1901.04 → 1907.44] even do something at that point where if you had two maybe if you had two 16x slots they could allow
[1907.44 → 1912.64] it or something the GPUs could use the first eight lanes and the and the SLI communication could be on
[1912.64 → 1917.52] the other eight lanes like I don't know maybe I'm just totally being ignorant here some of the reason
[1917.52 → 1924.56] why they don't like it is interference and crosstalk if colton did this screenshot then he gets to
[1924.56 → 1930.96] be yelled at because he left his cursor on one of the data points for the new spec that's okay we
[1930.96 → 1939.04] love you 16. Um so there you have it though with a single 1x or 2x slot you could do two gigabytes or
[1939.04 → 1946.24] four gigabytes per second of bandwidth to something like a name SSD which is I guess good you
[1946.24 → 1955.76] know um here we go so they've also got some suggestions as to sort of why they think this
[1955.76 → 1960.96] matters so use cases chip to chip connection you can reduce power in real estate with extendable
[1960.96 → 1966.88] design features and power management capabilities m.2 scalable performance for power constrained
[1966.88 → 1974.88] mobile platforms u.2, so this would be the um that's that like server connector where you can connect SSD
[1974.88 → 1980.16] storage in like uh more like a rack mount case um and then use cables to get a get off the motherboard
[1980.16 → 1986.24] with it and PCI Express cards so high bandwidth functionality for internet of things appliances
[1986.24 → 1992.88] like HD video streaming apps high frequency sensor data and automation controls so nowhere in their does
[1992.88 → 1998.56] it says graphics cards will suddenly be faster because PCI Express 4.0, but that's not going to stop them
[1998.56 → 2000.56] from cramming it down our throats as a selling feature
[2000.56 → 2008.32] no we should probably skip this topic I've read over it and oh, and then we should go to android 7.0
[2008.32 → 2014.08] all right let's talk new good, so this was posted by Trinity on the forum the original article here
[2014.08 → 2020.08] is from anon tech I don't think I've ever read anything by Matt hum rick on anon tech before
[2020.08 → 2028.88] but android nougat is here so there's like some I actually filmed an uh a tech quickie fast as possible
[2030.24 → 2036.00] you know these always get me they're like do you won't believe these animals are real yeah
[2036.00 → 2040.56] yeah half the time they're not real by the way yeah don't get drawn into it, they're real drawings
[2040.56 → 2048.40] they're real photoshops yeah anyway it started rolling out as of August 22nd so like four days ago or something
[2048.40 → 2056.80] uh it will begin rolling out on nexus devices in the next few weeks including nexus 5x 6p 6 9 player
[2056.80 → 2066.56] pixel c tablet general mobile 4g uh yeah anyway uh the nexus 5 and 7 2013 are not eligible for this
[2066.56 → 2073.92] update LG v20 will be the first new device that will ship with nougat pre-installed cool
[2073.92 → 2079.36] yeah Samsung's president of mobile stated that an update should come to the note 7 in perhaps the
[2079.36 → 2086.08] next two to three months how long ago did you film your thing uh the note 7 uh noes this video today
[2086.08 → 2092.96] tech wiki today yeah so coming soon yeah coming soon to a tech wiki near you yeah um but some of the new
[2092.96 → 2097.36] get features that we're highlighting here are a split screen mode this is something that has already
[2097.36 → 2103.60] existed on some vendors custom versions of android just going to say um so Samsung has had this for quite
[2103.60 → 2109.68] some time although uh and this is something that I did bring up in my note 7 review it doesn't work
[2109.68 → 2115.92] across the board like here's a key application that Samsung split screen doesn't work with Google sheets
[2116.56 → 2123.76] oh no way like I can yeah so I mean that was kind of the first time when I was working on my review
[2123.76 → 2129.60] when I went gee I really need to use split screen right now because I was filling out a props sheet
[2129.60 → 2134.40] um and doing internet research on like funny camping things and I was copying pasting links and I was
[2134.40 → 2142.16] like oh yeah cool that oh wait no so the app support is quite limited if it is natively supported in
[2142.16 → 2147.92] android I would hope that app support would be quite a bit broader uh double tapping the uh the most
[2147.92 → 2154.40] recently used apps button now switches between your last app that's and the current one that's cool
[2154.40 → 2159.28] which is really nice because that and this kind of ties into another comment from my note 7 review
[2159.28 → 2165.76] which I think went up on vessel last night um where I was talking about the stylus on the notes that this
[2165.76 → 2174.08] is not a note 7 just to be clear this is the motor z force droid thing um but anyway the stylus has
[2174.08 → 2179.28] a feature called glance where there's a little minimized icon in the bottom corner that
[2179.28 → 2185.20] you can hover over to quickly look between two apps and I was like that sounds pretty cool right
[2185.84 → 2191.52] except that it's faster to just use your multitask button and switch between them because of the delay
[2191.52 → 2196.08] when you hover but if it was a shorter delay then it just wouldn't work very well because every time
[2196.08 → 2205.68] you accidentally move anyway um so this makes that even less relevant now because now you can
[2205.68 → 2208.80] just double tap that button, and it'll go right to the last app you're using so when you're quickly
[2208.80 → 2213.36] switching between things to refer back to them this could be very useful I'm super excited about that
[2214.00 → 2218.96] um there's now the ability to bundle notifications together and this isn't in our notes, but it was in
[2218.96 → 2223.92] john script so I'm going to assume that it's correct um also the ability to expand your notifications
[2223.92 → 2227.76] and address them individually oh, thank goodness because okay this is something that's been pissing
[2227.76 → 2233.44] me off with twitter for so long you'll get like this person followed you and then someone that
[2233.44 → 2239.60] you're following like retweeted something of yours I'm like I want to click on that person's profile to
[2239.60 → 2242.40] figure out who they are that just followed me because if you ever get a notification that someone
[2242.40 → 2246.72] followed you they're probably somebody important or something, or it's one of those people that's like
[2247.20 → 2253.60] 95 million followers and 95 million people that they followed, and it's like okay sure um
[2254.00 → 2258.96] anyway, and you can't because you click on it and the app just gets confused, and then it dumps you
[2258.96 → 2264.08] somewhere with that said I have very little faith that this is any of this is going to improve twitter
[2266.32 → 2272.48] because there's plenty of stuff that is perfectly not broken on android but is still very broken on
[2272.48 → 2279.44] twitter you know they uh released that like anyone can apply for official status thing did you apply yep
[2280.16 → 2286.72] no they didn't they denied john they didn't deny me they just refused to respond uh respond I've done
[2286.72 → 2294.64] it is like three or four times they're just up I tried to apply and um the form just didn't work in multiple
[2294.64 → 2300.16] browsers on multiple occasions I filled out the whole form that's what happened the first couple times i
[2300.16 → 2304.24] tried to up you have to upload a thing I think yeah so I kept trying to upload and the uploader just
[2304.24 → 2312.32] wouldn't work so I was just like okay it's really not that important to me so yeah fine my only
[2312.32 → 2317.12] thing is there's like, and you're going to get this with your new account too there's a lot of imposter
[2317.12 → 2323.20] accounts there was some guy who was not retweeting manually tweeting all the same tweets that I had
[2323.20 → 2329.52] really and then filtering in like super ultra aggressive religious messages really between them
[2329.52 → 2335.76] and like he had the exact same uh photo as me exact same cover photo all the same pictures that I would
[2335.76 → 2340.80] post up he would post weird um like everything I mean that takes a significant amount of dedication
[2340.80 → 2346.80] it was a lot of work and then yeah religious messages filtered in between what a weird thing to work on
[2347.36 → 2352.00] I know I mean everybody needs a hobby and I get that, and you know they verified that I was real
[2352.72 → 2360.08] and banned him really fast and they don't want to give you continued to not respond about being
[2360.08 → 2363.84] official and I'm like if this is a problem you should probably just give me an official tag so
[2363.84 → 2368.24] this is easier because once you're official if you report someone as an imposter whatever you don't have
[2368.24 → 2372.56] to go through as big of a process oh really I didn't know that yeah it's more refined interesting okay
[2372.56 → 2376.08] because they like to know that you're actually the right one because I had to go through this thing like
[2376.08 → 2383.92] verifying that I was the one that wasn't the imposter right anyway apparently the audio crackle is
[2383.92 → 2389.20] back I wonder if like the microphone is overheating or something it's really hot honestly it wouldn't
[2389.20 → 2395.36] even surprise me it's like 33 degrees out there or something like that and like the warehouse with the
[2395.36 → 2411.04] lights and the know stardom neither of us have official tags the stardom well all right so the
[2411.04 → 2420.08] original article here uh was posted by Patrick 3027 on the forum, and it's from ifixit.org dun dun dun
[2420.64 → 2427.36] could it be bent gate all over again no because the design defect actually has nothing to do with
[2427.36 → 2433.04] bending, but you can see this gray flickering bar across the top of this iPhone is a classic symptom
[2433.04 → 2439.36] of a problem that repair pros are seeing more and more in iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus devices
[2440.88 → 2449.04] and it basically causes the touchscreen to be unresponsive and the weird thing about this is that it has taken
[2449.04 → 2458.00] until now for lots of repair shops to experience this influx of faulty iPhones with exactly the same
[2458.00 → 2465.68] problem now replacing the touchscreen actually doesn't fix it the gray bar eventually shows back up on the
[2465.68 → 2472.24] news screen as well it's actually the two touchscreen controller chips or the touch IC chips on the board
[2472.24 → 2478.88] inside the phone that are causing the issue apple hasn't addressed the issue and their in-house teams
[2478.88 → 2486.96] cannot fix it so third-party micro soldering specialists uh it's funny this notes this is
[2486.96 → 2494.00] hilarious yeah our notes say mostly unauthorized to do apple repairs because apple doesn't authorize
[2494.00 → 2500.24] third parties even in cases where there literally isn't an Apple Store within driving distance like you
[2500.24 → 2506.72] would have to get on a plane to go to an Apple Store um, so unauthorized Apple repair people have
[2506.72 → 2514.64] been helping to fix people's phones but right now uh it looks like that's about all that you've got going
[2514.64 → 2519.68] for yourself the good news is that apple will have to respond to this because literally every
[2519.68 → 2525.20] single iPhone 6 or 6 plus is within its warranty period right now unless you've done something to
[2525.20 → 2533.68] physically damage it outside this going wrong with it um so let's let's hope that they do something
[2535.28 → 2539.20] though I don't know what that would be
[2542.64 → 2549.52] all right this next topic is pretty fun this is posted by unlock 21 on the forum the original article here is from polygon
[2549.52 → 2555.92] South Park the fractured butt holes fart smelling peripheral
[2558.16 → 2559.20] is a thing
[2562.24 → 2571.44] there you have it this is the nostrils rift which is of course a play on oculus and nostril and um
[2571.44 → 2580.48] that's that's about it, i actually I don't even know what else to say other than someone tried it and
[2580.48 → 2588.32] apparently it's very pungent yeah the sole purpose of this peripheral is to deliver a potent fart smell
[2588.32 → 2596.16] during specific in-game moments and I think the jokes pretty much write themselves here but the developer
[2596.16 → 2606.80] of this peripheral is Ubisoft, so the obvious one is we tried the nostrils rift Ubisoft's latest release
[2607.60 → 2611.04] we couldn't tell the difference between it and any of their other releases
[2615.84 → 2624.16] oh which isn't fair because they haven't been that badly but who has the guts to make a gaming device
[2624.16 → 2628.72] that just smells bad that just smells like ass gas um
[2630.96 → 2638.16] so farting is a key component in self-park the fractured but whole and uh I mean it's a command
[2638.16 → 2643.92] that you can use anytime with a button press and then after you fart in game the nostrils
[2643.92 → 2649.60] floods with a smell that only gets stronger as you progress it comes from oils within the device
[2649.60 → 2656.08] that's really gross um and here is a picture of what it looks like when you wear it
[2658.32 → 2665.12] I am not sure if I am excited about the new South Park game I really enjoyed stick of truth I did too
[2665.12 → 2674.16] a lot it was perfect um but they I mean like so many brands that work through third-party game
[2674.16 → 2680.56] developers they made a game that was good, and my understanding is there were some difficulties
[2680.56 → 2686.56] throughout the development process I get that but like they made a game it was successful and then they
[2686.56 → 2692.00] completely changed the developer and are making an oh no very different game yeah that's not the same
[2692.00 → 2698.24] dev it's not FBI um i I don't know no the like the actual game studio that's making it yeah oh
[2698.24 → 2704.96] that's still a nightmare yeah so it's one of those things where it's like you have changed
[2706.08 → 2713.52] literally everything about it so yeah don't pre-order things anyway but especially don't
[2713.52 → 2718.64] pre-order this yeah I really do want to play it though if it gets good reviews I'll get it I'll play it
[2718.64 → 2725.92] uh all right next article this was originally posted by goodbyes that guy can post pretty much anything
[2725.92 → 2732.16] about Microsoft on the forum and I won't be surprised although this raised some
[2732.16 → 2740.32] controversy is an Xbox onesie is he being paid off to sell onesies I don't think I don't know
[2740.32 → 2745.36] what he might be this they're only being sold on Australia what if Microsoft is trying to take over
[2745.36 → 2750.64] the Australian onesie market it comes in both black and white uh the features are highlighted in
[2750.64 → 2755.84] Microsoft's press release it actually looks kind of comfy enlarge pockets to fit your Xbox controller
[2755.84 → 2761.36] and media remotes it has an arm pouch to offer quick and easy access to your mobile phone
[2761.36 → 2767.84] it has rollable legs and arms to cater to all temperatures and seasons it has forearm grips to
[2767.84 → 2770.88] prevent slipping on those edge of your seat moments
[2773.52 → 2781.84] it has an extra large hood to accommodate headsets for the ultimate gaming session and customized gamer tag
[2781.84 → 2791.60] embroidery um should I go get our NVIDIA onesie yeah okay I forgot about I will be right back I will
[2791.60 → 2799.76] return in the meantime if you want to talk about uh man bang or something man bang what the crap okay
[2799.76 → 2803.76] we are going to talk about this don't forget you can screen share you just have to like your thing
[2803.76 → 2811.84] right give me one second guys hold up post it in there now it's in the chat you guys can investigate
[2811.84 → 2818.24] man bang with me, I have never heard of this man bang okay I'm using the wrong mouse where's my screen
[2818.88 → 2825.60] there we go nice all right so outside the Nissan thing North Korea's man bang
[2825.60 → 2833.20] is a state approved streaming service why did they call it man bang could one of them have looked into
[2833.20 → 2840.48] this so one of my first questions that's going to rise here is like as far as I've heard almost no one
[2840.48 → 2847.20] in North Korea has the like North Korean version of the internet so I'm not sure how this is going to work
[2847.20 → 2854.00] uh it says you can't watch Netflix in North Korea thanks Engadget um but the democratic people's
[2854.00 → 2861.28] republic now has something at least man bang a state approved set box that streams live to meet TV or
[2861.28 → 2867.28] on-demand video okay, so really the only interesting thing about this article is the name man bang
[2868.72 → 2869.60] there's a video
[2869.60 → 2879.52] I have no idea how loud this is so I'm just going to mute it I'm also going to mute this
[2888.00 → 2898.56] there you go okay so here come the shill comments see it's very subtle actually just a little NVIDIA
[2898.56 → 2903.04] logo oh I guess I could switch to this and then that might make more sense see a little NVIDIA logo
[2903.04 → 2909.60] on the arm there it's uh I actually don't know exactly how the snuggle is supposed to work like
[2909.60 → 2916.88] is it supposed to kind of be like a ninja thing or like oh wow, but it has uh has pockets in the front
[2916.88 → 2922.24] the uni pouch yeah it's hard to tell so kind of do that see well you can tell that my hands disappear
[2922.24 → 2930.48] it's like boom that's it gone boom its hands no hands it's like uh antialiasing oh nice something
[2930.48 → 2936.08] there you go yeah yeah because that sort of uh this is freaking warm okay check this out real quick i
[2936.08 → 2940.72] want to show you this really cool video effect that they use in the man bang video check watch this
[2941.28 → 2941.60] whoa
[2945.20 → 2948.00] holy crap now that's a transition
[2948.00 → 2952.56] yeah we need to start talking to Taryn and ed about rolling out on the channel I think we should
[2952.56 → 2956.72] start using that for every transition imagine every single time we went from like product to
[2956.72 → 2964.08] host it was like whoa boom here's your host wonderful you have to like warp through space and time
[2964.08 → 2971.04] and then there's like this crazy fuzzy effect yeah why is why did they I mean we've seen that before
[2971.04 → 2977.76] when there's condensation uh in front of the inside the waterproof housing for a GoPro yeah we've seen
[2977.76 → 2985.44] that like that weird blurry effect around the outside of the frame but uh oh no original article
[2985.44 → 2993.84] here is from Ars Technica McDonald's recalls happy meal fitness trackers after they injure children so
[2993.84 → 3002.64] they recalled millions of wristband toys amid reports of blistering now this is a case of um
[3002.64 → 3010.32] um good I have this conversation with my wife all the time English is not her first language although
[3010.32 → 3015.84] she speaks it mostly natively, but there are certain things that she's picked up particularly from her
[3015.84 → 3025.20] parents where um it doesn't seem she doesn't really seem to understand the importance of the different
[3025.20 → 3031.04] meanings that words have like injure like okay yeah but I'll give some other examples first so
[3031.92 → 3039.04] she'll tell me go up in the house I left my keys on the table I will go to the house and I will look
[3039.04 → 3044.16] on every single table in the house, and they will not be there I will then run back down the stairs and
[3044.16 → 3049.28] I'll say they're not there were are they and she'll say they're on the table I'll say come show me it turns
[3049.28 → 3058.40] out they're on the counter which is not a table okay another perfect example the cat scratched the kid
[3059.12 → 3067.84] and now she has a scar and I go what it turns out she means scratch which is not the same as scar
[3067.84 → 3077.04] is permanent scratch is a mark it goes away so in much the same way that a table is not a
[3077.04 → 3085.28] counter or vice versa and injury is not a blister and vice versa and the difference between after
[3085.28 → 3089.44] like hurting kids is a very broad definition anything could be hurting kids that
[3089.44 → 3099.12] could be all the way from the sun yeah yes but injuring children implies that they like can't um
[3099.92 → 3106.80] the dietary properties of McDonald's food could be hurting kids yeah uh anyway so
[3106.80 → 3111.28] the devices were found to burn and irritate kids skin so far there have been 70 reports
[3111.28 → 3115.52] of injuries from the colourful gadgets um
[3118.48 → 3124.88] so apparently you can return it to the restaurant in exchange for another toy a tube of yogurt or apple
[3124.88 → 3127.76] slices cool so at least there's that
[3127.76 → 3132.72] the other way to the restaurant in exchange for another toy a tube of yogurt or a tube of yogurt
[3132.72 → 3137.36] apparently there's an U.S. senator suggesting that swapping college instructors for videos could be a good
[3137.36 → 3144.72] idea directly calling out uh the higher education system as a cartel and suggesting that uh colleges
[3144.72 → 3148.00] could cut the number of instructors and increase the use of online videos
[3148.00 → 3162.48] uh um I guess this is trying to lay the groundwork for some of the discussion that mostly
[3162.48 → 3170.00] seems to stem from uh the Bernie Sanders campaign around post-secondary education should be free I guess
[3170.00 → 3175.44] we're we're now laying the groundwork for what free what you should actually get for free yeah it should be
[3175.44 → 3182.32] video courses I guess yeah um being able to have uh office hours and being able to ask questions is
[3182.32 → 3187.52] rather important yeah I really don't think the point that the democrats were trying to make
[3188.24 → 3196.48] is that um the entire U.S. higher education system should be changed and then be free I think
[3196.48 → 3203.28] they were trying to say like what we have which is fairly well regarded with many of the world's most
[3203.28 → 3210.24] prestigious schools being in the United States that should be accessible to everyone and i I'm not
[3210.24 → 3218.48] getting involved in that debate I paid for university um I was able to like to make that work even without
[3219.44 → 3225.04] you know an amazing job by being entrepreneurial and stuff like that like I think there are ways to do
[3225.04 → 3230.80] it I do I think it's great that you know people in lower income brackets than me are able to get
[3230.80 → 3235.92] bursaries and are able to like to make that work I think the system could be better but I'm not
[3235.92 → 3241.84] necessarily saying I think that it's you know everyone's right to go to university for absolutely
[3241.84 → 3245.60] nothing and thinking there's possibly a middle ground but I do think it should be accessible to
[3245.60 → 3251.20] everyone whether that means that you have 10 years to pay back your loans or whether that means that
[3251.20 → 3255.84] the costs are significantly reduced I don't know what the answer is that's what I'm trying to say I'm just
[3255.84 → 3265.60] saying I don't think the answer is making it free and significantly reducing the staffing of universities
[3265.60 → 3273.20] and colleges I really don't think that was the point um yeah
[3275.92 → 3282.32] pizza drone deliveries start testing in New Zealand the drone delivery stuff is interesting because we
[3282.32 → 3286.08] were talking about this how many years ago did we start talking about this two one and a half
[3286.80 → 3291.28] something like that yeah something like that it's been a while and they're they're still kind of going
[3291.28 → 3296.16] along and one thing that we said back then that is that this wasn't going to happen now and it was
[3296.16 → 3301.20] probably going to happen later on down the line and whatnot and there 's's a video here which
[3301.20 → 3307.12] you can check out I can't imagine your pizza wouldn't be cold by the time it arrived if it was delivered
[3307.12 → 3313.92] by drone like I'm just pointing out sort of why well I don't know it's like if that's a relatively
[3313.92 → 3320.72] thermally sealed box it might get there faster than what oh by a cable it might get there faster than
[3320.72 → 3325.20] uh a car sometimes you throw it in a car and it's going to be in the car for a while before it gets
[3325.20 → 3330.00] to the destination that's true but it's going to have to be pretty sealed because you literally are
[3330.00 → 3337.36] blowing four fans very forcefully at it whereas most of the time when I see the driver come out of
[3337.36 → 3344.16] their car they're keeping it like in that thermal bag against the seat where you're going to lose a
[3344.16 → 3350.32] little bit of heat but like not too much I mean these guys look like it's super delicious they're all
[3350.32 → 3357.76] nodding yes, yes the pizza did arrive by drone yes here you go who knows though that is interesting i
[3357.76 → 3360.88] don't think it's going to matter that much clearly not actors look it's raining
[3363.84 → 3368.48] drop fell right in front of the lens it's like oh sometimes you just gotta do the shoot
[3370.16 → 3376.56] not a neat pizza guys not a neat pizza um this is interesting as rock rack and super micro have
[3376.56 → 3382.64] announced Leon phi systems we are actually getting one no what we're going to do with it, I don't know
[3382.64 → 3390.96] but hey maybe it can solve your uh balancing oh give it a rest um basically these are a couple of
[3390.96 → 3400.32] the super micro systems that are going to be available Leon phi is um kind of like coprocessor
[3400.88 → 3408.00] but it's a little bit different from the first generation Leon phi so this is the uh this is the new x200
[3408.00 → 3413.36] series and it's going to be a little bit different in the sense that you can actually run windows on it
[3413.36 → 3418.88] now so it's not just on a PCI Express card that you have to add to a system that's running regular
[3418.88 → 3427.12] eons now you can actually just boot a Leon phi system so they're going to have CPUs with up to 72 cores
[3427.12 → 3434.72] and these are based on highly modified atom Silverman cores running it up to 1.5 gigahertz with up to 36
[3434.72 → 3444.32] legs of level 2 cache 16 gigs of on package high performance memory holy crap a six channel ddr4
[3444.32 → 3454.40] controller as well as 36 PCIE 3.0 lanes this is going to be a LGA 3647 sockets so these chips are like huge
[3454.40 → 3462.88] they're massive um and should be a significant upgrade over the existing Leon phi parts which
[3462.88 → 3469.28] only ran over a PCI Express bus like I mentioned before it is expected that they will be available
[3469.28 → 3477.52] in PCI Express form again but for now they're going to look like a pretty traditional rack mount server
[3477.52 → 3484.00] I wish we could get a better look at the song really so you guys could see yeah there you go huge so
[3484.00 → 3490.88] there's a there it is liquid cooled I don't quote me on this but I want to say like 160 or 185 watt TDP or
[3490.88 → 3498.00] something like that oh no here we go here we go here we go 250 to 260 watt TDPS so yeah liquid cooling
[3498.64 → 3506.72] a thing in servers moving forward um and again I have no idea what we're going to do with it
[3506.72 → 3512.96] but apparently super micro is planning to send us one I don't think we're going to keep it
[3514.00 → 3518.24] because we legitimately have zero use for it whatsoever we should just
[3519.04 → 3525.68] do something with it fold or something um the thing is like immediately better than the
[3525.68 → 3532.16] whole folding the software designed to run on it has to be designed to run on it even though it is
[3532.16 → 3538.48] sort of x86 also totally fair like I still haven't had my briefing on it yet I've only done a little bit
[3538.48 → 3544.64] of like cursory research myself um, and it's not very clear exactly
[3547.44 → 3550.48] what a general consumer could possibly hope to get out of it
[3552.40 → 3560.80] probably nothing yes, yes yes um okay, but there are things that there's more than nothing that consumers
[3560.80 → 3569.36] could expect to get out of intel finally has m.2 SSDs freaking finally so the 600p series has been
[3569.36 → 3577.28] announced in capacities of up to one terabyte um, so these are for the mainstream market these are not
[3577.28 → 3583.44] a 950 pro competitor but with that said they still are going to outperform a sat abased SSD
[3583.44 → 3588.40] fairly substantially with sequential reads in the neighbourhood of up to two gigabytes per second
[3588.40 → 3596.48] and random read IOPS over well 100k uh 155k and random write IOPS actually more difficult are at
[3596.48 → 3604.48] 128k so we're looking at better than SATA 3 pretty much across the board uh although uh reviews are
[3604.48 → 3609.92] still pending on this one so I don't really have anything to say other than that and I guess that's
[3609.92 → 3615.20] pretty much all that I have one more thing scroll down a little bit yeah a little bit more yeah a little
[3615.20 → 3621.60] bit a little bit more a little bit more yeah there the PlayStation now coming to pc okay this
[3621.60 → 3625.44] was at the very bottom of the dock I did not see this definitely should have been in like the first
[3625.44 → 3630.96] three or four topics you better cover this so I only know a few things because also very
[3630.96 → 3636.88] bottom the dock just saw it uh the PlayStation now streaming ecosystem which I just looked wow that's
[3636.88 → 3645.12] awesome um is coming to pc and includes a huge list of games it's actually rather massive I'm not even
[3645.12 → 3649.92] just saying that that's a full list of subscription games is like here switch my screen for a second
[3650.40 → 3657.92] uh oh yeah cool this is the full list of subscription games there 's's like if you like bios hock
[3657.92 → 3663.84] there's bioshock 2 bios hock infinite you can like immediately get a really substantial library
[3663.84 → 3670.08] of games for not even that much money all the god of wars all this different stuff what's the monthly fee
[3670.08 → 3677.84] start your seven-day trial uh one month for 20 bucks three months for 44.99 that is substantially
[3677.84 → 3683.92] more expensive than GeForce now but more titles just having a look at the titles available on GeForce now
[3683.92 → 3688.40] though here oh man isn't this great how we can both be looking up different things yeah so part of the
[3688.40 → 3697.76] problem with GeForce now is that a lot of the games are just the same price you just NVIDIA's trying to
[3697.76 → 3703.28] sell it based on you don't have to buy a video card so they're eating up your video card budget
[3703.28 → 3709.36] whereas it looks like Sony is going after your game budget yeah um so it's a different kind of
[3709.36 → 3716.48] approach so you can see a lot of these are paid games paid I clicked on something sorry so the
[3716.48 → 3724.96] actual ones that are included with your membership are like mostly older titles yeah saints row four last
[3724.96 → 3733.68] gen or a couple of gens grid autosport street fighter 4 um Arkham asylum original borderlands
[3734.24 → 3740.48] yeah borderlands one they don't have borderlands 2 darksiders 2 those are old devil may cry 4
[3741.52 → 3752.16] fear 3 um whereas Sony's library looks more competitive for a couple of reasons number one is there are some
[3752.16 → 3756.08] more modern games in it and I think they're getting around this with that substantially higher
[3756.08 → 3763.44] subscription fee yeah um as well as the fact that Sony's library of exclusive titles spans back three
[3763.44 → 3769.84] generations of some pretty freaking amazing games I'm replaying Final Fantasy tactics right now because
[3770.80 → 3775.12] if you're willing to forgive some of the utterly game breaking issues with it
[3775.12 → 3786.24] it is a great turn-based game the story is completely unintelligible as far as I can tell
[3786.24 → 3791.36] there's like suspenseful moments where you're like oh yeah like that guy's bad, and we hate him let's kill
[3791.36 → 3798.40] him kind of like you can kind of get into it a bit, but the lore is very poorly constructed especially at
[3798.40 → 3805.68] the beginning i I wouldn't blame you for having absolutely no idea what's going on and the uh
[3805.68 → 3813.04] sponsors we haven't talked about at all so I fix it dun dun dun dun I fix it has an offer code when
[3813.68 → 3819.04] that will let you save five dollars off a purchase of ten dollars or more and I fix it this isn't a
[3819.04 → 3823.52] service that they offer unfortunately because it's the coolest thing ever but I want to give them a huge
[3823.52 → 3830.24] shout out for providing our office with all these embroidered pro tech toolkits the latest version of
[3830.24 → 3838.40] the pro tech tool kit um I have one that says Linus Luke has one that says Luke john has one that says
[3838.40 → 3843.68] writer oh so he's replaced but no it says john so they sent us they sent us all these kits and the funny
[3843.68 → 3851.44] thing about it was they were like do not show the old kits on camera any more we are sending you
[3851.44 → 3858.32] literally a dozen of the new kits do not use the old kits, but the thing is that while the old kit
[3858.32 → 3865.04] is not as good in some fairly significant ways mine is still in perfect condition and works great I have
[3865.04 → 3871.28] had no desire whatsoever to use the lifetime warranty that they provide on their tools, but the new kit is
[3871.28 → 3877.84] better it comes with 10 more drivers for the screwdriver kit it has this handy dandy magnetic release system
[3877.84 → 3882.08] and the lid is released so you can kind of use it as a parts' tray which is pretty cool yep the uh so
[3882.08 → 3887.52] the lid is magnetic as well, and it has all these little dividing things in it that I totally use as
[3887.52 → 3892.08] a parts' tray even though I'm actually not sure if that was what they intended uh the driver is
[3892.08 → 3897.84] significantly upgraded yeah it has like a grippy part on it now so you can get way more torque and
[3897.84 → 3902.64] which was a problem before, and it has this handy spinning part on the top I don't know if you guys can
[3902.64 → 3908.72] see that this is spinning, but that makes it so you can hold that in your hand, and you can spin
[3908.72 → 3913.20] the uh the neural part right here like there's a few ergonomic improvements that actually make a
[3913.20 → 3918.72] very significant difference it also comes with more general parts suction cups and more plier
[3919.84 → 3926.16] prior pieces and stuff like that the okay the plastic like uh mac tools is what I used to call them
[3926.16 → 3931.12] they have a better name than that, but these are significantly improved as well yeah um you can just
[3931.12 → 3937.28] bend them in half I don't want to do it because like someone did it for me before and uh Paris
[3937.28 → 3941.20] yeah was just like yeah yeah yeah and I was like oh why did you do that, and he's like look because
[3941.20 → 3949.52] it's still perfect can I do it yeah and see it just like bounces back I was like oh that's cool yeah
[3950.08 → 3955.12] and the ends are much more durable now because I used to love those things, but they had like a lifespan
[3955.12 → 3958.80] yeah because the more and more you use them the more chewed up the ends would get, and these are
[3958.80 → 3964.80] anyway so fixity tools are the bomb and if you use offer code when you can save five bucks off a
[3964.80 → 3971.84] purchase of ten dollars or more if you don't have an fixity kit and any mobile device needs a repair
[3971.84 → 3979.12] in your house I can tell you right now the math that I did is fairly simple I can pay someone the
[3979.12 → 3986.48] amount it would cost me for an fixity kit to repair this once or I can buy an fixity kit now and I can do all
[3986.48 → 3991.52] my own repairs in the future and since then I've done everything from taking apart an iMac to
[3991.52 → 3995.84] repairing my old iPhone 4 putting in a new home button so that I can continue to use it as a mp3
[3995.84 → 4000.56] player like a throwaway device that I don't care about when I'm on trips or whatever the case may be
[4000.56 → 4006.48] so highly recommended and that one was like a six dollar part one bay yeah so you know just sitting
[4006.48 → 4011.44] and i personally I find repairing small electronics kind of therapeutic so i just kind of sat and chilled for
[4011.44 → 4018.08] an hour replace my home button, and it cost me nothing yeah except like six dollars and the fixity
[4018.08 → 4025.04] kit once yes all right our next one and I have no idea what the bullet points are for this cooler master
[4025.04 → 4032.00] is sponsoring the wan show, and you can learn more about why at coolermaster.com because I sure don't
[4032.00 → 4037.04] know it's the maker five oh it's the oh it's the master case maker five again oh good the master case
[4037.04 → 4042.08] maker five gives you the freedom to build your case uh the way you will with a variety of modular
[4042.08 → 4046.00] parts I actually forget the pre-roll spot I haven't done it in a little while that was it wasn't it
[4046.00 → 4053.44] was it um hold on the master case maker five gives you the freedom to make your mid-tower pc case your
[4053.44 → 4058.80] own with a variety modular system oh right with the free form modular system with a variety of with the
[4058.80 → 4063.92] free form variety of parts and accessories with a variety of parts and accessories okay let's just
[4063.92 → 4069.76] screen share here all right master case maker five there it is guys the master case maker five
[4069.76 → 4075.52] the case that we have probably talked about more than any there it is free form modular system um
[4076.08 → 4080.48] there's actually some pretty cool stuff about it so the fact that you can hear this is cool so you
[4080.48 → 4086.16] can design stuff yourself they've actually got 3d graphics files for external modularity to customize
[4086.16 → 4091.92] or accessorize so you can download those they actually have a store that you can find where is it
[4091.92 → 4096.00] is it under modding or is it under okay I'm not sure where it is we've talked about it before but
[4096.00 → 4101.60] they have a store where you can actually buy third-party um like maker inspired and maker designed
[4101.60 → 4107.84] and maker made accessories for the master case series uh customer here it is maker master accessories
[4107.84 → 4112.96] and maker made accessories some of these are pretty cool they were showing off some primo chill ones
[4112.96 → 4118.24] back at I think it was CES so I was just like oh yeah okay that's pretty neat those guys are cool and of
[4118.24 → 4122.24] course their site it takes a long time to load because that's how it is I'm going to try and show
[4122.24 → 4127.36] anything you guys are probably all over there right now or something so I guess that's pretty
[4127.36 → 4131.12] much it checks them out at the link in the video description and I will go ahead and copy that link
[4131.12 → 4136.88] into the chat for you guys did nick message you that we had forgotten the sponsor spots or like no
[4137.60 → 4146.24] okay good someone in the twitch chat did really yeah wow we should hire them yeah that's that's now the like
[4146.24 → 4152.00] yeah hiring metrics have you ever been in the wan show chat yeah have you ever reminded of our
[4152.00 → 4156.40] sponsor spots no okay I think we're going to have to talk to you later yeah but if they yell at us for
[4156.40 → 4166.64] being late then it cancels it out okay yeah all right, so thank you guys for watching the wan show
[4166.64 → 4175.60] the overheated show yeah do we need like a fan for our microphone like I don't know I don't understand
[4175.60 → 4181.12] what to do at this point that'll make it putting a fan yeah you don't want to put a fan on a mic we
[4181.12 → 4185.52] need to like water cool it yeah we could water cool the microphone I wonder if we could do that
[4185.52 → 4190.08] somewhere else like that would be just kind of one of those totally stupid projects but that I'm sure you
[4190.08 → 4196.48] guys would watch I'd watch that like water cool your desktop microphone i just out of curiosity you
[4196.48 → 4201.20] know you could probably actually do it relatively easily like we could even just wrap like some kind
[4201.20 → 4206.96] of conductive tubing around it like you wouldn't actually be custom loop style where the pump is
[4206.96 → 4211.44] far away though yeah yeah you put the pump like under the desk like a nice quiet pump under the desk i
[4211.44 → 4218.08] think I think you'd be fine vibration isolation okay like some kind of like a thing rubbery thing of
[4218.08 → 4224.64] something yeah like some kind of silicone thing um I think I could work in like a radiator just like
[4224.64 → 4231.52] mounted to the bottom of the desk speaking of desks this has been a long time coming, but there will be
[4231.52 → 4239.84] a new desk pc build on Linus tech tips, and it is going to be better than every other desk pc you've ever
[4239.84 → 4247.52] seen not because it looks more impressive not because the hardware is higher end not because it has like
[4247.52 → 4255.04] hard line water cooling or anything like that it will be the best because it will be super cheap and
[4255.04 → 4265.04] still look pretty cool okay yeah because most SP pc builds are like excessively expensive okay and like
[4265.04 → 4272.16] to replicate them you would need like an entire well-equipped shop yeah whereas this one literally
[4272.16 → 4278.80] doesn't have a single glue or excuse me a single nail or screw in it, you can build the entire desk pc
[4278.80 → 4286.56] with a single sheet of MDF and glue seriously well the computer would have screws in it yes
[4287.92 → 4294.40] haha but the purpose of the death victory the purpose of the desk pc is that you can build it
[4294.96 → 4301.12] for less than you'd pay for like an enthusiast grade case that's pretty wicked so it should be
[4301.12 → 4304.64] pretty cool I'm pretty excited about if it's pretty wicked I mean okay to be clear the hardware inside
[4304.64 → 4310.80] it is going to be baller AF because it's a show have that yeah it's a showcase build like if I go and put
[4310.80 → 4318.00] like a matx motherboard in like one hard drive in an entire desk pc I got so much because I released
[4318.00 → 4323.60] that video about how high-end power supplies or like really really really high wattage power supplies
[4323.60 → 4329.20] are stupid yeah and then the very next build that came out had like a 1200 watt power supply in it
[4329.20 → 4334.00] the only reason why I did that was because it looks nice, and it came with it already had the nice cables
[4334.00 → 4340.64] plugged into it yeah that computer turned on like maybe once for b-roll yeah sorry but like the comment
[4340.64 → 4347.12] section oh man people were like how could you make a video about that then make this computer I'm like
[4347.12 → 4352.00] I'm not suggesting you put these parts in this case I was just reviewing the case we're just
[4352.00 → 4357.84] reviewing a case yeah it legitimately doesn't matter what power supply no not at all it was literally
[4357.84 → 4362.80] just laying there you know what was my other favourite like top comment on that video was the
[4362.80 → 4370.00] people being like well actually they're not stupid because my triple r9 290 build actually like draws
[4370.00 → 4378.72] almost that much I'm sorry but why did you high wattage power supplies
[4380.80 → 4386.48] don't make sense for any other configuration of hardware that would have made sense
[4387.92 → 4393.20] I can build a computer that can max out a 1200 or even a 1500 watt power supply
[4393.20 → 4402.88] and I noticed literally in the intro seven gamers one CPU was that computer it actually drew like 1500
[4402.88 → 4408.16] watts from the wall, but it was stupid and that makes sense and nobody should have built it yeah
[4410.08 → 4416.96] it was a cool experiment yes it definitely was a cool experiment I don't understand why anyone built a
[4416.96 → 4427.44] multi-Hawaii crossfire system
[4432.80 → 4438.00] unless you were going to water cool it maybe and like hang the radiator out the window or put it on your
[4438.00 → 4449.28] roof, but we all know how that ends up anyway all right so I'm done thank you for tuning into the
[4449.28 → 4454.48] show it's been a great time yeah see you again next week same bat time same bat channel
[4454.48 → 4460.32] bye is that joke ever going to get old someone in I guess people have to get it for it to be old someone
[4460.32 → 4465.84] in my chat again thought you were saying batch yeah same batch time same batch channel and I was like nope
[4465.84 → 4470.32] that's wrong
