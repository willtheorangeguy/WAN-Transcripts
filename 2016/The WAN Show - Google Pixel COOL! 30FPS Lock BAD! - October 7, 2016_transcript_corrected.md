[0.00 → 9.48] all right welcome to the WAN show we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today including but
[9.48 → 16.92] not limited to Luke's food which actually smells a lot better than it looks yeah because it actually
[16.92 → 22.26] looks like garbage it do I can't really like to show you because it's not going to show very well
[22.26 → 28.08] yeah I don't mean yeah well I know I think they think they get the point I don't mean figurative
[28.08 → 34.86] garbage I mean it looks literally like garbage like the like people's leftover plate scraps that
[34.86 → 39.14] that's been for like a couple of days probably that they put in, but it smells perfect it smells
[39.14 → 45.58] like hot and sour soup um also on the show today we've got Google's event which includes their
[45.58 → 54.58] unveiling of the pixel and the pixel XL yes for the uh larger uh plus-sized among us no plus size is
[54.58 → 64.82] different um plus-sized hands I'm a plus size hand model like I mean I'm not, but I was playing
[64.82 → 71.54] a part Galaxy Note 7s still problems lots of problems tons of terrible problems well there's one
[71.54 → 77.46] problem a singular terrible problem yeah there's one problem it's just really terrible that's all
[77.46 → 86.76] um Google is reinventing Wi-Fi again and by reinventing I mean taking something that has
[86.76 → 93.44] existed for a very very very long time and doing it in an affordable device that's targeted at consumers
[93.44 → 101.06] because why hasn't that ever been done up until this point what else we got also I tried the HoloLens
[101.06 → 107.24] for an extremely short period of time let's talk about that that's solid man yeah
[107.24 → 119.06] wait for it no Hold no I got it oh yeah oh I'll just roll the intro okay that became awkward
[119.06 → 124.12] what is that
[124.12 → 147.64] oh apparently the intro audio is very low all right well um square space and also oh crap okay square
[147.64 → 153.96] space and also Dollar Shave Club and also stalling for time while I turn up the intro
[153.96 → 158.72] audio which I forgot that we fixed at some point, so I don't have to turn it down all the time
[158.72 → 167.00] any more yeah all right it wouldn't be the WAN show we were mostly on time no we weren't it's four
[167.00 → 172.52] it was 4 45 last time it was like 5 20 well that's true but last time we were trying to have you call
[172.52 → 178.22] in from Timbuktu and the audio should not be a complicated problem no it shouldn't be but the audio
[178.22 → 186.98] sliders I swear they were like it was like exploding in my ears when I listened to the like
[186.98 → 197.58] the bong bong bong sound in the corner and you could barely hear, and I couldn't adjust I
[197.58 → 203.10] couldn't adjust our voice chat we tried two different video chat clients and I couldn't adjust
[203.10 → 209.86] that without adjusting the system slider and whenever I adjusted the system slider explosion
[209.86 → 216.14] I've been trying to get discord to include video chat that would be awesome I was trying to get them
[216.14 → 222.86] to specifically do it so that you can add the video of the person's video chat as a like camera in play
[222.86 → 228.02] right um they don't really want to do that they want to do the video chat thing they don't really
[228.02 → 231.50] want you to be able to add it as it because that's more complicated I'm like but seriously
[231.50 → 236.92] that would be amazing discord's whole thing by the way they are not a sponsor today on the WAN show
[236.92 → 243.10] uh but like discord's whole thing like talking to their guys it's so cool because they're just so
[243.10 → 248.66] down to earth I'm just like they're pretty chill why did you guys build a video chat platform and
[248.66 → 253.66] they're like well because like we couldn't figure out why everything else was terrible
[253.66 → 261.42] thank you that's why everyone should develop everything yeah they still have a lot of grounds
[261.42 → 269.02] to catch up on like they need to have like tiered chat things and that's coming I think and
[269.02 → 274.30] they need some other stuff, but I like the platform anyway I like the philosophy is what I like all right
[274.30 → 278.02] speaking of philosophies the Google nexus device
[278.02 → 287.96] it's gone it's gone the way of the play store edition like galaxy what was that like in the s5
[287.96 → 294.68] days or whatever it was when they used to do the play edition yeah so for a while there nexus and
[294.68 → 301.28] play edition kind of existed alongside each other, so nexus were these google exclusive sort of devices
[301.28 → 307.24] sometimes they were quite similar to a device that the actual manufacturer of the hardware would
[307.24 → 311.08] also release with their own android skin, and then we got play editions where google kind of
[311.08 → 318.18] adopted devices that were already out there on the market so HTC had a one play edition for example
[318.18 → 325.98] um and then now we are doing away with that, and we're getting something that is completely
[325.98 → 332.72] completely built sort of by Google so everything about the design everything about the hardware
[332.72 → 338.92] everything about the software is googled both inside and out now with that said uh we actually
[338.92 → 343.98] talked about this on the show intro like clip that nobody watches as far as I can tell and
[343.98 → 347.64] that's okay I don't blame you, but they're actually quite funny they're worth going and finding
[347.64 → 353.88] like better than the first bit of the actual show yeah honestly I mean nothing against you or me
[353.88 → 359.86] we're great we're always great what does that have to I just mean you know the sometimes our best
[359.86 → 365.72] work is not actually on the show it's when we're like excited about starting the show yeah yeah um
[365.72 → 372.00] anyway the point is that it's still manufactured by someone else because Google doesn't own like a
[372.00 → 378.64] phone manufacturing facility, yet I mean even apple doesn't own a phone manufacturing facility
[378.64 → 385.76] um so it's actually manufactured by HTC, but you won't find a HTC logo on it this is a Google phone
[385.76 → 391.36] so the pixel and the pixel XL feature an aluminum unibody and polished glass design a high def AMOLED
[391.36 → 396.54] display a snapdragon 821 processor four gigs of LP ddr4 memory a rear fingerprint sensor which I'm
[396.54 → 403.62] personally kind of bummed about we can debate this after if you'd like uh 2770 or 3450 William hour
[403.62 → 410.64] battery and what they are claiming is the best camera ever yes, although again this is something
[410.64 → 416.04] that I'm going to have to see to believe because there's a lot more to a mobile camera than just
[416.04 → 423.04] how it scores on what's it called base mark I think what's the benchmark I can't remember what
[423.04 → 427.18] it's called it's one of those things that I like look up before I have to talk about, but I didn't
[427.18 → 432.88] today because I didn't prepare for this, so I'm excited though largely because of the no camera bump thing
[432.88 → 438.66] no camera bump is great but okay, okay fine I won't, I won't finish everything I'm talking about
[438.66 → 443.46] I am going to talk about the camera so just because it gets a great score when it's uh doing
[443.46 → 448.28] what are effectively the equivalent of synthetic benchmarks like if you're shooting at lines and
[448.28 → 452.26] seeing how close the lines can be before you can't resolve them anymore all that kind of stuff
[452.26 → 458.72] just because something performs well there does not mean that it performs well in the real world of
[458.72 → 464.98] course um I mean a perfect example of this was the axon 7 whose camera can actually take a pretty
[464.98 → 473.94] darn great shot but as I showed in my review if the subject is oh I don't know say moving the axon 7
[473.94 → 481.32] in order to achieve the image quality that it does in their you know in like the glamour shots that
[481.32 → 488.58] you would take with it needs a much longer shutter speed than the Galaxy S7 did so when I took pictures
[488.58 → 494.60] under the same lighting conditions with both cameras of a moving subject you can tell that even though
[494.60 → 500.34] they might be similar in quality the ones that you're actually going to get usable pictures out of
[500.34 → 506.18] like in your day-to-day life when your kids or your dogs or your you know to be fair dick pics are moving
[506.18 → 512.22] already photos from it taken by third-party reviewers and that's that's fine in not
[512.22 → 516.60] ideal lighting situations and ridiculously rapid fire because the shutter speed's really fast and
[516.60 → 521.82] that's fine, and I'm totally looking forward to it, we definitely do have a phone two phones actually I
[521.82 → 528.18] think being provided by brand yeah I think um much like, so I shot my iPhone 7 and 7 plus video today
[528.18 → 534.32] so we'll just have v-roll of both of them so we can kind of cover both moving on it's got 32 or 128 gigs
[534.32 → 539.22] of storage I actually think this is a good move they don't have to have as many skews uh no, no
[539.22 → 544.78] ditching 64 yeah just not having an in-between like who needs the tweeter you either need a bunch
[544.78 → 549.38] of storage on your phone, or you don't really care in which case 32 gigs is lots love it especially
[549.38 → 555.08] because this phone in particular I don't really see any reason why I would need a 128 because it comes
[555.08 → 564.30] with unlimited full quality photo storage using google photos so that is pretty freaking sick I mean
[564.30 → 570.36] that's a yeah honestly like for me all that stuff says snapdragon 821 blah blah blah no camera
[570.36 → 578.80] sure that's great but not having many photos yeah I take tons I have kids oh yeah okay I might
[578.80 → 583.84] like I might like to have dinner and take 40 photos because I'm like oh they're so cute look at me
[583.84 → 587.26] taking all these photos of them terrible that they're never gonna look at terrible, and I'm never
[587.26 → 591.96] gonna show to people because I don't want to be that dad but are you doing that yeah yeah yeah
[591.96 → 598.76] but I don't need that many for that yeah so there you go um everyone's just like what yeah yeah
[598.76 → 605.62] don't worry everything's okay I'm doing the thing there is a 3.5 millimetre headphone jack
[605.62 → 611.96] holy shit I don't know how they managed to fit it on this right um I don't even know why they
[611.96 → 616.46] thought it was necessary I mean who uses that's like who uses wired headphones it's like they're not
[616.46 → 622.06] courageous yeah uncourageous yeah is the word that I would use to describe you know I very recently
[622.06 → 626.82] checked out this little robot thing, and it has like emotions one of them is courage theirs is
[626.82 → 631.02] probably like hold on no, no no I don't want to hear about this robot anymore unless it doesn't
[631.02 → 635.50] have a three and a half millimetre jack no it doesn't it doesn't okay courageous carry on there we go
[635.50 → 642.48] yeah so it has different emotional and a one is like a full point so anyway you guys will see
[642.48 → 648.48] the video on that later yeah I mean isn't it kind of crazy the way we work on videos that won't hit
[648.48 → 653.52] YouTube for like three weeks long time yeah it kind of trips me out actually it's a little unfortunate
[653.52 → 658.76] considering a certain one that is currently on vessel after just sitting around for like a while
[658.76 → 664.96] and then new information has come out since then which hurts it a little bit not, not like a lot like
[664.96 → 670.06] it's not a big deal but just looking back at it's like oh I could have had more stuff that one
[670.06 → 676.78] oh what killed VR one so this Google thing just happened, and they just announced their daydream
[676.78 → 682.18] thing yeah there was daydream view yeah there's more information in there that would have been
[682.18 → 687.46] helpful to include in that script all right so hold on let's finish up with the pixels uh there's three
[687.46 → 691.74] colours I actually love the names of their colours quite black really blue and very silver
[691.74 → 702.84] it's such a shot at all the complete nonsense that I blame lipstick manufacturers okay that's fair if
[702.84 → 709.92] anyone in the lipstick industry is out there you are to blame for this crap that we all go through
[709.92 → 717.74] where it's like it passion red sunrise I mean those aren't even that bad a little bit like non-pg for a
[717.74 → 722.30] second because well that's what their names are to be fair like once you get to a certain realm
[722.30 → 726.50] there's like there's even hair products that are just called like sexy hair
[726.50 → 733.56] you're not even trying anymore like bankable red
[733.56 → 739.04] it's just some companies should just go flat out
[739.04 → 743.98] yep this lipstick colour is bankable red
[743.98 → 747.54] room job rose like I don't know where's the limit
[747.54 → 755.98] oh my god that would be the most hilarious lipstick we're going to lose all of our sponsors
[755.98 → 761.26] they're all gone I'm sorry I got a call coming in I got a call coming in from Nick
[761.26 → 766.78] sorry, sorry he can't say them fast enough all the sponsors that are abandoning the show
[766.78 → 769.96] but we've gained a new one they make lipstick it's called room job red
[769.96 → 772.78] yeah we are now their only it tastes awful
[772.78 → 784.60] oh god okay uh moving on okay, so daydream view the first daydream ready VR headset
[784.60 → 789.40] yeah go so daydream we've talked about on the wan show before is like kind of certification process
[789.40 → 796.22] for android phones where you have to have the right like movement text so it's accurate it knows
[796.22 → 800.46] exactly where the phone is inside its fast enough the processor is good enough etc etc etc
[800.46 → 807.12] and then there's daydream content now they have daydream view which is like the headset thing that
[807.12 → 810.56] you put the phone in its compatible with a different a bunch of different types of phones
[810.56 → 816.46] it's not uh locked down to like HTC because HTC is the one that made the pixel it's kind of whatever
[816.46 → 824.20] you want to put in there um which is cool and stuff the reason why I was against it yeah what i
[824.20 → 830.32] just said yeah is having this information would have pushed in really well to a video that's
[830.32 → 835.16] currently on vessel yeah like uh maybe you can talk about it a fair bit I mean it's okay so the
[835.16 → 841.54] video is going to watch it yeah the video is called what killed VR um it started from a wan show from
[841.54 → 847.66] about three weeks ago where we talked about how desktop users' adoption of VR has gone down so like
[847.66 → 858.14] desktop VR like the opaque tethered realm of VR that is yeah oh so you break VR into quadrants
[858.14 → 863.14] there's tethered, so there 's's tethered and untethered then there's opaque and transparent oh i
[863.14 → 869.46] understand okay, okay yeah so like opaque tethered would be five and oculus rifts um opaque untethered
[869.46 → 878.54] would be gear VR uh transparent untethered is the hollow lens and then transparent tethered is
[878.54 → 884.46] who would want that there's a there is one I don't remember what it's called yeah it sounds stupid
[884.46 → 889.04] I don't think it works very well yeah I can't imagine it would yeah okay so don't worry about
[889.04 → 893.96] that, but there's like yeah there are the quadrants so it's like why the opaque tethered side of things
[893.96 → 899.88] is not is losing adoption rate um and I talk about like the gear VR, and it would have been
[899.88 → 905.00] helpful to talk about daydream view people are still subscribing using twitch prime peter meter
[905.00 → 912.88] 909 just subscribed using twitch prime apparently Colton told me this so it might be completely off
[912.88 → 922.08] base right um, but apparently we have 500 subscribers now that's crazy twitch prime is different like uh
[922.08 → 927.38] it doesn't auto re like it's its not really a subscription because it doesn't auto re-up
[927.38 → 933.04] oh okay, but they could come back and just click the button again, and then it would do it oh cool
[933.04 → 939.92] okay sorry carry on daydream anyway um so like it's 79 bucks which is price competitive with the 2015
[939.92 → 948.82] gear VR not price competitive with the 2016 gear VR um but like I mean that's a 20 difference so
[948.82 → 955.98] it's probably not that bad in the end um they have a lot of like I'm not really going to be able to
[955.98 → 960.76] comment on this properly, but they talked a lot about the overall design and the comfort and the
[960.76 → 965.54] fit and the finish the stuff that I can't say anything about at all until I touch it and try it
[965.54 → 972.44] yeah haven't touched it and tried it so whatever um I can say however that they did use fabric for the
[972.44 → 977.68] touch faces which is good this is what you kind of see with like uh the rift the Oculus Rift instead of
[977.68 → 983.84] the vibe um they focused on comfort and ease of use it connects to the phone it has a wireless
[983.84 → 987.86] connection to the phone which is kind of cool and an auto alignment system stuff like that
[987.86 → 994.04] um it has a controller with clickable touchpad and two buttons and there are sensors inside that
[994.04 → 1000.92] respond to how you move and stuff like that uh just yeah maybe it'll be okay watch what killed VR
[1000.92 → 1007.30] I requested a review sample cool so maybe we'll get it, or maybe we won't, they actually didn't reply
[1007.30 → 1015.14] to me, so nice yeah cool all right so let's talk about some of the home stuff that they wanted to uh
[1015.14 → 1020.16] that they want you to put in your home Chromecast ultra is here so you can cast content at up to 4k
[1020.16 → 1031.38] uh it supports HDR and Dolby Vision I mean I colour me skeptical as far as the whole is HDR okay HDR I can
[1031.38 → 1040.10] see making a difference on something that you are streaming and casting to a TV I mean we are
[1040.10 → 1048.44] talking compression up the Yazoo at this point um even, even taking like 4k uh something like Marco Polo
[1048.44 → 1056.16] okay so even taking 4k HDR content right off of your internet connection into your TV's built-in
[1056.16 → 1061.26] Netflix app which are the ones that actually tend to get upgraded first when there's a new feature
[1061.26 → 1072.12] there's still a very debatable um benefit to 4k resolution HDR I can see making a difference because
[1072.12 → 1078.42] the additional colour information um it makes it look realistic you're saying this as a bandwidth
[1078.42 → 1087.14] problem I'm saying that I doubt that 4k on a Chromecast is going to be anywhere near what 4k
[1087.14 → 1092.44] is capable of, and it's about bandwidth because yeah yeah because of all the compression so you're
[1092.44 → 1100.66] still going to see compression artifacts and banding and blockiness even though you have technically 3840
[1100.66 → 1105.76] by 2160 pixels yeah because if they had is they tried to do it all uncompressed and everyone tried
[1105.76 → 1114.26] to stream at the same time that would be bad not to mention that I mean a 4k HDR Blu-ray is like 50 gigs
[1114.26 → 1126.60] so if you're not wired you're you're not getting that level of quality um I actually have my stable of 4k Blu-rays now
[1126.60 → 1136.74] and I have an Xbox One S now, and so I have definitely not uh ripped the because it's great because the 4k Blu-rays
[1136.74 → 1141.70] also come with the regular Blu-ray so one thing I was worried about was that I was going to have to have
[1141.70 → 1146.66] two Blu-ray players on two separate inputs but I can just have my pc and I can stream the regular
[1146.66 → 1152.54] uncompressed Blu-ray rips and then I can have the Xbox that I don't have and then I can have the Xbox
[1152.54 → 1157.64] connected to another HDMI input and Brandon's going to help me with this we're going to just be able to
[1157.64 → 1163.02] flip between them just by changing inputs so we can do a lot of side-by-side watching and uh in
[1163.02 → 1168.44] comparison, so those are all here I have a question uh how long until this is called the Google cast
[1168.44 → 1175.42] and google cast ultra I don't know because we have Google Wi-Fi google we have Google home
[1175.42 → 1183.72] and then we have Chromecast right i I have no idea it's confusing to me and I mean like Samsung
[1183.72 → 1191.56] is going the obvious intelligent route of just naming everything gear, so there's no confusion
[1191.56 → 1196.08] every single talking about this I thought that was stupid I thought no I'm yeah oh yeah no calling
[1196.08 → 1200.08] everything gear is dumb I didn't realize how extensive it was until I was doing the research
[1200.08 → 1204.58] for kill VR and I actually went on their website and clicked on products and was like oh my god
[1204.58 → 1212.16] well I was doing an editing pass of one of his scripts and I kept referring to the gear VR as the
[1212.16 → 1218.24] gear and I was like nope that won't work because and you can't just call watches and your VR either no
[1218.24 → 1223.32] because there's 15 or 2015 and 2016 versions maybe they're trying to quite different maybe they're
[1223.32 → 1229.68] trying to take like the bum equipment approach you know where it's like Samsung gear like they're
[1229.68 → 1235.46] actually just going to change the brand oh no I'm oh no, no I'm joking I mean they're close to that
[1235.46 → 1245.46] yeah they're not the Samsung gear Galaxy S7 XL explosion edition um
[1247.54 → 1251.54] you know it's okay Severus you guys have seen Severus on our channel a few times the
[1251.54 → 1257.22] big twitch streamer I have it's not that big he's kind of skinny actually no I meant like yeah anyway uh
[1257.22 → 1264.50] he was plugging his note 7 in at the beginning of his streams every time just like see if it would
[1268.50 → 1275.30] how hard do stream so awesome how hard do streamers work to have dumb stuff happen on their streams
[1276.34 → 1280.18] oh yeah probably I mean at that point you're just like you're inviting it I mean why don't you just
[1280.18 → 1284.74] have a bucket of gas sitting next to you and strike a match at the beginning of every one of your streams
[1284.74 → 1290.34] hey let's just see if you use let's just see if the air currents in the room are blowing this way or
[1290.34 → 1296.66] that way today people would really tune in for the start of all your streams yes they would that
[1296.66 → 1304.02] viewership boom would be really fast that is irresponsible no yes, yes what do you mean no there
[1304.02 → 1309.70] is no, no there's no there's no it's not responsible for getting tons of views it's not open for debate
[1309.70 → 1317.46] um all right, so there's more to the Chromecast ultra than just 4k though uh google blah blah blah
[1317.46 → 1322.02] blah so google play movies and TV are rolling out 4k content November that's cool that's also 4k that's
[1322.02 → 1327.62] not what I promised you just now it's also 1.8 times faster at loading content and features major Wi-Fi
[1327.62 → 1332.50] improvements which it bloody well better if it's going to be doing anything it supports Ethernet yes so
[1332.50 → 1339.46] Ethernet for power users so that takes care of some of my concerns with respect to 4k content not all i
[1339.46 → 1344.98] actually don't know if it's gigabit or 10 hundred regardless there's still going to be compression
[1344.98 → 1348.58] it's not going to solve the problem entirely they're going to compress it before they send it
[1348.58 → 1352.18] to you, they're not going to send completely uncompressed footage yeah anything you're streaming
[1352.18 → 1357.14] over the internet like honestly I bought house of cards on Blu-ray even though that's dumb because
[1357.14 → 1363.06] I have a Netflix subscription it's a really well shot show though and I'm starting to become a bit
[1363.06 → 1369.22] of a cinematography snob that he did it to me, he does it to everyone I hate me too I hate him
[1369.22 → 1374.58] because like I love him well it's a love-hate relationship he loves him I hate him so
[1376.42 → 1382.66] like I don't even understand necessarily why things are wrong, but you can feel it, but you can feel it
[1382.66 → 1388.02] now when like before I just didn't care yeah like I can't even watch Big Bang Theory anymore and like
[1388.02 → 1394.66] yeah I thought it was pretty funny, but he's on some podcast he complains about all kinds of like
[1394.66 → 1402.34] like stupid stuff but like wait Brandon's on a podcast I think so really was a guest or
[1402.34 → 1407.78] something oh huh how about that well not yet like it's I think it's happening or I don't know well i
[1407.78 → 1416.26] hate him um all right so google in the home google Wi-Fi is an expandable system of apps now every time
[1416.26 → 1423.46] that anyone's tried to do this in the past it's been stupid I mean this isn't perfect as well to
[1423.46 → 1429.78] be very clear but whenever we've seen this in the past it's been really, really stupid like it's been
[1429.78 → 1439.22] oh yeah you should have a Wi-Fi range extender which are awful god I hate those range extenders are the
[1439.22 → 1444.34] worst your connection gets interrupted as you cross over the barrier literally terrible unless you're gonna
[1444.34 → 1451.30] leave a gap in between too their range is awful and the problem with that is that because their range
[1451.30 → 1456.42] is awful you can't actually move them very far away from your original access point unless you're doing
[1456.42 → 1462.82] like one of those Ethernet extended ones even those have been every time I've used one terrible oh
[1462.82 → 1469.06] yeah terrible experience unless you're just like okay I give up I'm just going to have a separate SSID
[1469.70 → 1474.18] Linus's house basement yeah yeah and that's what this is going to be well that's what I'm saying if
[1474.18 → 1477.94] you put it like I've seen some people that use them, and they'll put them in like the garage where
[1477.94 → 1482.10] the house Wi-Fi doesn't get to at all and then just call it the same thing and put the same password
[1484.58 → 1489.70] which works if you have somewhere where your house Wi-Fi doesn't reach at all yeah, but it has to be
[1489.70 → 1496.42] completely dead otherwise phones are so bad for this they're so sticky a sticky client is one that
[1496.42 → 1503.70] doesn't grab a stronger signal very actively it just stays on some weak sauce signal trying to
[1503.70 → 1509.70] transfer data knowing that it can't do it I mean it's giving me an error on the screen that says the
[1509.70 → 1515.86] web page can't look then try something else it doesn't seem that complicated Windows phone is great
[1515.86 → 1522.66] at this your Wi-Fi cuts out switches over to data I mean it's the one thing that I miss about using windows
[1522.66 → 1527.70] phone um okay so I'm going to drop in one of the little kind of funny things about me being at
[1527.70 → 1531.46] Microsoft right now I know we're gonna talk about HoloLens yet but what you just said was hilarious
[1531.46 → 1537.94] um while I was down there we were talking about uh insert NDA currently covered content here
[1539.70 → 1546.98] so there you go and I was like what platforms is this coming to um is it going to be on you know tried
[1546.98 → 1552.26] to like be subtle about it like hey you're gonna release this on more things than just Windows phone
[1552.26 → 1560.82] and the person insert NDA covered name here um was like well we're going to try to get to where the
[1560.82 → 1574.10] people are oh, oh that's not nice to themselves so it's going to be on their platform first so they can
[1574.10 → 1578.50] like kind of work things out I mean I just think that's not fair to their users either I mean calling
[1578.50 → 1582.90] everyone who uses Windows phone a chimp not a people well okay I think they might have said it
[1582.90 → 1589.22] in a slightly different way but yeah yeah i just not to go on for too long about this I think it's
[1589.22 → 1594.34] part of the new CEO kind of deal yeah because before they used to be very like don't compete with their
[1594.34 → 1600.18] own products kind of thing, and now they're not good anyway anyway back to google Wi-Fi so the hardware
[1600.18 → 1605.78] is designed to be visually subtle whoa, and it comes with a feature set called network assist which
[1605.78 → 1611.86] optimizes which ap you're accessing they also give you a network management app impressive and it
[1611.86 → 1617.30] works together with uh google on hubs the pre-orders are available in November shipping in early December
[1617.94 → 1623.38] 130 bucks for a single unit 2.99 for a three pack they really want you to buy that three pack they do
[1623.94 → 1628.66] and I mean I understand why so it's kind of a mesh based network thing that they've got going on here
[1628.66 → 1635.94] which still is going to hurt your data transfer rates with that said Wi-Fi ac I actually don't
[1635.94 → 1641.78] know if it's wave one or wave two which would be interesting because if it's wave two iPhone 6s's and
[1641.78 → 1650.74] sevens are actually going to perform really well even with a couple of hops um but ac Wi-Fi has gotten
[1650.74 → 1655.22] fast enough that for most anything you'd need to do if you're going through a hop or two you'll probably
[1655.22 → 1659.86] still be okay both latency and bandwidth wise so I'm really interested to see how this works out
[1659.86 → 1664.90] I don't generally cover Wi-Fi stuff anymore because it usually makes me want to rip my hair out
[1664.90 → 1670.50] um because things just don't work the way that you expect, but the great news about this product is that
[1670.50 → 1674.66] it is designed to be easy to use basically you just take these things you scatter them around all over
[1674.66 → 1679.62] your house and uppity bop pity it's supposed to be amazing coverage everywhere seamlessly so if anything
[1679.62 → 1683.94] doesn't work seamlessly then I just get to say that instead of trying to problem-solve it
[1683.94 → 1689.46] so there you go let's find out how that goes uh google home uh seems like a huge focus I don't
[1689.46 → 1693.62] really care because it's not available in Canada so it's 129 bucks includes a six-month free trial
[1693.62 → 1698.58] of YouTube red and pre-orders are available now for first class citizens down in the United States of
[1698.58 → 1705.22] America uh yeah I was going to say we could do the ship and bring it over the boat we've done that before
[1705.22 → 1709.70] yeah that didn't work out very well that did not work out well with the echo all right let's move on to
[1709.70 → 1716.10] our next article original from the verge I actually posted it already a post recall Galaxy Note 7
[1716.10 → 1724.98] caught fire on a Southwest Airlines flight with a thick gray green quote-unquote angry smoke
[1726.66 → 1733.94] pretty uh that looks delicious yeah yeah that looks about as appetizing as your food hey man that's
[1733.94 → 1739.38] pretty true oh it's actually good it just looks terrible it smells great yeah it's good looks
[1739.38 → 1745.78] like monkey butt it's like kale and brown rice and corn and peppers, and it sounds awful too I mean it
[1745.78 → 1752.26] tastes all right yeah it smells good yeah yeah smells good yeah the phone is currently in the hands of the
[1752.26 → 1757.46] local fire department with the arson investigation unit so I guess they're trying to figure out who they're
[1757.46 → 1764.74] going to throw blame at um which I think we can probably guess the owner of the note 7 that caught
[1764.74 → 1775.70] on fire has already replaced it with an iPhone 7 uh-oh so dun don't dun that's not astounding
[1777.78 → 1785.30] to be clear this is one of the units that Samsung has already deemed to be safe yeah the phone was
[1785.30 → 1791.70] charged to about 80 percent when the incident occurred and when the IMEI was run through Samsung's
[1791.70 → 1797.86] recall eligibility checker it read great news your device is not in the list of affected devices if you
[1797.86 → 1804.82] have any other questions contact us sad blip pity sloppily blue so they issued a statement okay until we
[1804.82 → 1809.22] are able to retrieve the device we cannot confirm which is currently held by the fire department we cannot
[1809.22 → 1814.82] confirm that this incident involves the new note 7 they're possibly trying to say that it's the old one
[1814.82 → 1820.42] we are working with authorities and southwest now to recover the device okay so they're working
[1820.42 → 1825.30] the fire department I guess and confirm the cause once we have examined the device we will have more
[1825.30 → 1829.70] information to share although I think that's literally exactly what's happening right now is the
[1829.70 → 1837.06] government is examining the device so I don't really think it matters too much what Samsung finds so
[1837.06 → 1840.58] there's a lot more with government the U.S. consumer product safety commission is opening an
[1840.58 → 1845.46] investigation into the incident and this seems to be the first reported incident of a replacement
[1845.46 → 1852.74] phone going bad at least in the U.S. if it's actually a replacement phone all right apple has apparently
[1852.74 → 1858.98] patented a fingerprint sensor that works through the display that's pretty crazy the headline here and I'm
[1858.98 → 1865.78] posting the original apple insider article in the twitch chat here the headline reads hints at iPhone 8
[1865.78 → 1871.54] technology although I would be very surprised if we see this in the iPhone 8 because if apple is yeah i
[1871.54 → 1876.82] did if apple is patenting it now what you guys need to understand and Luke will have a lot of really
[1876.82 → 1881.70] cool information about this in that upcoming Microsoft coverage do not miss those Microsoft videos they are
[1881.70 → 1887.86] going to be very cool um there's no way if apple is patenting it today that it will be anywhere near the
[1887.86 → 1893.94] iPhone 8 yeah mark my words the development cycle of a product like that is at least 18 months to two years
[1894.66 → 1900.98] at least it'll be a while so it'll be a while, but it sounds really cool unless they were just like
[1901.54 → 1906.90] hedging their bets that no one else would figure it out and tried to just place the patent last minute
[1906.90 → 1913.06] but that's very uncharacteristic and very unlikely so it's rumoured that the 2017 iPhone will get rid of
[1913.06 → 1919.94] the iconic home button entirely making way for a full screen face edge-to-edge OLED display um apple is
[1919.94 → 1923.70] said to be working on a virtual button which presumably carries over the same features and
[1923.70 → 1927.62] functions I mean the tactic engine is I'm just going to say that that would be fine one step in that
[1927.62 → 1933.70] direction already yeah but I would be very surprised if they try and do something so dramatic two phones
[1933.70 → 1940.98] in a row especially because we already know that the s variant usually changes very little yeah over
[1940.98 → 1946.42] the non-s variant yeah so if something like that were to happen oh I guess they are saying iPhone 8
[1946.42 → 1952.26] but then they're saying 2017 device okay well they can't decide what they're talking rumours so maybe
[1952.98 → 1960.10] but I doubt it because the 27 excuse me the 2018 iPhone would be yeah that would be hold on a second
[1960.10 → 1967.38] that would be two years away okay maybe so we'll see I'm not good at time and math what was I talking
[1967.38 → 1973.30] about again uh we're now talking about Washington state gambling commission which has ordered valve to
[1973.30 → 1979.30] stop skin gambling via steam oh I wanted to talk about some of the tech in it though did you yeah
[1979.30 → 1984.50] ah so with most fingerprint sensors separation between the contact surface and the capacitive
[1984.50 → 1988.42] sensing array results in a blurring of the finger's electric field leading to degraded
[1988.42 → 1993.46] fingerprint image resolutions and degraded recognition accuracy apple's proposed implementation uses
[1993.46 → 1998.82] electrostatic lenses uh described as one or more patterned conductive layers so depending on the
[1998.82 → 2003.14] position relative voltage and shape the layers are able to shape or bend the electric field associated
[2003.14 → 2012.66] with the user's fingers which sounds really cool that was the reason I went to go move on I was just
[2012.66 → 2019.06] like okay all right did you post this already now it is all right I'm going to go ahead and screen share it
[2019.06 → 2023.78] you go ahead and tell us about this so I think it's pretty self-explanatory actually there is a huge
[2023.78 → 2030.58] amount of notes here um but I don't actually think there's a ton to say basically Washington state
[2031.54 → 2035.54] is deciding that at least to a certain degree valve is facilitating this
[2037.62 → 2043.38] intentionally or not they seem smart the gambling commission knows what's up yeah like it intentionally
[2043.38 → 2051.30] or not it is happening its their platform and much like you would have to take care of your land
[2052.50 → 2056.10] you they're going to have to take care of their platform yep I mean it's one of those things where
[2056.10 → 2062.98] there's the whole plausible deniability like oh gee yeah i I created this infrastructure for
[2063.70 → 2070.18] handling you know uh lottery tickets and I created these templates for lottery tickets and I created
[2070.18 → 2075.30] all these really fun things for people to buy lottery tickets about and I created a way that the
[2075.30 → 2080.90] money could change hands but like no I mean all my customers that are coming to me and buying all these
[2080.90 → 2084.82] supplies well I'm not responsible for what they're doing and yes that's an extreme example and that's not
[2084.82 → 2090.82] really fair, and it's not the same as what valve's doing but the reality of it is that gambling laws
[2090.82 → 2098.42] are serious for a reason and gambling laws especially as they pertain to miners are serious for a reason
[2098.42 → 2106.98] miners no offence to the miners who are watching okay you want to mine coal all day that's cool okay
[2106.98 → 2112.34] your face is dirty that's fine you know when you go have a shower that all comes off everyone's feeling
[2112.34 → 2118.66] good you're looking good just not what I'm talking about at all yeah but many of the miners that i
[2118.66 → 2127.38] have known and that I have met are stupid, and they are not ready to understand the risks that they're
[2127.38 → 2134.98] taking with gambling and the impact that that can have on their lives so a big part of the problem
[2134.98 → 2141.54] here is that valve has rules against stuff like bots and its user agreement, but it knowingly allows the
[2141.54 → 2147.38] bots that are handling all the gambling trading to continue that's a big part of the problem they're
[2147.38 → 2153.46] they're being like yeah you shouldn't be able to use bots except those bots that are trading things and
[2153.46 → 2159.38] indirectly make us lots of money yeah those are going to be completely fine um, and its like is completely
[2159.38 → 2162.34] knowledgeable about all these things and is letting it happen which is part of the problem
[2162.90 → 2169.22] it has been said if valve does not comply that they risk the seizure and forfeiture of property used to
[2169.22 → 2175.78] conduct these illegal activities forfeiture of its corporate charter as well as criminal charges so
[2175.78 → 2185.06] they just absolutely dropped the book cool like stop this immediately basically oh okay nope looks like
[2185.06 → 2190.58] uh looks like it looks like all the people who hate on our audience were right our audience is entirely
[2190.58 → 2197.06] made up of miners not all of them coal miners okay some of them gold miners okay and all those gold miners
[2197.06 → 2202.50] they're they're cancelling they're cancelling all the prime subscriptions used to be plumbers
[2203.22 → 2209.78] and are now miners and are now miners yes interesting yes yeah very cool a lot of them are carpenters now
[2209.78 → 2216.34] too oh yeah why is that uh because we have DIY desk pc that we just released yeah many of our viewers are
[2216.34 → 2221.94] also carpenters yes that are much better than you, I'm sure well they're all better than me but right
[2221.94 → 2227.06] probably most of them aren't better than my dad so he's the one who did it oh now there were some
[2227.06 → 2231.86] questionable things that we did do for the sake of saving a few bucks and stuff okay but like literally
[2231.86 → 2238.98] everyone that I know that makes things does that yes, so sometimes that's a reality yeah all right we
[2238.98 → 2245.38] don't all work in like boutique uh what is it called the like super fancy nerd uh word for
[2245.38 → 2257.06] handmade things yeah boutique I think no, no no, no no Etsy no craftsman no uh it's like this hipster word
[2258.10 → 2263.94] uh someone in chat is probably saying it I feel like it starts with a b but I'm not sure tell you
[2263.94 → 2272.42] what I'll monitor for that you talk about HoloLens okay yeah bespoke oh all right yeah see
[2272.42 → 2278.34] hipster word starts with a b kind of like that I mean could we turn the pretentious down to 11. Well
[2278.34 → 2283.70] that's what I'm saying yeah yeah anyway HoloLens I'm going to do a little demonstration if you
[2283.70 → 2290.34] can turn that screen so that I can see it this will help me a lot yeah yeah I want to show everyone something
[2290.34 → 2297.86] okay so this thing right here this camera this is your eyes you're wearing a HoloLens right now this is a
[2297.86 → 2303.14] it obviously this isn't reality I don't think they can hear you very well you better speak up can you
[2303.14 → 2309.54] talk to me okay this camera is your eyes this is your vision currently, and you are now wearing a
[2309.54 → 2314.50] HoloLens this is how this is going to work there is a video playing in the middle of the HoloLens
[2314.50 → 2318.90] and you can see the edges of it because it has colours going all the way to the end it does not have
[2318.90 → 2324.50] a transparent background in this video the video is about oh this can be really hard to do the video is
[2324.50 → 2328.58] oh god this is really hard to do uh is about that much of your vision
[2331.06 → 2339.14] is that cool do you enjoy that I enjoyed it is that I look like I enjoyed it is that a fantastic
[2339.14 → 2347.78] experience this is a is a question that I'm asking you was that good did you
[2347.78 → 2352.66] like that much of like no of course they didn't they hated everything about it yep they said it
[2352.66 → 2359.46] was trash it sucked anyway trash nope I was able to use HoloLens for like two and a half to three
[2359.46 → 2367.86] minutes Harambee in a weird demo in a side room that we weren't allowed to record now it's not fair
[2368.90 → 2373.70] they have other much cooler demos, and you're able to spend much more time with it, I talked to multiple
[2373.70 → 2378.82] people including Austin Evans and Severus who have tried it in the past and done very cool demos
[2378.82 → 2384.02] Severus said that playing minecraft on it was probably the best way to play minecraft which
[2384.02 → 2389.78] is a pretty big endorsement uh he also tried this really cool halo demo where he was walking around
[2389.78 → 2395.70] and then he looked out some windows and ended up being like a hanger bay cool demos cool stuff they
[2395.70 → 2401.86] had monitors set up, and it like put a screen on the monitor uh they had like big basically projector TV
[2401.86 → 2404.90] kind of deals on the walls really cool setups
[2407.62 → 2414.82] I did not have a good experience it was legitimately pretty terrible um there's one ring that wraps
[2414.82 → 2420.18] around your head that supports the weight of the entire thing it does not wrap above the top oh it
[2420.18 → 2425.78] only goes around, and you have to like crank it down so that it actually holds on right and then the lens
[2425.78 → 2430.82] itself is able to pivot on top of that ring, so there's like it punches into that ring and then pivots
[2430.82 → 2436.18] on top you have to like to clamp it onto your head not very comfortable um the nose bridge thing
[2436.82 → 2441.54] pretty much the best way to wear it as said by a Microsoft employee is to make sure the nose bridge
[2441.54 → 2448.82] thing doesn't touch your nose so all the weight is supported by it strapping to your skull okay
[2449.86 → 2454.98] not super great the headphone the lack of headphones and having speakers on it is actually pretty cool
[2454.98 → 2459.46] they're directional speakers shoots sound directly into your ears it's not super loud to everyone else in
[2459.46 → 2463.62] the room cool you can hear it, but it's not super loud it's comfortable because you don't have stuff
[2463.62 → 2468.18] in your ears then you can hear the people that you can see which actually kind of helps with it a
[2468.18 → 2475.22] little bit right when the actual screen area where it's playing something is on top of someone you can
[2475.22 → 2481.78] just barely see them oh okay which is actually pretty cool oh okay it's properly obscuring things that
[2481.78 → 2487.14] are behind the screen uh I didn't get to do the demo where they like to show an textured city just made out of
[2487.14 → 2491.62] wood, and then it like textures it and has like things happening in the city and stuff didn't get
[2491.62 → 2497.86] to do that didn't get to do like any of the cool demos but the main thing that I got to do was see
[2497.86 → 2505.38] the hardcore limitations of the headset okay well that's good that was uh that was time well spent
[2505.38 → 2510.42] them touring you and showing you that I also saw a bunch of other stuff which is going to be super cool and
[2510.42 → 2519.30] make videos about that but HoloLens in its current form in my opinion leaves me wanting so the question
[2519.30 → 2531.62] from twitch chat is do you have sand in your vagina yes okay well that settles it then yeah speaking of
[2531.62 → 2537.30] sand in our vaginas sponsors peripheral vision like if we were talking about that probably
[2538.02 → 2543.38] square space you could make a website about sand you could make a website about sand yes you could
[2543.38 → 2547.78] you could make a website about how you like the HoloLens you could make a website about why you don't
[2547.78 → 2553.70] like the HoloLens you could make a website people like you could make a website that they hate but no
[2553.70 → 2558.90] matter what kind of website you made it would look great because it would be using one of Squarespace's
[2558.90 → 2566.34] awesome templates that feature responsive design so they scale to any platform that all feature commerce so
[2566.34 → 2570.54] So you could sell things people like, or you could sell things they hate through your website.
[2571.00 → 2577.14] They've got their cover pages feature, their logo designer, and now everyone can publish content,
[2577.22 → 2580.84] whether it's content people like or content people hate, like the WAN show,
[2580.84 → 2586.30] in the Apple News format from their Squarespace blog module.
[2587.00 → 2592.68] Squarespace makes whatever the content you're building available to anyone
[2592.68 → 2606.66] so you don't look like some junior woodchucks organization that doesn't have a dedicated IT guy.
[2606.68 → 2610.70] As long as you've got some cool pictures that show who you are and what you're about,
[2610.92 → 2612.60] you can build a Squarespace site.
[2612.88 → 2617.08] It's easy, and you can start a trial with no credit card required in case you don't believe me
[2617.08 → 2619.10] because I can see why you wouldn't.
[2619.16 → 2620.70] I don't sound very credible right now.
[2620.88 → 2621.74] Should you be interested?
[2621.74 → 2622.92] You should.
[2623.12 → 2623.36] No!
[2623.58 → 2623.90] Oh!
[2630.78 → 2632.30] You were doing so good.
[2632.66 → 2634.70] You're on such a roll, and I screwed it all up.
[2634.70 → 2636.92] I tried to add a little bit, and I just broke it.
[2637.12 → 2643.30] Squarespace.com slash WAN, and make sure you use offer code WAN to get 10% off your first purchase.
[2644.18 → 2648.46] I do want to jump back to the previous topic real quick before we do the next advertisement thing.
[2649.92 → 2650.36] Really?
[2650.44 → 2651.24] We never do that.
[2651.24 → 2651.96] All right.
[2651.96 → 2655.02] I didn't have enough time to properly cover the HoloLens.
[2655.50 → 2655.90] You're a rebel.
[2655.90 → 2659.00] And eventually, hopefully, I will have enough time to properly cover the HoloLens,
[2659.06 → 2660.38] and then I will make a video about it.
[2661.16 → 2661.50] Really?
[2661.68 → 2663.62] You interrupted my sponsor reads for that.
[2663.80 → 2664.02] Yep.
[2665.02 → 2667.42] You just don't GF, do you?
[2668.14 → 2668.50] Nope.
[2668.50 → 2669.68] Okay.
[2669.68 → 2669.72] Okay.
[2669.72 → 2672.42] Dollar Shave Club!
[2672.42 → 2680.18] If you're not a member of Dollar Shave Club yet, join today, and you'll get your first month of razors for free!
[2680.18 → 2682.34] Not this kind of razors.
[2682.34 → 2685.06] We're talking about face razors.
[2685.06 → 2685.60] Yeah.
[2685.60 → 2688.08] I mean, you don't have to use them on your face.
[2688.16 → 2689.42] They could be armpit razors.
[2689.42 → 2690.62] They could be chest razors.
[2690.70 → 2691.78] They could be back razors.
[2691.88 → 2693.20] They could be buttock razors.
[2693.28 → 2694.36] They could be leg razors.
[2694.66 → 2699.80] They could even be feet razors if you are a hobbit, or you just have hairy feet.
[2699.88 → 2700.78] I have hairy feet.
[2700.88 → 2701.80] I'm not ashamed of it.
[2702.52 → 2704.74] But I don't shave my feet because I'm not ashamed of it.
[2704.92 → 2707.54] But you could shave your feet if you wanted to.
[2707.60 → 2708.18] Do you shave your feet?
[2708.28 → 2708.34] No.
[2708.34 → 2708.84] Are you putting up your feet?
[2708.84 → 2709.18] Oh, okay.
[2709.22 → 2710.66] I put up my hand because I agreed with you.
[2710.78 → 2712.24] Oh, because you agreed that you can shave your feet?
[2712.24 → 2713.66] It's kind of gross, but I just don't do it.
[2713.80 → 2714.04] Right.
[2714.18 → 2714.36] Yeah.
[2714.46 → 2716.16] Foot hair is just sort of nasty.
[2716.16 → 2717.52] Just don't look hair.
[2718.02 → 2718.88] That's why I wear socks.
[2719.24 → 2719.48] Yeah.
[2720.16 → 2720.92] Socks and sandals.
[2721.04 → 2721.36] Why?
[2721.64 → 2722.20] Hobbit feet.
[2722.20 → 2730.60] Anyway, once you try dollarshaveclub.com, you'll become a proud member like millions of others.
[2730.66 → 2731.98] They have millions of members.
[2732.10 → 2732.60] That's pretty cool.
[2732.80 → 2733.66] That's incredible.
[2733.90 → 2734.28] It is.
[2734.38 → 2740.28] They deliver amazing razors directly to your door, and it costs less than getting off your butt and going out to buy it yourself.
[2740.84 → 2744.54] Membership means you can afford to shave with a fresh blade anytime you want.
[2745.16 → 2748.74] And wow, all of these talking points are pretty much the same thing.
[2748.74 → 2750.68] You can afford to shave.
[2750.96 → 2752.36] You can get a first class shave.
[2752.90 → 2758.80] You can use the executive blade, which makes the blade glide gently for the smoothest shave ever.
[2760.14 → 2767.98] And they also have other products, including their Dr. Carver Shave Butter, their Aftershave, and their One Wipe Charlie's Peppermint Scented Butt Wipes for Men.
[2768.06 → 2771.22] So your butt could be clean of hair and clean of poo.
[2771.44 → 2771.58] Yeah.
[2771.58 → 2773.96] All with products made by Dollar Shave Club.
[2774.12 → 2774.22] Yeah.
[2774.44 → 2776.80] You could even put Aftershave on it if you're into that sort of thing.
[2776.92 → 2777.72] Then it would smell perfect.
[2777.82 → 2778.68] It would smell perfect.
[2778.84 → 2780.06] Like with the peppermint.
[2780.38 → 2780.62] Hopefully.
[2780.62 → 2783.06] Like Aura stack with the Aftershave.
[2785.64 → 2788.76] How close do you have to get for the effects to take hold?
[2790.56 → 2791.24] I don't know.
[2791.74 → 2792.28] Benchmark it.
[2792.62 → 2795.34] I'm sure people are upset about all of this, all this butt talk.
[2795.40 → 2796.08] But you know what I say?
[2796.20 → 2796.66] Loosen up.
[2796.66 → 2801.64] Anyway, head over to DollarShaveClub.com slash Linus and give them a try for free.
[2801.84 → 2803.10] And I'm fired.
[2805.40 → 2806.04] Okay.
[2806.40 → 2812.04] First topic after the sponsor break is going to be...
[2812.04 → 2817.60] This is actually in our rejected topics, but I really, really want to do it anyway because it's funny.
[2818.10 → 2819.60] Microsoft Banned 2.
[2819.72 → 2820.90] No longer being sold.
[2821.20 → 2822.70] No Banned 3 coming in 2016.
[2823.12 → 2824.88] It was rejected in our doc.
[2824.88 → 2825.24] Microsoft.
[2825.44 → 2826.26] Reason given.
[2828.22 → 2829.42] No one cares.
[2830.72 → 2831.16] Yep.
[2831.26 → 2832.42] That sounds about right.
[2832.80 → 2834.70] And there actually was one person who cared.
[2834.94 → 2836.04] Good bites on the forum.
[2836.36 → 2836.76] Good bites.
[2837.38 → 2838.26] We love you.
[2838.56 → 2840.34] You care about everything, Microsoft.
[2840.64 → 2841.74] And we love you for that.
[2841.94 → 2842.24] Okay.
[2842.42 → 2847.90] Like I said, I was at Microsoft and there are legitimately a number of things that they're doing that are cool.
[2847.90 → 2853.62] And I think a lot of that has been inspired by the new mentality that came along with their CEO.
[2853.94 → 2856.36] And there are also things like the band.
[2858.66 → 2859.72] Just move on.
[2859.86 → 2860.18] Okay.
[2860.26 → 2861.00] And that's what they're doing.
[2861.24 → 2862.30] And that's what we're going to do.
[2862.38 → 2865.24] So the original article here is from PCPurr.com.
[2865.32 → 2866.54] Are you dropping this in the Twitch chat?
[2866.68 → 2866.82] I can.
[2867.24 → 2867.56] What's up?
[2867.56 → 2868.32] That's okay.
[2868.38 → 2868.80] I got it.
[2868.82 → 2869.22] I got it.
[2869.22 → 2869.64] I got this.
[2869.64 → 2870.10] I got this.
[2870.16 → 2870.64] Boom!
[2871.44 → 2871.80] Let's go.
[2872.48 → 2873.24] How do you like that?
[2873.78 → 2875.44] Kaby Lake support is official.
[2875.62 → 2879.64] Asus releases UEFI updates for their LGA 1151 boards.
[2879.64 → 2883.62] Which means we should probably get a request in for Kaby Lake processors.
[2883.90 → 2893.42] Because I'm sure the engineering samples couldn't be that far away if Asus has already had them for long enough to build and validate BIOS support for them.
[2893.76 → 2893.88] Yes.
[2894.08 → 2897.60] So they have a table listing all models and UEFI versions.
[2898.24 → 2899.44] Let's go ahead and pull that up.
[2899.54 → 2900.52] You guys can check that out.
[2901.16 → 2902.98] Edgeup.asus.com.
[2904.30 → 2906.04] I can't find this.
[2906.26 → 2907.34] Where is this article?
[2907.72 → 2908.26] There we go.
[2908.26 → 2912.30] So basically all the D170s.
[2913.06 → 2916.84] And in fact there are 87 boards that will have support.
[2916.86 → 2925.22] H110, B150, H170, Q170, Z170, and C232 will all support Kaby Lake CPUs.
[2925.56 → 2926.10] Wonderful.
[2926.80 → 2929.26] So if you were just thinking to yourself, gee.
[2930.88 → 2931.92] I should buy a processor.
[2932.04 → 2934.20] I love the processor I just bought.
[2934.20 → 2938.62] Except that I wish it performed a little better and used a little less power.
[2939.00 → 2942.90] Things that you probably wouldn't notice if you had one that was compatible with that board.
[2942.90 → 2943.62] It depends.
[2944.12 → 2944.58] It depends.
[2944.86 → 2948.26] Some people, I thought this was like not a thing.
[2948.76 → 2962.42] Some people actually buy like halfway through a generation, and they'll buy like a base level Core i3 with the intention of like it's faster than their older system, but they don't have all the money for like a ball in Core i7 yet.
[2962.42 → 2968.48] So they actually buy themselves like nine months to flip that chip down the line because low-end chips don't lose value.
[2968.58 → 2969.12] Yeah, that's probably fine.
[2969.18 → 2970.00] Nearly the same way.
[2970.12 → 2973.76] Even if it loses, so let's say a $100 CPU loses 30% of its value.
[2973.88 → 2974.82] Ooh, you lost $30.
[2975.48 → 2978.92] Compared to a $300 CPU loses 30% of its value.
[2978.98 → 2979.62] Now you lost $90.
[2980.64 → 2983.18] And then what they'll do is they'll buy us upgrade, and they'll upgrade their CPU.
[2983.38 → 2984.14] That is a thing.
[2984.30 → 2985.02] That actually makes sense.
[2985.02 → 2986.64] So I was kind of being facetious there.
[2986.74 → 2988.42] There are valid upgrade paths.
[2988.42 → 2994.60] But then that would be an entirely new, like you were planning on buying an entirely new processor anyway already.
[2994.86 → 2995.30] Yes.
[2995.50 → 2997.44] So it still fits in the other category.
[2997.50 → 2997.80] Yes.
[3000.54 → 3005.02] Okay, so we've got benchmarks for the 7700K.
[3005.36 → 3007.62] Just how much, a little bit faster will it be?
[3008.14 → 3008.90] Approximately this.
[3008.90 → 3015.90] It's a benchmark from September 29th, and it claims to be run on a Z170XPSLI.
[3016.84 → 3018.90] It claims to be a Z77...
[3018.90 → 3019.90] Z7700K...
[3020.80 → 3021.32] Z7...
[3021.32 → 3022.90] I7 7700K...
[3022.90 → 3023.90] I7 7700K...
[3025.16 → 3025.52] Intel!
[3025.64 → 3026.24] Keep going, man.
[3026.34 → 3027.14] Get it together here!
[3027.22 → 3027.84] Keep going, man.
[3027.88 → 3031.28] At 4.2 gigahertz with four cores and eight threads and...
[3031.28 → 3033.92] Someone's going to remix that into a wrap or something.
[3035.08 → 3035.68] I7 7700K...
[3035.68 → 3036.38] I7 7...
[3036.38 → 3036.90] Z77...
[3036.90 → 3037.54] Z77...
[3037.54 → 3038.08] I7 7...
[3038.08 → 3038.64] Z77...
[3038.64 → 3039.16] 700...
[3039.16 → 3039.90] I7 7700K...
[3039.90 → 3040.90] All right.
[3040.90 → 3041.30] I7 7700K...
[3041.30 → 3043.38] Okay, so there's your performances.
[3044.02 → 3046.90] You can go look at them on browser.primatelabs.com.
[3048.40 → 3048.80] Enjoy.
[3050.50 → 3051.02] All right.
[3051.04 → 3052.58] That should be in a proper script.
[3052.86 → 3054.84] Okay, so there's your performances.
[3057.82 → 3059.90] Well, if we did one-minute reviews...
[3060.90 → 3061.24] Yeah, yeah.
[3061.30 → 3065.14] Then it's like, okay, it fits in this motherboard.
[3065.32 → 3066.64] Okay, it costs this much.
[3066.64 → 3067.90] Okay, there's the performance.
[3068.34 → 3069.36] See you next time.
[3069.48 → 3069.96] Yeah.
[3070.66 → 3071.42] Oh, man.
[3072.00 → 3077.44] Capcom Street Fighter V installs a hidden rootkit on your PC.
[3079.12 → 3080.42] Was, was.
[3081.42 → 3086.58] We are in the process of rolling back the security measures added to the PC version of Street Fighter V.
[3086.58 → 3092.84] After the rollback process to the PC version, all new content from the September update will still be available to players.
[3092.84 → 3098.94] We apologize for the inconvenience, and we'll have an update on the time frame for the PC rollback solution soon.
[3100.56 → 3101.12] Okay.
[3101.98 → 3106.22] On the subject of crap ports, where is this?
[3106.26 → 3106.78] Mafia!
[3107.04 → 3109.76] This was originally posted by Steve Wazowski on the forum.
[3110.68 → 3111.24] Wazowski.
[3111.80 → 3112.58] The Grabber.
[3113.14 → 3113.58] Oh, my.
[3113.78 → 3114.26] Wazowski.
[3114.68 → 3115.34] Oh, jeez.
[3115.98 → 3117.72] I don't know if you want to be known as the Grabber.
[3117.94 → 3118.64] The Grabber.
[3119.50 → 3120.62] Depends on what you're grabbing.
[3120.74 → 3121.08] I don't know.
[3121.48 → 3121.92] Yeah.
[3121.92 → 3129.04] You could be grabbing orphans out of burning buildings in a totally non-sexually inappropriate way.
[3129.78 → 3130.70] Could be interpreted in a weird way.
[3130.70 → 3133.62] No, you're not taking advantage of their situation.
[3133.82 → 3135.92] You're just removing them from the fire.
[3137.04 → 3137.34] Okay.
[3137.52 → 3138.64] And they don't owe you anything.
[3139.82 → 3141.20] That shouldn't matter.
[3144.52 → 3149.16] Mafia 3 runs at 30 FPS on the PC.
[3149.16 → 3153.58] But an after-launch patch is in the works.
[3154.08 → 3155.12] Oh, my God.
[3156.28 → 3156.64] Okay.
[3156.82 → 3159.70] Now, this is one of those things where I can look at it and I can go, okay.
[3159.90 → 3164.94] So, you're at least aware of the issue, which is better than, like...
[3164.94 → 3166.20] Ignoring it, I guess?
[3166.20 → 3166.56] Yeah.
[3166.56 → 3171.46] Better than not even understanding that 30 frames per second is dumb.
[3171.68 → 3172.88] Oh, okay.
[3172.94 → 3176.34] To put in some context, I recently made that video with the C922.
[3176.40 → 3177.28] Did you just say context?
[3178.62 → 3179.18] Maybe.
[3179.18 → 3179.26] Maybe.
[3180.30 → 3183.46] So, I plugged it in last night before streaming.
[3183.84 → 3186.22] And it was running at 30 FPS.
[3186.30 → 3187.58] Just talking to my BF in jail.
[3189.38 → 3190.38] It's getting steamy.
[3191.78 → 3192.42] Don't look.
[3192.96 → 3193.68] Oh, jeez.
[3194.08 → 3197.58] I couldn't figure out why it looked so bad.
[3198.56 → 3201.62] I was like, I just made a video about this.
[3201.86 → 3203.10] It better not look this bad.
[3203.24 → 3203.94] What's happening?
[3204.46 → 3207.02] And then I figured out that it was running at 30 FPS.
[3207.34 → 3209.20] And my brain was expecting 60 FPS.
[3209.54 → 3209.80] Right.
[3209.86 → 3213.04] So, I went in and, like, manually changed the number to 60 so that it actually worked.
[3213.30 → 3214.60] And it looked infinitely better.
[3214.60 → 3217.66] And I don't think I've actually felt that much of a change before.
[3218.02 → 3221.54] Except for when I was all excited about my new 60 FPS thing.
[3221.84 → 3222.76] And then I was like, why is this?
[3222.82 → 3225.14] I didn't even immediately figure out that it was a frame rate issue.
[3225.26 → 3226.46] I was just like, it looks like poo.
[3226.46 → 3227.88] And I don't know why.
[3228.14 → 3228.80] And then it fixed.
[3228.94 → 3235.36] So, they have a patch running at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames per second options in the video menu.
[3235.60 → 3237.88] Which, again, is ridiculous.
[3238.20 → 3242.20] Because they could just have V-Sync and not V-Sync.
[3242.20 → 3248.22] Like, every other game in the last, like, 20 years?
[3250.10 → 3250.90] It's been a while.
[3251.12 → 3252.48] And I don't mean every other game.
[3252.56 → 3255.64] I mean every other proper game in the last 20 years.
[3255.76 → 3256.08] Rest!
[3256.08 → 3259.90] It sucks too because I was kind of excited to play.
[3260.06 → 3262.22] And now I'm probably just going to wait until they update.
[3262.42 → 3268.22] But, like, it's just frustrating because it's not completely about this one thing that's missing that's garbage.
[3268.64 → 3276.14] It's about that being a strong indication of a very shoddy last minute PC port.
[3276.14 → 3280.04] And if you remember my DX12 and Vulcan video that you probably should have watched.
[3280.12 → 3282.28] And if you didn't, you should go back and watch it anyway because it's awesome.
[3282.28 → 3290.92] There's a bit in there about how DX12 and Vulcan is going to be very developer heavy in terms of things being good.
[3290.98 → 3292.12] Alright, it's wonderful.
[3292.12 → 3294.84] Um, so, yeah.
[3295.10 → 3296.22] This worries me a lot.
[3296.22 → 3298.68] I brought up, like, developers being kind of poo.
[3298.92 → 3300.66] And I remember a lot of comments being like,
[3300.74 → 3302.74] Eh, they get too much hate.
[3303.24 → 3304.26] They're going to do fine.
[3304.30 → 3305.18] It's going to be awesome.
[3305.54 → 3306.70] There were a few of those comments.
[3307.14 → 3308.42] No, you're wrong.
[3309.08 → 3313.80] Stuff like this is going to continue to happen, and it's going to bleed into more things.
[3313.80 → 3318.44] Because there will be more availability for ignorance and failure with DX12 and Vulcan.
[3319.52 → 3322.20] So, I have an impromptu news topic.
[3323.24 → 3332.86] Um, YouTube apparently has, like, find singles in your area ads now?
[3333.76 → 3334.56] I don't know.
[3334.56 → 3337.30] There was a much racier one before I reloaded the page.
[3341.98 → 3342.42] Nope.
[3342.64 → 3343.60] Now it's an ad for...
[3343.60 → 3344.00] Keep going.
[3344.18 → 3344.78] That, yeah.
[3344.88 → 3345.42] Let's just keep going.
[3345.42 → 3347.34] Because that's an ad for what's also been added in the video.
[3349.24 → 3349.48] Nope.
[3349.54 → 3349.78] Nope.
[3350.24 → 3351.24] And that's also in French.
[3351.72 → 3352.08] Yeah.
[3352.46 → 3353.24] Isn't that bizarre?
[3353.84 → 3355.22] I'm not even using a VPN.
[3356.44 → 3357.40] The mini...
[3357.40 → 3358.52] I don't think...
[3358.52 → 3360.92] I don't think Google knows what I care about.
[3361.58 → 3362.48] No, probably not.
[3362.60 → 3363.70] To be perfectly honest.
[3363.98 → 3365.60] Probably because you look at so many different things.
[3366.58 → 3367.56] It's not doing it.
[3367.78 → 3368.22] Come on.
[3369.82 → 3371.56] Show the internet the racy ad, Google.
[3371.56 → 3371.92] Yeah.
[3371.92 → 3373.78] It knows it's being watched now.
[3373.84 → 3374.48] It's like, oh, dang.
[3375.50 → 3375.76] See?
[3376.00 → 3376.44] Wow.
[3376.80 → 3377.20] Right?
[3377.82 → 3379.08] That's brutal.
[3379.24 → 3380.06] What is this?
[3380.18 → 3381.30] Can you read the name, too?
[3381.90 → 3382.26] Yeah.
[3382.62 → 3383.02] Look at this.
[3383.02 → 3383.50] Holy...
[3383.50 → 3384.42] What the hell?
[3384.96 → 3387.34] Like, what is this ad for?
[3388.24 → 3389.02] I mean, I'm interested.
[3389.46 → 3389.80] But...
[3389.80 → 3391.56] I mean, who wouldn't be?
[3391.78 → 3392.28] That's...
[3392.28 → 3393.20] That's like...
[3393.20 → 3394.12] I've never seen an ad.
[3394.22 → 3396.30] That's like shoddy website level stuff.
[3396.34 → 3396.50] Yeah.
[3396.56 → 3398.98] That's like some sketchy stuff right there.
[3399.10 → 3399.40] Yeah.
[3400.56 → 3401.16] Crazy, eh?
[3401.34 → 3401.58] Sorry.
[3401.64 → 3405.10] I was only bringing this up because I was going to bring up your DX12 and Vulcan video and
[3405.10 → 3405.68] I got distracted.
[3405.68 → 3406.46] Yeah, no, it's fine.
[3408.54 → 3408.90] Um...
[3408.90 → 3413.80] I had people complaining to me on Twitter about that video because they're like, I don't
[3413.80 → 3414.06] care.
[3414.18 → 3414.88] It's too technical.
[3416.14 → 3418.52] And then I had to like to sit down for a second and be like, oh.
[3420.10 → 3420.50] Okay.
[3420.50 → 3420.62] Okay.
[3422.26 → 3430.02] I spent as much time as I could and Ed spent a lot of time making like cool graphics and
[3430.02 → 3430.62] breaking it down.
[3430.74 → 3431.76] Did your soul die a little?
[3431.84 → 3432.18] It did.
[3432.26 → 3432.56] Okay.
[3432.78 → 3433.52] That was painful.
[3433.78 → 3434.24] All right.
[3434.40 → 3436.60] Oculus Rift has a new minimum spec.
[3436.70 → 3439.16] This was posted on the forum by Mr. Troll.
[3439.68 → 3447.06] Basically, what they're saying is now you can have a $499 entry level PC that can run
[3447.06 → 3447.56] VR.
[3448.20 → 3450.14] PC VR is more affordable than ever.
[3450.14 → 3451.68] This is just nonsense.
[3451.84 → 3457.22] All this means is that they're not selling enough headsets right now and their original
[3457.22 → 3461.14] specs were stupid because most of the games...
[3461.14 → 3467.96] In fact, every game I've tried does not push your graphics card that hard.
[3469.30 → 3472.80] Because like, like, like, uh, um, uh, hollow point.
[3473.36 → 3475.64] There's a reason that the dude...
[3475.64 → 3475.92] That's nice.
[3475.92 → 3476.64] The dude...
[3476.64 → 3477.36] Yeah, I know.
[3477.44 → 3478.16] Every VR game.
[3478.60 → 3484.60] Uh, there's a reason that the dudes walking towards you are like static objects that like
[3484.60 → 3489.04] aren't made of a lot of polygons and are barely animated unless they're like really close to
[3489.04 → 3489.22] you.
[3489.22 → 3493.04] And the room is just like, like flat walls and like a pretty small room.
[3493.08 → 3497.78] Like they're trying to avoid stratification.
[3497.78 → 3504.46] Like they pretty much want anyone with a gaming rig and a VR headset to be able to play the
[3504.46 → 3504.76] game.
[3504.92 → 3510.22] So basically they're just coming down, and they're saying like, okay, we better get realistic
[3510.22 → 3516.50] about this because we're scaring people off with our $600, $700 piece of hardware peripheral
[3516.50 → 3517.78] for...
[3517.78 → 3519.32] I mean more if you had the touch controllers.
[3519.60 → 3519.80] Yep.
[3520.38 → 3521.00] 200 bucks.
[3521.00 → 3523.36] And telling them that they also need a $1,000 computer.
[3524.00 → 3529.00] So I guess we better, we better just, you know, make Intel mad and not say that everyone
[3529.00 → 3534.38] needs an i5 or an i7 for gaming because an i360 100, like let's look up.
[3534.46 → 3535.44] What is an i360 100?
[3535.74 → 3536.24] I'll do that one.
[3536.44 → 3540.84] So yet another thing that sucks about videos going on Vessel and being delayed before going
[3540.84 → 3548.04] on Vessel is my what is wrong with VR thing, uh, was written before that keynote.
[3548.64 → 3550.36] So there you go.
[3550.36 → 3557.56] So the i7-6100 or i360 100 runs at 3.7 gigahertz with two cores and four threads.
[3558.06 → 3565.26] I can tell you right now that every VR game will run just fine on that because they do
[3565.26 → 3571.88] not have a ton of AI or some of the other things that are very, very demanding on the
[3571.88 → 3572.18] CPU.
[3572.38 → 3573.50] Not every VR application.
[3573.84 → 3574.12] No.
[3574.90 → 3576.66] But every game I've played then.
[3576.82 → 3577.90] Every game that I have played.
[3578.12 → 3578.30] Yeah.
[3578.30 → 3579.84] Not every VR application.
[3580.00 → 3589.20] I know of one right now that is like a huge problem to run on like Extreme Edition and
[3589.20 → 3591.04] multiple Titan XPs.
[3591.04 → 3597.28] So basically they're saying now anything from an NVIDIA 960 or greater is considered VR ready.
[3597.74 → 3604.26] And this is a reduction from the previous GTX 970 or AMD 290 or greater or equivalent.
[3604.26 → 3609.38] I would be interested if someone has a rig that is like, and is in the chat right now that
[3609.38 → 3611.04] is exactly on that spec line.
[3611.74 → 3612.06] Yeah.
[3612.06 → 3614.58] Like an i360 100 and whatever.
[3614.58 → 3620.56] If you have access to a rift, whether you own it or you know someone who owns it, try it
[3620.56 → 3621.10] out on your rig.
[3621.56 → 3622.30] Let me know.
[3622.70 → 3628.80] Because there's some funky stuff that happens in the background with VR where quality things
[3628.80 → 3629.46] are dynamic.
[3629.70 → 3631.66] So you could have dynamic quality.
[3631.66 → 3639.02] And your results for the dynamic quality could be not great.
[3639.52 → 3642.08] And I'm a little bit worried that it might fall below 90.
[3642.26 → 3643.44] So try that.
[3643.76 → 3644.42] Report back.
[3644.54 → 3645.14] Hit me up on Twitter.
[3645.14 → 3648.52] This was posted by Deliciouser, I guess.
[3649.34 → 3657.52] Windows 10 now actually losing market share.
[3657.64 → 3660.74] The original article is from betanews.com.
[3661.16 → 3668.46] According to figures from NetMarketShare, Windows 10 went from 22.99% globally to 22.53%.
[3668.46 → 3670.50] These figures measure usage.
[3670.50 → 3677.28] So only PCs that are actually being used rather than just like PCs with it installed count
[3677.28 → 3677.88] towards it.
[3678.38 → 3683.44] The decrease is still surprising as Windows 8 and 8 point whatever only saw a decline
[3683.44 → 3685.70] after multiple months of diminishing growth.
[3686.18 → 3691.98] Windows 7 actually grew last month by 1% from 47.25 to 48.27.
[3692.12 → 3692.92] I'm not even that surprised.
[3693.06 → 3698.30] And a lot of it has to do with why my test next door just might actually be impossible.
[3698.30 → 3702.70] So we've talked about the browser test that I've been trying to run for a little while.
[3704.46 → 3708.06] I was streaming last night, just to not bring that up again.
[3709.24 → 3711.40] And CPU started throttling like crazy.
[3711.94 → 3716.46] I was playing something that I had done in that exact same scenario with the exact same
[3716.46 → 3720.52] software running on my computer, doing the exact same things literally the day before
[3720.52 → 3722.26] and everything was fine.
[3722.40 → 3724.34] So I was trying to figure out why that was happening.
[3724.34 → 3729.42] There was certain Windows services that are like moderately core services.
[3729.62 → 3732.92] Like one of them had to do with audio and I have audio enhancements disabled.
[3733.12 → 3734.20] So it's not that thing.
[3734.30 → 3736.66] I've already dealt with that major performance problem.
[3736.94 → 3739.78] One of them was some, I don't even remember what.
[3740.02 → 3741.20] The other one was the audio thing.
[3741.36 → 3741.44] Yeah.
[3741.54 → 3742.70] I killed both of those.
[3742.78 → 3748.40] Instead of being CPU pinned and like resulting in, I think it was like 16 FPS on the final stream.
[3748.58 → 3752.34] My computer was running fine, but the stream out to everyone else was at like 16 FPS.
[3752.34 → 3760.58] I went down to 60% CPU utilization from being completely peaked just from killing two bullshit
[3760.58 → 3763.30] Windows things that did not need to run at that point in time.
[3763.56 → 3763.90] Interesting.
[3765.10 → 3770.60] Windows is this, Windows 10 is this crazy dynamic performance hog that will just every once
[3770.60 → 3773.70] in a while just absolutely spike your CPU as hard as it can.
[3773.86 → 3774.16] Right.
[3774.16 → 3781.04] And I just like, I can't understand how it doesn't realize that your CPU is now at 100% and doesn't pull back.
[3781.52 → 3781.62] Right.
[3781.62 → 3783.16] Because it's an automated background process.
[3783.28 → 3784.60] It should not crush your computer.
[3785.14 → 3785.48] Yeah.
[3787.98 → 3788.92] Absolutely garbage.
[3789.34 → 3794.16] So like I actually know a fair amount of streamers that are going back to or are staying on Windows 7
[3794.16 → 3796.70] because there's just too many dynamic problems.
[3796.70 → 3809.56] Speaking of problems, Blizzard has a problem with something that was allegedly said during an interview
[3809.56 → 3811.58] with their game director, Tom Chilton.
[3812.10 → 3821.34] To be fair, I do believe this is the same person who said you think you do, but you don't in terms of Warcraft Classic.
[3821.34 → 3827.78] So this guy's a little, uh, he's a quotable person who runs his mouth sometimes.
[3827.86 → 3828.08] Okay.
[3828.64 → 3835.34] So Polish magazine Pixel claims that Tom Chilton of Blizzard told them that the current subscriber count is around 10.1 million.
[3836.06 → 3840.88] WoW's peak was at around 12 million players and at the end of 2015 it was at 5.5 million
[3840.88 → 3843.98] at which point Blizzard stopped publicly reporting subscriber numbers.
[3844.70 → 3849.56] They have since issued a statement denying that Tom Chilton provided the 10.1 million subscriber number to the magazine.
[3849.56 → 3854.08] This was a misquote or some kind of misunderstanding on the part of the journalist.
[3854.54 → 3858.00] Our policy for almost a year now is that we do not talk about subscriber numbers
[3858.00 → 3860.84] and Tom did not do that with this publication.
[3861.12 → 3861.70] Oh, wow.
[3863.28 → 3863.76] What?
[3863.90 → 3865.62] Yeah, they're going straight after the journalist.
[3865.76 → 3866.50] They're just blaming them.
[3866.72 → 3867.08] Holy crap.
[3867.24 → 3867.46] Yeah.
[3869.36 → 3869.80] Okay.
[3870.58 → 3871.80] Unless, hmm.
[3873.02 → 3875.08] That journalist is getting a lot of views from this.
[3876.34 → 3876.78] Yeah.
[3877.00 → 3877.82] So there's that.
[3877.82 → 3881.14] I would be very surprised if it's back up at 10 million.
[3881.30 → 3883.66] My reasoning for this, I was talking to Nick about this earlier.
[3883.76 → 3884.80] Like who do you know who's playing?
[3885.54 → 3886.54] Yeah, for one.
[3888.64 → 3889.30] Actually, okay.
[3889.36 → 3890.28] I do know a couple of people.
[3890.62 → 3894.18] But they were playing before anyway and were going to play this anyway.
[3894.54 → 3896.60] Every time that a new expansion comes out, there's a spike.
[3897.02 → 3897.82] That's just going to happen.
[3897.88 → 3898.62] It's not very surprising.
[3898.62 → 3905.70] But the last time WoW was running at 10 million subscribers, it was extremely commonly talked
[3905.70 → 3905.96] about.
[3906.72 → 3907.58] Huge deal.
[3907.80 → 3908.52] Do you remember those days?
[3909.12 → 3910.12] Everyone was talking about WoW.
[3910.28 → 3910.42] Yep.
[3910.60 → 3913.08] Wasn't that when like the South Park episode came out about WoW?
[3913.28 → 3914.38] Yeah, that was a long time ago.
[3914.44 → 3918.30] Like 10 million subscribers was a huge deal for World of Warcraft to be pulling.
[3918.30 → 3922.46] If they're doing that again, awkwardly silent.
[3923.42 → 3924.62] Don't know what's going on.
[3925.32 → 3926.50] Not a ton of talk about it.
[3926.94 → 3927.48] All right.
[3927.58 → 3929.60] Things that we do want to talk about, though.
[3929.70 → 3930.80] This is pretty interesting.
[3930.80 → 3939.24] Spotify was caught serving malware-infested ads to its users, which actually ties in pretty
[3939.24 → 3943.12] well to my sketchy YouTube ad topic that I came up with.
[3943.18 → 3943.72] Yeah, it does.
[3944.02 → 3944.50] Spontaneously.
[3944.74 → 3944.88] Yeah.
[3944.92 → 3949.48] This was posted by Hey Yo on the forum, and the original article here is from 9to5Mac.
[3949.48 → 3954.12] Now, they claim to have successfully identified and eliminated the source of the problem,
[3954.68 → 3960.48] but they should have, at their scale, I kind of think they should have identified that
[3960.48 → 3961.50] before it happened.
[3962.68 → 3964.60] They should probably have a vetting process.
[3965.18 → 3967.68] With that, yes, they should have a vetting process.
[3968.16 → 3973.48] This was originally reported to be occurring on Windows 10, but the issue persists in other
[3973.48 → 3976.52] operating systems, including Ubuntu and macOS.
[3976.52 → 3981.68] Spotify has said they are currently looking into the issue, and they dealt with a similar
[3981.68 → 3982.80] thing back in 2011.
[3983.80 → 3987.66] A few users have experienced a problem with questionable website pop-ups
[3987.66 → 3991.72] in their default browsers as a result of an isolated issue with an ad on our free tier.
[3992.36 → 3995.78] We have now identified the source of the problem and encourage all of our users to pay for their
[3995.78 → 3996.46] freaking music.
[3996.58 → 3997.04] No, I'm just kidding.
[3997.10 → 3997.66] That's not the quote.
[3998.14 → 4001.02] We have now identified the source of the problem and have it shut down.
[4001.10 → 4002.54] We will continue to monitor the situation.
[4003.30 → 4005.60] Imgur, or Imgur, or whoever you want to say that.
[4005.60 → 4006.40] I think it's Imgur.
[4006.62 → 4007.10] Imgur?
[4007.22 → 4007.68] I think so.
[4008.30 → 4008.68] Imgur?
[4008.94 → 4009.40] I think so.
[4009.68 → 4012.44] I've always said Imgur, but that's definitely not it.
[4012.46 → 4013.10] I think it's Imgur.
[4013.28 → 4013.72] Yeah, probably.
[4014.00 → 4022.98] Imgur has had kind of sketchy ad problems recently as well, along with autoplaying audio-enabled
[4022.98 → 4027.00] videos, which is the reason why people install AdBlock.
[4027.00 → 4029.76] So if you could stop, that'd be pretty cool.
[4029.92 → 4030.32] It'd be great.
[4031.22 → 4032.86] Videocards.com.
[4033.34 → 4041.30] The first pictures of the yet unannounced GTX 1050 Ti have appeared online.
[4041.98 → 4042.32] Cool.
[4042.32 → 4044.56] It is confirmed, quote unquote.
[4044.74 → 4046.16] I mean, that is okay.
[4046.52 → 4046.90] Sure.
[4047.18 → 4050.86] To feature the GP 107 GPU.
[4051.14 → 4058.68] So this is what would have years ago been like not a GTX card.
[4058.80 → 4059.42] You posted it right.
[4059.42 → 4060.52] And not a Ti.
[4060.54 → 4061.18] No, I didn't, actually.
[4061.18 → 4061.52] Okay, good.
[4061.52 → 4061.66] Thank you.
[4061.94 → 4062.92] Not a Ti.
[4063.24 → 4069.94] This would have been like an 8400 GS or whatever.
[4070.82 → 4075.84] Actually, I don't know if it's quite that small in terms of die size, but the whole thing
[4075.84 → 4081.36] NVIDIA has done where they've taken their second chip, and they've positioned that as their
[4081.36 → 4086.22] top chip was tightened in like sort of like this weird stratosphere sort of area.
[4086.42 → 4090.66] And then their second chip and positioned as their third and their third and positioned
[4090.66 → 4093.42] it as their second, wait, fourth and whatever.
[4093.50 → 4100.22] The point is that we're getting smaller chips positioned as though they are like more expensive
[4100.22 → 4103.20] parts when normally we'd have gotten more silicone for our dollar.
[4105.64 → 4107.80] Sorry, I'm just, I'm thinking of that YouTube ad.
[4108.50 → 4111.26] How much silicone will I get for my dollar here?
[4111.36 → 4112.36] Oh God.
[4113.58 → 4116.40] I can't even believe that to be completely honest.
[4116.76 → 4117.42] Yeah, that's bizarre.
[4117.72 → 4117.92] Man.
[4118.60 → 4122.08] Anyway, the sticker placed on the other side of the PCB.
[4122.56 → 4122.70] Yeah.
[4123.84 → 4129.76] Confirmed that the 1050 Ti will feature four gigs of GDDR5 memory, and they figure it should
[4129.76 → 4131.08] take place in about two weeks.
[4131.64 → 4132.56] So, oh, okay.
[4132.66 → 4135.56] Well, I had not heard anything about that.
[4136.26 → 4139.14] So that's good, I guess.
[4139.14 → 4142.14] I mean, looking at how Titan XP happened.
[4143.36 → 4143.68] Yeah.
[4144.32 → 4144.76] Maybe.
[4145.04 → 4146.36] Surprise me anymore at this point.
[4146.60 → 4147.58] But I.
[4147.72 → 4148.14] Six pin.
[4149.84 → 4150.70] Six pin power.
[4151.16 → 4151.40] Wow.
[4151.46 → 4152.74] That is an empty PCB.
[4153.00 → 4153.96] I was just going to say that.
[4153.96 → 4158.00] When I first looked, I thought it was unfinished, but I don't think so anymore.
[4158.40 → 4158.80] Wow.
[4159.76 → 4162.94] That is a that is one naked, naked card.
[4163.08 → 4163.66] Very bare.
[4164.10 → 4168.26] You know how mad Mike, or I almost just said Microsoft, uh, NVIDIA is going to be?
[4169.14 → 4170.92] They were very pissed.
[4171.10 → 4175.36] Last time there was, uh, the picture releases of, was it the shroud of something?
[4176.06 → 4176.82] Oh, I don't remember.
[4177.08 → 4180.62] I think it was the, the first pictures of the shroud that showed the new angular design.
[4180.68 → 4181.22] Uh, uh-huh.
[4181.30 → 4182.20] Oh, they were mad.
[4182.26 → 4185.66] And like, people were fired that worked at the factory and all this kind of stuff.
[4185.74 → 4186.04] Wow.
[4186.04 → 4187.80] And there are pictures of this one out too.
[4187.84 → 4188.46] This is worse.
[4188.62 → 4189.70] I mean, a PCB with.
[4189.70 → 4192.88] The chip, like, oh man.
[4193.12 → 4193.74] Wrecked, son.
[4194.04 → 4194.34] Yeah.
[4194.68 → 4195.58] People are getting fired.
[4195.72 → 4202.02] Speaking of people getting fired, if your job, this was posted by M. Suribachi on the
[4202.02 → 4210.22] forum, if your job was to, uh, take money or even accept free or discounted products
[4210.22 → 4214.06] and review them on Amazon, that is no longer a job.
[4214.06 → 4220.64] Amazon is banning reviews based on free or discounted products except
[4220.64 → 4226.14] books and reviews from the Amazon Vine program, which Amazon conveniently makes money on, by
[4226.14 → 4226.44] the way.
[4226.72 → 4232.62] You have to pay Amazon to submit your product for Vine in addition to providing the free
[4232.62 → 4232.94] product.
[4233.30 → 4238.10] So, let's not pretend this is all about the integrity of reviews on Amazon.com.
[4238.12 → 4238.28] Yeah.
[4238.44 → 4241.96] Although, I do believe that it is a significant factor.
[4242.44 → 4243.62] I don't think it's, I don't think it's going to help at all.
[4243.62 → 4248.78] There's, there's far too many completely fake reviews that aren't claiming that they got
[4248.78 → 4251.42] the product for free that it's just not going to matter.
[4252.20 → 4252.88] Let's see.
[4253.46 → 4254.14] Let's see.
[4254.34 → 4254.66] Sure.
[4255.08 → 4256.38] So, here we go.
[4256.50 → 4257.36] Amazon had always.
[4257.60 → 4259.24] Well, I met, okay, I met that dude at CES.
[4260.34 → 4260.78] Who?
[4260.94 → 4261.96] Who, like, does that.
[4262.40 → 4264.08] Remember we talked about that?
[4264.08 → 4264.92] I don't remember.
[4264.92 → 4271.84] I, like, met a guy at CES, who will, like, meet with people, and then they'll be like,
[4271.90 → 4273.10] yeah, we want Amazon reviews.
[4273.22 → 4274.74] And he'll be like, I can get you a 50.
[4275.70 → 4278.36] And he, like, serves out large numbers of Amazon reviews.
[4279.20 → 4280.18] I was like, wow.
[4281.44 → 4282.42] You're a dick.
[4282.42 → 4284.08] And he's like, yep.
[4284.50 → 4287.24] Like, one of those guys that just doesn't care and makes cash off of it.
[4287.36 → 4287.56] Huh.
[4287.98 → 4288.24] Yeah.
[4288.82 → 4289.16] Cool.
[4289.54 → 4291.50] Like, I don't think it's going to change anything.
[4291.66 → 4294.32] If that guy's still around, I don't think shit's changing.
[4295.30 → 4299.62] So, Amazon has always allowed businesses to offer products or discounts on products to
[4299.62 → 4303.80] customers in exchange for a review on their site, provided that this affiliation was disclosed
[4303.80 → 4304.40] in the text.
[4304.94 → 4310.94] A recent study of over 7 million reviews by Review Meta found that incentivized reviews,
[4311.22 → 4316.72] those with some kind of disclaimer text, were rated 0.38 stars higher than non-incentivized
[4316.72 → 4317.76] reviews overall.
[4318.02 → 4322.00] And while that seems like a small change, that doesn't seem small at all to me, that could
[4322.00 → 4326.92] potentially boost a product from the 54th percentile to the 94th percentile.
[4327.00 → 4332.16] And when we talk percentile, we talk about where it would fall in terms of how close to
[4332.16 → 4336.20] the top of the pile it would be if you would sort by review scores.
[4336.94 → 4340.90] So, this could, in some cases, bring a product from average to top-rated.
[4341.56 → 4346.82] The study also found that incentivized reviewers were 12 times less likely to provide a one-star
[4346.82 → 4351.12] rating and nearly four times less likely to leave a critical review.
[4352.00 → 4353.44] So, there you have it.
[4354.10 → 4359.68] Amazon reviews continue to be a pretty good source for me to get information on stuff that
[4359.68 → 4360.18] I'm buying.
[4361.00 → 4362.12] Or have been, sorry.
[4362.26 → 4363.66] And I guess they will continue to be.
[4364.52 → 4365.28] So, that's cool.
[4368.16 → 4368.56] Sharp.
[4369.06 → 4376.04] I guess we're kind of getting into some rapid fire stuff right close to the end of the video
[4376.04 → 4376.38] here.
[4376.70 → 4377.14] The video?
[4377.28 → 4377.86] The stream?
[4378.06 → 4378.66] Sorry, I'm tired.
[4379.46 → 4380.50] It's kind of been a long week.
[4380.50 → 4382.58] I definitely won't be here next week, by the way.
[4382.64 → 4383.44] I keep saying that.
[4383.92 → 4385.60] But I definitely won't be here next week.
[4386.34 → 4391.88] If my wife goes any further past the due date than probably Monday, then it's probably
[4391.88 → 4399.26] going to be medicinal, like IV-inducing the body to eject the small creature inside.
[4400.66 → 4405.80] So, Sharp showed off an Igbo 27-inch 8K 120Hz display.
[4405.80 → 4406.22] Yeah.
[4409.10 → 4409.50] Yeah.
[4409.88 → 4415.80] So, that would be pretty much the be-all and end-all of what I would be interested in owning.
[4416.52 → 4418.98] In fact, I don't even know if I need 8K at that point.
[4419.32 → 4420.50] 4K 120Hz.
[4420.84 → 4421.78] We're getting pretty close.
[4421.84 → 4423.40] Maybe like 4K 240Hz.
[4423.48 → 4423.68] Anyway.
[4424.20 → 4424.40] Okay.
[4424.50 → 4425.20] Well, I can dream.
[4426.00 → 4426.74] Check this out.
[4426.84 → 4428.60] So, I've asked this in the past.
[4428.68 → 4433.04] In fact, I have a video that's on Vessel coming to YouTube soon where I talk about this directly.
[4433.04 → 4439.74] But you know how display manufacturers are fighting so hard to be like the thinnest?
[4440.60 → 4442.52] When we don't look at them from that angle.
[4442.66 → 4447.98] And I've asked myself what if they understood that I don't care?
[4448.90 → 4452.44] What kind of display could they build if it was thick?
[4453.18 → 4454.20] Apparently this.
[4454.48 → 4455.58] Because look at this thing.
[4456.28 → 4457.22] It's ridiculous.
[4457.88 → 4459.28] It's like 5 inches thick.
[4459.62 → 4460.70] 4 at least.
[4460.70 → 4462.58] But it's badass.
[4463.62 → 4470.80] And I would much rather own that than some like crazy, like sexy, super slim thing that is not as cool.
[4470.84 → 4472.78] That's 326 pixels per inch.
[4473.04 → 4475.46] So, you could get as close as you would to your phone.
[4475.58 → 4477.56] You would not be able to see a pixel.
[4478.82 → 4479.88] That kind of...
[4479.88 → 4481.70] I think it was running off something like...
[4482.78 → 4483.24] Let's see.
[4483.36 → 4484.18] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4484.18 → 4484.78] From the article.
[4484.78 → 4487.92] Could have been running off as many as 16 HDMI cables.
[4488.62 → 4493.48] Because of the bandwidth required to run 8K at that refresh rate.
[4494.02 → 4494.60] Love it.
[4495.22 → 4498.94] There is no known release date or price as this is purely a prototype.
[4499.66 → 4504.64] And if that kind of thing were available, I don't even know what you would do with it.
[4505.32 → 4505.90] Like...
[4505.90 → 4508.94] It would just be bragging rights.
[4509.36 → 4510.48] And I would brag about it.
[4510.48 → 4512.28] Because I would think that is very cool.
[4513.04 → 4515.06] Posted by Chief Yum Yum on the forum.
[4517.24 → 4523.78] Nike's self-lacing sneakers finally go on sale November 28th.
[4523.78 → 4524.46] So cool.
[4525.34 → 4528.10] Inspired by Back to the Future.
[4528.10 → 4530.20] Yes, my friends.
[4530.34 → 4533.10] Michael J. Fox has lived to see...
[4533.96 → 4537.10] Crap that was pure science fiction...
[4537.80 → 4538.88] Turn into reality.
[4539.54 → 4541.00] I mean, that's happened many times.
[4541.16 → 4542.14] I mean, yes.
[4542.72 → 4544.82] That's actually how a lot of technologies get realized.
[4547.34 → 4548.80] Anyway, these are super cool.
[4548.96 → 4549.60] Why are you such a downer?
[4549.60 → 4551.56] I hope they keep the light.
[4552.10 → 4553.10] Because I like that.
[4553.26 → 4554.94] Because I'm still 15.
[4555.78 → 4557.04] You have to charge them.
[4557.20 → 4557.86] So that's a thing.
[4558.10 → 4558.72] That's a little weird.
[4559.04 → 4559.88] So here's a video from...
[4559.88 → 4561.02] Do they have wireless charging?
[4561.90 → 4562.44] I don't know.
[4562.54 → 4563.60] This is a really long video.
[4564.06 → 4564.86] It is a very long video.
[4564.86 → 4566.10] I don't want to sit through this whole video.
[4566.24 → 4567.98] Please just show me the self-effacingness.
[4568.62 → 4570.20] Holy crap, this is a long video.
[4570.98 → 4571.68] Oh, wow.
[4571.92 → 4573.72] Is it like the punchline at the end?
[4577.04 → 4577.40] Wait.
[4577.40 → 4578.50] I didn't even see it happen.
[4581.16 → 4582.52] Oh, oh, oh.
[4583.66 → 4584.82] Okay, that's kind of cool.
[4584.84 → 4586.02] Did it go really slowly?
[4586.40 → 4586.90] I don't know.
[4586.94 → 4587.56] I'm not that impressed.
[4587.56 → 4588.12] Okay.
[4588.86 → 4589.56] All right.
[4590.52 → 4594.46] Speaking of things that might be impressive, but might not be.
[4594.56 → 4596.24] Coaxial Gamer posted this on the forum.
[4596.30 → 4598.86] The original article from KitGuru.net.
[4599.40 → 4604.44] AMD reportedly launching Zen and X370 motherboards at CES.
[4604.58 → 4605.82] I hope it's impressive.
[4606.50 → 4615.34] So they're going to be ramping up clearance of their current batch of CPUs like the FX8350 and FX6350 in an effort to make room for Zen's arrival in January.
[4615.34 → 4623.98] This is according to sources speaking with Digitizes who also claim that the last generation of CPUs will see heavy price cuts in the last few months of 2016.
[4623.98 → 4632.40] I wonder when AMD will figure out what all the other huge tech guys are doing and not launch things at CES anymore.
[4632.40 → 4633.40] But don't.
[4633.40 → 4639.08] Yeah, I wasn't really listening.
[4639.08 → 4640.56] I was reading something on my screen.
[4640.56 → 4645.52] So on that note, thank you for your contribution to our last topic there, whatever it was.
[4645.60 → 4645.80] Sweet.
[4646.40 → 4649.34] And thank you to you for watching.
[4649.86 → 4650.64] And we will see you again.
[4651.06 → 4651.74] I'll see you later.
[4652.40 → 4654.22] Are you doing the APM thing?
[4654.48 → 4654.98] Is that what it's called?
[4655.64 → 4655.96] ASMR.
[4656.28 → 4656.42] Yeah.
[4656.70 → 4657.26] I don't know.
[4657.34 → 4657.80] I might be.
[4658.38 → 4659.42] I don't really know how it works.
[4659.74 → 4660.62] To be completely honest.
[4661.04 → 4661.86] No, it's...
[4661.86 → 4663.30] Is it just whispering into a mic?
[4663.44 → 4663.92] Sort of.
[4664.04 → 4665.64] I thought you needed a binaural mic.
[4665.76 → 4667.60] No, no, you don't need that.
[4667.70 → 4668.10] Oh, what?
[4668.10 → 4672.80] It's just supposed to, like, it's supposed to trigger, like, tingling or something for certain people.
[4672.84 → 4676.00] Oh, but I thought the whole point was having, like, a binaural recording setup.
[4676.52 → 4677.66] Yeah, a binaural.
[4678.26 → 4678.98] Binaural, sure.
[4679.30 → 4679.52] Yeah.
[4679.96 → 4680.98] I've only ever read it.
[4681.12 → 4681.36] Yeah.
[4681.46 → 4681.84] I don't know.
[4682.26 → 4685.40] I mean, okay, binaural could sort of make sense.
[4685.56 → 4686.30] No, it's...
[4686.30 → 4688.68] Because it would be two neurons that go to your ear.
[4688.68 → 4689.28] That's not...
[4689.28 → 4691.54] I'm trying to help.
[4691.72 → 4692.04] Thank you.
[4693.08 → 4695.78] But apparently I was doing it when you were filming Fast as Possible.
[4695.78 → 4699.16] Because I was like, okay, welcome to the Sancho.
[4699.18 → 4700.28] I don't think you're supposed to whisper.
[4700.42 → 4701.94] I think you're supposed to just talk softly.
[4702.52 → 4704.80] I'm sure Twitch chat is correcting us, and I'm sure that I don't care.
[4704.92 → 4706.82] So thank you for watching, and we'll see you again next week.
[4706.92 → 4707.56] Same bad time.
[4708.20 → 4708.94] Same bad channel.
[4716.20 → 4718.04] Some ASMR users have been a hard time.
[4718.04 → 4718.20] Bye.
[4718.20 → 4718.26] Bye.
[4718.26 → 4718.38] Bye.
