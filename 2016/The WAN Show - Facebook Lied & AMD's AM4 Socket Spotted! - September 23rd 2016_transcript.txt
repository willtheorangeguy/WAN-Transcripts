[0.00 --> 3.12]  heroes in the thing oh yeah we should talk about youtube heroes
[5.52 --> 12.72]  hey guys i don't know what the next one is oh no no i'm done filming now no no good try
[12.72 --> 16.88]  good try but i'm done filming uh i hope i hope everything's working everything's working right
[18.40 --> 27.44]  welcome to the wet show oh man i actually can't it has been an intense week between me and luke
[28.08 --> 39.28]  we scripted eleven no twelve twelve videos this week okay you did a lot then uh holy crap what the
[39.28 --> 47.92]  hell uh because i did four yeah okay i have been i appreciate that you bundled me in that fully
[47.92 --> 53.60]  but just to add some context i'm trying to i'm trying to make sure there is a lot just so people
[53.60 --> 59.36]  like understand four is like four is okay so we do when show every week that's one of our seven
[59.36 --> 66.08]  weekly ltt uploads yeah um so if each luke and i do three then that covers everything we need to do for
[66.08 --> 75.28]  the week yeah because that's our six uploads so if we produce 12 in a week then what that means is that
[75.28 --> 85.04]  in the event that linus's wife who was induced this morning gives birth in the next 18 or so hours
[85.04 --> 89.76]  like she did last time she was induced post of what's happening it's just like how it's supposed to work
[90.72 --> 97.84]  then we will have a full additional week based on what we produced this week a full additional week
[97.84 --> 104.88]  of content that will allow linus to spend some time with his brand new baby yeah that that is uh
[104.88 --> 112.72]  and then if i keep where we're at four a week then we'll only rot at two videos a week as time goes on
[112.72 --> 117.44]  yes which is not that bad so maybe so maybe i will be able to take some time it's really funny like
[118.24 --> 126.88]  i never actually take my kind of vacation time like since i started working at ncix i think i've taken
[126.88 --> 132.72]  one time off that i would actually consider to be a vacation and it was like it was like early on in
[132.72 --> 136.88]  the days when basically i like got home and i was living with my girlfriend's parents and we would
[136.88 --> 143.12]  like get home and play team fortress too like my life really wasn't that hard anyway yeah yeah um but
[143.12 --> 152.00]  since then it's always been like some trip from hell to asia with two infants or like uh when i've
[152.00 --> 159.36]  had a child so i i think i took about seven work days off when i had my daughter um but this time
[159.36 --> 165.84]  the plan is and this has actually been kind of incredible like our team is now 15 strong as of the
[165.84 --> 172.72]  new salesperson that we've added who starts not this coming monday but the following monday okay now 15
[172.72 --> 180.08]  strong and the team is now structured such that i am hoping to take two to three weeks off to enjoy
[180.08 --> 186.88]  with my new child to be fair out of all of those new hires from three people to 15 people you haven't
[186.88 --> 196.56]  added anyone that's going to help with what you do the core on ltt no yeah on super fun and on tech
[196.56 --> 202.72]  quickie i have okay but super fun used to be a much smaller commit yes and but technically yeah
[202.72 --> 206.96]  was a lot of work for me yeah yeah although we didn't do three to four tech quickies a week the
[206.96 --> 213.44]  way that we do now and they were yeah the original ones were okay oh okay the original original ones
[214.64 --> 218.48]  i think they were just a little low hanging i don't think they're necessarily bad they were just very
[218.48 --> 223.76]  low hanging they were very low hanging they were low hanging like the balls of a potent stallion
[223.76 --> 230.64]  actually no stallion balls are actually kind of tight to the body so i like what has a good thing
[230.64 --> 235.92]  what has low hanging balls i'm sure twitch chat knows twitch chat can please please let us know
[235.92 --> 242.40]  twitch what are we even do we have topics preferably no longer uh low hanging balls i can i can get us some
[242.40 --> 253.28]  topics here uh there's one okay for topics today yahoo confirms a 500 million account breach for people who
[253.28 --> 258.32]  will never even know that this breach occurred because let's face it they are not that twitch
[258.32 --> 266.24]  uh twitch savvy internet savvy yeah they have yahoo accounts yeah moving on total biscuits tumor is down
[266.24 --> 274.32]  50 in size that is excellent news that is so good is it okay i know because of like a new treatment
[274.32 --> 280.80]  and stuff and that's after a very small amount of sessions i know that inoperable means that it cannot
[280.80 --> 290.08]  be operated but is it operable if it can be operated on uh i would assume so i don't know english is
[290.08 --> 296.24]  stupid and medical stuff gets crazy so you've got that combination i don't know okay i mean flammable
[296.24 --> 304.88]  and inflammable same thing so like rip english yeah uh what else we got palmer lucky is financing trump memes
[304.88 --> 313.28]  so well they're more like anti-hillary memes we'll get into it sure yeah yeah and apple patents a paper bag
[315.60 --> 323.12]  so yep maybe you can store your is it a lunch bag is it because it could have an apple in it oh
[323.12 --> 331.52]  oh that's not even funny that's not even like an oh damn moment that's just stupid that's okay i
[331.52 --> 334.56]  really appreciate you like no worries i'm looking out for you
[343.84 --> 344.40]  sorry
[344.40 --> 357.12]  okay
[360.32 --> 364.80]  see it's all these other things that like other people do so that i can try and make eight videos
[366.24 --> 370.08]  like normally i would have to put those little graphics in there which is why a lot of the time
[370.08 --> 382.00]  it wasn't done so that's a thing oh man okay well it's done now so good job colton
[382.80 --> 389.20]  so yahoo has confirmed 500 million accounts breached we have uh article from i believe the
[389.20 --> 393.28]  want me to post that into wall street journal i got it already here i'll share luke's screen boom there
[393.28 --> 402.48]  you go oh oh oh oh twitchception twitchception all right there we go so yeah at least 500 million
[402.48 --> 407.68]  user accounts um they're probably taking a little bit away from that for like people that haven't
[407.68 --> 414.32]  actually accessed their yahoo account for the last six years i mean 500 million accounts i mean is that
[414.32 --> 421.68]  not like is that the entire population of north america more than that canada has like 35 million the
[421.68 --> 428.32]  states has like 335 million or so like 330 340. i don't know how many people live in mexico but like
[428.32 --> 437.52]  it can't be that many like holy crap yeah is this is this the biggest account leak ever potentially yeah
[438.08 --> 443.36]  yeah i guess because we don't fully know how every single one of them has gone then we don't technically
[443.36 --> 449.36]  know if it is the biggest but it is potentially the biggest i mean do 500 million people have yahoo
[449.36 --> 454.56]  accounts how many of them are dead like how many of them have passed away yeah like actually people
[454.56 --> 459.84]  who have passed away a lot of these are probably people who like oh when i was 10 i made an email
[459.84 --> 468.56]  account called like sephiroth xxx69 boy and now i have replaced that with my real name and then at yahoo
[468.56 --> 472.72]  like there's probably a lot of those going on frighteningly enough sephiroth porn is probably a thing
[474.00 --> 478.80]  i just i remember like when i was younger and into video games it seemed like every second dude that i ran
[478.80 --> 485.04]  passed was like xxx sephiroth xxx it was just like the big and the small yeah yeah yeah the big x is
[485.04 --> 490.56]  in the middle yeah i know you know what was your like i'm a little kid email okay i'm gonna do yvonne's
[490.56 --> 500.00]  first okay so yvonne's was sweetheart09 oh man at hotmail.com oh man with underscore sweet underscore heart
[500.00 --> 505.76]  underscore zero nine and her display name always had like those things with the yeah yeah yeah yeah thing on
[505.76 --> 510.56]  the other side it was perfect it was awful it was awful it's a it's amazing that i ever fell in love
[510.56 --> 521.12]  with her because that's terrible um with that said um my cringe like first email address is moomoo
[521.12 --> 528.00]  underscore the underscore cow at hotmail.com oh my god yeah someone actually acquired it from me like
[528.00 --> 531.92]  really later on down the line like it went inactive and like someone got it otherwise
[532.64 --> 538.72]  i would have kept it i totally would have kept that you know quite frankly my new one is not that much
[538.72 --> 544.48]  better but it's funnier if you like get the joke yeah um i mean i don't even care i don't even monitor
[544.48 --> 548.24]  anymore i just keep it more out of sentimental value than anything else so i'll tell you guys what it is
[548.24 --> 554.64]  but it's the underscore peanuts underscore gallery it's just so long hotmail.com it's really long it's
[554.64 --> 560.00]  hard to type but what's funny about it and the thing okay this is important to me both of my email
[560.00 --> 565.04]  addresses were unique they did not have numbers at the end of them because especially 10 years ago
[565.04 --> 570.08]  there was really no excuse for that come up with something original don't be sephiroth you know
[570.80 --> 579.28]  69696969 because all the other 6-9s were taken okay um so they were both unique and the peanuts
[579.28 --> 585.92]  gallery is actually pretty funny because you know my personality of being loud and outspoken and sometimes
[585.92 --> 593.04]  wrong is uh is is directly sort of like it is kind of similar to what we what you would expect from
[593.04 --> 600.40]  the peanut gallery who i i forgive me if i have the origin of the term wrong but it dates back to i
[600.40 --> 606.32]  think shakespearean times when the peanut gallery was the standing audience in the theater the the poor
[606.32 --> 613.52]  people who like left a lot of peanuts um peanut remains left on the floor so like like they were kind
[613.52 --> 619.92]  of like and they would like they would yell during the show they were uncouth um so so i called myself
[619.92 --> 625.04]  the peanut gallery and then i'm the peanuts gallery because my name is one of the characters in the
[625.04 --> 631.20]  comic strip peanuts by charles schultz linus so i was like haha i am so clever this is unique no one else
[631.20 --> 638.48]  would ever want this email also because it's so damn long yeah so that okay so what's your cringe email
[638.48 --> 645.68]  uh pretty bad i technically didn't make it but i was totally down with it and used it uh ladies boy 54.
[647.28 --> 656.00]  54 was my boy 54. i didn't want to use man because i was too young i didn't self-identify as a man
[656.00 --> 661.84]  at that point in time i self-identified as a boy oh i'm so triggered right now so it was yeah ladies
[661.84 --> 668.48]  but apparently i was into older women because i used ladies instead of girls uh well girls boy 54
[668.48 --> 672.56]  just doesn't really even mean anything sounds a little weird yeah yeah so it was it was lady yeah
[672.56 --> 678.56]  ladies boy 54 at hotmail.com yeah that was uh i i actually tried to get it back i remember when i
[678.56 --> 682.16]  finally abandoned it i just made its password something crazy so no one would ever get into it
[682.16 --> 687.20]  and then now it's just gone i tried to like get it back the other day and like see what i used to do
[687.20 --> 692.00]  because i don't even remember what brought this on anyway i'm i'm definitely curious what ladies
[692.00 --> 696.88]  boy 54 like why were you trying to get it the other day no not the other day like like quite
[696.88 --> 700.96]  some time i don't remember when but like i went back to try to like oh can i get my old email back
[701.52 --> 703.92]  all the older women in the audience are freaking out by the way
[705.92 --> 711.36]  because they're like they have a chance now all all the older women like my mom
[711.36 --> 717.84]  mom she could be freaking out right now probably because she's embarrassed um but yeah there's
[717.84 --> 725.20]  there's probably an extreme lack of that currently watching yeah but yeah that was uh that was my old
[725.20 --> 730.88]  email oh that's funny hooray have we even covered a topic yet oh yeah the yeah thing oh that's excellent
[730.88 --> 736.56]  okay good um so i don't know we haven't actually really talked about any of the details of the breach
[736.56 --> 745.04]  so i guess oh the reason my laptop is running so poorly is that heaven still thought it was like
[745.04 --> 751.36]  running on an external monitor or something oh oh that's that's very inconvenient yeah who believes
[751.36 --> 757.52]  the hackers are no longer in its corporate network that's probably good um the company said that it
[757.52 --> 764.40]  didn't believe that unprotected passwords payment card data or bank account information had been affected
[764.40 --> 772.08]  um okay do they say what was affected yeah i'm trying to figure that out investigating claims blah
[772.08 --> 776.64]  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah it's unlikely to affect the terms of the
[776.64 --> 784.96]  verizon deal so that's good even though uh they said that um they weren't aware of any security breaches
[784.96 --> 792.64]  on september 9th the intrusion happened in late 2014. so by now like oh man
[792.64 --> 800.80]  wow basically they didn't even really start investigating until july when yahoo was started
[800.80 --> 806.16]  looking into claims by hackers who were offering to sell 280 million yahoo usernames and passwords
[806.80 --> 813.84]  like oh they said that the information for sale wasn't legit though and eventually determined that
[813.84 --> 821.12]  they had been breached by a state-sponsored actor so we'll we'll kind of stay tuned i guess and see how
[821.12 --> 825.92]  many of our grandparents uh should probably change their yahoo account passwords and my girlfriend
[825.92 --> 833.84]  stop using that email she uses yahoo yeah why you know like i i like subtly roasted her for this like
[833.84 --> 841.84]  a like while ago on the wan show but now like come on my aunt who has been retired for the last five
[841.84 --> 847.68]  years uses hotmail at least hotmail's even better though i know yeah you're you're on the outlook
[847.68 --> 855.76]  platform and stuff now like it's fine it's just an uh it's just an older name yeah ah man it's garbage
[855.76 --> 864.64]  that's disappointing all right researchers lead the way towards a method of unhackable internet
[864.64 --> 873.28]  communication okay grain of salt oh oh oh yeah no okay so i see where this is going so quantum state
[874.48 --> 880.80]  kind of internet networking stuff is iffy because if you try to intercept it uh before it gets to its
[880.80 --> 890.80]  destination the data inside will change so it could be hacked sort of but they won't get what you were
[890.80 --> 898.08]  trying to send if that makes sense and there would still be means of part of the problem is that the
[898.08 --> 907.84]  the use of the word hack yeah has become so perverted from the from the actual definition that
[908.96 --> 914.96]  because like a very effective hack in this scenario could be to hit everything and make it so that each
[914.96 --> 918.72]  side can't communicate with each other properly because everything that's going in each direction
[918.72 --> 927.20]  is scrambled yes or another hack could be as simple as installing screen recording software on
[927.20 --> 932.72]  someone else on someone's computer and intercepting the data that way you don't have to you know be
[932.72 --> 941.92]  all like csi like intercepting transmission retransmit like it doesn't hack the coffee mug
[941.92 --> 949.28]  like it's not it's upside down now yeah way to go if you didn't get that way to go i tried um
[949.28 --> 955.12]  they can't see because that's not the only means of hacking and lots of forms of hacking including
[955.12 --> 962.24]  social engineering hacks will very much still exist and this will do absolutely nothing to
[964.40 --> 970.16]  at all help fighting social engineering is not hacking yeah it constantly gets used in that way we call it
[970.16 --> 978.32]  that like you know oh linus's twitter got hacked no no in the purest sense of the word linus's twitter
[978.32 --> 986.16]  account was compromised yep but it was not hacked because calling it a hack would be giving the folks
[986.16 --> 994.88]  involved in that far too much credit yeah all right so anyway um basically it's a group from the university
[994.88 --> 1002.32]  of calgary that teleported the quantum state of a photon to a location 6.2 kilometers away using fiber optic cable
[1003.12 --> 1009.84]  researchers in shanghai sent states of photons 14.7 kilometers across that city so they believe that
[1009.84 --> 1015.04]  widespread adoption of quantum teleportation technology could usher in a new era of unhackable
[1015.04 --> 1020.40]  internet communication the first step though is figuring out how to send that quantum information
[1020.40 --> 1027.52]  over the vast distances we're talking not a few kilometers of fiber optic networks that span the
[1027.52 --> 1032.24]  entire globe although like internal land connections at extremely secure facilities
[1032.24 --> 1040.08]  using this could be pretty cool that would be pretty cool yeah um and basically i mean
[1043.36 --> 1048.88]  hmm so okay so the rest of it is kind of what we covered earlier yeah the rest of it is like
[1048.88 --> 1053.20]  pretty techie speak but pretty much pairs of particles are linked together through unique
[1053.20 --> 1059.44]  properties or states and then that means that only the two parties who have the entangled particles can
[1059.44 --> 1064.08]  read the information sent between them which is pretty cool hackers trying to eavesdrop would
[1064.08 --> 1069.28]  introduce detectable anomalies and the two parties could abort their communication so this is the kind
[1069.28 --> 1076.56]  of thing that i see being more like a military thing within any kind of like reasonable period of time
[1076.56 --> 1082.96]  reasonable period of time and i i don't know if it would ever make its way to like your wi-fi router
[1082.96 --> 1089.84]  for a number of reasons um so don't just consider like oh these guys are saying that technology isn't
[1089.84 --> 1094.16]  going to advance like that's not necessarily what we're saying there could even be legal reasons
[1094.16 --> 1100.08]  the government likes to have ways to sniff on your stuff so they literally might not make this
[1100.08 --> 1105.36]  possible for you they can sniff my stuff anytime they want it won't smell good but that's their problem it
[1105.36 --> 1111.28]  might smell good you just get out of the shower it's all right all right this is freaking hilarious
[1111.28 --> 1117.92]  um so incredibly not surprised haven't we been saying this for so long i i actually it's you know
[1117.92 --> 1124.72]  what it's not something that we've like ranted on but it's definitely something that we have talked
[1124.72 --> 1134.00]  about internally a lot yeah turns out facebook was inflating their video view stats for two years
[1135.36 --> 1142.64]  miscalculation uh likely led to an overestimated viewing time of 60 to 80 percent
[1144.72 --> 1154.56]  oh my god that's insane i don't like oh this was according to a letter sent to an ad buying agency
[1154.56 --> 1163.76]  that was reviewed by the wall street journal so basically facebook has been trumpeting that they are the
[1163.76 --> 1171.44]  the next destination for online video that they get x number of views like you look at any video on
[1171.44 --> 1176.24]  facebook it has a view counter under it and they've been saying that yeah so they've been saying that
[1176.24 --> 1183.84]  they are like like you know closing in on youtube for the most viewed online video platform and
[1183.84 --> 1189.44]  doobly blubbity blub but the truth of the matter is that the way that they're counting
[1189.44 --> 1198.32]  is ridiculous i mean they auto play the video yeah as you scroll through and i can't remember
[1198.32 --> 1203.04]  actually nick light is the expert on this stuff i kind of wish he would come down and take my spot
[1203.04 --> 1208.64]  here because he'd be able to say a lot more about it than i would but i think that facebook so so youtube
[1208.64 --> 1214.00]  counts a view after i think it's something to the tune of 15 to 30 seconds facebook is almost immediate
[1214.00 --> 1219.04]  is facebook's is like two seconds so youtube is kind of looking at it where they've had a lot of
[1219.04 --> 1226.40]  data over the years finding out uh how long it takes to capture a viewer and if you watch for under
[1226.40 --> 1231.36]  that amount of time it considers that you didn't capture the viewer yes so that's not a view and it
[1231.36 --> 1237.44]  doesn't count it yes if you watch for a significant enough time so you're past the average time that
[1237.44 --> 1241.68]  people would bail if they're not that interested then it counts as a view go ahead you got my chair i was
[1241.68 --> 1245.84]  literally i literally just finished a meeting and turned on the wan show and linus is like i wish nick
[1245.84 --> 1252.40]  would come downstairs and take my chair okay sure so anyway what do i what do i need to talk about
[1252.40 --> 1259.20]  uh facebook views compared to youtube views how they're calculated uh-huh it's funny because i've
[1259.20 --> 1266.00]  been saying this forever no i know yeah like yeah because you you have it standard that ads or that
[1266.00 --> 1272.24]  videos autoplay make people disable it so grandma watches every single video that's on her timeline
[1272.96 --> 1277.28]  watches um because technically i'm not exactly sure how facebook counts a view
[1277.84 --> 1283.36]  um i know on youtube it's something to the tune of a number of seconds i don't know what the number of
[1283.36 --> 1291.20]  seconds is um but if facebook is saying that one second is one view and they're auto playing on
[1291.20 --> 1298.72]  pretty much anyone who's not slightly tech savvy's timelines then that's a lot of views that are not
[1298.72 --> 1305.60]  actually views um so anyway it's just like it's something that i've been talking about internally here
[1305.60 --> 1311.68]  for a long time um that i was speculating essentially that facebook may have been over
[1311.68 --> 1318.48]  inflating their view numbers and um it appears that that may have in fact been allegedly correct yeah
[1318.48 --> 1326.00]  by by the team of 60 to 80 percent apparently which is hilariously awesome because i i actually
[1326.00 --> 1331.20]  personally hate facebook video and that's not just because like where are youtube people it just sucks
[1331.76 --> 1336.40]  like the amount of times that i'm like oh okay i actually do want to watch this and then the player
[1336.40 --> 1346.00]  just like fails it's like what oh and that's like an sorry is it 60 to 80 inflation on view number or
[1346.00 --> 1365.68]  view through duration do we know estimated that's what's actually great about that is that that
[1365.68 --> 1373.76]  doesn't even address the ridiculous view counts then yeah right so view counts could be 300 percent
[1373.76 --> 1379.20]  higher yeah yeah a thousand percent higher so like i was saying if they're counting every single
[1379.20 --> 1383.36]  second if if every person who watches the video for one second counts as a view
[1385.52 --> 1391.52]  you could easily be looking at hundreds of percent inflation on view numbers so this is all
[1392.24 --> 1397.12]  speculation and allegedly and disclaimers i'm sure they're not going to exactly publish all this kind
[1397.12 --> 1402.32]  of stuff but this is how it feels like it works from like a fair amount of the second i saw that they
[1402.32 --> 1408.32]  started to do autoplay i was like oh they're trying to push up numbers yeah that's the only reason yeah
[1408.96 --> 1413.52]  i mean i guess they could argue that it's for convenience sake i would actually love it if
[1413.52 --> 1418.96]  facebook became more of a legitimate video sharing platform it'd be great because we kind of need
[1418.96 --> 1425.04]  something that properly competes with youtube we we tried doing it consistently for like a while and
[1426.08 --> 1429.76]  we should still be doing it consistently but um we're not always doing it consistently
[1429.76 --> 1439.36]  um and that is a lot in many cases due to the fact that it's so sporadic yeah like it's so dependent on
[1440.48 --> 1448.16]  not only just keywords and and likes and all that like it is on youtube um but it's so dependent on
[1448.16 --> 1453.28]  whether people are sharing it because if you don't get a share it's like well this video got 300 views
[1453.28 --> 1458.48]  yeah and if you get a couple of shares and that person has 400 friends and all their 400 friends
[1458.48 --> 1463.28]  scroll down their news feed then it's like oh wow there's 400 more views even though one percent of
[1463.28 --> 1468.08]  those people were actually interested i think seven gamers has like over a million views on facebook
[1469.60 --> 1475.92]  because it got shared and some of our normal videos have like a thousand so like
[1475.92 --> 1486.88]  that's what am i supposed to do like anyway oh man so i mean to be clear it's not like they're
[1486.88 --> 1492.16]  getting busted on this and they were still trying to hide it they did come clean i mean this came from
[1492.16 --> 1498.32]  a letter they sent to an ad buying agency although i wonder if they're coming clean because they needed
[1498.88 --> 1505.60]  some kind of reason for why advertising on facebook video performed so poorly do you know what i mean
[1506.56 --> 1511.52]  maybe they're just proactively kind of addressing it so that no one digs further and kind of goes
[1512.40 --> 1520.08]  like if a million people watch this and like one person orders the new dyson miracle vacuum or whatever
[1520.08 --> 1526.00]  like really one out of a million like you know we run banner ads that are more effective than that really
[1526.00 --> 1534.00]  oh that's a dig um so anyway speaking of youtube though should we jump down to youtube heroes let's
[1534.00 --> 1543.44]  definitely do youtube heroes you know what's so funny about the name of this is that it's exactly like
[1543.44 --> 1553.68]  the condescending derogatory term that someone would use for people who are here who white knight
[1553.68 --> 1562.24]  around on the internet reporting stuff youtube heroes it's like good job hero you reported a video
[1562.24 --> 1569.60]  that had a bad word in it good for you now to be clear i do think that the youtube heroes program
[1570.24 --> 1579.28]  uh has the potential to offer a lot of benefit to the youtube community at large and we'll go ahead and
[1579.28 --> 1583.52]  we'll fire up the uh the youtube heroes page here so you guys can have a look at it it's a google
[1583.52 --> 1591.60]  support page here but there is also like everything google does like how do they not oh look they're in
[1592.96 --> 1598.88]  they are the most what this needs like this could be very cool if what happened was when enough heroes
[1598.88 --> 1605.60]  flag something it gets manual actual person oversight afterwards that's not going to happen but if that
[1605.60 --> 1611.04]  did happen that could be actually kind of cool and i don't understand why google doesn't understand this
[1611.04 --> 1620.80]  because they are the internet company-est of internet companies like they did okay no they do have a
[1620.80 --> 1627.12]  physical product okay technically google glass is a physical product and chromecast and chromecast is
[1627.12 --> 1632.80]  okay so they do have physical products audio but all their physical products are our internet okay
[1632.80 --> 1639.68]  our internet is that even i don't really think so don't worry about it whatever okay
[1641.76 --> 1648.24]  they're they're like they were like forged in the fires of mount internet okay and they've got the
[1648.24 --> 1656.72]  the internet ring okay the bring ring bus token ring i'm trying to bring this back just not happening
[1656.72 --> 1664.00]  topology what are we talking about ring topology okay basically there's no excuse for google to
[1664.00 --> 1673.20]  implement things that appear to internet denizens like us as though they've never seen the way online
[1673.20 --> 1682.24]  communities interact before yeah so people will people will become heroes for the sole purpose to troll
[1682.24 --> 1688.00]  of trolling out of people the crap out of people h3h3 actually said it in a really interesting way if
[1688.00 --> 1694.24]  you go to the youtube heroes video page and you see the ludicrous amount of dislikes and then you look
[1694.24 --> 1702.08]  down a little bit further and you notice that youtube has disabled comments on the video uh ethan pointed out
[1702.08 --> 1707.60]  that if you're scared of those people those are very directly the people that are going to enter this
[1707.60 --> 1713.92]  program and are going to troll the crap out of you and everyone else on this platform so we haven't
[1713.92 --> 1720.56]  actually explained what it is yet which we should probably do so heroes level up like does this just
[1720.56 --> 1727.36]  feel like an executive with gray hair like was sitting in a board room the kids these days they like the
[1727.36 --> 1732.48]  video games and there's the in the video games there's the hero right and you and the hero levels
[1732.48 --> 1736.96]  up you get experience and then you you yeah you level up and then becomes more powerful and gains
[1736.96 --> 1744.72]  abilities interesting yeah we should gamify the most boring part of the entire platform moderating it
[1744.72 --> 1751.76]  yeah okay so that's what it's for uh heroes also there are other bits and these bits are cool if you
[1751.76 --> 1758.24]  subtitle things you can get like points towards your hero thing and subtitling things is awesome
[1758.24 --> 1764.56]  and i think there's something else i was going to go through the whole list okay so heroes level up
[1765.20 --> 1770.40]  by doing what he said sharing their knowledge effectively with other users on the youtube help
[1770.40 --> 1778.56]  forum is another big one um by flagging inappropriate videos that's where the problem lies and each type
[1778.56 --> 1784.40]  of contribution is worth a certain number of points so accurate reports of videos that violate community
[1784.40 --> 1791.60]  guidelines is one point contributing a subtitle edit that gets published is another point answering a
[1791.60 --> 1798.96]  user question on the youtube help forum with a comment selected as the best answer is 10 points so they
[1798.96 --> 1803.12]  say they don't have captions in there are they considering subtitles the same as captions because those
[1803.12 --> 1809.36]  are actually adding captions and subtitles to videos are both um and no i know but then it says down below
[1809.36 --> 1814.24]  when it says actually earn points it says contributing a subtitle edit that gets published
[1814.24 --> 1819.92]  equals one point i'm pretty sure they mean captions and subtitles i think for the purposes of i actually
[1819.92 --> 1825.28]  i think there is a subtle difference between them but i don't remember what it is i think
[1826.56 --> 1832.56]  is that captions are native language and subtitles can be either i think i'm not that sounds right to me
[1832.56 --> 1837.44]  that's what i was going to say i think okay so maybe we're right and if we're not then twitch chat will
[1837.44 --> 1841.68]  yell at us but i'm not looking at it right now so i don't care i'm gonna look i care about you all
[1841.68 --> 1847.12]  right so it's currently in beta it's subject to change um effectively you can unlock rewards which
[1847.12 --> 1855.52]  is kind of here let's go ahead and uh unlock rewards so hero levels level one become a hero zero to
[1855.52 --> 1863.52]  nine points you can access the heroes dashboard and join the community a level two hero uh learns at
[1863.52 --> 1870.24]  exclusive workshops and can take part in hero hangouts like can you imagine that would be even worse than
[1870.24 --> 1875.68]  being in like a student government meeting ah closed captioning is like listening to a video for the
[1875.68 --> 1883.52]  deaf and subtitles is just yeah but effectively they're both texts at the bottom they usually look
[1883.52 --> 1888.96]  different so sub closed captioning usually has a black background and subtitles usually are like uh like
[1888.96 --> 1893.68]  uh um yeah a black drop shadow on white text like it's sort of weird yeah it's it's just i don't think
[1893.68 --> 1899.12]  that's enough of an answer but yeah but there you go can you imagine like being in a hero hangout
[1900.64 --> 1905.44]  like just i'm hanging out with all the people who moderate like i'm not saying that inappropriate
[1905.44 --> 1909.20]  content on youtube is a good thing and i'm not saying like it doesn't need to be moderated and i'm not
[1909.20 --> 1915.28]  i'm also not saying that in the very very long term with properly vetted heroes this program
[1916.48 --> 1921.60]  has the potential to be better than an automated system so i'm not saying any of those things
[1921.60 --> 1928.48]  i'm just saying that there is so much room for human error that didn't exist before and people
[1928.48 --> 1933.44]  who sit around and moderate youtube videos might be nerds apparently people a few people have actually
[1933.44 --> 1939.12]  said that we're right with subtitles and captions okay cool uh level three you get access to super tools
[1939.12 --> 1947.28]  and this is where it gets scary you only need a hundred points how easily could you abuse the system
[1947.28 --> 1952.40]  to get a hundred points on this an insane thing too is like if you think about it you could have
[1952.40 --> 1959.20]  your friends not to fuel the fire more you could have have your friends ask a question on the youtube
[1959.20 --> 1964.48]  10 questions that's it you get 10 points and you can even make them look pretty legit as long as the
[1964.48 --> 1972.64]  person just selects best answer and it looks pretty legit 10 points that's right and then you get to mass
[1972.64 --> 1988.00]  flag abusive videos which is like terrible so we've actually already had some flags come in yeah uh so i think uh the issue that someone flagged us for is completely irrelevant these come in every once in a while
[1988.00 --> 1994.64]  and it's fine because youtube i believe has changed the procedure on them i used to have to dispute them individually
[1994.64 --> 2001.44]  and my inaction would lead to the video being pulled um but people have said that um you can flag a video
[2001.44 --> 2007.60]  saying that it must have closed captioning if it originally aired on tv in the united states
[2008.48 --> 2014.48]  that's like a rule um so people can flag it saying i think this video must have closed captioning and it
[2014.48 --> 2021.04]  used to be that i would get my monetization removed if nothing else on those videos if i didn't demonstrate
[2021.04 --> 2025.36]  that my video was not a tv show at some point in time and i'm sitting here going this is ridiculous
[2025.36 --> 2031.76]  yeah so we i think we got hit with a mass flag of those already okay i'm just kind of like okay that's
[2031.76 --> 2037.92]  fairly minor i guess at level four you get to sneak preview product launches and contact youtube staff
[2037.92 --> 2043.36]  directly which is amazing because it took me until a year and a half ago to have direct contact with
[2043.36 --> 2048.40]  youtube staff that might be bad because it might clog the system uh and getting closer to youtube a thousand
[2048.40 --> 2053.84]  plus points means you can test products before release and apply for the heroes summit which
[2053.84 --> 2062.00]  sounds like the most boring possible place you could ever go but you know what power to you
[2062.96 --> 2068.48]  if you're into that sort of thing i mean maybe they'll bring like like celebrity youtubers to the
[2068.48 --> 2072.88]  summit or something so you can meet pewdiepie or whatever like i don't know youtube has the kind of
[2072.88 --> 2078.64]  money that would allow them to i don't pewdiepie likes this though yeah i mean i don't pewdiepie
[2078.64 --> 2083.92]  needs the money the super he releases a lot of videos like trolling the crap out of youtube because
[2083.92 --> 2094.24]  they keep doing stupid stuff yeah fair enough so i mean basically it's maybe eventually it's like so
[2094.24 --> 2100.16]  many of you know what okay it comes back to exactly the same conversation i was having about the way that
[2100.16 --> 2107.68]  they were cracking down on non-advertiser friendly content right now it's terrible give it another
[2107.68 --> 2112.00]  couple of years and they'll probably have worked out the kinks but that doesn't change the fact that
[2112.00 --> 2117.36]  this is going to create a lot of unnecessary busy work for people who are just trying to use the platform
[2117.36 --> 2127.44]  legitimately and running around and pinning like you know merit badges on people for reporting stuff that
[2127.44 --> 2135.20]  you know might not technically be within the community guidelines but like come on just it's
[2135.20 --> 2141.60]  like the community guidelines are you could pull down a lot of content on youtube based on the
[2141.60 --> 2146.88]  community guidelines and it would in my opinion destroy a lot of you know the things that people
[2146.88 --> 2154.00]  were whining about with the whole uh advertiser safe policies thing like um like it could destroy a
[2154.00 --> 2159.12]  lot of the free speech and openness of youtube to have people running around flagging anything that
[2159.12 --> 2165.84]  offends them a lot of a lot of community guidelines are in place so that if you go far enough they can
[2165.84 --> 2172.00]  hit you with a book not necessarily so they can actually be enforced 100 all the time for everyone yeah
[2173.84 --> 2183.68]  so yeah this is great 53nt 13nt great username uh says hall monitors yes yeah
[2183.68 --> 2191.76]  that is youtube has basically implemented a hall monitor system which was always terrible which was
[2191.76 --> 2199.28]  always terrible so sjw report system yeah like basically that seems to be what we're looking at
[2199.28 --> 2204.80]  that sounds like the most boring summit that anybody could be at what would be its purpose do you go
[2204.80 --> 2208.08]  around and meet other people who like abusing moderation powers
[2208.08 --> 2218.48]  i think in the right community getting like we call them moderators actually like on our community
[2218.48 --> 2222.72]  forum but getting together community leaders is what i would think of them as more like yeah and
[2222.72 --> 2227.60]  could be cool when you have that it's a contained community that's supposed to generally be about
[2227.60 --> 2232.80]  one thing and you have a relatively small compared to the entirety of youtube subset of users
[2232.80 --> 2240.08]  and there's essentially one category it is a tech forum yes these guys are just like go on youtube and
[2240.08 --> 2245.84]  look at whatever you want and click the buttons like uh i don't know like if you don't understand
[2245.84 --> 2251.52]  the humor of a channel and they're doing like satire or something that's a little bit edgy and then
[2251.52 --> 2255.60]  you decide to flag it because you're like this is bad content you don't realize it's a joke
[2255.60 --> 2263.36]  that could go bad and i am not just salty that i do not have any hall passes okay and that i was
[2263.36 --> 2270.00]  not selected for student body president okay i wasn't ever student body president
[2271.68 --> 2277.20]  i was hillary was student body president and i never went and they got really sad about it but i
[2277.20 --> 2281.04]  didn't actually apply they just put me on the student council so i was like i'm not going and they're
[2281.04 --> 2286.00]  like you have to go i was like i'm not going there's no way i would ever do this i wouldn't
[2286.00 --> 2292.40]  even want you on student council why because rude you'd be all like you'd be all like we need more
[2292.96 --> 2299.60]  more showers at the school well we no we had enough there you had enough there we don't have enough
[2299.60 --> 2307.60]  here we should get showers here ah see see exactly what i was afraid of let's do ad spots squarespace
[2307.60 --> 2312.48]  you could make a website about a shower if you wanted if we did enough squarespace spots maybe
[2312.48 --> 2318.24]  we could afford luke's shower that is why squarespace no that is not why squarespace
[2318.24 --> 2325.20]  squarespace lets you build a beautiful website that looks great at your computer on your phone or in
[2325.20 --> 2329.60]  the shower similar to how you would look great on your phone get out of the shower on the new iphone 7
[2330.16 --> 2335.92]  yeah that's water resistant thank you water is it i appreciate that see that see that right there
[2335.92 --> 2343.12]  that's me listening to you buddy um they offer 24 7 support via live chat and email it's only 12
[2343.12 --> 2347.36]  bucks a month to start and you get a free domain if you buy squarespace for the year
[2348.48 --> 2354.40]  all their websites include a commerce module a free online store and cover pages a feature that
[2354.40 --> 2362.24]  lets you set up a beautiful one page online presence in just minutes maybe your page is like a shower and
[2362.24 --> 2366.88]  as you scroll down you go further down the shower and the whole time you're like oh my goodness there's
[2366.88 --> 2372.40]  gonna be a person and then you have an iphone underwater that would actually be kind of a funny
[2372.40 --> 2376.88]  website yeah just like like you know those ones where it's like it's all like race like it's a big
[2376.88 --> 2382.00]  image yeah and you just see like this the slit yeah and like it could just go down down down is there
[2382.00 --> 2387.04]  gonna be a dick is there gonna be a dick is it gonna be a dick no it's an iphone 7 yeah i like that
[2387.04 --> 2392.80]  yeah we should someone someone should make that website probably space yeah and if they did so
[2392.80 --> 2397.28]  then they wouldn't have to pay for the first 14 days because squarespace offers a free trial
[2398.16 --> 2404.32]  that lets anyone try it see how easy it is to use before buying and deciding to use offer code when
[2404.32 --> 2410.24]  to save 10 when they decide that that website really needs to be on the internet forever because
[2410.24 --> 2419.12]  it's an important piece of artwork speaking of important pieces of artwork tools are not really
[2419.12 --> 2428.16]  art and i fix it makes toolkits that someone put away improperly someone put away improperly and this
[2428.16 --> 2433.84]  is my kit but it was in the workshop so uh-oh i don't know what happened there are all the pieces
[2433.84 --> 2438.56]  there are you gonna have to rage face all the pieces are like all the pieces are good but are they in the
[2438.56 --> 2443.20]  right spots i've had people put my kit back with the pieces not in the right spots and i'm like i'm
[2443.20 --> 2448.00]  sitting here looking at going okay like the kits are great everything is clearly labeled it is you
[2448.00 --> 2455.68]  can you can obviously tell what goes where uh this is the 64-bit driver kit so i won't run on windows xp
[2455.68 --> 2460.32]  but as long as you've got windows vista or later or actually technically there was a windows xp x64
[2460.32 --> 2464.32]  edition but it was terrible no one used it no one no one used that i actually did run it for a little
[2464.32 --> 2469.84]  while did you did it it worked oh yeah most people i know of that had it it like crashed a lot and
[2469.84 --> 2474.80]  stuff i it was actually stable on my machine cool yeah yeah it was it was one of those things anyway
[2474.80 --> 2482.32]  i fix it has what do they have they have right they have guides for diy electronics repair whether
[2482.32 --> 2488.80]  it's your whether it's your imac your tablet your phone whatever the case may be i have saved enough
[2488.80 --> 2495.04]  using i fix it guides to tear down machines and often repair them in ways that cost me very little
[2495.04 --> 2500.72]  money that i could easily have afforded to buy myself an army of i fix it repair kits not that i
[2500.72 --> 2507.20]  need one because all i fix it repair kits are backed by their lifetime warranty in fact my i fix it repair
[2507.20 --> 2512.48]  kit my original one that i bought over holy crap i've had it for three and a half years now lmg's almost
[2512.48 --> 2517.44]  four years old it's weird right yeah i know like actually really close yeah yeah like soon anyway my
[2517.44 --> 2523.28]  original one still works so well that i fix it had to yell at me and tell me to stop using it on
[2523.28 --> 2529.12]  camera because it's old and outdated and they're supposed to be i'm supposed to be doing sponsor
[2529.12 --> 2536.00]  spots for the new one but my old one still works exactly perfectly in every way we're getting closer
[2536.00 --> 2538.16]  to me working with you for six years
[2538.16 --> 2547.04]  then whoa then nothing i guess but we're getting we're getting close to that i was thinking like
[2547.04 --> 2551.12]  all my previous jobs combined but that's not actually quite true yet we're getting we'll get
[2551.12 --> 2556.32]  there we're getting there yeah um also in the pro tech tool kit which is the one that we actually have
[2556.32 --> 2561.68]  these awesome embroidered ones that they sent us which is why i know that someone put it back in the
[2561.68 --> 2569.44]  workshop when they took it from me yeah um so they've got like esd safe tweezers hey you still
[2569.44 --> 2573.12]  have all your covers for your tweezers and stuff you're doing good yeah they've got little pokers
[2573.12 --> 2577.60]  and prodders and prying tools they've got their other prying tools the suction cup the esd strap that
[2578.56 --> 2582.96]  doesn't look like it's ever been taken out along with the other the little spatula thing and the
[2582.96 --> 2587.68]  other like pry tool that's it's great the tweezers and stuff have been used but yeah that that has never
[2587.68 --> 2593.28]  been taken most of what you need to work on pretty much any small device is included in the kit
[2593.28 --> 2597.92]  and i can't say enough about how much time and money i've saved with i fix it kits and i have to
[2597.92 --> 2602.24]  say the first kit or at least the last kit that we had i don't know if that's technically the first
[2602.24 --> 2609.12]  kit was great but this one is a lot easier to keep things tidy within the kit and that's actually
[2609.12 --> 2615.12]  really cool so you can get the all new pro tech tool kit it's not really that new anymore but my
[2615.12 --> 2620.88]  notes are old and get going on your next fix hacker rebuild by just heading over to ifixit.com
[2621.36 --> 2625.52]  linus to save five bucks on a purchase of ten dollars or more and they have a lot more than
[2625.52 --> 2631.04]  just the tool kits they have like replacement gaskets for like imacs like they have replacement parts
[2631.68 --> 2635.04]  the things that you'll break when you take something apart they a lot of the time have
[2635.04 --> 2638.08]  stuff that'll allow you to actually put things back together which is really helpful
[2638.08 --> 2645.92]  all right moving on to our next topic we actually have not covered a lot of topics today
[2646.88 --> 2655.28]  um we've done like three okay so the original article here is from the daily beast.com polymer lucky
[2655.28 --> 2666.24]  the facebook near billionaire secretly funding trump's meme machine yeah so basically he is providing
[2666.24 --> 2674.08]  financial backing and it's apparently he has confirmed this to the daily beast he is providing
[2674.08 --> 2681.84]  financial backing for a group that circulates dirty memes about hillary clinton even going as far as to
[2681.84 --> 2690.16]  buy physical billboard space for a meme about how hillary is too big to jail and that's the uh that's
[2690.16 --> 2700.88]  the one that's in the uh the image right here yeah uh nimble america now whether or not this is even
[2700.88 --> 2707.84]  legal is is actually kind of a gray area right now because under the u.s tax code something something
[2707.84 --> 2716.08]  nimble america can't spend more than 50 percent of its resources backing uh a candidate unless it also does
[2716.08 --> 2722.00]  all these other things or something something etc but the fact that it's happening at all it basically
[2722.00 --> 2728.16]  he's so he's putting money behind an unofficial donald trump group dedicated to shit posting and
[2728.16 --> 2735.20]  circulating internet memes maligning hillary clinton i mean what is this i i kind of think that people
[2735.20 --> 2742.96]  should probably put a little bit more uh investment into these two particular lines that are actually
[2742.96 --> 2748.64]  quotes from him the first one is i've got plenty of money the second one is money is not my issue
[2748.64 --> 2754.08]  i thought it sounded like a really jolly time if you look back and do a little bit more deeper
[2754.08 --> 2760.48]  searching instead of just taking this article and a couple other ones at the surface go far enough back
[2760.48 --> 2768.64]  there's pro bernie tweets on his twitter retweets tweets from himself all that kind of stuff he was pro bernie
[2768.64 --> 2775.28]  in the background in the back when bernie was still running i guess and i kind of think what's
[2775.28 --> 2781.76]  happening now is he's just like well my horse is out of the race time to just be a supreme troll
[2782.64 --> 2788.00]  and he's literally just doing what he says in that quote where it says money is not my issue i thought it
[2788.00 --> 2796.48]  sounded like a really jolly good time i think bernie is out so he's just like let's burn some fires and have
[2796.48 --> 2801.20]  some fun and troll and have a jolly good time i'm not trying to defend his actions i just think that's
[2801.20 --> 2806.64]  helpful right now i just think that people are taking it as something that it isn't and you can
[2806.64 --> 2813.12]  still be mad and pitchforky over what i just said i don't care i just think that that's probably more
[2813.12 --> 2819.36]  where it's coming from and it also seems like more like a thing that he would do is just troll around
[2819.36 --> 2825.76]  i generally don't like trolling i'm not trying to defend this yeah i'm just saying i think this is
[2825.76 --> 2833.84]  the more accurate way to approach what's happening this is a really immature move um and i mean it
[2833.84 --> 2839.84]  shouldn't surprise me that much the guy is really young and i think his estimated net worth based on
[2839.84 --> 2844.24]  some of the articles i was reading when i was looking into this something like 700 million dollars
[2844.24 --> 2849.12]  uh i don't think anyone knows exactly how much he got paid from the facebook bio but it was a lot
[2850.24 --> 2858.88]  and i i think like is he just is he just like cranky and bored like is that what this comes down to
[2860.72 --> 2870.88]  uh yeah i kind of think so like i don't actually know obviously because we only have the quotes that
[2870.88 --> 2879.12]  are out there but i think he's looking at this selection as honestly what it is which is a complete
[2879.12 --> 2886.32]  mess in like every possible way you can look at it um rock and hard place yeah and just going like
[2887.12 --> 2892.88]  well let's just screw around because obviously everyone else is screwing around so i'm gonna do it
[2893.52 --> 2897.68]  the way i do it which is by tossing some money around and having fun with the internet
[2897.68 --> 2907.92]  and you can you can all judge that however you please oh man yeah the uh the twitch chat is just
[2907.92 --> 2913.04]  like this this is great why don't you guys report on mark cuban who's going after trump every day
[2914.64 --> 2924.16]  no one goes after trump trump creates the trumpness like you don't have to go after trump
[2924.16 --> 2935.76]  yeah all right like but then like yeah i don't know yeah i mean yeah i think i think uh i i can't
[2935.76 --> 2939.76]  read this person's twitch username because it's like bright green but the point is to vote for who
[2939.76 --> 2944.48]  actually respects your constitutional rights and is actually willing to defend them and actually knows
[2944.48 --> 2950.96]  his head from his butt and i agree with that and unfortunately the system is broken enough that
[2950.96 --> 2957.92]  that isn't happening i don't think we need to get way too into politics directly um you guys can all
[2957.92 --> 2963.12]  go watch uh yeah what was it called well there's a there's gonna be a debate coming or that no our
[2963.12 --> 2968.48]  thing which thing when we both the computers oh yeah you can go watch um oh what did we call that
[2968.48 --> 2974.32]  what did we call that show i don't like the name uh tech showdown yeah tech showdown episode two i think
[2974.32 --> 2980.08]  it's a good name i don't think it's a good youtube name yeah yeah i think it's a good like tv show name yeah
[2980.08 --> 2987.44]  um yeah so all right so good luck everyone i am pretty sure he's just trolling and at this point
[2988.40 --> 2991.20]  with how the election is going i literally don't think it's going to make a difference
[2992.16 --> 2998.56]  um the too big to jail thing is an actually very arguable point yep i did that so like and i haven't
[2998.56 --> 3003.28]  seen any of the other memes they've made but that one's really not that bad i don't know i think people
[3003.28 --> 3007.92]  do like to glom on to some of the anti-trump things that i've said and go like oh he's a hillary
[3007.92 --> 3014.24]  supporter i'm i'm not i'm canadian so fortunately i actually don't have to make a decision on election
[3014.24 --> 3019.44]  day which is great which is great for me i can just kind of point out everything that's completely
[3019.44 --> 3027.52]  ridiculous about both of them um but but trump is more hilarious like i have never paid closer attention
[3027.52 --> 3037.44]  to any political anything than i have to the 2016 u.s election it has been better than every book i've
[3037.44 --> 3043.12]  read every tv show i've ever followed and every movie i have ever watched in terms of entertainment
[3043.12 --> 3050.24]  value that's really sad it's hilarious i don't find it funny oh at all really i find it really
[3050.24 --> 3055.60]  depressing i to be completely fair i find this a little bit more funny than how the election's going
[3055.60 --> 3060.64]  because this feels like a troll it feels like a joke i think it's legitimately a joke i think he's
[3060.64 --> 3066.08]  legitimately screwing around i think trump is a living breathing joke oh yeah but like that's a living
[3066.08 --> 3071.12]  breathing joke that might go in office and like control things and yeah both of them are that i
[3071.12 --> 3077.68]  don't agree with either of them okay like so fair enough when like this is probably literally a joke
[3077.68 --> 3083.44]  i could be behind this more i guess so i don't know but this literal joke could contribute to putting
[3083.44 --> 3089.36]  trump in office i don't think it's is it funny anymore at that point luke i don't think it's gonna change
[3089.36 --> 3093.52]  is it funny anymore i don't think it's gonna change anything i think as of right now no one's really
[3093.52 --> 3099.52]  flip-flopping sides if you've chosen one of them i'm pretty sure you're there the polls are all over
[3099.52 --> 3104.88]  the place i don't know man yeah but the polls are all like like yes yes and no i mean every time
[3104.88 --> 3112.00]  every time trump attacks like a widow okay not to like a side too hard it's still first past the post
[3112.00 --> 3116.64]  is it not i don't remember so the election just doesn't matter in my opinion because it's just
[3116.64 --> 3122.00]  all bullshit anyways so just everything's bullshit you have two crazy people running like trump you're
[3122.00 --> 3126.64]  sounding like trump it's a rigged system man it's a rigged system systems rigged all right
[3128.08 --> 3135.44]  san francisco is getting tiny self-driving robots that could put delivery people out of a job this is
[3135.44 --> 3144.16]  actually very interesting because while the whole drone delivery thing is very headline grabby this is
[3144.88 --> 3152.80]  way more practical safer more economical that is to say if they don't get stolen that often which i'm
[3152.80 --> 3162.08]  sure will be a thing at some point or another um and way more likely a future than than what i see
[3162.08 --> 3170.88]  what i see happening i mean this is the way to handle the last mile that addresses the problems
[3170.88 --> 3176.72]  with current couriers like the cost associated with people uh driving vehicles around and delivering
[3176.72 --> 3182.96]  things the cost associated with um fuel involved in driving those vehicles around if these things could
[3182.96 --> 3189.20]  be cheap and fast enough and easily replaceable enough to have enormous fleets of them then it could
[3189.20 --> 3196.80]  actually become truly more economical to order things online than to go and pick them up in bulk
[3196.80 --> 3203.52]  at stores and this should be terrifying to brick and mortar retail absolutely terrifying more so
[3203.52 --> 3208.40]  than to delivery people who will still have to be involved in larger shipments and customs brokerage
[3208.40 --> 3214.96]  and that kind of stuff for quite a while moving into the future um so the startup uh what's what's the
[3214.96 --> 3220.16]  startup called starship technologies yeah it's an autonomous robot i don't think linus is saying that
[3220.16 --> 3224.88]  he wants to put people out of jobs i think no i'm saying that it will happen so we better be ready for
[3224.88 --> 3232.96]  it yes um and whether that and you know what you can you can you can cry um what is it socialist all you
[3232.96 --> 3240.80]  want but at the end of the day like if we create enough technology that people legitimately have nothing to do
[3240.80 --> 3247.68]  and have all of their of their base needs taken care of we're gonna have to figure out something
[3247.68 --> 3253.60]  there's like there's arguments on each side there's one that's going like in in no recordable time in history ever
[3253.60 --> 3260.00]  has a new technology wake actually made it so that there's less jobs it's just changed what the jobs are but then
[3260.00 --> 3266.80]  there's a counter argument which i agree with more which is this is just job removal and mass yeah this isn't actually like
[3266.80 --> 3273.04]  like just making your lives easier it's just directly replacing people i mean let's look at the ice box
[3273.04 --> 3282.00]  or uh the so ice i love ice harvesting it's like it's hilariously out of date and it wasn't that long ago
[3284.40 --> 3294.00]  like yeah crazy like like trains of ice okay like crossing america to deliver ice from the ice
[3294.00 --> 3300.56]  harvesting caves to people's ice boxes all right like like there was an entire infrastructure built
[3300.56 --> 3308.56]  around this industry and then boom refrigeration yeah but refrigeration requires jobs maybe more
[3308.56 --> 3313.20]  skilled jobs which isn't necessarily a bad thing because educational standards have by and large been
[3313.20 --> 3319.68]  improving since the early 1900s but overall the jobs were replaced things that people did were replaced by
[3319.68 --> 3326.16]  things that other people did so net net maybe you even gained jobs like you do it many times
[3326.16 --> 3330.88]  as this whole thing progresses um and more convenient for the people that are using the thing that's
[3330.88 --> 3335.36]  right however looking at some of the automated things that are happening now replacing the person who
[3335.36 --> 3341.04]  flips burgers with a machine that flips burgers replacing the mechanic who changes the oil in your car by
[3341.04 --> 3347.60]  hand because every car is different with a machine that just swaps the battery on your model s in what was it
[3347.60 --> 3351.76]  like 10 minutes it's less than it takes to fill up your tank of gas something along those lines
[3351.76 --> 3357.28]  exactly what it was not a lot of time now we're talking about people who actually just don't have
[3357.28 --> 3364.32]  any work to do um and it's very different end to end replacement not only are you just replacing the
[3364.32 --> 3369.04]  guy that flips the burger you're replacing every other line of cooking that's in there you're also
[3369.04 --> 3374.08]  replacing selling things to people the food delivery you're also replacing the food delivery you're also
[3374.08 --> 3380.40]  replacing the food harvesting to some degree yep you're also replacing like everything yeah yeah
[3381.60 --> 3387.92]  so basically this robotic courier um picks up goods from a centrally located logistics hubs hub and
[3387.92 --> 3392.32]  delivers them to homes within a two mile radius through a partnership with mercedes-benz the company
[3392.32 --> 3397.92]  is experimenting with loading a bunch of robots into a modified sprinter van that drops off the delivery
[3397.92 --> 3404.96]  bots along its route now when self-driving vehicles loaded up with it's gonna be like phantom menace
[3405.52 --> 3411.36]  like you're gonna have like the the like the the drop ship that like floats along the street and then
[3411.36 --> 3415.68]  it's gonna be like unroll the thing and it's gonna be like they're gonna like come out and they're
[3415.68 --> 3418.32]  gonna deliver all the things to the houses they're gonna come back and then it's gonna go to the next
[3418.32 --> 3423.68]  location it's gonna be an amazing future we just need to figure out the role that people are gonna play in
[3423.68 --> 3430.16]  it that's complicated yeah so like this is cool and i love it but like my job is still protected for a
[3430.16 --> 3436.32]  while although it won't be that long yep before you can build an ai they're already working on it
[3436.32 --> 3442.00]  evaluates a product tests every single that was made by another ai possible yeah that was made by another
[3442.00 --> 3448.64]  ai that tests every single possible aspect of it and delivers a like how good is it could it be better
[3448.64 --> 3457.36]  and yeah and then the places making these products will just have those in their studios where they're
[3457.36 --> 3461.52]  making the products and then the robots that are making the products will know exactly how good it
[3461.52 --> 3464.72]  is and then they'll price it exactly where it's supposed to be so you won't really need the reviewer
[3464.72 --> 3468.48]  bots because you'll just know that everything is price scaled exactly yeah so spend more and it'll be
[3468.48 --> 3476.16]  better yeah period yeah for everything always all right so we're slightly over time i would like to
[3476.16 --> 3480.64]  cover there isn't much that oh we already talked about total biscuits tumor thing right yep sort of
[3480.64 --> 3484.56]  okay cool i mean it's there's really nothing else in the notes that we didn't say already it's very
[3484.56 --> 3494.80]  good the tumor size is down by 50 that's very good um amd's am4 socket has been pictured okay it has
[3494.80 --> 3501.20]  like 1200 pins or something like that i don't know 24 pci e lanes which is really interesting so amd
[3501.20 --> 3509.12]  is apparently targeting squarely between intel's mainstream platform and their enthusiast platform
[3509.12 --> 3517.20]  just based on that that's all i'm going based on but that is actually very interesting to me so dual
[3517.20 --> 3524.64]  channel ddr4 which is frankly all we need on the desktop anyway 24 pci e lanes meaning that amd seems to
[3524.64 --> 3533.36]  think they're going to be that better than the mainstream but like enthusiast grade but cheaper
[3533.36 --> 3542.88]  than enthusiast option which is a is a void that intel has stubbornly refused to fill over the last four
[3542.88 --> 3550.24]  to five years really interesting because intel could easily build a more complex quad core or a six core
[3550.24 --> 3556.80]  in terms of the die size cost associated with that mainstream platform they just choose not to they
[3556.80 --> 3563.60]  choose to put better on board graphics if amd comes in and turns the screws a little bit on intel we could
[3563.60 --> 3570.72]  be in for a fascinating couple of years here apparently it's not that many pins it's not the 1331 yeah 1331
[3570.72 --> 3578.40]  that's more than 12 whatever that i said i thought you said something else oh okay i don't know twitch chat's
[3578.40 --> 3583.84]  trying to correct you i don't know what's going on get rack twitch chat spotify and tinder link up to
[3583.84 --> 3591.60]  form a match made in heaven if your heaven is swiping if your heaven is swiping people and listening to
[3591.60 --> 3599.12]  music for free yeah i mean i think it's actually not a terrible idea to have people with similar music
[3599.12 --> 3606.32]  tastes sure um yeah like i mean so you can swipe someone and then just be like justin bieber nope
[3606.32 --> 3612.64]  yeah exactly or justin bieber yeah his new stuff's okay i don't know i i meant like that's why i said
[3612.64 --> 3618.56]  that's why i added the yup afterwards i don't listen to new stuff i'm old now i listen to the things on
[3618.56 --> 3625.28]  my server now i'm that guy oh yeah or monster cat's 24-hour fm mix because i could stream that
[3626.48 --> 3631.20]  because monster cat's cool and stuff so i either listen to monster cat because they don't mute my
[3631.20 --> 3638.56]  vods or i listen to stuff on my server and that's it excellent yeah or the radio because i don't pay
[3638.56 --> 3642.96]  attention to it and it's in the background i still listen to the radio too yeah and i actually listen
[3642.96 --> 3648.32]  to it like over the airwaves like i don't have a fancy app like even though the only station i listen
[3648.32 --> 3653.92]  to like you could just listen to it in an app anyway but i would never listen to it in the app
[3653.92 --> 3659.20]  because if i'm somewhere that doesn't have a normal like am fm radio that i'm just going to listen to
[3659.20 --> 3665.28]  music that i have off my server so anyway you can link your account and the music taste begins to become
[3665.28 --> 3672.88]  part of your dating profile um and you can also pick a song to be your anthem that describes who you
[3672.88 --> 3677.20]  are so that's supposed to be a way to understand a person through a single piece of music which is
[3677.20 --> 3685.92]  unfortunate um don't laugh brandon you know that you know a single person just just song yeah a single
[3685.92 --> 3692.16]  piece of music would have been enough for for for brandon it's like uh do they have a song about taking
[3692.16 --> 3695.20]  pictures polaroid picture
[3695.20 --> 3704.56]  okay uh oh our buddies over at lime technology have released the latest iteration of unraid so
[3704.56 --> 3712.00]  all the features that i've been demonstrating since two gamers one cpu are finally in a stable release
[3713.84 --> 3721.04]  hooray hooray so they get vlans multiple ethernet support no device limit for trials so you can actually
[3721.04 --> 3726.48]  try out unraid in a way that's not frustrating which is oh my god kind of cool it was doing
[3726.48 --> 3733.76]  nickelback look at this photograph yeah that could be brandon brandon could have a bunch of music under
[3733.76 --> 3738.72]  his profile uh they've added dual parity support so if you're worried about two drives failing at a
[3738.72 --> 3743.44]  time and losing data then you no longer have to worry about that they have a gooey boot mode now so you
[3743.44 --> 3749.76]  don't have to access it on first boot over the network which i personally find helpful i find that because
[3749.76 --> 3755.36]  like i don't care you can tell me all day that this should work over the network just type this
[3755.36 --> 3763.12]  into your browser no no no just let me plug in a vga port and a ps2 keyboard and then i will believe
[3763.12 --> 3770.72]  that it will work yeah so that's pretty happy for me um major updates to virtual machines so i will be
[3770.72 --> 3777.84]  trying to do uh like a multi vr gamers one cpu over the next little bit so stay tuned they'll be looking
[3777.84 --> 3789.36]  at some of the new 6.2 features there you and the point i think it's 0.3 of steam users well why are
[3789.36 --> 3792.00]  you a hater i'm not okay then
[3795.76 --> 3804.96]  oh opera browser unveils a free unlimited vpn service this this raises my eyebrow because nothing in life is
[3804.96 --> 3812.96]  free and especially user data is very very valuable possibly valuable enough that you could operate a
[3812.96 --> 3818.24]  vpn service for free with what that would be worth and i'm not saying they're doing that and i'm not
[3818.24 --> 3823.28]  saying that opera was relatively recently bought out by some like i think random chinese company that
[3823.28 --> 3827.28]  people don't know a ton about if i remember the article correctly that we covered on the wan show a few
[3827.28 --> 3834.48]  months ago that's probably not noted in here so it's a free no log easy to use vpn service available
[3834.48 --> 3841.44]  directly in the opera desktop browser um christian calandra senior vice president of opera browser
[3841.44 --> 3845.44]  for computers says if people knew how the internet truly works i believe they would all use a vpn
[3846.08 --> 3850.72]  i don't believe any of them would use a free vpn if they knew how the internet works yeah um by
[3850.72 --> 3855.68]  making our browser vpn free and easy to use we hope to make it an essential tool just as the locking key
[3855.68 --> 3862.00]  is to your house i also wouldn't put opera in charge of the locking key to my house someone uh someone in
[3862.00 --> 3866.32]  twitch chat said that they tried the opera vpn and it's terrible so maybe that's how they're getting
[3866.32 --> 3873.20]  around the costs it's just it's just really bad oh okay well hey maybe i'm maybe my tinfoil hat is
[3873.20 --> 3881.04]  too strong today and i should have just gone with my like general skepticism hat i use opera as my home
[3881.04 --> 3885.20]  browser i've talked about this a little bit before because i use all browsers that might that's my thing
[3885.20 --> 3889.28]  so every like different computer i use a different browser you'll see i'm using firefox now
[3889.28 --> 3895.76]  i'm maintaining that by using firefox on my laptop um i use chrome on my work desktop
[3895.76 --> 3902.56]  use opera at my home desktop firefox on my laptop and then ie on test benches or edge i guess on test
[3902.56 --> 3906.80]  benches but half the time i get too frustrated with it and switch to chrome anyways because it just
[3906.80 --> 3915.12]  doesn't work um god stupid i still hate how the bar is in the middle yeah until you type in it it's like
[3915.12 --> 3925.20]  muscle memory okay i know where to find the browser bar don't move it period it's fine where it is or
[3925.20 --> 3931.36]  was yes and don't move it put it somewhere and don't move it if you decide the best place for the
[3931.36 --> 3937.20]  for the url bar is in the middle of the screen then stick with it and if it's not the best don't put it
[3937.20 --> 3940.96]  there ever yeah because it's not because it's like that you would navigate away it would be right in the
[3940.96 --> 3947.60]  middle of your that's really stupid yeah and it's no less stupid doing it some of the time yes um
[3948.72 --> 3955.84]  samsung announces the 960 pro and 960 evo ssds boistering boistering boasting blistering fast
[3955.84 --> 3961.68]  sequential read speeds of three and a half gigabytes per second and writes of 2.1 gigabytes per second
[3961.68 --> 3968.80]  and something like three plus times the random iops of sata ssds we are finally at the point now here
[3969.44 --> 3976.96]  where nvme ssds are coming into their own and are going to be legitimately much faster feeling day
[3976.96 --> 3984.80]  to day than a sata ssd how long do you think until we start seeing it um as a rather common thing for
[3984.80 --> 3993.68]  easier for a user to have no cable based drives oh oh well in laptops already a thing i mean razer blade
[3993.68 --> 3999.36]  doesn't have a spot for a drive it has one nvme slot okay i see what you're saying that's it so in
[3999.36 --> 4008.96]  laptops now yeah in i mean like desktops okay so we're already at the point where that cable nvme
[4008.96 --> 4013.44]  interface is like dead in the water there's a handful of drives that support it but it's like
[4014.56 --> 4019.60]  unless intel and amd both get on board and start building it into the south bridge like that's
[4019.60 --> 4025.52]  not happening um so those drive i mean there's only like one drive that i'm aware of on the
[4025.52 --> 4033.04]  consumer side and that's the intel 750 series um so either plugging into a pci express slot or plugging
[4033.04 --> 4039.92]  into an m.2 slot on your board wow i think it's going to make way more sense for performance enthusiasts
[4039.92 --> 4045.36]  and by extension everyone a few years down the road probably five there three years three years
[4045.36 --> 4050.72]  that's my prediction three years the only thing that makes me worry a little bit there's already
[4050.72 --> 4057.20]  a two terabyte model yeah but how much does that cost but give it three years so i'm saying three
[4057.20 --> 4063.36]  years okay yeah i wish we uh what could be kind of cool is if we had like a custom calendar just for
[4063.36 --> 4068.00]  like claims that we have on the way i know right so we can like follow them up properly someone out
[4068.00 --> 4073.84]  there is probably doing it that would be pretty cool actually it's like things that linus and luke predict
[4073.84 --> 4080.32]  on the wan show like followed up how would that count i think that pretty much wraps it up americans
[4080.32 --> 4087.20]  apparently pay 40 percent more for tv than they did five years ago which only proves that americans uh
[4087.20 --> 4094.40]  should stop paying for tv or that the only people left paying for tv are the like ones who just aren't
[4094.40 --> 4100.80]  aware of the internet like what was it 30 million americans cut the cord last quarter like some obscene
[4100.80 --> 4106.96]  number they don't watch sports sports can also be streamed online and it's cheaper to sign up for
[4106.96 --> 4112.24]  like nhl center ice than it is to have a cable subscription that's not necessarily true if you
[4112.24 --> 4116.80]  watch multiple different sports well if you watch multiple different sports i mean okay if you watch
[4116.80 --> 4121.52]  baseball and anything i don't know how you have to anything else do you know they play
[4121.52 --> 4127.68]  baseball did you know they did you only play 160 games a year i did and that's without playoffs what
[4127.68 --> 4137.28]  the hell 160 games a year you could literally spend in your home arena i don't think they call it an
[4137.28 --> 4142.96]  arena but i don't care ballpark there in your home ballpark i think they just say park calculator
[4142.96 --> 4153.36]  benway park calculator okay so 80 over 365 you could spend 22 of your evenings in a ballpark if
[4153.36 --> 4159.44]  you had seasons passes and you actually you could eat a hot dog one out of every five nights
[4160.88 --> 4165.92]  and that is it for the land show thank you for tuning in today we will see you again next week same
[4165.92 --> 4171.12]  bat time same bat channel uh i will you will oh yeah i probably won't be here i will probably have a
[4171.12 --> 4175.68]  new baby and i'll be like not in this country and hopefully that stream works at all we should
[4175.68 --> 4187.60]  just have like nick and colton host the wan show no i hate that guy no no no colton's chiming from
[4187.60 --> 4198.64]  the background charge is over this is not happening now my understanding hot dogs like
[4198.64 --> 4207.20]  like legit increase your risk of dying but it's like there was a study and basically like there's
[4207.20 --> 4213.68]  a threshold like they're actually not very harmful until you eat a lot of them like over an extended
[4213.68 --> 4221.60]  period of time then you like die sweet because it's like sodium and like highly processed stuff yeah
[4221.60 --> 4228.40]  no nose and like well pig nose is probably good for you yeah everyone knows that
[4230.40 --> 4233.28]  oh god yeah we're still screaming i'll shut down
